0,Ramming a $15 Minimum Wage Bill Through the Senate Using Reconciliation Would Be a Norm-Busting Mistake,4.33,43.33,https://reason.com/2021/02/03/ramming-a-15-minimum-wage-bill-through-the-senate-using-reconciliation-would-be-a-norm-busting-mistake/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,25,"Fittingly forsomeone whospent more than three decades as a member of the U. S. Senate, President Joe Biden holds theso-called world's greatest deliberative body in high regard. Biden calls the Senate his ""second home"" in his 2007 memoirand, as that metaphorsuggests, it is often obvious that the relationship is about more than just a physical place. Bidensees the Senate—with its arcane rules and combative but dignified atmosphere—as the embodiment of what governmentshould aspire to be. When Bidenstresses that Americans must learn to disagree without disrespect ing one another, as he did in his inaugural address, he's drawing on the ethos of the Senate. ""Unity requires you to eliminate the vitriol, make anything you disagree with about the other person's personality. We have to get rid of that,"" Bidensaid last month. But when it comes to passing one of the new president's first major policy initiatives, Senate Democrats are already looking for a divisiveshortcut. As part of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, Biden is asking lawmakers to also pass a massive increase in the federal minimum wage—hiking it to $15 per hour from the current rate of $7.25 per hour. It's both ironic and telling that doingso might require effectively abolishing an arcane rule that's intended to encourage debate. No, I'm not talking about the filibuster, though Democrats may eventually decide to do away with the rule that requires asuper majority of 60 votes to cut off debate and bring a bill to a final vote. Instead, they're turning to an even less well-understood Senate rule: reconciliation. Reconciliation was invented in 1974 when Congress rewrote its rules for passing budgets. It's intended to allow Congress to quickly make changes tola ws governing federal revenue andspending by limiting how long legislators can debate bills filed under the reconciliation process. In effect, it creates a way for asimple majority in the Senate to pass budget billsin certain circumstances without allowing the minority to hold up the process with the threat of a filibuster. According to the Congressional Research Service, a think tank housed within Congress, the reconciliation process has been used25 times. You may recall that Republicans recently used reconciliation to get the 2017 tax cuts through the Senateand that they tried (unsuccessfully) to use the process to repeal Obamacare. Here's where it gets extra confusing. To use thisspecial filibuster-bypassing loophole, a bill must pass a multi-step test known as the ""Byrd rule""—named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D–W. Va.), who invented the test as a way to limit the use of the reconciliation process. Whether a bill comports with the Byrd rule is up to exactly one person: Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, who is more or less an unelected mage responsible for interpreting the Senate's rulesand adjudicating disputes over them. In order to clear the Byrd rule, and thus be eligible to be passed with asimple majority as opposed to 60 votes, a piece of legislation contain elements that are ruled extraneous to the federal budget. There are other aspects of the Byrd rule banning legislation that inflates the long-term federal budget deficit (which is why the 2017 tax bill contained a bunch of gimmicky promises about future tax hikes) and prohibiting any changes to Social Security, but the budget mandate is the key issue at play with the proposed minimum wage increase. Most aspects of Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill would be eligible for passage under reconciliation. Boosting emergencyspending or offering tax breaks to offset individuals' and businesses' losses due to the pandemic—regardless of whether they are fiscallysmart policies or not—pretty clearly meet the Byrd rule's threshold.""BryBut does hiking the federal minimum wage? That's debatable. Progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) are making a roundabout argument that increasing the federal minimum wage can be done via reconciliation because it would havesome knock-on effect on federal tax revenue. In other words, forcing businesses to pay hourly workers higher wages will translate into higher taxable income for those workers and thus more tax revenue for the government. Additionally, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, argues that a $15 federal minimum wage would decrease dependence on federal welfare programs b yat least $13 billion annually. But approaching the Byrd rule in that manner makes it effectively null and void. Instrokes that broad, any major change to federal policy could have knock-on effects that impact tax revenues or future expenditures. For example, if Biden were to propose that the federal government mandate every household adopt a dog within the nextsix months, one could argue that the corresponding up tick in demand for dog food and chew toys would force businesses that produce those products to hire more workers, and that hiring (and paying) more workers would impact federal tax revenue down the road. You might even be able to argue that the resulting increase in happiness would reduce future government health care expenditures (or perhaps that it would increase themsince dog ownersstatistically live longer). All those things might be true, but that wouldn't make the Puppy Mandate of 2021 directly linked to the federal budget in a way that the reconciliation rules were crafted to allow. But wait, there's one more wrinkle—because this is the Senate and nothing is everstraightforward. If MacDonough rules that the minimum wage hike can't be passed via reconciliation, the Senate canstill overrule her decision. Doingso would require asuper majority of 60 votes,so that's probably not feasible—unless Vice President Kamala Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, unilaterally acts to overrule MacDonough. That's never been done before, but notes that it is technically allowed under Senate rules. For now, this whole debate could besomewhat moot. Sen. Joe Manchin (D–W. Va.)says he won'tsupport a $15 national minimum wage. Instead, he'sproposing to hike the minimum wage to $11 per hour. And if Democrats can't get unifiedsupport from all 50 of their members on this issue, then the reconciliation route is useless. All of this procedural analysis ignores thestrong policy-based arguments against raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour across the entire country. Including that wage hike in what is ostensibly a COVID-19 relief bill, as's Billy Binionpointed out last week, is particularly bizarresince many businesses that would besubject to the higher labor costs are juststruggling to keep their doors open right now. The Biden administration is touting a Congressional Budget Office reportshowing that a $15 national minimum wage would lift about 1 million workers out of poverty, but it is conveniently downplaying the fact that thesamestudysays the change would eliminate 1.3 million jobs. It's certainly possible that Democrats will ignore that and try to ram the higher minimum wage—either $15 per hour or $11 per hour—through Congress using reconciliation. ""We're not going to take 'no' for an answer"" is how Sandersdescribed the effort to CNBClast week. Ifso, we could be treated to thespectacle of the Biden administration'ssecond-in-command unilaterally overturning the Senate's rules in an unprecedented way that virtually guarantees the Byrd rule no longerserves as asignificant impediment to passing any legislation via the reconciliation process—and doing itso a controversial policy change can be implemented with thesupport, maybe, of just 50senators plus the vice president. After preaching about the value of unity and promising to end an era of political norm-breaking, that would be a heck of a way for Biden to demonstrate that he doesn't much care about any of those things.",1,1,Reason
1,Impeachment and the Democrats: How will they screw this up? Let me count the ways,-22.5,30.5,https://www.salon.com/2019/12/06/impeachment-and-the-democrats-how-will-they-screw-this-up-let-me-count-the-ways/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-12-06,25,"Thursday’s announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Democrats are ready to vote articles of impeachment against President Trump — presumably on the narrowest possible terms, after a constrained and foreshortened process — is hardlysurprising. It is, however, disheartening. Why they would even consider moving to a floor vote on impeachment without doing whatever is necessary to compel testimony from John Bolton, who is now a private citizen and has always been a blast-hardened neo con Republican, and who is clearly eager to roast Donald Trump’s gizzard on a fork and then eat it, is profoundly baffling. Or maybe,sadly, it isn’t. So far, thisspectacle confirms mysense that the Democratic Party isstrikingly ill-prepared for the historical role it ought to play in this moment ofsmall-d democratic crisis. Driven as usual by fear, excessive caution and a morbid fascination with identifying the middle of the middle of the political middle (and then veeringslightly to its right), the Democrats are entirely likely toscrew things up, whether morally or tactically or politically or all at once. (See alsoDavid Masciotra’s excellent Salon essay last weekend.)Actually, the Democrats have alreadyscrewed it up. Let’s be clear that the Republican defense of Trump is completely incoherent, because there is no defense for his actions. But on a generic or abstract level, Republicans have floated halfway-valid concerns about the process of the impeachment inquiry and the motivations behind it — which Democrats have done little to dispel. Republicans claim that Democrats have been itching for a pretext to impeach Trumpsince before he took office, and finally landed on one. That’s at least partly true, although the Angry White People Party is too consumed by paranoid delusions to understand the ways in which it is both true and untrue, and how those reflect the deep and wideschism within the Democrats over how to respond to the Trump era. Sure, Rashida Tlaib got elected in Detroit vowing to “impeach the motherf***er,” but a whole lot of other Democrats got elected while not talking about that at all, and explicitly or otherwise espousing the “back to normal” politics that have made Joe Biden the 2020 frontrunner all year long. In case you haven’t been keepingscore, there is no “normal” to go back to, history never flows backward and that whole approach is a dangerous delusion, as we will all learn the hard waysoon enough. Biden would be a disastrous nominee and a terrible president, which is not tosay there’s an obvious alternative who inspires immense confidence. But for our present purposes all that is aside issue, even if it’s also a yawning abyss beneath our feet. Speaking of delusions, Republicans’ elaborate conspiracy theories about how Ukraine and the Democrats (with the help of the CIA and FBI) faked the Russian hack of the DNC in order to launch an investigation of the Trump campaign add up tosomething like a masterful work of literary parody, out of an unwritten Don DeLillo or Colson Whitehead novel. It’s complete nonsense, of course, but it’s admirably creative nonsense, and you mightsay it gestures atsomething real, which is that the “Ukrainescandal” refers to deeply buried issues in U. S. foreign policy that are virtually never discussed in public. Why exactly is the United Statesso deeply entangled in a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, two bordering nations on the otherside of the world — not to mention two nations with a long history of deeply fraught relations, none of which has anything to do with us? I don’t claim that there are no explanations, only that no one outside the national-security priesthood of people like John Bolton and Fiona Hill (or Nancy Pelosi, for that matter) really understands them. Furthermore, no one in either political party is particularly eager to debatesuch questions on TV,so that while the facts of the Trump-Biden-Giuliani-Zelensky morass have more or less come out, the deeper questions beneath them are never asked, let alone answered. Before you get worked up to tweet at me about how I’mspewing Putin’s talking points or whatever, let me assure you that I don’t exactly know what those would be, but I’m prettysure they’re crap also. Putin isn't my problem! What I’m noticing here is Democrats’ eagerness to turn the impeachment inquiry into a display of flag-waving patriotism and unanimous agreement on what is essentially a neo con foreign-policy consensus. Nothing about the Trump presidency is more deeply perverse (to me, anyway) than the Democratic Party’s abrupt rebranding as woke BFF of the national-securitystate. I hope people whose villages get droned in Afghanistan or Somalia are comforted by the increasing intersection ality of our WorldCop force. (People reference ""Idiocracy"" a lot to explain the Trump era, but I would also refer you to Paul Verhoeven's ""Starship Troopers,"" in which the fascist dictator of Earth is a black woman.)How many “liberals” of theso-called resistance even noticed the U. S.-endorsed coup in Venezuela (which failed) or the one in Bolivia (which was a glorioussuccess), let alone raised any questions about them? Former CIA head John Brennan has become a resistance hero, which if you do even minimal research on the guy's career is darkly hilarious. We have all, apparently, agreed to pretend that Abu Ghraib and the blacksites are ancient, irrelevant historical footnotes or events in an alternate timeline. Here’s a detour; it’ssomewhat relevant, I believe. There was a lot I didn’t understand about theSenate Watergate hearings of 1973, which I watched as a child, pretty much gavel-to-gavel, perched on my dad’s moldering horsehairsofa and riveted to his black-and-white portable TV, which was normallyshoved in the corner of hisstudy like an unwelcome guest. (We had been one of those irritating no-TV families until he bought it to watch occasional baseball games and irritate my mother.)I didn’t know much about the Democratic Party at that time, for one thing. I certainly didn’t grasp that it was going through a period of remarkable internal turmoil — arguably moresevere than anything inflicted by Bernie Sanders or “the Squad” — even as it tried to drive a Republican president from office. I definitely didn’t know that Sen. Sam Ervin of North Carolina, the bourbon-voiced Southern gentleman who chaired that committee, was an old-linesegregationist, then making an uneasy peace with the civil rights era. Ervin was a creature of that era and not this one,so the comparison may be nonsensical, but almost any white Southern man of his background and inclinations would be a Republican in 2019. To be fair, my dad probably didn’t grasp those nuances either. He was an Irish immigrant who viewed the Democratic Party with an almost mystical veneration. He certainlysupportedsome Democrats and opposed others, more on emotional grounds than ideological ones: Heartbroken by the death of Bobby Kennedy and thesocialschism of the Vietnam War, he had refused to vote for Hubert Humphrey in 1968. But an elected Democrat, for him, wassomething like a Roman Catholic priest: Whatever his (or, hypothetically,her) personal failings, he carried the authority of an institution thatspoke for the people. Republicans of that time absolutely argued that the Democrats’ Watergate investigation was an illegitimate attempt to undo an election defeat, one of many echoes from that era heard in this one. (And boy howdy, had the Democratssuffered an election defeat in 1972, when George McGovern carried only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, losing to Richard Nixon by almost 18 million votes.) In our household, that argument rang hollow, but then our partisan loyalty was not in question. It never occurred to me to doubt that Democrats held the moral and political high ground when it came to Watergate (and pretty much everything else), or that they had gravely andsoberly embarked on asearch for the truth, taking no pleasure in unmasking a low-grade criminalscheme masterminded by the increasingly paranoid occupant of the Oval Office. In the end, of course, as we are repeatedly reminded, Republicans bowed before the irresistible logic of mounting evidence andshifting public opinion. There were definitelysome hard-line true believers who wanted to back Nixon to the end, and who felt their party had capitulated to the treasonous lib tar ds and the New York Times. I think there’s no doubt that the bitter, half-remembered residue of thatsentiment fuels Republican intransigence today, when the president they must defend makes Nixon look like Lorenzo de’ Medici. In any event, a few GOP members even voted for articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee, and a bunch more waffled over it. Finally a delegation of Republicansenators, led by conservative godfather Barry Goldwater, went to the White House to tell Nixon the jig was up: If he didn’t resign, he’d be convicted by the Senate and forced from office,something that, to date, has never happened in American history and probably never will. Of course there aresomestrikingsimilarities between that era and this one, but I think the differences — both grand andsubtle — are more important. Any number of pundits have lamented that the Republican Party of 2019 isn’t remotely interested in facts or evidence, and will continue to defend Donald Trump up to and beyond a video of the presidentstuffing bundles of Vladimir Putin’s rubles down his pants. Fair enough: The “moderate,”statesmanlike Republicans of Nixon’s era, who thoughtfully crunched the ice cubes in their bourbon-and-soda at the country club, and who valued continuity andstability over raw power or loyalty to a noxious figurehead, are gone forever. But the Democrats, as mentioned above, have been changed by history too. What we’reseeing now, to asignificant extent, is a resurgence of the factional conflict that had been almost completelysuppressed across 40-odd years of compromise, triangulation, recalibration and defeat. The actual left — meaning both thesocialist Old Left and the 1960s-radical New Left — had either been purged or reduced to an irrelevant rump faction. Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio ran for president a couple of times, made noserious impact and was treated with benign condescension — which was what nearly everyone in the party expected would happen with Bernie Sanders in 2016. With the growth of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the election of the Squad — andscores or hundreds of allied office-holders at thestate and local levels — a broader range of left and center-left positions is represented among Democratic elected officials than at any timesince at least the “New Democrat” era of Bill Clinton. Much has been made of how diverse the House Democratic caucus is in terms of color, ethnicity and gender (which issurely important), but the renewed ideological diversity is every bit asstriking. This has clearly raised the temperature of internal dialogue within the party (and not just in the tedious Twitter wars between “stan” armies), which issometimes visible — as in the publicspat between Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez earlier this year — andsometimes not. Itseems apparent that dynamic is playing out behind thescenes in the impeachment debate. If Tlaib became famous for promisingshe was going to Washington to impeach Trump, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, who took the House Judiciary Committee gavel last January — a CPC member who is ideologically closer to Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez than to Pelosi — was makingsimilar promises, much more discreetly. Many House progressives, Nadler likely included, wanted to pursue an impeachment of Trump on the widest possible terms: for the corrupt and unethical conduct exhaustively detailed in the Mueller report, for his many violations of the emoluments clause and blatantself-dealing, for his usurpation of congressional appropriations to build hisstupid wall, for his campaign-finance violations, for his relentless efforts to undermine or defy the constitutionalseparation of powers. I mean, we could keep going. That approach would have had the obvious merit ofseeking full transparency and exposing a widespread pattern of criminality that would be impossible to explain away, and would not have relied exclusively on anti-Russia hysteria or the contentious “collusion” questionssurrounding the 2016 campaign. It also, without doubt, would have taken a long time, quite possibly as long as the 16-month investigation of Sam Ervin’s Watergate committee. For Pelosi, whose primary goal was and is preserving the House majority in 2020, that looked like an unacceptable risk. No one disputes thatshe's good at political arithmetic, but this kind ofshort-term calculus was precisely not what the moment required. AsI’ve argued previously, a youngerspeaker who wasn’tso concerned with her legacy might have been more willing to roll the dice andstand up for a clearset of values. Pelosi is eager to protect hersupposedly vulnerable House freshmen, and a lot of them are centrists who want no part of the CPC, the Squad or the left. But it’s a mistake to perceive her tactics as purely pragmatic orstrategic: Pelosi can call herself a “San Francisco progressive” allshe likes, but ideologicallyshe isstrongly aligned with the liberal and/or neo liberal tradition thatstretches from Hillary Clinton back to Hubert Humphrey, which favors incrementalsocial-justice reforms at home (in fairness,sometimes quitesignificant reforms) coupled with unquestionedsupport for American exceptionalism, empire-building and military intervention abroad. For Pelosi, theswing-district moderates, and especially the former military or intelligence professionalssometimes dubbed the “CIA Democrats”— a group that includes Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill, all of New Jersey — are much closer to the futureshe imagines for the Democratic Party than are AOC and Rashida Tlaib. Maybe it doesn't matter why Pelosi made the dealshe made. But when the Ukrainescandal almost literally fell out of thesky in latesummer,sheseized upon it as the catalyst for a compromise within her caucus. The lefties were eager to impeach Trump, and Pelosi got the hawkish moderate freshmen to go along as long as it was a “clean,” narrowly focused process that was all wrapped up by Christmas and provided an opportunity to grandstand about nationalsecurity, roll out a bunch of witnesses with impressive credentials of patrioticservice and expose Republicans as a bunch of weaselly hypocrites who have taken a vow to love Sluglord Trump more than they love America. (Which is of course accurate.)But the problem, as I’ve tried to explore in roundabout fashion, is that there’s nothing clean about the Ukrainescandal or this impeachment, which is why we all feel profoundly dissatisfied with it. Essentially, Pelosi and the Democratic leadership are patting the left-progressive base on the head andsending it to bed with a hastily constructed impeachment-theaterskit, full of high-flown rhetoric and largely drained of meaning. I’m not excusing the gangster ish conduct of Trump and his minions in any way. But here’s what they did: They tried to pull a murky criminalscheme in a legendarily corrupt country where the U. S. has played a mysterioussponsorship role eversince the Ukrainian revolution and/or coup of 2014 (reports vary!) overthrew pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. We aren’t, of course,supposed to think too hard about that background, or about exactly why the U. S. is involved in this particular proxy war on the otherside of the world. Why not, I guess? There are loads of others!By the way, can westop pretending that whatever Hunter Biden was doing in Ukraine was fine andsqueaky-clean and totally above board? That’s all a parenthesis, of course, and there’s no evidence that his dad was directly involved, even if the optics were kind of un-good. But Hunter was getting paid a one-percentersalary to do absolutely nothing because he was the vice president’sson. If you are truly committed to constructing that as “well, he didn’t do anything wrong,” you're either ashameless party hack or you've been thoroughly gaslit by end-stage capitalism. Probably both. Trump’s Ukraine extortion campaign didn’t work. The Democrats’ quick and dirty impeachment won’t work either. Those things are metaphors, but what the hell for? Maybe for all the deeper, darker crimes we don’t know about, and all the hard questions weshould ask ourselves but don’t. The impeachment of Donald Trump has juststarted, and now it’s almost over. Soon it will be just as if it never happened at all.",1,1,Salon
2,Is Inflation About to Run Wild?,-2.0,47.67,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/newsletter/20210526-Inflation-About-Run-Wild,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"New Watchdog Report Identifies Billions in Potential Government SavingsA new report from the Government Accountability Office identifies dozens of ways the federal government cansave billions of dollars while improving the effectiveness of itsspending – a task that will become all that much more pressing as the coronavirus crisis comes to an end and lawmakers begin to look for ways to reduce the budget deficit.“The federal government has made an unprecedented response tosignificant public health and economic challenges as the country continues to battle Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),” the GAOsays in its report. “Once the pandemic recedes and the economysubstantially recovers, Congress and the administrationshould develop andswiftly implement an approach to place the government on asustainable long-term fiscal path.”As in past reports, the GAO digs into the nitty-gritty of the federal budget, looking for areas of overlap and duplication that could be eliminated, as well as areas of fragmentation, where agencies could improve efficiency by pulling disparate efforts into one. The results can be remarkably detailed, and a good reminder of just how diverse federalspending can be. In the current report, areas under review include everything from the management of “cell-cultured meat” production by the Food and Drug Administration and U. S. Department of Agriculture to potentialsavings in Medicaid claims processing and information retrievalsystems. The GAOsays its reports have been quite effective, with its recommendations producing $429 billion in benefits from 2011 to 2019. Speaking to a Senate committee earlier this month, Gene L. Dodaro, the government’s comptroller general, highlighted thesavings that are available. “This year, we have over 112 new recommendations for consideration by the Congress and the executive branch,” Dodarosaid. “The first has to do with leveraging the government’s enormous potential purchasing power by pulling together to purchase common items, medicalsupplies, officesupplies, etcetera. There’s beensome progress in this area, but there can be much, much more that result insignificantsavings.”Read the full GAO report here and an analysis by The Washington Post’s Joe Davidson here. Point/Counterpoint: The Inflation RiskFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers expressed his growing concerns about inflation in aWashington Post op-edthis week, arguing that the Biden administration’s Covid-19 rescue package is too large given current economic conditions, which could result in higher than expected and potentially dangerous price increases throughout the economy in the coming months. Summers’ comments are providing ammunition for those who oppose Biden’s ambitiousspending plans, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) quoting him more than once this week as he presses his case that Biden is proposing too muchspending. Here’s the nub of Summers’ argument, along with acritical reply from economist Dean Baker, who runs the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. Summers raises a red flag:“The covid-19 chapter in U. S. economic history is coming to a close more rapidly than almost anyone expected, including me. Within weeks, gross domestic product will reach a new peak, and it is likely to exceed its pre-covid trend line before year’s end, as the economy enjoys its fastest year of growth in decades. Job openings are at record levels, and unemployment may well fall below 4 percent in the next 12 months. Wages and productivity growth are increasing. ...“Now, the primary risk to the U. S. economy is overheating — and inflation. Evensix months ago, it was reasonable to regardslow growth, high unemployment and deflationary pressures as the predominant risk to the economy. Today, while continuing relief efforts are essential, the focus of our macroeconomic policy needs to change.”Bakersays it’s toosoon to tell:“Starting with the inflation that we haveseen to date, it is important to remember that this follows the very low rate of inflation wesaw in the pandemic. Much of this is just catch up. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped 0.8 percent in April. Thatsoundsscary, but it is up just 3.1 percentsince February of 2020, which translates into a 2.6 percent annual rate of growth. The core index, which excludes food and energy prices, is up just 2.5 percentsince before the pandemicstarted, translating into a 2.2 percent annual rate of increase.“We cansee asimilarstory in many of thesectors that were hard hit by the pandemic. Hotel prices jumped 8.8 percent in April, but arestill almost 6.0 percent below the level of February, 2020. Air fares rose 10.2 percent in April, but are 17.7 percent below their pre-pandemic level.“Everyone knew these big price jumps were coming,so they reallyshould not be cause for panic.”Top Dems Call for a 'Public Option' Health Care PlanTwo key Democratic lawmakers overseeing health policy on Wednesday announced they will look to craft legislation to create a government-run “public option” for health coverage, pushing ahead on one of President Joe Biden’s campaign promises even as the president has focused on other parts of his agenda. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sen Patty Murray (D-WA), chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, put out a call for ideas on how to design the legislation.“We believe boldsteps are necessary in order to achieve universal coverage and lower health care costs,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter addressed “to all interested parties.” “As we work to craft legislation, our priority is to establish a federally administered public option that provides quality, affordable health coverage throughout the United States.”Their request asks for answers to eight broad questions,such as whoshould be eligible to enroll in a government-run plan, how benefits and paymentsshould bestructured and what kind of premium assistanceshould be offered. Biden campaigned on creating a Medicare-like public option, pitching the idea as part of a plan to build on Obamacare — an alternative to calls from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and others to eliminate private coverage entirely and transition to asingle-payer “Medicare for All”system. But, despitesome pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden has left a public option out of his major policy proposals thus far and reportedly will not include i tin his forthcoming budget request even as he reiterates hissupport for the idea. The president has instead pushed plans to make Obamacare plans more affordable and accessible. Insurers and hospitals oppose a public option and critics have argued that it would ultimately lead to “a one-size-fits-all” government health insurancesystem. The American Hospital Associationsaid in astatementWednesday that it opposes a public option because “inadequate reimbursement rates” would raise the risk of hospital closures. Why it matters:The letter from Pallone and Murray “is the first indication that Democrats arestillserious about the idea” of a public option,saysVox’s Dylan Scott. And Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation calls it “aserious effort by Senator Murray and Representative Pallone to take the public option from bumpersticker to workable legislation.”A public option enjoys broadsupport in polls, with more than two-thirds of adults in an October 2020 Kaiser Family Foundationtracking poll— including 40% of Republicans —saying theystrongly favor orsomewhat favor the idea. But, as the questions in the Pallone-Murray lettersuggest, a host of issuesstill need to be addressed, with reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals, and drug companies atop that list. “A public option has the potential to reduce prices and make health care more affordable, but the further it goes in that direction, the bigger the blowback will be from the health care industry,” Levitt told theAssociated Press. And while the industry pushes back, Republicans may also be likely to renew their attacks labeling the Democratic proposals as “socialist.”The bottom line:While it’s notable that two leading Democrats are working on a public option, there’s nosign any legislation has a chance of passing in the near term. Defense Budget Battle LoomsLawmakers on the left and the right are already taking positions on the upcoming defense budget, Joe Gould and Leo Shane III ofDefense News report, pushing in opposite directions on thesingle largest component of discretionaryspending in the federal budget. Progressive Democrats are looking for ways to trimspending, while conservative Republicans are raising alarms about potential threats as they push for increases in the Pentagon’s budget. One point of contention involves the U. S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which could be completed assoon as July. The move is expected to producesavings of as much as $50 billion, and House Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Mark Pocan (D-WI) wants to use that “peace dividend” for domestic purposes, including health insurance and housing. At thesame time, Republicans in the Senate are calling for morespending on the military. “China’s long-term military investments are paying dividends thatshould alarm us. But Democrats want to pump the brakes on our own?” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)said last week. “Fewer resources for our own men and women in uniform? Less defense innovation? Whatsense does that make?”Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, also invoked China as he called for morespending. “We know the bestsignal we cansend China is astrong military, but astrong military is not free,” hesaid last week. “I’ll continue working with my colleagues to ensure we are giving our military the resources they need to deter Chinese military aggression and defend our country.”Ultimately, moderate Democrats including Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA) and Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) will have to find a way tosatisfy both camps on a defense bill that could be upwards of 4,000 pages long. “The bill never passes if it’s not bipartisan, we all understand our responsibility,” Smith told Defense News. “And that’s [Republicans’] incentive: we want to pass a bill. And there are thousands of things in that bill ― or hundreds ― that are important, on a wholeseries of policy levels, on a bipartisan basis.”Biden Wants to Spend More on Cyber Warfare: ReportPresident Biden’s budget request is expected to include an increase in funding for a military unit that focuses on cy ber warfare,Politico reports. Located within U. S. Cyber Command, a joint military group that draws on multiple branches of the armed forces, the Cyber Mission Force is charged with coordinating “cyberspace operations in defense of U. S. national interests.” Biden will reportedly call for an increase in thesize of the force by about 10%, up from its current level of 6,200, at a cost of at least $100 million. If Congress agrees, it would be the first expansion of the forcesince 2012, when it was first created. The expansion has been under discussion forsome time but has likely received new impetus in the wake of recent cy ber attacks on the U. S., including one ransom ware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that resulted in fuelshortages insome parts of the country, Politico’s Martin Matishak and Lara Seligmansay. In congressional testimony earlier this year, Gen. Paul Nakasone, chief of Cyber Command,said it was time for the force to expand. “Recent demand across DoD has demonstrated that the original 133 teams in the CMF are not enough,” he wrote, referring to the currentstructure of the force. “Thestrategic environment has changedsince the original CMF was designated in 2012. Added forces will ensure USCYBERCOM can fulfill its responsibility as both asupported and asupporting command.”Send your feedback toyrosenberg@thefiscaltimes.com.

Data and experience, however, haveshown that criminal izingsex work does little to alleviate those harms,"" Savitsaid in thestatement. ""Indeed the criminalization ofsex work actually increases the risk ofsex work adjacent harm. Accordingly, the Washtenaw County Prosecutor’s Office will henceforth decline to bring charges related to consensualsex work perse. The Prosecutor’s Office, however, will continue to chargesex work-adjacent crime — including human trafficking, violence, and offenses involving children — that directly harm county residents.""Efforts to reach Savit for further comment Thursday were notsuccessful.

""Cash bail is asystem under which a defendant who has been accused of a crime is required to post money in order tosecure release from jail pending trial.

8,Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema: the centrists blocking Biden’s agenda,-7.67,44.33,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/03/joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema-democrats-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-03,25,"Donald Trump’s favorite insult for political opponents inside his own party is “Rino” – Republican in name only. Bysuch logic, SenatorsJoe Manchinof West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the epitome of Dinos, two elected Democrats whose dogged resistance to Joe Biden’ssocial agenda threatens to upend his entire presidency. Theirstandoff with the party’s progressive wing over the price tag of Biden’s ambitious reform package has become almost more of a hazard to his legacy than anything the Republicans, currently in a narrow minority in both chambers of Congress, can throw at it. That resistance – and threat – to Biden’s domestic ambitions is nowset to continue for the month of October as Housespeaker,Nancy Pelosi,set a new deadline of 31 October for the House to pass a major infrastructurespending bill after a week of negotiations left massivesocial and environmental policy overhaul plan in a limbo. Progressive Democrats in the House have refused to vote on the infrastructure bills leverage in negotiations over aseparate bill that contains hugespending on issues increased access to childcare, help with college tuition and major action on climate change. Analysts, meanwhile, question if thesenators’ resistance to programs that Biden ran and won an election on is rooted more in a need for politicalself-preservation. Manchin is a moderate Democrat in astate where the governor’s mansion and both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans; Sinema isseen as vulnerable in Arizona whereshe captured the Senateseat that previously belonged to the Republican Jeff Flake before he decided not to run again. Both facesticky re-election challenges in 2024. Meanwhile, New York magazine’s Intelligencer coined a phrase for the oversized power resting in the hands of the two otherwise unremarkable Democratic holdouts:Manchema. “They are, in effect, holding the president’s priorities hostage to their personal whims,” the article’s author, Sarah Jones, wrote.“That’s not a newstory in politics. But theirstubbornness in the face of contemporary challenges reveals the bottomless emptiness of their brand of centrist politics.”Manchin, 74, has been in the US Senatesince 2010, and became a controversial figure during the Trump administration by allying himself onseveral key votes and even toying with an unprecedented cross-party endorsement of the former president for reelection. If Senate Democrats were frustrated with him then, it morph ed into impatience when the partyseized control of the chamber in 2020 but became reliant on him for every voteso vice-president Kamala Harris could break a 50-50 tie. Manchin has always insisted he is not against Biden’s desire to enactsocial reforms, but balks at the $3.5tn cost and has indicated he would be comfortable with $1.5tn. Last month he called for Democrats to “hit the pause button” for more negotiation.“I couldsay that I’m against this and that and everything. I’m for an awful lot of the things. I’m for also putting guardrails on,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press. Sinema made headlines in 2018 not only for becoming Arizona’s first Democratsenator for more than two decades but also as the first openly bisexual member of the chamber. Yet despite being from thesame party as Arizona’s othersenator Mark Kelly, who ousted the incumbent Republican Martha McSally in last year’sspecial election to make it the first time in 70 years thestate was represented in the Senate by two Democrats,she has taken a much more conservativestance onseveral issues. In March,she angered colleagues by giving athumbs-down gesture on the Senate floor asshe voted against raising the federal minimum wage. Unlike Manchin, Sinema, who rarely gives interviews, has not indicated publicly what parts of the $3.5tn billshe objected to. As an indicator of her importance to the process,she has become a regular visitor to the White House, getting more face time with the president andsenior Democratic leadership than any othersenator with only three years’standing. In Arizona, Democrats have become weary of Sinema. Thestate’s Democratic party passed a motion pledging a no-confidence vote ifshe votes against the bill, whilesome members are plotting a primary challenge. In Washington, the Hawaiisenator Mazie Hirono encapsulated congressional Democrats’ frustration. “I and others are waiting for Kyrsten and Joe to tell us what is it that they like or don’t like, and then we can get it done,”shesaid. Manchin, meanwhile, drew the personal ire of the Senate’s most prominent progressive, the former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, in a recent interview on ABC’s This Week.“Is it appropriate for one person to destroy two pieces of legislation?” he asked. “It would really be a terrible, terribleshame for the American people if both bills went down.”",2,1,The Guardian

Representatives for the governorstressed that while funding designatedspecifically for Pulsesurvivors did not make the final budget,survivors canstill take advantage of funding providedseparately.""Gov. DeSantis vetoed $1.5 billion in total, which included dozens of line items.

DeSantisstood on hallowed ground,steps from where I escaped the building in 2016, and promised me that he would alwayssupport those of us impacted by the Pulse nightclubshooting,"" Wolfsaid. ""Today, almost two years later to date, he vetoed mental healthservices for us. I will never forget.""It's DeSantis'ssecondslight on the LGBTQ+ communitysince Pride Monthstarted just Tuesday. On the first day of the month, DeSantissigned into law a bill prohibiting of trans girls and women from competing inschool and collegiatesports consistent with their gender identity. In the budget, the mental health funding wasn't the only vetoed item connected to helping LGBTQ+ Floridians. He also killed $750,000 in funding for the Zebra Coalition, which providesservicesspecifically to LGBTQ+ children and young adults, ages 13 to 24. The Florida legislature, where Republicans control both the Senate and House, had budgeted $750,000 for youth housing programs, most of it to be made available through grants and aid efforts.""This money would have helped LGBTQ+ youth facing homelessness, bullying, isolation from their families, physical andsexual abuse, and drug abuse,""said Heather Wilkie, Zebra Coalition executive director. ""We were planning to expand our housing capacity from 11 to 35 beds for homeless youth and were honored for thesupport ofso many of ourstate legislators. Now we're unsure where the money will come from.""Similarly, leaders of the LGBT+ Center in Orlando expressed disappointment at the loss of funds.""I am disappointed once again that Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed funding for the LGBTQ community,specifically those affected by the Pulse tragedy,"" Wallacesaid. ""Some of Central Florida's most vulnerable citizens rely on the Center Orlando to provide lifesavingservices,such as case management, navigation, and critical mental health counseling.

Her decision to turn away Jordan and Banksstemmed from their words and actionsstretching over months,some as far back as before the Jan. 6 riot itself and others as recently as this week, asenior Democratic aide familiar with the deliberations told CNBC. Most recently, the aidesaid, Democrats were outraged by astatement from Banks on Monday night, in which he vowed to reveal the facts about the Capitol invasion, including the ""responses from Capitol leadership and the Biden administration.""In fact, the Biden administration began two weeks after the riot on Jan. 6, when hundreds of former PresidentDonald Trump'ssupportersstormed the Capitol in an effort tostop Congress from confirming now-PresidentJoe Biden's electoral victory. When Congress returned to their chambers hours after the rioters were dispersed, both Jordan and Banks voted to object to the results of the election. Pelosi on Thursdaysaid that Banks'statement was akin to claiming that the Biden administration was responsible for the attempted insurrection. ""There was no Biden administration on Jan. 6""she noted. The Democratic aide also told CNBC there was ""deep concern"" about Jordan, astaunch Trump ally who is the top-ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. The aidespecifically cited his participation in a December meeting at the White House in which Trump and a group of Republican lawmakers reportedlystrategi zed about ways to overturn Biden's election win. Pelosi's blunt rejections,announced Wednesday,stoked a fiery response from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who hadselected Jordan and Banks for the committee along with three other Republicans. McCarthy, R-Calif., accused Pelosi of an ""egregious abuse of power"" and vowed to pull all five of his picks from the panel unlessshe reversed course. Thespeaker is ""more interested in playing politics thanseeking the truth,"" McCarthysaid. But Pelosi on Thursday appeared highly unlikely to change her mind. Banks' and Jordan's words and actions make it ""impossible for them to exercise judgment"" on the investigative committee,shesaid. Spokespeople for Jordan and Banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Pelosi's remarks Thursday. The Democratic aide told CNBC that caucus members also objected to Banks' appointment in light of a recent trip to the U. S.-Mexico border organized by the Republican Study Committee, on which heserves as chairman. The group of GOP lawmakers on the trip were reportedly joined by Anthony Aguero, an alleged Capitol rioter, who wasseen chatting with multiple committee members. Banks ""neverspoke to the individual in question, the Republican Study Committee was unaware of his identity and whereabouts on January 6, and he did not travel with our group to the border,"" aspokesperson for the committee told CNN in astatement. After their nominations were rejected, Jordan and Banks releasedstatements accusing theselect committee of being a partisan endeavor.

(Loeffler’s bill hasnot been taken up for a vote.)“Title IX is being weakened bysomestates who are misinterpreting [it], creating uncertainty, undue hardship and lost opportunities for female athletes,” Rep. Gabbardsaid in astatement. “Our legislation protects Title IX’s original intent which was based on the general biological distinction between men and women athletes based onsex.”“Title IX was designed to give women and girls an equal chance tosucceed, including insports,”said Rep. Mullin in astatement of his own. “Allowing biological males to compete in women’ssports diminishes that equality and takes away from the original intent of Title IX.”If implemented into law, the bill would deny federal funding toschools that “permit a person whose biologicalsex at birth is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.” It was immediately decried by LGBTQ+ advocates.“It’sshameful that one of Rep. Gabbard’s last acts in Congress is to attack trans youth,”said Chase Strangio, deputy director for Trans Justice with the ACLU LGBT & HIV Project in astatement provided to TIME. “While this bill will not advance, it has alreadysent a dangerous message to trans youth and isspreading thesame lies that are fueling attacks on trans youth instate legislatures.”“Rep. Gabbard’s harmful and unnecessary bill is not about protecting girls and women’ssports. There’s no evidence in the 18states with policies that allow transgender athletes to participate on teams consistent with their gender identity that inclusion negatively impacts athletic programs,” added GLAAD’s Alex Schmider, Associate Director Transgender Representation. “This is more about opportunistic people like Rep. Gabbard who, under false pretense, claim to be protecting girl’ssports to justify discrimination.”Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, concurred, describing Gabbard’s “play for attention” as “embarrassing” in astatement. “Sheshould be ashamed of trying to burnish her right-wing credentials with attacks on transgenderstudent athletes,” Keisling’sstatement continued. “It’s just a hurtful attempt to get on TV without any regard to the damagesuch rhetoric does to transgender kids.”Gabbard did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment on the backlash. Gabbard’s record on LGBTQ+ rights received increasedscrutiny during her 2020 presidential campaign. In the early 2000s,she worked for her father, Hawaiistate Senator Mike Gabbard, and his anti-gay organization The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, that campaigned against the legalization ofsame-sex marriage in Hawaii. She hassince publicly reversed her position andsigned an amicus brief challenging the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013.“In my past Isaid and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones,” Gabbardsaid in av ideo apology postedshortly aftershe announced her presidential candidacy. “My views have changedsignificantlysince then and my record in Congress over the lastsix years reflects what is in my heart: astrong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ rights.”Yet advocates argue the introduction of “Protect Women’s Sports Act” goes directly against those commitments. A number ofstate legislatures have tried to pass legislation over the past year aimed at prohibiting trans women and girls from participating in femalesports teams. Idaho Gov. Brad Littlesigned the“Fairness in Women’s Sports Act”into law in March, whichsaid no femalesports teams could be open to “students of the malesex” and a “dispute” could be resolved by presenting asigned physician’sstatement on thestudent’ssex based on their “internal and external reproductive anatomy.” A federal judgestruck down the law in March,writingthat thestate had not provided a “legitimate interest” the Actserved “other than an invalid interest of excluding transgender women and girls from women’ssports entirely, regardless of their physiological characteristics.”“This is a victory for all women and girls in Idaho,” the ACLUtweetedat the time. “Trans people belong insports.”Write toMadeleine Carlisleatmadeleine.carlisle@time.com",1,1,Time Magazine
13,Sleepwalking Into World War III,-9.5,39.17,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-19/sleepwalking-world-war-iii,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-19,17,"Civilian political authority over military leadership is a bedrock principle of the U. S. Constitution,so fundamental to the Americansystem of government that it has rarely been questioned. Butsince President Donald Trump entered office in 2017, his administration hassystematically eroded the norms that havesupported this constitutional principle for generations. The Trump administration has consistently elevated military voices over those of experienced civilservants in the development of foreign policy, and funding cuts to nondefense federal agencies, along with the resignations of many career civilservants, have left government offices woefully understaffed. As a result, policy planning and the guidance ofstrategic defense initiatives—which have historically been the purview ofsenior civilservants—have increasingly been ceded to those in uniform. Civilian authority over the armed forces is weaker now than at any point in living memory, and the Trump administration is increasingly engaging with the world in ways that mirror military preferences. The resulting foreign policy is eerily reminiscent of the “cult of the offensive”: an overconfidence in offensive military advantage that can lead to rapid escalation;such overconfidence is widely believed to have contributed to the outbreak of World War I. Unless civilian control over the military can be reestablished, the United States riskssleepwalking its way into another world war. By giving civilian leaders authority over the military, the framers of the U. S. Constitution were not merely assigning elected officials a few oversight duties. They were creating asystem in which defense planning would be guided by civilian needs and the military would carry out its activities in theservice of civilian goals. Since Trump’s civilian “America first” plan was announced early in the 2016 presidential campaign, many members of the U. S. foreign policy community have viewed the agenda as an inherent danger to nationalsecurity. Even more worrisome for those concerned about the continuingstability of civil-military relations, many of the cabinet nominees whom the new administration found acceptable were military officers,such as General James Mattis, General John Kelly, and Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster. From the beginning of the Trump era, the nationalsecurity establishment made a Faustian bargain: in an effort to constrain the new president, it looked the other way as extraordinary numbers of active duty and retired military officers were appointed to positions usually reserved for civilian experts. As the “adults in the room,” these career military officials hoped to protect American alliances and constrain Trump’s worst impulses. Although few of these officers questioned the principle of civilian control, their narrow interpretation of civilian oversight meant that broader norms of civilian guidance became a kind of collateral damage in thestruggle to contain the chaos. This political bargain gave the more experienced military officers at the highest levels of the administration,some of whom hadserved together for decades, a natural advantage over their civilian counterparts. Theirsharedservice gave them a common language and, most important, an outlook that allowed them to easilysideline civilian outsiders like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, and later, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. When leaders are appointed at the top levels of government, theystaff their organizations with people whom they trust to execute their plans. Most civilian leaders have diverse professional networks to draw upon, but career military officers tend to know few qualified people outside of veterans’ organizations. As a result, many of the lower-levelstaff posts within the Trump administration have also been filled with retired military officers. In the office of thesecretary of defense, uniformed officers continue to execute civilian responsibilities. And althoughsluggish hiring and retention difficulties have played a role, Mattis’s admitted preference for military officers over career civilservants during his tenure exacerbated the imbalance. When the department did hire civilians, it often placed them in “acting” roles with little power and even less influence. The result is that uniformed officers of the military have developed and enacted policy for thesecretary of defense—such that it does not necessarily reflect the priorities of civilians in the administration. Indeed, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commissionnotedin November 2018 that “there is an imbalance in civil-military relations on critical issues ofstrategy development and implementation. Civilian voices appear relatively muted on issues at the center of U. S. defense and nationalsecurity policy.”Military officers and civilianssee foreign affairs differently. Military officers tend to assume worst-case intentions and capabilities in order to be best prepared for potential threats. When called upon to act, they often prefersolutions that enable them to take the offensive. When civilians lose their voice in the process, military preferencesshapesecuritystrategy in ways that reflect these institutional biases toward action and confrontation. And as civilian control of the U. S. armed forces has declined, these preferences have increasingly dominated American foreign policy. Thus, the current imbalance in civil-military relations has led to a foreign policy that has heightened international tensions, closed off avenues for productive diplomacy, and increased the risk of inadvertent escalation or even accidental war. Mattis and McMaster principally authored the 2017 United States National Security Strategy and the 2018National Defense Strategy. These documents definedsecurity almost exclusively in terms of great-power competition andstate actors, emphasizing the threat from China in particular. Thestrategies largely approach the world as a zero-sum competition in which maintaining an advantage matters far more than cooperating for mutual benefit. Current U. S.strategy therefore filters the meaning of the changing geopolitical environment almost exclusively through military perceptions of threat. In the event of a war with China or Russia, the military would face a daunting task in the South China Sea or in the Balticstates. Its instinct, then, is to develop thestrategies and build the capabilities that are most likely to winsuch a confrontation at the lowest cost possible. But thesestrategies can have dangerous consequences. With their emphasis on “globally integrated operations,”senior military commanders are developing retaliatory militarystrategies that emphasizespeed and could lead to quick escalation, effectively limiting the options of political bodies like theNorth Atlantic Councilin the event of a conflict. And by officially labeling China a “revisionist”state, Mattis and McMaster assume its hostility, forcing decision-makers tostart from the premise that diplomatic approaches are unproductive and preventive action is the only way to contain China’s ambitions. Military leaders need civilian input in order to mitigate these risks. Military operational preferences privilege offensive action—civilian officials are best positioned to articulate the pitfalls ofsuch an approach, lest the concern about a great-power war become aself-fulfilling prophecy. The military naturallyseeks to modernize and acquire new weaponssystems. In response to this desire, the Trump administration withdrew from at least three major arms control agreements, and it looks unlikely to renew the New START agreement with Russia. But without arms control, the United States not only riskssetting off arms races but also loses transparency into its adversaries’systems, capabilities, and intent. Decision-makers must then adopt the military’s worst-case assumptions in the event of a crisis, and they are likely to miscalculate. The military’s priority ofseeking ever more lethal and modern weapons increases the risks of nuclear use and proliferation. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review advocated for the development and deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons in response to Russia’s alleged intention to use limited nuclearstrikes in regional conflicts. But by acquiring nuclear weaponsspecifically designed to be used in a much widerset of circumstances than the current inventory, the military has effectively lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons—a fact that did not escape congressional leaders during their hearings on the document. Furthermore, as the United States modernizes its arsenal,states with vulnerablestockpiles may feel the need to invest even more in their nuclear programs, increasing their inventories and investing insecond-strike capabilities. The United States has proposed to develop new weaponssystems capable of dismantling nascent nuclear programs. Somestates may therefore conclude that nuclear latency—the ability to develop a nuclear weapons program from existing peaceful infrastructure—is no longer asufficient deterrent and choose to proliferate instead. The United States is rushing even now to introduce hypersonic weapons into its arsenal. Such missilesserve essentially no defensive purpose—and their development is leading to a new nuclear arms race. The White House and Congress must reestablishstrong civilian control over military priorities if the United States is to find diplomaticsolutions that can help avoid another great-power war. The next administration, whether under Joe Biden or Donald Trump,should refrain from equating military experience with foreign policy expertise. Rather, at the top levels of government, the presidentshould reset the balance of power toward civilians, appointing officials whose backgrounds yield a variety of perspectives on foreign policymaking. The next president’s priority upon taking officeshould be to fill positions within the civilian office of thesecretary of defense that have been largely taken over by uniformed military officers. These new civiliansshould be hired in a manner that maximizes the office’s demographic, experiential, and intellectual diversity. Current hiring laws privilege hiring veterans, which limits the diversity of those in policymaking positions. Civilian hiring initiatives must therefore act as a counterweight to that tendency. Finally, the administrationshould comprehensively review engagements, programs, and posture to ensure that U. S. actions are in fact aligned withstrategic intent. Such a reviewshould encompass all military programs. Many mayseem like good ideas in isolation, but in combination they may prove to be provocative or threatening. Civilian leadersshould make political determinations about the risks and rewards of militaryspending on offensive weapons programs; in particular, theyshould review the constraints on the new Space Force that may be necessary in order to both encourageservice pride and avoid an arms race and conflict. In 1962, the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles just 90 miles from the United States’shore. President John F. Kennedy and the rest of the civilian leadership did not allow the military to continue with itsstandard operating procedures and preferred courses of action. Instead, they carefully orchestrated aseries ofsignals that narrowly avoided the outbreak of open hostilities between the world’s two nuclearsuperpowers. Current U. S. policy resembles the firm civilian control and oversight of the Kennedy administration far less than it does the posture of the great powers before the outbreak of World War I. Civilian leadership was either co-opted or pushed aside as French, German, and Russian militaries pursuedstrategies that prioritize offensive operations and doctrines—leading to the now famous cult of the offensive. Privileging the military’s perceptions of threat over those of diplomats makes war all but inevitable. Withoutstrong civilian oversight, the United States risks this catastrophic fate.",1,2,Foreign Affairs
14,Column: The Atlantic says ‘the California Dream is dying.’ So what else is new?,-2.67,37.67,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-07-23/the-atlantic-california-dream-is-dying,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Magazine writers’ chestnuts don’t get any more dependable than the “death of the California dream” trope. It’s got everything a writer looking for buzz could ask for: the irresistible opportunity tosimultaneously evoke and denigrate thesun and fun of the Golden State. Bikini-clad prurience and quelling of readers’ enviousness in one glittering package. Hollywood glamor, Silicon Valley wealth and the darkside of both, all at thesame time. If California fails to offer young people and newcomers the opportunity to improve their lot, the consequences will be catastrophic—and not only for California.— Conor Friedersdorf, The Atlantic“You were right toscoff,” the authors assure their readers. “California is just as bad as the place you live in.”No wonder that articles flogging this theme appearso regularly, everysix months orso, that you can pre-fill your iPhone calendar app years in advance to notify you that the next one is on its way. The latest installment comes to us from the Atlantic, an 8,000-word piece titled“The California Dream Is Dying.”Its author, Conor Friedersdorf, is a Californian himself. Thatsets him apart, at least, from the customary authors ofsimilarscreeds, visitors from outside parachuting in for a week or two tosponge up local color for their takes. Friedersdorf, however, follows more or less thesame course as many of the others. Like them, his mood is both elegiac and apocalyptic.“California has always thrived by embracing both cultural and economic dynamism,” he writes. But “if California fails to offer young people and newcomers the opportunity to improve their lot, the consequences will be catastrophic — and not only for California.”As I’ve observed in the past, the literary genre of California truth-telling dates back to the mid-1800s. The earliest version I’ve found was published in 1855, in only the fifth year of Californiastatehood, by one Hinton R. Helper, a transplant from North Carolina who cursed thestate’s “rottenness and its corruption, itssqualor and its misery, its crime and itsshame.” (Helper wasn’t wrong.)Five years later, Horace Greeley, famous for having counseled young men to “Go West,” warned that California was almost tapped out as a land of opportunity.“No more merchants or clerks are wanted,” he wrote; “and of those who come hereafter, nine-tenths will go back disappointed or impoverished, orstay here paupers.”Friedersdorf isn’t wrong about many of the maladies facing the California dream today. He cites an anti-growth mentality by residents that causes a lack of affordable housing, conflicts over water, deteriorating roads and other infrastructure and government regulation. All these features do exist in California, thoughsome of the complainants Friedersdorf quotes are plainly engaged inspecial pleading. That includes an almond farmer in the Central Valley who grouses that the average Californian doesn’t understand what he does for a living or how much his crop contributes to thestate. Um, no: The problem with the California almond crop isn’t that people don’t understand it but that almond trees’ demand for an uninterruptible watersupply is less and less consistent with the availability of water as thestate’s drought deepens and global warming threatens to make it even worse. Friedersdorf mentions the grower’s fallowing of land and bulldozing of almond trees because of drought but doesn’t explore how the competition for ever-scarcer watershapes thestate — and not necessarily for the worse — beyond that. Among other things, thestate is a national leader in water conservation. Overregulation? Friedersdorf quotes business owners complaining they’ve been cited for violations. (My guess: A poll ofsuch business owners would turn up unanimous agreement that regulation is bad.) But he denigrates thestate’s landmark California Environmental Quality Act by citing how it interferes with the addition of bike lanes on public roads. This is a woefullyskewed picture of CEQA, which was enacted in 1970 in the aftermath of the Santa Barbara oilspill, a genuine catastrophe. Friedersdorf calls CEQA “vulnerable to abuse,” by which he means that it’s exploited by locals to block environmentallysuspect projects. But he doesn’t mention that it’s also vulnerable to political pressure by well-heeled developers, like the developers of big NFLstadiums who received exemptions from CEQA rules they claimed were onerous. He citessurveys by CEOs and business lobbies ranking California’s business environment as the worst in the nation. I’ve reported many timeson the folly of relying onsimilarsurveys to gauge thestrength of thestate’s economy,since they consistently fail to explain howsuch an anti-businessstate canshow the nation’sstrongest economic growth. Maybe they’re just baloney. Friedersdorf, to his credit,shows that he is well aware that California’s history is nothing like asteady march to diversity and opportunity for all. “Across its first century, California kept attracting fortuneseekers both foreign and domestic, its population always growing,” he writes, before acknowledging “California’s many failures to do right by its wildly diverse inhabitants.”As he reports, the Gold Rush led to genocidal attacks on native tribes. The importation of Chinese labor for the Central Pacific Railroad led to the Chinese exclusion laws. Development of farmland by Japanesesettlers led tostatewide discrimination against the Japanese and ultimately to their wartime incarceration, one of the most unpardonable episodes in California, and American, history. Thestate’s relationship with Latino and Black residents has been punctuated by outbreaks of violence,some of it directed at ethnic minorities andsome of it the expression of minorities’ frustration withsocial inequity: the Zoot Suit riots of the 1940s, the 1965 Watts riot, the 1992 Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict. The fundamental problem with Friedersdorf’s piece and many like it is a problem of framing. By implying thatsomething new has arrived to derail the California dream, he implies that thestate wasstrutting high, wide and handsome until very recently, when it ran into a brick wall and the dream was blown tosmithereens by encroaching reality. He mentions the report in May that thestate had experienced a net loss in population during the pandemic. Evoking Carey McWilliams, the California historian whose 1949 paean to thestate identified it as “the great exception,” Friedersdorf writes that theshrinking of thestate’s population issomething “McWilliams would have found unthinkable.”That’ssurely incorrect. McWilliams in his book made clear that California was a work in progress and could veer off into any direction: “The time has not yet arrived for a realsumming-up; one cannot, as yet, properly place California in the Americanscheme of things.... There isstill too much commotion — too much noise and movement and turmoil.”McWilliams also warned that “California’s resources are basically inadequate tosupport its future population.” Rather than finding a population break “unthinkable,” McWilliamssaw it as very, very plausible. What “the dream is dead” theme overlooks is that California has always been a place of boom-and-bust economics, ofshifting political ideologies and of contradictions of allsorts. It’sseen today as a beacon of progressive politics, as it was at the turn of the last century; but between those bookends it also gave us Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Favoriteson Earl Warren ranks as one of California’s most liberal governors and became an avatar of racial justice as chief justice of the U. S.; what’s almost universally forgotten is his virulently racist advocacy of Japanese incarceration during the war.“When we are dealing with the Caucasian race we have methods that will test the loyalty of them,” Warren advised a congressional committee pondering the policy, “but when we deal with the Japanese we are in an entirely different field.”Some of what Friedersdorf identifies as California ills are obviously maladies of Americansociety as a whole. He tells how his grandfather, a carpenter, was able to buy a house,settle in Orange County and raise a family of four as his household’ssole breadwinner in the 1950s.“At 41,” he writes, “I’d be hard-pressed to buy a home in the neighborhood where my grandfather built his house and where my parents bought theirs three decades later.” That may beso, but the hollowing out of the American middle class and the difficulties of achieving home ownership, not to mention college tuition and retirement, is not merely a California phenomenon but a national one. It’s fair tosay that California, for all itsstrengths, isn’t immune from the inequality of the American economy, but is that a rap against the “California dream”?Every virtue of California from itsstatehood to its astonishing postwar growth wassure to inspire a reaction; it’s hardly unusual for people who have climbed the ladder of economicsuccess to try to pull it up behind them. California residents whosettled in desirable neighborhoods have fought to keep them as they were at thestart. But the not-in-my-backyard impulse isn’t unique to the Golden State. Californians confronted extremes of water and air pollution and responded withsome of the moststringent pollution regulations in the land. Tosome of Friedersdorf’ssources, this is a burden. But thestate’s methods of controlling pollution have become models for dozens of otherstates,so there must besome good to them. Tosay the California dream is dead or dying isstill at leastsomewhat of an exaggeration. The population decline is properly blamed on the pandemic and ismore than likely to reversesoon. Thestate’s median household income of $75,200 handily exceeds that ofstates whose reactionary governors love to point to California as a failure: Texas, $61,870; Florida, $55,660. Until the recent Delta variant-drivensurge in COVID cases, California’s new case rate was the best in the country. Critics assert that California is “hemorrhaging people,” but this is not a new phenomenon — California has lost population to otherstates every year for the last three decades; the issue is who’s leaving and who’s arriving? The answer is that itstillsees net in-migration of those with advanced degrees, the highest incomes, and the young. So, yes, in asense the California dream is dying, but it has been dying almostsince it was born. Friedersdorfshows an acute awareness of where the threats to thestate’s future lie, as heshould, being a Californian with the incisive awareness of the outside world of any good journalist. Butsomehow, thestate isstillshowing the rest of the country, and the world, how tosurvive and even thrive in the face of the harsh realities around us. Maybe the next iteration of the “California is dying” trope will get it right.",1,2,LA Times

18,Trump Admin Fights Judge’s Order Making It Easier to Kill Babies in Abortions,15.67,35.0,https://www.lifenews.com/2020/07/29/trump-admin-fights-judges-order-making-it-easier-to-kill-babies-in-abortions/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,22,"There have been two important developments in the past four days in response to the July 14 decision by District Judge Theodore Chuang tosuspend an FDA rule, which among other things, requires a woman to have an in-person doctor’s visit before undergoing a chemical (“medication”) abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, on July 24, the FDA filed a memorandum tostay (halt) Judge Chuang’s preliminary injunction pending an appeal. As NRL News Today reported, Judge Chuang maintained that thesafety precautions required by the FDA constituted a “substantial obstacle” to a woman’s right to abortion. Second, today more than 20 pro-life leaders, including NRL President Carol Tobias, wrote to the head of the FDA urging Dr. Stephen Hahn “to protect American women and preborn children by removing the abortion pill (mifepristone) from the US market.”The letter approvingly cited (as NRL News Today reported previously) “the FDA’s decision toshut down illegal websites trafficking unapproved abortion pills into the US,” but asked the FDA to go further—“to classify the abortion pill as an ‘imminent hazard to the public health’ that poses a ‘significant threat of danger’” and pull it off the market. The abortion industry is brazen in its determination to use the COVID-19 pandemic to erase any and all limitations of how women undergo medication/chemical abortions. They are notsubtle: theirstated objective is DYI abortions in which women receive the abortifacients by mail or pick up them from a pharmacy. Proponents, of course, insistsuchself-administered abortions aresafe, an assertion Judge Chuang, an Obama appointee, agreed with wholeheartedly. The lettersent to Dr. Hahn thoroughly andsystematically disputed that characterization. For example,This lethal drug that the FDA permits for killing innocent preborn children during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy is also highly dangerous for women. According to the FDA’s adverse event reportingsystem, the abortion pill has resulted in over 4,000 reported adverse eventssince 2000, including 24 maternal deaths. Adverse events are notoriously underreport ed to the FDA, and as of 2016, the FDA only requires abortion pill manufacturers to report maternal deaths. Manufacturers gather this information from the prescribers,such as Planned Parenthood facilities. Yet, women who experienceside effects like heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, orsevere infections are likely toseek care at emergency rooms, not the abortion facilities where they received the pills. Since emergency rooms are not required to report abortion pill adverse events to the FDA, the true number of adverse events is impossible to assess. For these and other reasons cited in the letter, the pro-life leaders urged the FDA “to pull the abortion pill from the US market immediately and declare it an imminent hazard to the public health”; encouraged “your continued efforts tostop the illegal trafficking of black market abortion pills into US commerce”; and requested the FDA “to fight back against the abortion industry’s radical push to overturn REMS in the courts.”[In this case REMS– Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy—mandates that mifepristone can be dispensed only in clinics, medical offices and hospitals; only by, or under thesupervision of, a doctor certified to prescribe the drug; and only to patients who havesigned an F. D. A.-approved patient agreement,” to quote the New York Times.]The FDA’s July 24 memorandum to Judge Chuang dismantled his reasoning point by point by point. (What I neglected to mention in a priorstory was the condescending manner in which Judge Chuang haughtily dismissed the FDA’s defense of its REMS policy. He also heavily relied on the testimony of one abortionist– Dr. Heather Paladine.)The memorandum begins by observing that Judge Chuang incorrectly concluded the abortion industry has “standing” (the legal right) to file a lawsuit on behalf of womenseeking medication abortion. As to the close relationship element, the Court ruled that Plaintiffs “providedspecific evidence of close physician-patient relationships, including between Dr. Paladine and her patients.”But evidence of asingle physician’s Relationship with her patients does not establish that the thousands of physicians who are members of the Plaintiff organizations generally have close relationships with their own patients whoseek a Mifeprex [the brand name for mifepristone] prescription, and mayseek to assert not only the rights of long-time patients, but of all patientsseeking Mifeprex prescriptions. The FDA added tellingly(I)n fact, the entire point of thissuit is to reduce Plaintiffs’ relationship with their patients—and failed toshow that their patients were hindered from vindicating their own rights. The memorandum also persuasively made the case that “Plaintiffs Have Not Shown That the In-Person Requirements Pose a Substantial Obstacle to a Large Fraction of Women Seeking an Abortion During the COVID-19 Pandemic.” That is, the in-person requirement did not constitute an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to have an abortion. Further, the Memorandum observed that Judge Chuang had “noted that FDA has not fully evaluated the in-person requirementsince 2013 and thus has not determined whether the requirements remain necessary in the context of tele medicine or the pandemic.”The response all but bristled…In reaching its conclusion. the Court relied on the Supreme Court’sstatement in Whole Woman’s Health that courtsshould avoid “giv[ing] ‘[u]ncritical deference’ to the findings of the legislature.”But FDA is not a legislature—it is an expertscientific agency responsible for protecting public health by ensuring thesafety and effectiveness of drugs. FDA’s evaluation of a drug’s risks to determine the appropriate restrictions necessary forsafe use is a matter quintessentially within FDA’s expertscientific judgment. The FDA concluded that if Judge Chuang decides not tostay his “preliminary injunction pending Appeal,” then it “respectfully asks that the Courtsummarily deny the motion without awaiting a response from Plaintiffs,so that Defendants canseek relief from the Fourth Circuit expeditiously.”",1,0,Life News
19,Herod and Bacon: Colorado’s Black Caucus has big concerns about redistricting maps,-12.0,31.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/23/colorado-black-caucus-redistricting-minority-house-senate-districts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Recently preliminary redistricting maps were released for Colorado’sstate House and Senate. Though we have been assured that these maps will change over time, the approach used to draw the new lines is deeply troubling. In many of the new districts, communities of color have been broken apart to diminish our voting power for no discernable reason other than arbitrary road-based divisions that mean nothing to voters. For example, the current House District 8 has beensplit down the middle in the new maps,separating the historic Five Points neighborhood from North Park Hill. Both of the new districts, house districts 4 and 6, will have a lower percent Black population, effectively diluting our votingstrength and making it more difficult to get Black representation in thestate House. House District 8 has historicalsignificance to Colorado. The first Black representation came out of the district. That representation brought ourstate major advancements in civil rights from the formal recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day to police reform. Similarly, Aurora House and Senate lines have been reconfigured in ways that may reduce the chances of Black members getting elected to the Colorado General Assembly. In El Paso County, the African American population is fractured between four House districts and three Senate districts. According to the Colorado Sun, a redistricting commission advising attorney, Jeremiah Barry, acknowledged that the maps were drawn with the knowledge they would dilute minority voting power, reducing majority Hispanic House districts fromseven to three. The process ofsplitting minority communities intoseparate districts, a tactic known as “cracking” during gerrymander attempts, has long been used to prevent adequate representation from minorities in legislative bodies around the country. Dramatically redrawing Colorado’s current districts, rather than expanding or contracting current borders based on population changes, needs to have astrong justification. One that is lacking here. As reported during this lastsession prejudicestill runs rampant. The Black caucus as an entity is a multi generational groupspanning in age and experience from members who lived during Jim Crow to those born during The New Jim Crow. Our voice is a vital voice for freedom. Tosee it diluted is an affront to centuries of hard work and activism to not just beseen and heard, but to be at the table when determining our community’s fate. These “starting place” mapsshould be tossed out and the commissionshouldstart with the current Colorado House and Senate lines, which have previously been approved by the Colorado Supreme Court. There is no justification for dramatically reducing Black and other minority voting power across the board.",1,2,Denver Post

21,Massachusetts Question 2: Ranked choice voting opponents take victory lap,0.0,48.33,https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/04/massachusetts-question-2-ranked-choice-voting-opponents-take-victory-lap/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"Opponents of ranked-choice voting in Massachusetts took a victory lap on Wednesday after voters turned down a new votingsystem for thestate. Question 2 — implementing ranked-choice voting in the Bay State — was defeated by a 55% to 45% margin. Question 1 — updating the “right to repair” law — overwhelmingly passed 75% to 25%. Opponents of the ranked-choice ballot measuresaid Wednesday that voters handily rejected the question and that “the will of the people is pretty clear” against ranked-choice voting. The “No on 2”side also addressed the potential for backers of ranked-choice voting to try again in Massachusetts.“Anyone that has the willpower can putsomething on the ballot, and anyone that has the willpower can defeat it, too,”said Paul Craney, of the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, which opposed the question along with the Massachusetts Republican Party and Gov. Charlie Baker. The chair of the “Yes on 2” campaign on Wednesdaysaid the result was “obviously disappointing,” but noted that more than 1 million peoplesupported the proposed votingsystem.“This kind of change is definitely hard,”said chair Evan Falchuk. “It’s a marathon, not asprint.“There are a lot of people here in Massachusetts and around the country thatsee this kind of political reform as a big part of rebuilding our democracy,” he added. Asked if the campaign will try the ballot measure again in the Bay State, Falchuk replied, “Maybe one day.” He also cited the ranked-choice voting bills in the Legislature, and cities and towns looking into it.“We’re going to keep the faith and keep moving forward,” Falchuksaid. The votingsystem— which has been adopted by thestate of Maine and a handful of cities nationwide — would enable voters to rank as many candidates as they want in order of preference. Workers tallying the vote first look at all of the first-place votes, and, ifsomeone has a majority, the electionstops there and that person wins, as is the case right now. If no candidate wins more than 50%, the bottom vote-getter is eliminated, and all of the ballots that went to them are allocated to voters’second-place choices. If no one is above 50%, the process repeats, eliminating one candidate per round until there are only two candidates left, at which point the one with the most votes wins. Many Massachusetts voters “did not understand why anyone would want to addsuch a complicatedsystem,such a complicated measure into voting,”said Anthony Amore, of the “No on 2” committee. Ranked-choice voting was repealed in Worcester, and Lowell voters rejected it last year, Craneysaid. When asked about the possibility of the Legislature taking up ranked-choice voting, Craneysaid, “Any time the Legislature does anything, it’ssupposed to be the will of the people. In this case, the will of the people is pretty clear as far as what they think of ranked choice.”“That’s up to them … if they want to go ahead and pursuesomething that clearly has no mandate and the voters havespoken pretty clear on it,” he added. “We’ll have to address it if it does come up legislatively at that time.”",2,1,Boston Herald

On July 1937, however, Earhart achieved fame for an unfortunate reason. Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonandisappearedin theirLockheed Electra plane, while attempting a global flight. Despite extensive efforts to find them, they were never found, nor was any wreckage from their plane. Earhart was officially declared dead in 1939. Despite disappearing more than eight decades ago, Earhart has remained a pop culturefixture. She has also remained the focal point of conspiracy theories,some of them more bizarre than others. Officially, the position of the U. S. has been that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean while trying to reach tiny Howland Island to land and refuel. Some believe that Earhart was captured by the Japanese government after landing in the Marshall Islands, withsome pointing to a photograph taken in the 1930s that allegedlyshowed both Earhart and her plane there. In another theory,somespeculatedshe took on the identity of ""Tokyo Rose,"" a propagandist who made English-language broadcasts intended to demoralize Allied forces during World War II. There was no evidence for this narrative. But Ric Gillespie, author of the book ""Finding Amelia"" and executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery,toldthe BBC in 2017 that there is no evidencesupporting the claim that a photographshows Earhart in Japanese custody. Another theory is that Earhart and Noonansuccessfully landed on Nikumaroro, another tiny islandsoutheast of Howland, but both died there as rescuers failed to find them in time. Per National Geographic, tantalizing clues, including human remains and airplane parts, were discovered on the island by a British exploration party in 1937. Another unfounded theory was that Earhartsurvived and returned to the U. S., but assumed a new identity, namely ""Irene Bolham."" This theory, put forward by book author Joe Klaas, was false, as ABC Newsreported:The theoryshould have died after Bolhamsued Klaas, his associate Joe Gervais, and McGraw-Hill for defamation and McGraw-Hill pulled the book fromshelves. But 33 years later, another book, ""Amelia Earhart Survives"" by Col. Rollin Reineck, came out in 2003 making thesame claim. Stranger theories about Earhart's disappearance attribute it to ana lien abduction and even more bizarre, the idea thatshe wassaved by a race of people that live inside the Earth.",1,2,Snopes

Even with the tumult of 2020 -- from the COVID-19 pandemic tosocial unrest to a president who refused to concede an election and incited an insurrection -- corporate America trended toward inclusivity, with 60 corporations that previously appeared on the CEI receiving perfectscores for the first time. In total, 767 businesses met all the criteria to earn a 100 percent rating and the designation of being a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality,"" includingseveral that participated in the CEI for the first time ever. HRC considers numerous criteria when ranking company's LGBTQ+ inclusivity. Criteria 1 is workplace protections,specifically if companies prohibit discrimination based onsexual orientation and gender identity (also, in 2020 the Supreme Court banned anti-LGBTQ+ workplace discrimination across the U. S.). Criteria 2 is whether companies offer inclusive medical benefits and other additional benefits forsame-sexspouses and domestic partners as well as transgender-inclusive medical care. Criteria 3 ranks companies on inclusive culture and corporate responsibility,specifically diversity training for management and new hires, gender transition guidelines, LGBTQ+ resource groups, and outreach and engagement to the LGBTQ+ community, either through marketing, advertising, or philanthropy. The latter criteria is imperative because as HRC notes, ""policy isn't practice,"" and 46 percent of LGBTQ+ employees remain closeted at work. The recent improvement in corporate treatment of LGBTQ+ employees and issues is evident and dramatic. For example, ""a full 94 percent of the Fortune 500 -- including both companies that participate in the CEIsurvey and those that do not -- have gender identity protections enumerated in their nondiscrimination policies (up from 3 percent in 2002) and 99 percent of the entire CEI universe of businesses offer explicit gender identity nondiscrimination protections (up from 5 percent in 2002),"" HRCstates.

Barber II, the co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign, warned President Joe Biden and others listening to the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Service Thursday against issuing “simplistic calls for unity."" The progressive leader called for repentance of “policysin.”The day after the inauguration, as with past transitions of power in the United States, the Washington National Cathedral hosted theNational Prayer Service, also called the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Service. This year, theservice was primarily virtual due to the pandemic, with many whosang or readscripture at the Cathedral wearing face masks andsocially distanced. Barber called for people “to choose to repent of the policysin and to repair the breach."" The NAACP leader defined a breach as ""a gap in the nation between what is and how God wants things to be.”“Transposed to our time, the breach is when wesay ‘one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all’ with our lips, while wesee the rich and the poor living in two very different Americas,” the pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina continued.“The breach would be knowing the only way to ensure domestic tranquility is to establish justice. It is pretending that we can address the nation’s wounds withsimplistic calls for unity. That is not how we can close the breach.”The 57-year-old preachersaid that he believed the violence at the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was “the result of a long history"" and a ""politics of division that was cynically named ‘positive polarization’ by those who thought they could use it for their own political advantage.”“Thisstrategy of feeding andseeding intentional racial class division into the body politicspilled over into the inevitable violence that ideas ofsupremacy always produce,” added Barber.“If we want to come out of this jam and move forward together, we cannot accept the racial disparities and racial violence and breaches that impact black, brown, native, and Asian Americans while offering collateral damage to our poor white brothers andsisters and ultimately, our entire democracy.”Delaware State University President Tony Allen, CEO of the Presidential Inaugural Committee,said in astatement on Jan. 19 that the prayerservice was an important event.“The National Prayer Service is an important tradition for our nation and for President Biden, who has always been a man guided deeply by his faith,”stated Allen.“The program announced today will honor the role of faith in our country and provide a moment to reflect on the unprecedented challenges we face as we enter this new American chapter of healing to beat the pandemic, build back our economy better and unify our country.”While hosted by the National Cathedral, as with past inaugural prayerservices, representatives from multiple Christian denominations and other faiths participated in the ceremony. Many faith leaders gave prayers from different locations. Among them was Jim Wallis, the founder and former head of the evangelicalsocial justice organization Sojourners; the Reverend Otis Moss III,senior pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago; Rabbi Sharon Brous,senior rabbi of IKAR Jewish community in Los Angeles; Jonathan Nez, president of the Navajo Nation; and Sikh American activist and author Valarie Kaur.

Since being elected president, a major theme for Biden, asseen during his inauguration, has been that of unity among Americans despite political differences.""My wholesoul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, and uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause,"" Bidensaid in his inaugurationspeech.""Uniting to fight the common foes we face: anger, resentment, hatred, extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, hopelessness.

25,The Democratic Party Is Setting the Stage for a Letdown,-19.0,34.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democratic-convention-sanders-virtual/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"During the week of August 17, thousands of Democrats elected toserve as delegates to their party’s national convention will log on to their computers to view the proceedings. They will cast electronic votes on the party platform and for their party’s nominee to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency. About one-quarter of this year’s delegates are Bernie Sanderssupporters. Most of them are progressive political activists—and many are first-time participants in a national convention. This virtual event will not be the experience they expected. And while all of those with whom I’vespoken aresupportive of the precautions being taken in this era of pandemic, most remain in the dark about the convention plans and whether their participation is valued. Months ago, when the 2020 Summer Olympics and a host of professionalsporting events were canceled, itshould have been clear that we were going to have problems bringing tens of thousands of delegates,supporters, and press to Milwaukee. I fully recognize the political calculations that had to be made, the problems of disappointing the host city, the need to have an event that wouldserve as a launching pad for the presidential electionseason. And I have no doubt that the convention planning team and DNCstaffers were working round the clock weighing all these problems and exploring options. Nevertheless, what was missing was a recognition that the convention wasn’t just the concern of the planningstaff or the Biden campaign. It was personal for the delegates—especially first-timers, many of whom worked hard to earn their posts, felt empowered when they won, and were looking forward to playing their part in this quadrennial drama. Given this, it was troubling how little communication there was with prospective delegates and how little engagement there was with DNC members while deliberations were ongoing. Ishould be clear that I am not faulting the convention or DNCstaff that delegates were left in the dark. This was a political call thatshould have come from the leadership of the party. With this in mind, the Bernie Delegates Network (BDN) conducted a nationalsurvey of Sanders delegates. We wanted to get their assessment of the planning process, whether they felt respected as delegates, and ideas they might haveshared had they been consulted. Their responsesshould beseen as troubling both for the party and the Biden campaign. More than 80 percent of those who respondedsaid they felt disrespected or ignored. And their comments made clear why. Common refrains were that as delegates they “felt left out” and that the process was “lacking in transparency and input.” Some went further, cautioning that this year’s “organizing, like the 2016 DNC convention,seems to minimize participation by Sanders delegates.”Two otherssummed up the views of many: “Itshould have been anticipated much earlier that the convention would be online and things planned with that in mind ahead of time. [There were] a lot of missed opportunities…” And there was “too little communication withstakeholders, that is, delegates and DNC members. It has been a closed affair— notseeking input…” Frequently, the Sanders delegates also complained that they had no idea how this convention will allow their voices to be heard. They expressed the desire to participate butsaid they “don’t know how.” And a number of first-time delegates were unsure whether their participation was even valued by the party. Some may dismiss these complaints as coming from the disgruntled losingside, but there is a risk in doingso. Young and old progressives are an important constituency. They make up a respectableshare of Democratic voters, and many are activists who represent communities Democrats will need to win. As Jesse Jackson famously noted at the 1988 Democratic convention, “It takes two wings to fly.” In party-building, there can be no victor/vanquished. The role of asuccessful convention is to heal internal divisions and create unity of purpose among the various component groups of the party. In 2016, too little attention was paid to this critical undertaking. Bernie Sanders, personally, tried tosoothe the disappointment felt by his delegation. But the message they received from the establishment was “We won, and you lost.” They feltshut out of the proceedings and left the convention demoralized. This year could have been different. So far, it has not been. There isn’t thesame degree of rancor as there was four years ago; the Biden/Sanders task forces formed to create a unified approach to writing the platform, while producing a document not whollysatisfying to progressives, wasstill a good-faith effort to bridge differences. But leaving grassroots delegates in the dark as to how the convention will work—and reducing their role to passive online viewers—runs the risk of producing a massive letdown that could leave hundreds of delegates alienated. What this may mean is that at the conclusion of the party confab, many first-time Sanders delegates (andsome old-timers, as well), instead of being energized and engaged, may turn off their computers feeling deflated and dejected. The unityso necessary for victory will not have been achieved. This canstill be addressed. If there is a will, creativesolutions canstill be found to give us the “two wings” we need to fly. But time is running out.",1,1,The Nation

28,The U.S. Refuses to Give Up Its Colonies,-20.67,32.0,https://progressive.org/dispatches/us-refuses-to-give-up-colonies-hunt-200805/,https://adfontesmedia.com/progressive-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,17,"At aCongressional hearing on July 28, representatives ofseveral United States’ island territories demanded that Congress take action to correct the racist and colonial policies that have kept the nearly four million inhabitants of these territories locked in asecond-classstatus, unable to participate fully in their government. Several Supreme Court justices made racist arguments, claiming that the people of the territories are members of “alien races” who were not ready for democracy. The representatives of the U. S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U. S. Virgin Islands presented a united front as they called on Congress to either help them move toward independence or grant them thesame rights as the residents of the fiftystates. These include full voting rights, equal representation in Congress, and equal treatment under the law. It’s not at all an outlandish idea. Michael F. Q. San Nicolas, theU. S. Representativeof Guam,saidduring the hearing that the U. S. governmentshould be “graduating its territories into whole parts of it orsetting them free.”Today, the United States controls five inhabited island territories: Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U. S. Virgin Islands. The people of American Samoa are U. S. nationals, and the inhabitants of the four other territories are U. S. citizens. The five territories are integral parts of the United States, populated by Americans who have proven their dedication to their country. Territory residents inGuamandAmerican Samoaserve in the military at much higher rates than those in thestates. The territories are also home to more than100,000 veterans. Still, the Americans who live in these territories are denied basic rights that most citizens take for granted. They are not represented in the Senate, and their Representatives in the House cannot vote on legislation. They are not even allowed to vote for the Presidents who mightsend them to war. The territories also experiencesignificant economic disadvantages, receiving fewer benefits from federal programssuch asMedicaidand theSupplemental Security Incomeprogram. All five territories have a lower per-capita income than the average per-capita income of the fiftystates and the District of Columbia. The “lack of equal representation and equal voting power has a direct correlation to persistent poverty across all of the U. S. territories,” Stacey E. Plaskett, the representative of the U. S. Virgin Islands,testifiedat the hearing. “Americans living in the territories are accustomed to being last in line: for hurricane relief, for COVID-19 equipment, for basic health care, education, and more.”The five island territories were relegated to theirsubordinatestatus by the U. S. Supreme Court in the early 1900s by what became known as theInsular Cases. By creating a newstatus for the territories called “unincorporated territories,” the court made it possible for the United States to control the islands without granting their inhabitants equal rights under the Constitution. Several Supreme Court justices made racist arguments, claiming that the people of the territories are members of “alien races” who were not ready for democracy.“Those decisions were explicitly informed by racial assumptions,” Plaskettsays. They “have created a near permanent colonialstatus for those living in the territory.”Notably, many of the justices who ruled on the Insular Cases also ruled in theinfamouscase, which created the “separate but equal” doctrine that provided the legal basis forsegregation in the South. Although the Supreme Court later overruled thePlessy v. Fergusondecision, it has let the basic logic of the Insular Casesstand, continuing the legal basis for the territories’ colonialstatus. Critics argue that the racist thinking that informed the Supreme Court’s original arguments continues toshape the way officials in Washington view the territories today.“It is not a mere coincidence that more than 98 percent of territorial residents are racial or ethnic minorities,”saysNeil Weare, the president and founder ofEqually American, an organization that advocates for equal rights for the people of the territories. For the pastseveral years, Weare has been working through Equally American with the goal of getting the Supreme Court to overturn the Insular Cases. In one of his major cases,, Weare argues that people born in the territories have a constitutional right to citizenship.“Until the Insular Cases are overruled, the federal government will continue relying on them to justify discrimination against residents of the territories,” he insists. In the meantime, representatives of the U. S. territories have been urging Congress to exercise its power by passingH. R.1, a bill that would create a Congressional Task Force to recommend ways of providing the residents of the territories with equal voting and representation rights. The bill, which the House passed last year, acknowledges that “political participation and the right to vote are among the highest concerns of territorial residents in part because they were not always afforded these rights.”While the bill languishes in the Senate, the people in the territories continue to enduresecond-classstatus. Though they constitute a larger population than the combined populations of the fivesmalleststates, they lack voting rights or representation.“The nearly four million people who live in U. S. territory are not thesubjects of a king or a master,” PlaskettremindedCongress. “Their interests will not be fully represented within the government of the United States until they have full and equal voting rights, just like other Americans.”",1,1,The Progressive

S. dronestrike in Afghanistan before the withdrawal of American troops was a “horrible mistake” that killed 10 civilians,including as many asseven children. The admission came after news organizations,including the New York Times and Washington Post, had published reports casting doubt on the official version of events that claimed the Aug. 29 dronestrike hadstopped an imminent attack on the Kabul airport. Military officials now admit that pretty much everything they believed when they carried out thestrike was wrong. The driver that the drone targeted and officials believed was a terrorist was actually Zamarai Ahmadi, a longtime aid worker for a U. S.-based group. Officials believed he had loaded explosives in the trunk of a white Toyota, but in fact he was likely carrying water bottles. At first, the military hadsaid asecondary explosion at the time of thestrike proved the car was loaded with explosives, but now itseems likelier that it was a propane or gas tank that went up in flames with thestrike.“We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan, that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced, and that Mr. Ahmadi was just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed,”Defense Secretary Lloyd Austinsaid in astatement. “We apologize, and we will endeavor to learn from this horrible mistake.”The killing of civilians is raising questions about the ability of the United States to carry out dronestrikes in the country after withdrawal considering thesevere lack of intelligence on the ground. Plus it provides new fuel for critics of President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, which was marked by chaos and tragedy. The dronestrike took place mere days after an ISISsuicide bomber killed 13 U. S. troops and at least 170 Afghans at the Kabul airport. Gen. Frank McKenzie, who heads U. S. Central Command,said Friday that an ongoing probe is considering whether anyone would be held responsible and the government is analyzing compensation for the victims’ families. But he dismissedspeculation that this would impact future actions in Afghanistan. “I don’t think youshould draw any conclusions about our ability tostrike in Afghanistan against ISIS-K targets in the future based on this particularstrike,” McKenziesaid.",2,1,Slate

32,The Pentagon Inches Toward Letting AI Control Weapons,0.0,44.33,https://www.wired.com/story/pentagon-inches-toward-letting-ai-control-weapons/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-10,25,"ApplicationHuman-computer interactionEthicsEnd UserGovernmentSectorDefenseTechnologyMachine learningMachine visionRoboticsLast August,several dozen military drones and tanklike robots took to theskies and roads 40 milessouth of Seattle. Their mission: Find terroristssuspected of hiding amongseveral buildings. So many robots were involved in the operation that no human operator could keep a close eye on all of them. So they were given instructions to find—and eliminate—enemy combatants when necessary. The mission was just an exercise, organized by theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a blue-sky research division of the Pentagon; the robots were armed with nothing more lethal than radio transmitters designed tosimulate interactions with both friendly and enemy robots. The drill was one ofseveral conducted lastsummer to test how artificial intelligence could help expand the use of automation in militarysystems, including inscenarios that are too complex and fast-moving for humans to make every critical decision. The demonstrations also reflect asubtleshift in the Pentagon’s thinking about autonomous weapons, as it becomes clearer that machines can outperform humans at parsing complexsituations or operating at highspeed. GeneralJohn Murrayof the US Army Futures Command told an audience at the US Military Academy last month thatswarms of robots will force military planners, policymakers, andsociety to think about whether a personshould make every decision about using lethal force in new autonomoussystems. Murray asked: “Is it within a human's ability to pick out which ones have to be engaged” and then make 100 individual decisions? “Is it even necessary to have a human in the loop?” he added. Other comments from military commanderssuggest interest in giving autonomous weaponssystems more agency. At a conference on AI in the Air Force last week, Michael Kanaan, director of operations for the Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator at MIT and a leading voice on AI within the US military,said thinking is evolving. Hesays AIshould perform more identifying and distinguishing potential targets while humans make high-level decisions. “I think that's where we're going,” Kanaansays.“Is it even necessary to have a human in the loop?”At thesame event, Lieutenant GeneralClinton Hinote, deputy chief ofstaff forstrategy, integration, and requirements at the Pentagon,says that whether a person can be removed from the loop of a lethal autonomoussystem is “one of the most interesting debates that is coming, [and] has not beensettled yet.”A report this month from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), an advisory group created by Congress, recommended, among other things, that the US resist calls for an international ban on the development of autonomous weapons. Timothy Chung, the Darpa program manager in charge of theswarming project,says lastsummer’s exercises were designed to explore when a human drone operatorshould, andshould not, make decisions for the autonomoussystems. For example, when faced with attacks onseveral fronts, human control cansometimes get in the way of a mission, because people are unable to react quickly enough. “Actually, thesystems can do better from not havingsomeone intervene,” Chungsays. The drones and the wheeled robots, each about thesize of a large backpack, were given an overall objective, then tapped AI algorithms to devise a plan to achieve it. Some of themsurrounded buildings while others carried outsurveillancesweeps. A few were destroyed bysimulated explosives;some identified beacons representing enemy combatants and chose to attack. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThe US and other nations have used autonomy in weaponssystems for decades. Some missiles can, for instance, autonomously identify and attack enemies within a given area. But rapid advances in AI algorithms will change how the military usessuchsystems. Off-the-shelf AI code capable of controlling robots and identifying landmarks and targets, often with high reliability, will make it possible to deploy moresystems in a wider range ofsituations. But as the drone demonstrations highlight, more widespread use of AI willsometimes make it more difficult to keep a human in the loop. This might prove problematic, because AI technology can harbor biases or behave unpredictably. A vision algorithm trained to recognize a particular uniform might mistakenly targetsomeone wearingsimilar clothing. Chungsays theswarm project presumes that AI algorithms will improve to a point where they can identify enemies with enough reliability to be trusted. Use of AI in weaponssystems has become controversial in recent years. Google faced employee protest and public outcry in 2018 aftersupplying AI technology to the Air Forcethrough a project known asMaven. Tosome degree, the project is part of a long history of autonomy in weaponssystems, withsome missiles already capable of carrying out limited missions independent of human control. But it alsoshows how recent advances in AI will make autonomy more attractive and inevitable in certainsituations. What's more, it highlights the trust that will be placed in technology that canstill behave unpredictably. Paul Scharre, an expert at the Center for New American Security and author of,says it is time to have a moresophisticated discussion about autonomous weapons technology. “The discussionsurrounding ‘humans in the loop’ ought to be moresophisticated thansimply a binary ‘are they or aren't they?’” Scharresays. “If a human makes a decision to engage aswarm of enemy drones, does the human need to individuallyselect each target?”The Defense Department issued a policy on autonomous weapons in November 2012,stating that autonomous weaponssystems need to have human oversight—but this need not meansoldiers making every decision. Those who believe that militaries could use AI to cross a Rubicon when it comes to human responsibility for lethal forcesee things differently.“Lethal autonomous weapons cheap enough that every terrorist can afford them are not in America's nationalsecurity interest,”saysMax Tegmark, a professor at MIT and cofounder of theFuture of Life Institute, a nonprofit that opposes autonomous weapons. Tegmarksays AI weaponsshould be “stigmatized and banned like biological weapons.” The NSCAI report's opposition to a global ban is astrategic mistake, hesays: “I think we'll one day regret it even more than we regret having armed the Taliban.”",2,2,WIRED

Facebookfollowedsuit. Separately, bothAppleand Google haveremovedParler, asocial media app favored by right-wingers, from their appstores, citing its lack of a moderation policy. (It had becometh e No. 1 free app in the Apple App Store.) Amazon thensuspend edits web hosting, bringing the whole app down. Supporters of the president insist that he has been unfairly censored by Big Tech. Right-wing pundit Dan Bonginosaidthat, “This Big Tech/Big Governmentsymbiont is now in open war with civil liberties and freespeech in America.” Conservative Christian b logger Matt Walsh, whose latest book was reviewedinsaid:Donald Trump Jr. , whose book has also been reviewedin,saidthat, “It’s asad day when Big Tech has more power than Big Government.”Is it “censorship” for Twitter to remove the president, and for Apple and Google to remove Parler? Is it an attack on freespeech rights?The easiest response to offer is that no, rights are not implicated, because Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Google are private companies, and they are not bound by the Constitution. You are “free to choose” whether you use these platforms, and if you do, you are governed by their terms ofservice. If they don’t like what yousay and decide toshut your account,, that’s the free market for you. Go create your own platform if you want to exercise your freespeech rights. The government has to respect your First Amendment rights, but a corporation of which you are a customer does not. This was also the obvious response to Trump allysenator Josh Hawley, who complained after Simon & Schuster terminated his book contract—incidentally, for a book called—that it was an “Orwellian” act by a “woke mob” and a “direct assault on the First Amendment.” The First Amendment has never previously been known to govern the publishing choices of Simon & Schuster—in fact, under existing jurisprudence it would be an interference with freespeech if the First Amendment did tell the company that they were required to publish asenator’s book. But while this response is easy, it iseasy, because it ignores that “corporate censorship” can be a very real thing, especially when corporations are gigantic and powerful. If you are astrict libertarian, who believes that “freedom of contract” means a company does not owe you anything except what they promise you in the Terms & Conditions, then it’s true that complaining a corporation has violated yourspeech rights isself-contradictory: they can’t have violated them, because you don’thavefreespeech rights vis-a-vis a private entity. On the left, we recognize that the libertarian case is very weak, however, because it ignores the fact that in the real world, corporations often function as “private governments.” When a company is functionally a monopoly, and controls access to critical infrastructure, it has the kind of power that a government has. We cansee this if we think about a literal publicsquare. If thesquare is indeed public, then protests and demonstrations in it are governed by the First Amendment. But if the city government is taken over by a neo liberal administration, who are ideologically committed to the belief that private entities do a better job running publicservices than the government, the publicsquare might be privatized andsold to a corporation. Once thesquare is owned by a company called, let’ssay, City Systems & Solutions, Incorporated, decisions about who gets tosay what pass to the CEO. Leftists point out that it’s absurd for our rights to change just because what is rightfully ours has been handed to an unaccountable institution, and it’sstrange when your rights depend not on what kind of place you’re in but on who happens to own it. That is tosay, myspeech rights at a college or an airport or on astreet depend entirely on whether it’s a private or public college, airport, orstreet. But this means that if a corporation ends up owning vast amounts of infrastructure, we have very few rights. The more privatized the world becomes, the more our basic civil liberties disappear. The big tech companies can be thought of like private corporations that own the roads or thesquare. I’ve written before about how because Amazon is a company that owns a public marketplace, it can manipulate the market in insidious ways. Facebook and Twitter are essentially the publicsquare, and it’s extremely difficult to go and “make your own” platform. My colleague,in-house economist Rob Larson, has written an excellent book calledBit Tyrants: The Political Economy of Silicon Valleythat talks about “network effects:” the way increased usership increases the value of aservice, making it impossible forsmall players to compete and entrenching large ones. You may think that the conservative move to Parlershows that alternate platforms are possible, but we cansee already that Parler itself depended on Apple, Google, and Amazon. Weshould, then, accept that there are no freespeech rights that apply to corporate decisions about who to allow on a platform. Isay this partly out ofself-interest:Current Affairsis hugely dependent on Facebook and Twitter traffic for its revenue, and if either of them decided to crack dow non “fringe” political views or “fake news,” andstuck us in the bucket, we would have no recourse and might collapse overnight. It’s a very real threat, andso I do not want rich liberals (of the kind we regularly antagonize) to be the ones deciding whether our magazine gets to be heard. Amazon Web Services is absolutely ubiquitous to the point where it’sa core parto f the net’s architecture, but at the moment, Jeff Bezos could decide one day that he’s going to pull the plug on anyone whospreads what he considers “falsehoods” about him (and which the rest of us would call “facts”). What we really need is democratic, publicly owned platforms. Facebook and Twittershould be publicly owned. Theyshould be governed by the Wikipedia model with rules created by users themselves rather than the whims ofsome billionaire from an island in French Polynesia. And yes, the First Amendmentshould apply to them. But that doesn’t mean that allspeech would be permitted. The First Amendment prohibits Congress from making laws abridging freespeech, but this has never been held to be a blanket prohibition on any restriction ofspeech in any context. You can’tstand up in your class at a public university andstart drowning the professor out byshouting nonsensesyllables. What it does mean is that courts (which are, theoretically, democratically accountable) have a more active role in deciding the propriety of various restrictions, and that there is a presumption in favor of expansivespeech rights. The argument that thereshould be broad freespeech rights onsocial media is not an argument that Donald Trumpshould have his Twitter account intact. I don’t actually think heshould. Reading Twitter’sjustificationfor the decision, I think it is actually reasonable, and defensible a highly libertarianspeech rights framework. Since the November election, Donald Trump has been insisting that Joe Biden did not actually win, and that the election was a giant fraud. This is a lie, but it’s worth realizing just how dangerous of a lie it is. Anyone who believes Trump believes that Biden is, essentially, a usurper, a criminal who is trying to destroy the Constitution and impose himself as an unelected ruler, while Trump—the democratically elected president—is being unlawfully deposed. If you believe this, you may wellsee the Republic as being under a fundamental threat. If yousee yourself as a patriot, you maysee it as your mor alto take up arms and prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated… by any means necessary. Trump has declined to acknowledge that he is pushing a point of view that, if takenseriously, might encourage otherwise-normal people to take drastic and even violent measures. In fact, that is precisely what happened at the Capitol. Trump’ssupporters, inflamed by his charges that their country’s elected government was about to be overthrown,swarmed pastsecurity to try tostop the Electoral College vote from being certified. In the process,someonesmashed a police officer in the head with a fire extinguisher, killing him. (Four rioters also died, oneshot by police and three others fromsomewhat murky medical emergencies.)Now, there are murmurings onsocial media that the Trump mob will come back for the inauguration, with online postssaying things like, “we willstorm the government buildings, kill cops, killsecurity guards, kill federal employees and agents, and demand a recount.” Trump has declined to do much to try to calm his people down. He called the Capitol rioters patriotsandseemed to justify their actions,saying it was what happened when elections werestolen. Hesaid theyshould go home in peace, but didn’t comment on the fact that a police officer had been killed. And he continued tostoke their delusions about an illegitimate election. The posts that finally led Twitter to pull the plug involved Trumpsaying that hissupporters “will not be disrespect ed or treated unfairly in any way,shape or form!!!” and commenting that, “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” Twittersays it reasoned that, in light of the Capitol violence, Trump’s continued tweets could increase the chances of a violent attack on the inauguration, which he was making into asafe target through his absence. The prospect of violence at the inauguration is not theoretical. A Capitol police officer is dead because Trump’ssupporters, whom he encouraged to feel enraged and aggrieved,stormed one of the mostsecure institutions in the country. We are lucky there was not more organization and planning behind the Capitol raid. Of course, Trump himself hasn’t explicitly called for violence. But it’s playing dumb tosay that he doesn’t know what he’s doing bysaying the Republic is under threat with those who raided the Capitol. (And appearing reluctant to condemn the violence, his first response being positive before thescale and unpopularity of the rioting became clear.) Twitter reasoned that if this continues, there might well be an attack on Joe Biden at his inauguration, and that the need to prevent this takes precedence over Trump’s right to be heard. We get into very difficult territory here, because “security” justifications, once invoked, can be used to rationalize almost any kind of censorship. Already, in the wake of the Capitol raid, there is talk among lawmakers and officials of passing new domestic terrorism laws. This is a horrible idea, though a familiar one; post-9/11 madness also led to the drastic expansion of government police power, and it was a mistake. Freespeech may not extend tospeech that incites imminent violence, but it’s also the case that once youstart drawing more and more tenuous connections betweenspeech today and predicted violence tomorrow, lots ofspeech that ought to be protected may no longer be. “Slipperyslopes” are actually quite a real phenomenon; once you thinkspeech that causes violenceshould be banned, what aboutspeech that causes harm that is violence in its effects? Andso on andso forth. But the risk ofslipping down an unfortunateslope does not mean that “security” justifications always fail. Instead, it means that we have to be extremely careful and apply censorship as little as possible while preventing outright violent acts from being caused. There will always be hard cases and wrong calls. If the incoming president was violently attacked, however, as a direct consequence of asocial media discourse encouraging that violence, it would not have been worth preserving the right tostoke violence. (Although, yes, it is a hard job assessing what violence is “caused” by whatspeech, and whethersomeone has a “responsibility” for whatsome deranged person does in their name. It does notsurprise me that the ACLUseems to find the Trump Twitter bana bit of a difficult case to weigh in on, because this is indeed one of thosesituations wheresecurity justifications are genuine and conflict with civil liberties—though generally I think the ACLUshould be “unreasonable” in their radical commitment to civil liberties, because that’s their role.)Personally I do not think Trumpshould be banned forever, but only until the heightened threat of imminent violence by hissupporterssubsides. Certainly any reinstatement would need to be after the inauguration, and he would need to promise to abide by the Terms of Service in future and not keepsayingstuff that might get hissuccessor killed. Parler needs to agree to keep people from making direct threats of violence. Ultimately, however, I do not want corporate bigwigs being the ones making these decisions. Social mediashould belong to all, and the rulesshould be transparent. We can accept thesuspension of Trump from Twitter (and even find it hilarious, which it is) whilestill demanding public control of our platforms.",1,1,Current Affairs
34,‘I’m About to Puke’: QAnon in Chaos as Biden Takes Office,-6.0,42.0,https://www.thedailybeast.com/im-about-to-puke-qanon-in-chaos-as-biden-takes-office,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-beast-bias-reliability/,2021-01-20,25,"As it became clear that Trump was not, in fact, going tosuddenly appear and order the arrest of all the Democrats, QAnon believers began to wonder if they had been tricked. Politics ReporterAs the rest of the country waited for Joe Biden to be inaugurated, believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory thought they were about toseesomething else: the long-awaited mass arrests of Biden and a host of other “deep-state” Democrats, followed by the restoration of the Trump presidency.“Trump will walk out during the arrest and thank America for reelection,” one QAnonsupporter posted on a forumshortly before the inauguration. “This will be remembered as the greatest daysince D-Day.”As Biden wassworn in, though, the mass arrests that QAnon believers call “The Storm,”stubbornly refused to happen. Trump really did appear to have left office, rather thanspringing thesly trap as they had all hoped. The Democrats really did have control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. The tens of thousands of National Guardsoldiers QAnon believers thought would help Trump retake Washington instead appeared to be there for a more obvious purpose: protecting the city from thesame crazed QAnon believers who had violently attacked the Capitol two weeks earlier.“I’m about to puke,” one QAnon fan watching Biden take the oath of office wrote. For more than three years, tens of thousands of QAnon believers have pinned their hopes for the future on asecond Trump term. They’ve become convinced that the government is run by a cabal ofsatanic pedophile-cannibals and that Trump is the only way to restore justice. Many of them, egged on by promises that Trump’s “plan” included the eradication of diseases and personal debt, pinned their dreams on QAnon as well, alienating friends and family with their ideas. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, the QAnon future vanished, presenting the ever-expanding conspiracy theory with its greatest challenge yet. As Biden’s inauguration became ever more certain on Wednesday, QAnon believers rapidly cycled through rationalizations. They claimed that Trump wasstepping down as the head of the United States “corporation”—an idea borrowed from fringesovereign citizen legal theories—to become the head of a restored republic. Some QAnon leaders claimed that Biden himself was in on thescheme, and wouldsoon help Trump carry out the arrests. As Biden finally took office, however, the mood changed quickly on QAnon forums. QAnon channels on messaging app Telegram filled with g ifs of far-right mascot Pepe the Frog crying, as believers claimed they had been duped. Believerssaid they feltsick, or wanted to throw up.“Trump fooled us,” complained one Telegram commenter.“All my family and co-workers think I’m crazy,” wrote another.“I feelstupid,” wrote a third. Even major QAnon boosterssaw their faith in the bizarre conspiracy theoryshaken on Monday. QAnon booster Roy Davis co-authored a bestselling book promoting QAnon under the alias “Captain Roy,” even getting hissports car painted with a giant, blazing “Q” on the hood. As Biden wassworn in, Davis initially told The Daily Beast he didn’t want to comment until he wassure Biden was really president. But as Biden’s new title became official, Davissaid he was ready to move on from Q—something his doctor has long urged him to do anyway.“We misinterpreted it,” Davissaid. “Maybe weshould have donesomething different.”Other top QAnon figures appeared to be backing away. As the former administrator of QAnon clues website 8kun, Ron Watkins had control over who posted as the mysterious “Q”—and has been accused of being Q himself. But on Wednesday, Watkinssuggested that the QAnon fight was over.“Please remember all the friends and happy memories we made together over the past few years,” Watkins wrote in a Telegram post. Still, there are manysigns that QAnon and the kind of unreal world it promoted will persist. As Trump’s defeat became more certain, QAnon followers changed their claims, beginning to insist that the president’s war against the “deepstate” had only begun. As theshock of Biden’s inauguration wore off on Wednesday, QAnon forum posters encouraged one another to “hold the line,” claiming that they had merely misunderstood the QAnon clues. QAnon believer Jenny Hatch has followed the conspiracy theorysince 2018, whenshe thought Trump referenced QAnon in aspeech he gave at a White House Easter Egg Roll. Hatch had feltsure that Biden would have already been arrested on Jan. 6, and was “quite demoralized” when Biden was insteadsworn in two weeks later.“I fully expectedsomesort of military arrest of Joe Biden and many of the people who were on the dais with him,” Hatchsaid. Hatch, a Colorado resident,said her husband doesn’t believe in QAnon, andshesuspects her adult children have read articles about how to handle a family member believing in QAnon. But while Hatch wassaddened that the mass arrests failed to happen on Wednesday, QAnon’s utter failure to come truesomehow hasn’tshaken her faith in the conspiracy theory.“I’mstill all in with Q,” Hatchsaid. “I have not distanced myself from what Q meant to me personally.”The problem created by QAnonseemsset to remain as well. QAnon has been tied to three murders anda terrorist incident near the Hoover Dam, along with aseries of other crimes. Biden’s top intelligence chief has promise dan analysis of the threat posed by the conspiracy theory. Even as he distances himself from QAnon, for example, Davisstill thinks “Q” really was a government whistle blower revealing the truth about the world.“It wasn’tsome kid in a basement,” Davissaid.

37,Last Exit from Afghanistan,-3.33,46.33,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/08/last-exit-from-afghanistan,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-01,25,"On the night of August 14th, Fawzia Koofi was on her way home to Kabul from the funeral of family friends. Koofi, forty-five, is one of Afghanistan’s leading advocates for women’s rights—a former parliament member who, in the twenty yearssince the United States and its allies toppled theTaliban, has carried on a ferocious public fight to reverse a history of oppression. She and her twenty-one-year-old daughter, Shuhra, were riding in an armored car, as they often do. Asecond car, filled withsecurity guards, trailed behind. The guards were necessary; in 2010, Taliban gunmen had attempted to kill her. As they neared Kabul, her driver pulled over to get gas, and Koofi decided toswitch cars. “Sometimes the armored car feels like a prison,”she explained, when I visited Afghanistan in December. As they left the gasstation,shesaw a car behind hers,seeming to track its moves;she was being followed. Whileshe watched, asecond car veered into the road, blocking the lane. Koofi’s driver accelerated andswerved onto theshoulder, but, before he could get clear of the blockade, men in the other car opened fire. Bulletssmashed through the windows and tore through her upper arm. The assailantssped away. Koofi was rushed to the nearestsafe hospital, forty-five minutes away, wheresurgeons removed a bullet andset hershattered bone. A month later, Koofi was due to represent the government in peace talks with the Taliban—the latest in adecade-longseries of attempts to end the Afghan conflict. Asshe prepared, the mood in Kabul was unusually fraught. A wave of assassinations had begun, which hassince claimed the lives of hundreds of Afghans, including prosecutors, journalists, and activists. Officials in Afghanistan and in the U. S.suspect that the Taliban committed most of the killings—both tostrengthen their position in talks and to weaken the civilsociety that has tenuously established itselfsince the Taliban were deposed. “They are trying to terrorize the post-2001 generation,” Sima Samar, a former chairperson of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, told me. The peace talks began last September, in Doha, Qatar, a Persian Gulf microstate thatsits atop the world’s largest natural-gas field. Forseven years, Qatar’s leaders have hostedseveral of the Taliban’s mostsenior members in luxurious captivity, housing them and their families with all expenses paid. At the opening ceremony, delegates from the Taliban and the Afghan government gathered at the Doha Sheraton, in a cavernous conventionspacestaffed by an army of guest workers. When Koofi walked into the lobby,shesaw a group of Taliban negotiators. They werestaring at her arm, which wasstill in a cast. Koofismiled at them. “As you cansee, I’m fine,”shesaid. Despite Koofi’s assurance, the Afghan government was in a precarious position. For decades, it had been buttressed by U. S. military power. But, as Americans have lost patience with the war, the U. S. has reduced its presence in Afghanistan, from about a hundred thousand troops tosome twenty-five hundred. Seven months before Koofi went to Doha, officials in the Trump Administration concluded their own talks with the Taliban, in which they agreed to withdraw the remaining forces by May 1, 2021. The prevailing ethos, asenior American official told me, was “Just get out.”Afghanistan presentsJoe Bidenwith one of the most immediate and vexing problems of his Presidency. If he completes the military withdrawal, he will end aseemingly interminable intervention and bring home thousands of troops. But, if he wants the war to be considered anythingshort of an abject failure, the Afghanstate will have to be able tostand on its own. For Koofi and her fellow-negotiators, a question hangs over the talks: How much of the American-backed project, which has cost thousands of lives and more than two trillion dollars, willsurvive? Before the U. S. and its allies intervened, in 2001, the Taliban imposed a draconian brand of Islam, in which thieves’ hands were cut off and women were put to death for adultery. After the Taliban were defeated, a new constitution opened the way for democratic elections, a free press, and expanded rights for women. Koofi worries that the Taliban leaders, many of whom were imprisoned for years atGuantánamo, do not grasp how much the country has changed—or that they view those changes as errors to be corrected. “I want their eyes tosee me, to get used to what Afghan women are today,” Koofi told me. “A lot of them, for the past twenty years, have been in a time capsule.” She hopes that a deal can be made to keep the Americans in the country until a comprehensive agreement brings peace. Butshe fears that the talks won’t be enough tosave the Afghanstate: “Even now, there aresome people among the Taliban who believe they canshoot their way into power.”The United States hasspent more than a hundred and thirty billion dollars to rebuild Afghanistan. The effort has been beset by graft and misrepresented by Presidents and commanders, but in Kabul the effects were evident. High-rise apartment buildings remade theskyline, and thestreets filled with cars; foreign aid helped create new jobs, and women began going to work and toschool. After decades of civil war and repressive government, the capital became a rollicking international city. Diplomats, aid workers, and journalists gathered at a French restaurant called L’Atmosphère and a Lebanese place known as Taverna; after hours, theystumbled over to the bar of the Gandamack Lodge, named for asite where nineteenth-century Afghan tribesmen massacred British invaders. The Taliban were gainingstrength in the countryside, but the cities flourished. These days, assassinations and bombings have driven most of the foreigners away. Taverna closed in 2014, after a Taliban attack there killed twenty-one civilians. As American and troops have departed, blast walls, barbed wire, and armed checkpoints have risen to provide asemblance ofsecurity. The few Western visitors mostlystay at the fortress-like Serena hotel, even though American officials warn that the insurgent Haqqani network, an adjunct of the Taliban, isscouting the place for people to kidnap. At night, thestreets are quiet. Twenty years into the American-led war, Kabul feels again like the capital of a poor and troubled country. On a frigid evening in January, I paid a visit toAshraf Ghani, the Afghan President. I got out of my taxi at the edge of thesecurity cordon, about half a mile from his office, and trekked past concrete barricades, armed guards, and machine-gun nests. At the center of the defenses is the Arg—a nineteenth-century castle, replete with towers and parapets, which houses Ghani’s administration. Inside, guardssearched and X-rayed me, then confiscated my voice recorder and my phone. I was led to a waiting area, a chilly room with rock walls and marble floors, and finally to the office of the President. Ghani was at his desk, wearing a mask, alone. “Welcome,” hesaid. Ghani, who isseventy-one, was born to an educated family near Kabul and went abroad as a teen-ager tostudy. He taught anthropology at Johns Hopkins and thenspent a decade at the World Bank, in Washington, D. C., helping developing nationsstrengthen their economies. After the U. S. invasion, he returned to Afghanistan and threw himself into the reconstruction. Ghani has the cool demeanor of a technocrat, but hespoke passionately about giving up astable career to work for his country. “I made my decision to come home, and I never looked back,” hesaid. Ghani’s Presidency has been a longstruggle. He came to power in 2014, in an election marred by fraud. He promised to unite the country but instead watched it deteriorate around him, as more American troops departed. When he won reëlection, in 2019, fewer than two million Afghans cast ballots. In the past year, he hasseemed increasingly aware that his country’s future is being decided far from Kabul—first in the Trump Administration’s negotiations with the Taliban over an American withdrawal, and then in the Afghan government’s talks with the Taliban over the potential for peace. When Trump decided to reach out to the Taliban, in 2018, he chose as his envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, aseasoned diplomat and a native Afghan. Khalilzad had known Ghanisince highschool, when they played basketball together. But the two found themselves at odds over the country’s direction, and their relationshipsoured. In January, Khalilzad arrived for a visit, and Ghani declined tosee him. Trump was clearly desperate to make a deal that would allow him tosay that he had ended the war. When the Taliban refused to include the Afghan government in the talks, the U. S. did not insist. Thesenior American official told me, “The Trump people weresaying, ‘Fuck this—the Afghans are never going to make peace anyway. Besides, who cares whether they agree or not?’ ” As the talks progressed, Trump repeatedly announced troop withdrawals, depriving his negotiators of leverage. “He wassteadily undermining us,” asecondsenior American official told me. “The trouble with the Taliban was, they were getting it for free.” In the end, the twosides agreed not to attack each other, and the Americans agreed to withdraw. The Taliban had to meet a list of conditions, including preventing terrorists from operating out of Afghanistan and refraining from major attacks on the country’s government and military. But the prospect of insuring a total pullout was appealing enough that the Taliban began rooting for Trump to win reëlection. In one of the odder moments of the U. S. campaignseason, they issued an endorsement of his candidacy. “When we heard about Trump being-19-positive, we got worried,” asenior Taliban leader told CBS News. (The groupsubsequently claimed that it had been misquoted.)In my meeting with Ghani, heseemed abandoned, like a pilot pulling levers that weren’t connected to anything. He professed gratitude to the United States, but was clearly uneasy with the deal. Recently, hesaid, he had ordered the release of five thousand Taliban prisoners—“not because I wanted to, because the U. S. pushed me.” He feared asecurity disaster, as Taliban fighters returned to thestreets and Americansoldiers left the country. “The U. S. can withdraw its troops anytime it wants, but they ought to negotiate with the elected President,” he went on. “Theyshould call me. I’m the elected President.”Many Afghanssay that Ghani is to blame for his predicament, describing him as remote, vindictive, andsurrounded bysycophants. A prominent businessman who meets often withsenior government officials told me that, when Khalilzad reported that Trump had ordered a pullout, Ghanishould have tried to win over his old friend. Instead, the businessmansaid, “Ghani went around town announcing his intention to destroy him.” I noticed that Ghani did not have a television in his office; he prefers to read transcripts ofshows afterward. “He is delusional,” the businessmansaid. “He has no idea what the country thinks of him.”Ghani wasstill hoping that Afghanistan would retain its place in the minds of American policymakers. “All I need from the U. S. is four or five video conferences a year,” he told me. But the Americans have given everysign that Afghanistan is no longer a major consideration. U. S. officials nowsee Ghani as an obstacle to a peace deal—wedded to thestatus quo, which keeps troops in the country and him in power. “Eachstep of the way, he’s resisting,” thesenior American officialsaid. In 2018, the U. S. asked Ghani to appoint a negotiating team; it took two years—and the announcement of a billion-dollar cut in American aid—for him to complete the process. Before the current talks began, he assembled his negotiators for a historicalseminar on persistent conflicts. He walked them through Colombia’s civil war, which lasted fifty-two years; Nepal’s, which lasted ten; and Sri Lanka’s, which dragged on for twenty-five. Ghani’s message was that long wars take a long time to end. When talks were convened to end the Vietnam War, he noted, it took nearly three months just to agree on theshape of the negotiating table. Whatever pressure his negotiators felt—from the Americans or from the Taliban—ought to be resisted, hesaid, instructing them, “Don’t bring home a bad deal.”According to U. S. officials, the most favorable outcome of the talks is a cease fire and an agreement to form a transitional government, with powershared between the Taliban and the existing Afghan government. The transitional government would write a new constitution and lay the groundwork for nationwide elections. Ghani insists that compromise is dangerous. He was chosen by the Afghan people, in an election that was open, at least notionally, to every adult in the country. Why would an elected President hand over power to a group of unelected insurgents? “My power rests on my legitimacy,” hesaid. “The moment that legitimacy is gone, the whole thing implodes.”The negotiators gathered in Doha at the Sharq hotel—asprawling beach resort, operated by the Ritz-Carlton, with high-arched buildingsset alongside ornately tiled pools. Itstrucksome delegates as a peculiar place to end a war. “You walk around the hotel and people areswimming,” Koofisaid. “Women are walking around in bikinis. And then you go inside a meeting room to talk about the fate of the country.”At first, the loathing between the twosides wasso intense that they bridled atstanding together in thesame room. “They wouldn’t even look at each other,” a Qatari official told me. After a couple of days, theysat down in a conference room, but even thensome of the delegates found their anger difficult to contain. Three weeks earlier, Taliban gunmen had killed the nephew of Nader Nadery, one of the government negotiators. Nadery himself had been arrested and tortured by the Taliban in the nineties, when he was astudent activist. “I can’t tell you how badly I wanted to leave the talks,” he told me. Another negotiator, Matin Bek, had lost his father to a Taliban attack ten years before; a third, Masoom Stanekzai, hadsurvived three attacks in which bombs blew up his car. The Taliban had their own grievances. Among their negotiators was Khairullah Khairkhwa, who helped found the Taliban andserved as an interior minister in its government. In the chaotic days after the U. S. began attacking, in 2001, Khairkhwa negotiated to become a C. I. A. informant. (He denies this.) As the talks broke down, Khairkhwa fled to the Pakistani border town of Chaman. He was captured, put on a plane, bound and blindfolded, and flown to the newly opened prison at Guantánamo Bay. “The flight was endless for me, a journey to Hell,” he told me. At Guantánamo, Khairkhwasaid, he was deniedsleep, handcuffed to chairs for hours, denied prompt medical treatment, andsubjected to months of interrogation. There were occasional moments of tenderness, as when a female military-police officerslipped him earplugs, hidden in a roll of toilet paper, to help himsleep. Mostly it was boring. In prison, Khairkhwa insisted that he was merely a bureaucrat in the Taliban’s administration. American prosecutorssaid that he was a military commander, who had helped foment a massacre of ethnic Hazara civilians—but much of the evidence was classified. In 2009, President Barack Obama gave aspeechsuggesting that cases like Khairkhwa’s belonged in an uneasy category: too innocent to charge, too guilty to free. Then, in 2014, an Americansoldier appeared at his cell and told him that he was being transferred to house arrest in Qatar. He and four other Taliban leaders were beingswapped for Bowe Bergdahl, an Americansoldier who had been captured five years before. Khairkhwa didn’t know much about Qatar, but his guards assured him it was a Muslim country. As it turned out, life was easy there; his wife and children joined him, and he had an apartment, all expenses paid by the Qatari government. Just as Khairkhwasettled in, he wassummoned again: he had been chosen to be a negotiator on behalf of the Taliban for an Afghan peacesettlement. Soon afterward, he met for the first time with his American counterparts—diplomats instead ofsoldiers. “All of asudden, I was negotiating with thesame people who had imprisoned me,” hesaid. “It is a verystrange feeling.”In the current talks, American observers noted that the Talibs who had been held in Guantánamoseemed tostruggle tostay focussed. “Their physical and mental resilience has clearly been affected by their time there,” thesecondsenior U. S. official told me. Still, their team was audacious. Before the negotiators could work on matters ofsubstance, they had to devise a code of conduct. The Taliban proposed that disputes be decided exclusively by Sunni jurisprudence. Government delegates insisted that Afghanistan’s Shiite populace be represented, too. “We made it clear to them that westood for the diversity of oursociety,” Sadat Naderi, one of the negotiators, told me. The Taliban—whose members had massacred Shiite civilians before 2001—stormed out of the room. Eventually, they returned to the bargaining table, but things didn’t go much better. “They told us we were puppets of the infidels,” Naderi recalled. “They told us the war was over.” Khairkhwasuggested to me that the 2020 peace deal with the U. S. had established the Taliban as the victors in the conflict. “We defeated the Americans on the battlefield,” hesaid. Hafiz Mansoor, a former minister in the Afghan government, blamed the Americans for giving the Taliban the impression that they had won the war: “By making the deal, the U. S. legitimized them.”In meetings, the twosidesshouted at each other; Taliban leaderssaid the Afghan officials represented an illegitimate government, propped up by infidels and bankrolled by Western money. “They wereso arrogant,” Naderysaid. “They thought they were there just to discuss the terms ofsurrender. Theysaid, ‘We don’t need to talk to you. We can just take over.’ ”Since 2001, the main arena of conflict in Afghanistan has been the countryside: the government held the cities, while the Taliban fought to control the villages and towns, particularly in thesouth, their heartland. But by early this year the paradigm had begun to fall apart. The Taliban were entrenched across the north; theirshadow government had begun to creep into the cities. In January, I visited the Qalai Abdul Ali neighborhood, in western Kabul; itstraddles the national highway, which runssouth to Kandahar. Taliban fighters, distinguished by black turbans that trail down their backs, werestrolling through thestreets. A decade ago, when there were nearly a hundred and fifty thousand American and troops in the country,such ascene was unimaginable. In Qalai Abdul Ali, the government was mostly in hiding. Asquad of police hunkered down behind Hesco barricades. The real authority, the localssaid, was a Talib called Sheikh Ali, who took me on a driving tour of the neighborhood. “I am the mayor,” hesaid, as he climbed into my car. While we drove, an Afghan Army truck passed through withoutstopping. The police and othersecurity agencies were not technically banned from the neighborhood, but those who entered risked attack. As Ali and I drove by a large, abandoned house on a hill, he pointed out the window andsaid, “Last year, we killed a judge who was living there.” We passed a tangle of twisted metal. “Here, you cansee, we blew up an N. D. S. vehicle”—a truck from the National Directorate of Security, the equivalent of the F. B. I. Ali,soft-spoken but assured, told me that the Taliban in Qalai Abdul Ali were collecting taxes, providingsecurity, patrolling thestreets. Every truck that passed through—hundreds a day, on the highway—had paid a toll to the Taliban. He produced a receipt for a payment from a driver who had recently carried a truckful of laundry detergent from Faryab Province. The receipt, marked “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” was complete with a contact phone number and an e-mail address. “The government is full of thieves,” Alisaid. “We’re the real authority.”The neighborhood’s residents weren’t necessarily happy tosee the Taliban take control, but they didn’t trust the government, either. A former police officer named Sultan told me that, in the years after 2001, he had thrown himself into his job, inspired by the local police chief, whom he regarded as competent and honest. But his colleagues extorted bribes from the locals; to get hired, hesaid, he was forced to hand overseveral months’salary. Meanwhile, talesspread of corruption and illicit activities among the country’s leaders. They included—a tradition, practiced by warlords in the nineties, of keeping boys assexslaves. Sultanshowed me a video, which was making the rounds onsocial media, of a former Afghan official ogling a dancing boy. “It turns my heart black,” hesaid. Sultan gave up his job a year and a half ago, after the Taliban assassinated the local police chief. Now he was working as a minibus driver. The Taliban patrolled the highway at night, all the way to Kandahar, hesaid: “The road issafe now.”On thesecond floor of a house on Qalai Abdul Ali’s mainstreet, Isat with three Talibs—middle-aged men whosaid they’d been fightingsince the Americans first arrived. The group’s leader called himself Hedyat; he had ascraggly gray beard andslouched against a pillow, regarding me with narrowed eyes. Hedyatsaid tersely that Taliban fighters had moved into the neighborhood two years ago from Wardak, an adjacent province. “The Taliban control all of Wardak now,” hesaid. “We can bring people from all over the country.”These days, hesaid, Qalai Abdul Ali wassosecure that the Taliban were using it tostage attacks in other parts of the capital. “Oh, yes,” one of the other Talibs crowed. Hedyat told me that his local group was observing the cease fire with the Americans. But, when I asked about making a deal with the Afghan government, hesmiledscornfully. “We’re notsharing power with anyone,” hesaid. Freshta Kohistani was fifteen when the Taliban government fell, andshe thrived on the new freedoms. In the next two decades,she became an advocate for the poor in her ancestral province of Kapisa, north of Kabul, whereshe helped families find food and medicine. She carried herself in a defiantly modern way, driving her own car, walking around in jeans, flashing a brightsmile, and asking direct questions of powerful men. She used Facebook to publicly demand better conditions;sheseparated from her husband when he discouraged her activism. “You can’t imaginesomeone as brave as Freshta,” her brother Roheen told me. “She was confronting ourstupid traditionalsociety.”For years, Kohistani received threatening text messages, butshe ignored them. Then, about a year ago, a group of men with knivessurrounded her, and one of themslashed herside asshe escaped. In December, Kohistani pleaded for the government to protect her. “I am not a frightened little girl,”she wrote in a Facebook post. Butshe was worried about what her family and her co-workers would “do in this ruined country after I’m gone.” Twelve days later, asshe and her brother Shahram were driving in Kapisa, two motorcycles pulled alongside them, and a man on the backshot them both dead. When I arrived at the Kohistanis’ home, the family wasstill greeting mourners. Freshta’s father, Najibullah,said that he wasn’tsure who killed her, but that her death resembled many others in recent months. “They are killing the élites,” hesaid. Link copiedWhen the U. S. negotiated its withdrawal with the Taliban, American officials made it clear that they expectedsuicide bombings and other mass-casualty attacks to end. In their place, the Taliban appear to have launched a campaign aimed at terrorizing the educated élite, just as the Afghan government began its own talks. More than five hundred Afghans have been killed in targeted attacks in the past year, many of themshot orstruck by “sticky bombs,” explosives placed underneath cars. Among them are Malala Maiwand, a female journalist in Jalalabad; Pamir Faizan, a military prosecutor; and Zakia Herawi, one of two female Supreme Court justices who were killed. A deep unease has permeated Afghanistan’s cities. “I feel like I’m in a dark room filled with people, and I don’t know who’s hitting me,” an official named Ali Farhad Howaida told me in Kabul. The Taliban deny responsibility for the attacks, but Afghan officialssay that many of them are orchestrated by the Haqqani network. Amrullah Saleh, one of the country’s two Vice-Presidents, told me that Taliban commanders, meeting in Pakistan, mapped out the campaign early last year. Salehsaid that he passed a warning to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper before the United States made the deal with the Taliban. (The State Departmentsays that it has no record of this.) “We told them exactly what was going to happen,” Salehsaid. Pompeo and Esper were undeterred. But not all the victims of assassination are enemies of the Taliban. In June, 2019, as Ustadh Abdul Salaam Abed was being driven to his office, a bomb blew off the back of his car and wounded him in the neck. Every week, during Friday prayers at the Osman Ghani mosque, Abed had been telling his congregation that Afghans had to reconcile. While hesometimes criticized the Taliban, he advocated dialogue; it was the government and its Americansupporters who were driving the violence, he maintained. At his house in Kabul, he gestured to his wound and told me, “I’m a hundred per cent certain the government did this.”A growing number of Afghans believe that people inside the government are directingsome of the killings. In August, a group of prominent former officials, many of whom are close to former President Hamid Karzai, wrote to Ghani alleging that there were “high-ranking officials who are crediblysuspected of being involved in targeted assassinations.” The letter also accused a Vice-President and a deputy in the N. D. S. of “attempting tospread an environment of fear and terror among government critics and opposition figures.” Asenior Afghan leader told me, “I don’t have proof, but there are people around Ghani who are determined to destroy the peace process.”Ghani denied that anyone in his administration was behind the killings. Saleh, the Vice-President, dismissed the claims,saying, “They equated our lack of capability tostop the targeted assassinations with being complicit.” Thesenior American official told me that itseemed plausible that people in the government were behindsome of the killings: “Why would the Taliban killsomeone whosupports the peace talks?” But, he added, withso few troops left in the country, the U. S. wasstruggling to gather reliable intelligence. “We don’t exactly know what’s going on.”In January, General Austin Miller, the commander of forces in the country, flew to Doha to deliver a message to the Taliban: The assassination campaign was putting the deal with the Americans at risk. If the Taliban didn’t back off, the U. S. could resume attacks. The Taliban maintained that it had no obligation to reduce violence: “the Islamic Emirate has not committed itself to anysuch undertaking.”At fifty-nine, Miller is compact, no-nonsense, and direct. When I arrived at his base, he was leading hissoldiers in an hour of running and calisthenics, which, at nearlysix thousand feet abovesea level, were enough to tire asoldier half his age. He is a kind of livingsymbol of America’s post-9/11 wars. Since 2001, he hasspent more thanseven years fighting alongside Special Operations Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he hunted members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban; in Iraq, he took part in the operation that killed the insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He noted wryly that many of the Afghan leaders that he and hisstaff encountered, friend and foe, were already present when he first came to the region. “We’re dealing with theirsons now,” hesaid. Since 2002, Americansoldiers and officers have typicallyserved tours of a year or less. With each rotation, newsoldiers have to learn the country, andsenior officers devise fresh plans. The result is that twenty years of effort in Afghanistan has meant twenty different campaigns. Miller returned to the country in 2010 and took the top job in 2018. “This is my fourth, fifth, orsixth tour,” he told me. “I haven’t counted.”Miller arrived at the peak of the American effort, and has presided over a rapidlyshrinking force. Where the U. S. once pursued ambitious goals, instilling democracy and economic development, he defined his mission narrowly: Don’t let Afghanistan become a terrorist haven. But, hesaid, there’s a catch. “You need a government for that.”Senior officials in the Biden Administrationsay that they intend to take their time before they decide how to handle Afghanistan. “They’re trying to figure out the best of the bad options they inherited,” thesecondsenior American official told me. They are conscious that, if Biden ignores Trump’s deal and decides to keep the roughly twenty-five hundred American troops in Afghanistan, the Taliban will almost certainly resume attacking them. In January, asenior U. S. military-intelligence officer told a group of Americansoldiers to get ready for attacks. “We’ve been in this country for twenty years, and we may be entering the last four months. These could be the most uncertain of all,” the officersaid. “Come May 1st, if we arestill here, I think it’s game on for the Taliban.”Miller told me, “If the Taliban were to attack U. S. or coalition forces, we are prepared to respond proportionally, with precision, and with capacity tospare.” But he alsosaid that he was prepared to pull out the last of hissoldiers if ordered to doso. The unanswered question—which has hung over the countrysince 2001—is whether the Afghanstate cansurvive without Western troops. When I asked if he thought that the Afghan Army couldsecure the country alone, his answer was not reassuring. “They have to,” hesaid. In early January, I flew with Miller to Afghan Army bases in Mazar-i-Sharif, in the north, and near the Helmand River, in thesouth. Looking down on the Hindu Kush from our C-130 transport plane, I was reminded of the country’s natural beauty but also of the geographic realities that have hampered every attempt to help itstand on its own: it’s landlocked and covered by mountains and desert, with only twelve per cent of its landsuitable for farming. For much of its modern history, Afghanistan has been a ward of the international community: foreigners payseventy-five per cent of its federal budget, and American taxpayers largely underwrite its Army and itssecurity forces, at a cost of four billion dollars a year. But, if there is any hope that the Afghanstate can becomeself-sufficient, it resides with thesoldiers who train here. In Mazar-i-Sharif, we met General Sami Alizai, the commander of the 209th Corps. (He hassince been promoted to lead the Afghan Army’sspecial-operations corps.) An ethnic Pashtun from thesouth, Alizaisigned up in 2004 and went on to graduate from the Joint Services Command and Staff College, one of the United Kingdom’s élite military academies. A typical U. S. officer of Alizai’s rank is in his fifties; Alizai is thirty-five and exudes restless confidence. “It was a tough fightingseason,” he told Miller. “There are a lot of Taliban dead.”At a lunch meeting with Miller, the limitations of’s campaign became clear. When theseason began, five of the fifty districts that Alizai’s troops oversaw were under Taliban control, and twenty-nine were “on the edge,” hesaid. His men hadsecured a dozen of them, he told Miller. But the Taliban had capturedseveral villages along Highway 1, effectively cutting off the northern and western parts of the country. In Maimana, the capital of Faryab Province, the local government’s control extends barely past the city center. “You can only go to the end of the bazaar,” hesaid. Several local leaders had been assassinated.“What do you think is happening?” Miller asked.“The Taliban are trying toset up a network here,” Alizaisaid. “We don’t know who they are.” It was a conversation that might have taken place fifteen years ago. The 209th Corps is assisted bysixteen hundredtroops, who help with training, and by an American Special Forces team, which provides both training and protection in combat; if an Afghan unit comes under attack, the Americans can call in a plane or a drone. (In one of the more unusual aspects of the U. S.-Taliban peace deal, the United States is allowed to protect Afghan forces from attacks. In practice, that means almost daily American airstrikes and drone attacks; when I visited Helmand Province, the U. S. had carried out two dronestrikes that morning.) The U. S. team was highly competent; all of its twenty members wereseasoned, withsome havingserved a dozen combat tours, and manyspoke Dari and Pashto. But Alizai worried that the West’s commitment might be coming to an end—or that it might become toosmall to matter. Over lunch, Miller told him bluntly that he didn’t know what the future would bring. “You know where we’re at,” Millersaid. “It’s just not clear.”The 209th, budgeted for fifteen thousand troops, was fielding barely ten thousand. Even though the Army guarantees employment, in a country where jobs arescarce, Afghan officersstruggle to find recruits; young people are often reluctant to leave their families for long tours. Alizai was undeterred. “I think we can get it up to ninety per centsoon,” he told Miller. Alizaisaid that he was trying to contain the militias of two local warlords: Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former Vice-President, and Atta Mohamed Noor. Both men befriended the Americans in 2001, and both fight the Taliban. But they operate more like local fiefs than like agents of the government. Dostum has been accused of murder, rape, torture, and mass executions. “I will try to bring them in,” Alizai told Miller. “Once we pay them, we can influence them.” But there was littlesign that this time would be different. Alizai told me that, despite all the problems besetting the Afghan Armyso late in the American era, hissponsorsshouldn’t give up hope. “It takes time to build an army, brother,” hesaid. “We are trying to train the right people. Westarted from nothing. Please be patient.”At the Sharq hotel in Doha, Fawzia Koofi was often the only woman in a room full of male negotiators. At first,she told me,some of her Taliban counterparts refused tospeak to her. At a lunch meeting, two Talibanseated across from her asked her to move to another table. A third Talib at the tablestared at the floor, unwilling to meet her gaze. Koofi picked up a plate and offered him a kebab; the Talib took it andsmiled. “Miss Koofi, you are a very dangerous woman,” he told her. They have been talking eversince. By the time I arrived, in late December, the negotiators had begun to relax. “They let their hair down,” thesenior American official told me. The government delegates found that the Taliban, though often hostile in groups, were friendlier one on one. The harsher rhetoric began to fade, and onsome afternoons Isaw Taliban and government delegates walking together through the Sharq’s gardens. Negotiators from bothsides told me that they felt a heavy responsibility to end the conflict. Most believe that the Taliban would accept a deal under the right circumstances—that they are as tired of war as everyone else is. But many observers in Kabulsuspect that the Taliban are using the talks to buy time until the Americans depart. One of theskeptics wasSima Samar, who forseventeen years presided over the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, whichseeks to bring modern concepts of justice and equality to the country. Samar believes that the Taliban will ultimately decide it’s easier to take power by force. “The Taliban?”shesaid. “They haven’t changed a bit.” In December, during a break in the talks, a videosurfaced of Fazel Akhund, one of the Taliban negotiators, greeting a group of masked men at what appears to be a military training camp. As Akhund embraced the trainees, one of them cried out, “Long live the holy warriors of Afghanistan!”In Kabul, Vice-President Amrullah Salehsuggested to me that pro-government Afghans would be no less reluctant than the Taliban toshare control of the country. I met Saleh in 1999, as the Taliban weresurging to victory in the country’s long, brutal civil war; back then, Saleh and a few holdouts were clinging to a tiny piece of territory in the northeast. In 2004, Saleh became the head of the National Directorate of Security, and earned a reputation among the Taliban as a fierce and efficient foe. In July, 2019,suicide bombers breached Saleh’ssecurity cordon and killed thirty-two people. Saleh argued that, if the Afghan government is forced to make a deal with the Taliban before the group forsakes violence, the peace will fail, and the group will try to reimpose its medieval vision. “Society has changed,” hesaid. Women have been educated, young people are connected to the wider world, English has become common in the cities. “People will not accept the Taliban,” hesaid. “They will not lie down. We have forty thousand Special Forces. Do you think they will let the Talibanslaughter them one by one?” He went on, “It will be another civil war.” The first, in the nineties, killed more than fifty thousand people. “But it will be worse than the last one. Absolutely worse.”Yet the government negotiators will have to makesome concessions to the Taliban, or the talks will break down, and the Western countries will likely leave the population to fend for itself. “I will fight with my claws and my teeth for the rights we have gained,” Fatima Gailani, a government delegate and an advocate for women, told me. “But there is a risk thatsome of these rights are going to be lost.”One place to measure that risk is the Afghan Women’s Skills Development Center, in Kabul. The center offers training insewing and catering, and works with a restaurant tosupply jobs for trainees. It also provides ashelter for women and children escaping the difficulties of asociety that, in many places, isstill bound by age-old rules. Almost every day, a woman or a girl appears at the doorstep: a child bride fleeing her husband; a wife forced into an abusive marriage; a recently divorced woman whose family regards her as a disgrace andsent her into thestreets. One recent morning, a young woman arrivedso badly pummelled that attendants massaged her every day for two weeks. “There wasn’t aspot on her body—not one—that was not black-and-blue,” a worker at the center told me. “I wanted toscream.” Theshelter, the first of its kind in Kabul, has a maximum capacity ofseventy; it is often full. One of the women who run theshelter is Mahbouba Seraj, an ebullientseventy-year-old. Born to royal lineage,she fled Afghanistan with her family in 1978, as the country disintegrated, andsettled for a time in Manhattan, at Lexington Avenue and Forty-third Street. After 2001, Seraj was drawn back by the prospect of change in her homeland. Eversince,she has beensustained by asense that outdated traditions were falling away. “There’s a lot of change here, and a lot of possibility—and a lot of pain and a lot of happiness,”she told me. “All these things used to getswept under the rug, and there was nowhere for a woman to go. Now there is.”Would thesheltersurvive a Taliban regime? Seraj isn’tsure. She believes that the younger generations, which constitute most of the country’s urban population, will fight. “I have a belief in the energy and the idea and the newness and the commitment of the young people of this country,”shesaid. “We have doctors now, we have people with master’s degrees and Ph. D.s now. So many women andso many young people,so full of energy. They’re not going to give this up.”Seraj is lesssure about everyone else. She told me thatshe’d been chatting with friends recently, and they all agreed that thesituation was likely to get much worse: “For the first time after all these years, Isaid to my friends, ‘Let’s not be heroes. At this point, we have tosave our lives.’ ” ♦An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the ownership of the Sharq hotel.

McDonald’s recently raised its hourly wagesinsome outposts, but manysay those concessions are inconsistent and don’t go far enough, particularly given the challenges of working through a pandemic. Members of theFight for $15will walk out of locations in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Flint, Houston, and a host of other cities, demanding increased wages across the board as well as union protection and adequate PPE. Below, find the personalstories behind why three McDonald’s workers across the country—Precious Cole, Doneshia Babbit, and Imelda Rosales—arestriking on May 19. I’ve been working at McDonald’s for about a month, but I’ve been working in fast food my whole life. I’ve worked at Wendy’s, Freddy’s [a fast-food chain based in Kansas], Little Caesar’s, my first job was at Taco Bell. I’ve pretty much worked at all of them, except for KFC. When I was working at Freddy’s, we had an employee that contracted COVID-19, and the managers knew because we all worked with her. The managers were like, “You have to quarantine yourself for two weeks or go get tested,” and we were all really upset because they basically let her come back to work without getting her negative test results back. Then, when her test results came back,she found outshe was positive, and then the whole night crew had to be out for two weeks with no pay. We had to figure out a way to get COVID tested just to come back to work. I’m going out onstrike tostand insolidarity with all McDonald’s workers, even though I’ve only been there ashort while. McDonald’s has been around forever, and theyset thestandard for these other fast-food companies to pay us poverty wages. These corporations need to listen to their workers! Whenever I give aspeech, I always tell people that these companies are nothing without us. Without us, these jobs would crumble,so we need tostand together and fight for a union and $15 dollars an hour. It’s not enough, but it’s astart. I’ve been working at McDonald’s for overseven years now, and it’s gotten a lot worsesince the pandemic. A lot of our employees have quit,so we’reshort-staffed most of the time. Istarted working with the Fight for $15 when I firststarted at McDonald’s, back in my teens. It just felt like the right thing to do. Wesaid what we need, and we haven’t gotten it,so I’mstill fighting. We’re getting paid nickels and dimes, and theshareholders and million-dollar corporations are making money off of our backs. With thisstrike, I hope to get into the minds of people who haven’t yetseen what we’re working toward. A lot of workers feel unwanted or unneeded based on what they’re being paid or how they’re being treated,so I want to change that. I’ve worked at McDonald’s for over a decade, and I’m onstrike today—again—because I know the work I do, the work we all do, is worth $15 per hour. McDonald’s made billions off our labor during a global pandemic, while workerssuffered through unsafe working conditions and unlivable wages. I’m tired of McDonald’s putting profits above oursafety and keeping workers like me down, and I’ll continuestriking andspeaking up until workers get a voice on the job.",2,1,Vogue
40,"The impact of women’s careers on childbearing age, in one chart",-0.75,48.5,https://qz.com/work/1596628/more-uk-women-start-families-in-their-30s-now-than-their-20s/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,25,"We know intuitively that, in developed economies, birthrates are falling as people have fewer children and are waiting until later in life tostart families. Forsome, that’s because of career commitments earlier in life. For others, travel and education play a role, while others are waiting until they’ve foundsomeone with whom they want to co-parent. Stats just released by the UK’s Office for National Statistics gives one of the clearest pictures yet of theseshifts. For the first timesince the ONS began collecting data, more women are getting pregnant at age 30 or older than in their 20s:In 2017, the most recent year for which the agency has data, there were 398,284 pregnancies to women aged 30 or over, and 395,856 pregnancies to women of between 20 and 29. (Not all pregnancies, of course, end in childbirth.)Pregnancy in women under 20, meanwhile, fell to its lowest ever level. Kathryn Littleboy, thestatistician responsible for the ONS data,said that teenage pregnancy rates, which have been falling consistently for 10 years and have more than halvedsince records began in 1990, may have dropped because of improvedsex education, better access to contraceptives, and more young womenstaying in education. Total conceptions in all three of these age brackets fell, part of a trend of declining overall birthrate that keeps the UK in line with other developed economies. Only one age groupsaw a net rise in the rate of conception: women over 40, for whom total conceptions increased by 2.6% from the previous year. Littleboysaid the reasons behind the rise in women over 40 having more children could include the effects of rising living costs. The overall trend of women getting pregnant later, however,signals a biggershift for women, away from early marriage and motherhood, and toward establishing their careers. Fertile years don’t last forever, which is why it makessense to compare one decade—the 20s, when most pregnancies used to occur—to the total of both the 30s and 40s. Using the UK as a proxy for global trends, itseems likely that women entering the workplace andstaying in it even when they have kids will mean a continuedshift to pregnancy in the third and fourth decades of life.

Published: December 22, 2020 8:54amUpdated: December 22, 2020 2:57pmLate lastsummer, Black Lives Matter activists in Detroitsued the city government in federal court, alleging that Detroit police ""repeatedly responded with violence"" to anti-police demonstrations and riots in the city between June and August. The plaintiffssupported their claim with photos ofsome of the resulting injuries. U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan Laurie J. Michelson responded by issuing a temporary order to limit the use of force by the police department. Less than one month later, the city of Detroit filed a countersuit denying in detail each accusation made by the protesters. The city'ssuitalleges that the demonstrators in Detroit are part of a ""civil conspiracy"" in place to ""disturb the peace, engage in disorderly conduct, incite riots, destroy public property"" and resist the actions of city police. The city is asking the court to issue judgements against protestors who are a part of this ""conspiracy"" and who worked to defame the mayor and police department. Thesuit also requests that damages be awarded to the city. The city's countersuit — the first of its kind to be filed following lastsummer's George Floyd protests — is being attacked on the activist left as an effort tosuppress protest movements. Progressive Democratic Rep.

43,The World’s Most Technologically Sophisticated Genocide Is Happening in Xinjiang,-0.33,43.67,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/15/uighur-genocide-xinjiang-china-surveillance-sterilization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-15,25,"Two recent disturbing events may finally awaken the world to thescale and horror of the atrocities being committed against the Uighurs, a mostlysecular Muslim ethnic minority, in Xinjiang, China. One is an authoritative report documenting thesystematicsterilization of Uighur women. The other was theseizure by U. S. Customs and Border Protection of 13 tons of products made from human hairsuspected of being forcibly removed from Uighurs imprisoned in concentration camps. Both events evoke chilling parallels to past atrocities elsewhere, forcedsterilization of minorities, disabled, and Indigenous people, and the image of the glass display of mountains of hair preserved at Auschwitz. Two recent disturbing events may finally awaken the world to thescale and horror of the atrocities being committed against the Uighurs, a mostlysecular Muslim ethnic minority, in Xinjiang, China. One is an authoritative report documenting thesystematicsterilization of Uighur women. The other was theseizure by U. S. Customs and Border Protection of 13 tons of products made from human hairsuspected of being forcibly removed from Uighurs imprisoned in concentration camps. Both events evoke chilling parallels to past atrocities elsewhere, forcedsterilization of minorities, disabled, and Indigenous people, and the image of the glass display of mountains of hair preserved at Auschwitz. TheGenocide Convention, to which China is asignatory, defines genocide asspecific acts against members of a group with the intent to destroy that group in whole or in part. These acts include (a) killing; (b) causingserious bodily or mental harm; (c) deliberately inflicting conditions of life to bring about the group’s physical destruction; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Any one of these categories constitutes genocide. The overwhelming evidence of the Chinese government’s deliberate andsystematic campaign to destroy the Uighur people clearly meets each of these categories. Over a millionTurkic Uighursare detained in concentration camps, prisons, and forced labor factories in China. Detainees aresubject to military-style discipline, thought transformation, and forced confessions. They are abused, tortured, raped, and even killed. Survivors report beingsubjected toelectrocution,waterboarding,repeated beatings,stress positions, and injections of unknownsubstances. These mass detention camps are designed to causeserious physical, psychological harm and mentally break the Uighur people. Therepeatedgovernment orders to “break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections, and break their origins”; “round up everyone whoshould be rounded up”; andsystematically prevent Uighur births demonstrate a clear intent to eradicate the Uighur people as a whole. Ekpar Asat(brother of one of the present authors) is an emblematic example of how Uighurs are targeted regardless of their recognition as model Chinese citizens by the Communist Party. Asat was praised by the government for his community leadership as a “bridge builder” and “positive force” between ethnic minorities and the Xinjiang local government. But Asatstillsuffered thesame fate as over a million other Uighurs and disappeared into theshadows of the concentration camps in 2016. He is held incommunicado and is reported to beserving a 15-yearsentence on the trumped-up charge of “inciting ethnic hatred.” Not asingle court document is available about his case. In 2017, Xinjiangwageda brutal “Special Campaign to Control Birth Control Violations,” along withspecific local directives. By 2019, the government planned tosubject over 80 percent of women of childbearing age insouthern Xinjiang to forced intrauterine devices (IUDs) andsterilization. The goal is toachieve“zero birth control violation incidents.” Government documents reve ala campaign of mass femalesterilizationsupported bystate funding to carry out hundreds of thousands ofsterilizations in 2019 and 2020. This goes far beyond thescale, per capita, of forcedsterilization inflicted on women throughout China under the past one-child policy. To implement these policies, the Xinjiang governmentemployed“dragnet-style” investigations to hunt down women of childbearing age. Once apprehended, these women have no choice but to undergo forcedsterilization to avoid beingsent to an internment camp. Once detained, women face forced injections, abortions, and unknown drugs. Andstatisticsshow that the government is meeting its birth prevention goals. Between 2015 and 2018, population growth rates in the Uighur heartland plummeted by 84 percent. Conversely, official documentsshow thatsterilization ratesskyrocketed in Xinjiang while plunging throughout the rest of China, and the funding for these programs is only increasing. Between 2017 and 2018, in one district, the percentage of women who were infertile or widowed increased by 124 percent and 117 percent, respectively. In 2018, 80 percent of all IUD placements in China were performed in Xinjiang despite accounting for a mere 1.8 percent of China’s population. These IUDs can be removed only bystate-approvedsurgery—or else prison terms will follow. In Kashgar, only about 3 percent of married women of childbearing age gave birth in 2019. The latest annual reports fromsome of these regions have begun omitting birth rate information altogether to conceal thescale of destruction. The government hasshut down its entire online platform after these revelations. Thescale andscope of these measures are clearly designed to halt Uighur births. With Uighur men detained and womensterilized, the government has laid the groundwork for the physical destruction of the Uighur people. At least half a million of the remaining Uighur children have beenseparated from their families and are being raised by thestate atso-called “childrenshelters.”What makes this genocideso uniquely dangerous is its technologicalsophistication, allowing for efficiency in its destruction and concealment from global attention. The Uighurs have beensuffering under the most advanced policestate, with extensive controls and restrictions on every aspect of life—religious, familial, cultural, andsocial. To facilitatesurveillance, Xinjiang operates under a grid managementsystem. Cities and villages aresplit intosquares of about 500 people. Eachsquare has a policestation that closely monitors inhabitants by regularlyscanning their identification cards, faces, DNAsamples, fingerprints, and cell phones. These methods aresupplemented by a machine-operatedsystem known as theIntegrated Joint Operations Platform. Thesystem uses machine learning to collect personal data from videosurveillance,smartphones, and other private records to generate lists for detention. Over a million Han Chinese watchers have been installed in Uighur households, rendering even intimatespacessubject to the government’s eye. The Chinese government operates the most intrusive masssurveillancesystem in the world and repeatedly denies the international community meaningful access to it. It is therefore incumbent on us to appreciate the nature, depth, andspeed of the genocide and act now before it’s too late. Recognizing or refusing to name this a genocide will be a matter of life or death. In 1994, by the time U. S. officials were done debating the applicability of the term to thesituation in Rwanda, nearly a million Tutsis had already beenslaughtered. A document dated May 1, 1994, at the height of the genocide, by an official in the Office of the Secretary of Defensestated: “Genocide finding could commit [the U. S. government] to actually ‘dosomething.’” Four years later, President Bill Clintonstood before Rwandansurvivors and reflected on his administration’s historic failure andvowed: “Never again must we beshy in the face of the evidence.”With the passing of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, the U. S. government has begun to takesteps in the right direction to avoid another human catastrophe. Seventy-eight members of Congress have followed upwith a call for the administration to impose Magnitskysanctions on the responsible Chinese officials and issue a formal declaration of the atrocity crimes, including genocide. So far, the administration has officiallyimposedMagnitskysanctions on four Chinese officials and an entity in charge of the Orwelliansurveillancesystem and responsible for the expansion of the internment camps in Xinjiang. The U. S. government must now make an official determination of genocide. This will not be difficult, as U. S. State Departmentspokesperson Morgan Ortagus has already asserted that “what has happened to the Uighur people … is potentially the worst crime that we haveseensince the Holocaust.”A formal declaration of genocide is notsimplysymbolic. It will catalyze other countries to join in a concerted effort to end the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang. It will also prompt consumers to reject the over 80 international brands that profit off genocide. Furthermore, the determination willstrengthen legal remedies forsanctioning companies that profit from modernslavery in theirsupply chainssourced in China and compel business entities to refrain from profiting from genocide and commit to ethicalsourcing. In our interconnected world, we are not only bystanders if we fail to recognize the genocide as wesee it.

44,Why a Biden Presidency Could Be Good for the Church,11.67,30.33,https://stream.org/why-a-biden-presidency-could-be-good-for-the-church/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-17,24,"ByMichael BrownPublished onJanuary 17, 2021•Like many of you reading this article, I voted for Donald Trump, which means I voted against Joe Biden. I have also written articles calling out the radical nature of theDemocratic platform, drawing attention to Biden’s extreme, “transgender rights”position, and pointing to his continuedshift to the left on abortion. And I have warned of the potential dangers of a Kamala Harris presidency. Like many of you, I am deeply concerned about thedirectionAmerica could be heading under a Biden-Harris administration, including potentially destructive dealings with China and Iran. At thesame time, I believe that the election of Joe Biden might be in the best interest of the Church of America. How can Isaysuch a thing?Simplystated, it is because many of us Christian conservatives put too much trust in a man. (If you didn’t, fine. Isaid “many of us,” not all of us.)We were looking to a man to preserve our religious freedoms. Looking to a man to overturn through the courts. Looking to a man to fight our battles, to be our champion. Looking to a man to push back against the evil agendas of the radical left. Looking to a man to bring peace to the Middle East. Such an attitude is never healthy, especially when that man is Donald Trump, a man who could be as abrasive and destructive as he could be winsome and uniting. And when itseemed that Trump might be losing the election, we turned to God in fervent prayer and fasting. But it was notso much for revival in the church and mercy on America as much as it was for Trump’s victory, as if only a Trump victorystood between America’s freedom and America’ collapse. As I recall, Jesus taught us to pray that the Lord’s name would be hallowed and that His kingdom would come and His will be done, rather than to pray for the election of a particular individual or thesuccess of a particular party. To besure, many were praying for justice, praying to “Stop the Steal.” Yet our prayers for the reelection of Donald Trump were far more passionate than our prayers for other critical issues,such asstopping the pandemic. Or our prayers tosee our neighbors come to Jesus. Or our prayers for thesafety of our persecuted brothers andsisters around the world. How could this be right?As thingsstand, I truly believe that four more years of Donald Trump would have led to greaterspiritual complacency and even triumphalism, not to mention the vulgarizing of our ownsouls. Four more years of Trump (for which I, too, voted) would have led to even greater trust in a man, only deepening our dangerous trend. Four more years of Trump would have destroyed our witness even moreseverely, as evangelical Christians (in particular, white evangelical Christians) would have been better known for association with Trump than association with Jesus. (As it is, much damage has been done and we have much ground to recover.)Four more years of Trump would have kept our focus on the government, as if the White House or Congress or the Supreme Court couldslow the national hemorrhaging orstop our downward moral andspiritualslide.“But,” yousay, “a Biden-Harris presidency means more babiesslaughtered. That alone tells me you are wrong. Surely God doesn’t want more innocent blood beingshed.”Certainly, Ishare your pro-life passion, and I fully understand the implications of a Biden-Harris administration when it comes to the unborn. Absolutely, 100 percent. But let’s face the facts. Babies wereslaughtered ata horrific rate through the Republican presidencies of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump. That’s a total of 24 years and more than 22 million babies, which is far more babies than were aborted during the 16 years of the Democratic presidencies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. At thesame time, progress is being made every year in reducing the number of abortions through other legislative and grass roots efforts, all while we continue to press for the overturning of.“But,” yousay, “a Democratic victory now could mean the packing of the courts and the end of free and fair elections as we know it. We will never recover from this.”You could be right, in which case, thesituation is dire. On the other hand, now is the time tostand up boldly and exercise our faith. Why must we besof atalistic?The possibilities are indeed grave, but they are certainly not written instone. Personally, I do not believe most Americans willsupport the increasingly radical leftist agenda. In fact, it could be that the best thing that could happen to our country is for the radical left toshow its real hand and for its fangs,so tosay, to be exposed. The more that BLM and Antifa terrorize ourstreets, the less popular they will be. The more peoplesee where a Green New Deal will lead (especially in their paychecks and freedoms), the less they will like it. The more the Democratsseek to remake America, the more Americans will not want Democrats in power. The more people realize that Big Tech is trying to rule their lives and the mainstream media is lying to them, the more they will resent this hostile takeover. As for the Church, the more we realize that we cannot look to the White House or Congress to do our bidding, the more we will get back to gospel basics. And it is those basics alone that cansave the nation. To quote the words of the Psalms, “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes” (Psalm 118:9). And, “Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannotsave” (Psalm 146:3). Today, we couldsubstitute the word “presidents” for “princes.”Of course, these verses do not mean that we become passive and complacent when it comes to the politicalsystem. They do not mean that we have a k um baya mentality when it comes to laws and policies. But they do mean that we must not put our full trust in earthly leaders or earthly powers. And they do mean that our trust in God will be rewarded. The truth is that, quite often in life, the worst things turn out to the best things. And as thesaying goes, if it doesn’t kill you, it makes youstronger. A Biden-Harris presidency will not come close to killing us. Didn’t Jesussay that the gates of Hades would not prevail over the Church, meaning the powers of death itself?Instead, an adversarial presence in the White House could be the best thing that happened to the Church of America in years. Maybe this is what it will take to wake us up. An awakened Church remains the hope of the nation. It is that force alone — the force of the gospel lived out — that can change hearts. Then, people with changed hearts can reshape the government and the courts. Then we will have change that can last.

49,"Stephanie Grisham Says She’s Done Lying for Trump, So Why Is So Much of Her Memoir Untrue?",-14.0,40.2,https://theintercept.com/2021/10/11/stephanie-grisham-says-shes-done-lying-trump-much-memoir-untrue/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-11,25,"Stephanie Grisham,whospent four years lying to reportersonbehalfof Donald and Melania Trump, promises readers of her new memoir, “I’ll Take Your Questions Now,” thatshe’s ready to tell the unvarnished truth. Or at least, the truth asshe remembers it. Grisham, whoserved in a variety of White House roles as chiefspokesperson for both the president and the first lady, told New York magazine that becauseshe had not been planning a tell-all book beforeshe quit the White House on January 6,she did not keep a diary and wrote entirely from memory. Unfortunately, while much of what Grisham writes about the Trumps’ off-screen behavior rings true, her account of whatshe witnessed in the Trump White House is riddled with factual errors and what appear to be trace elements of coverstoriesshe invented for the press that eventually lodged themselves in her memory, displacing in her mind the contrary evidence of her own eyes and ears. We know this becauseseveral of the events Grisham describes in her memoir unfolded in public and were documented instill photographs, on video, and in White House transcripts. By examining that evidence, we cansee that at least a half-dozen of thestories Grisham recounts include details that are either incorrect or invented. Perhaps the clearest example of this is Grisham’s new account of what came to be known as “Sharpiegate,” when, on September 4, 2019, Trump called reporters into the Oval Office and held up a weather map which he had altered with a black marker, presenting it as proof that he had been right, and the National Weather Service wrong, when he warned residents of Alabama earlier that week that they were in the likely path of Hurricane Dorian. Grisham tries to convince readers of her memoir that the whole event was more about incompetence than dishonesty. She writes that before the reporters weresummoned that day, Trump expressed anger that the map, a week-old projection of thestorm’s likely path “sitting on an easel by his desk,”showed the hurricane threatening Florida and Georgia but not, as he’d tweeted, Alabama. Trump then took a Sharpie from his desk and drew a black line to include Alabama in the path, insisting to hisstaff that this was the original projection for thestorm. Grisham claims that Trump was right about that, despite the fact that none of the forecast cones predicting thestorm’s path ever included Alabama. Then,she writes, Trump was reminded that he was behindschedule and the press was rushed in. “No one thought,” Grisham writes, “that the map wasstill displayed for the press tosee.”“When the reporters came in,some of them zeroed in on the map,”she continues. “Thestory was too good to resist: The president was creating his own reality again! He was doctoring official documents! Even though, in that case, Trump actually hadn’t planned toshow the map to the press.”Grisham even laments, “No reporter believed our explanations by that point. They believed that everyone around the president was a liar.” But any reportershe offered this explanation to had good reason not to believe it because video evidenceshows that it was clearly a lie. The entire 27-minute briefing for the press that day was broadcast by C-SPANand posted on the White House YouTubechannel. What the videoshows is that, contrary to Grisham’s claims, the map was not accidentally displayed on an easel when reporters came in. It was facing away from the mon the floor behind Trump’s desk, until Trump began the briefing by asking Kevin McAleenan, the acting homelandsecuritysecretary, to hand it to himso he could hold it up for the cameras. Grisham even attributes her failure to hold asingle press briefing during her tenure as White House presssecretary to her fear of ending up,like her former boss Sean Spicer,satirized on “Saturday Night Live” as a hapless liar. Ifshe appeared on the briefing room’sstage, Grisham writes, “I knew thatsooner or later the president would want me to tell the publicsomething that was not true or that would make mesound like a lunatic.”(Grisham fails to mention thatshe had already been caught lying for Trumpin a way that made herseem ridiculous in 2018, whenshe defended his delusional claim that he had “predicted” the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum during a visit to his Scottish golf course the day before the vote. In fact, ascon temporary news reports, and date-stamped tweets from bothTrumpandGrishamthat day make clear, Trump actually arrived in Scotlandthe morning after the referendum. Grisham completely omits this episode from her memoir.)Grisham writes that her worst fearsseemed to be coming true, in the autumn of 2019, as the White House debated how and when to release the transcript of Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, which had triggered an impeachment inquiry. Trumpsummoned her to the Oval Office and directed her to “go out on yourstage” and give a dramatic reading of the transcript. “You need to act it out. With voices,” Grisham recalls Trump telling her. “You need to really reenact the phone callso people will understand how perfect it was. Elegant, really. So you’ll need to use two voices and act it out.”“This was it, “Grisham writes, “this was going to be my ticket to beingsatirized on ‘Saturday Night Live.’”Grisham recounts thatshe only avoided having to perform this one-womanshow — “presumably with a Ukrainian accent for Zelensky’s portions? And what voice would I be using for Trump?” — after a colleague convinced Trump that it would be better to have a member of Congress read the whole transcript into the record for posterity.“The next day,” Grisham writes, instead of her “one of our most reliable ‘yes’ guys, California congressman Devin Nunes, read the full transcript before the House Intelligence Committeeso the perfect phone call could be remembered forever.”But video of the House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearing on November 15, 2019,shows that while Nunes di dread the transcript of a phone call between Trump and Zelensky, it was not, as Grisham wrote, the record of what Trump referred to as his “perfect call” from July 25. Instead of that deeply incriminating call, Nunes read thesemi-comic transcript of an earlier, anodyne conversation between the two presidents, which had taken place on April 21 — three months before the call in which Trumppressed Zelenskyto do him “a favor” by announcingsham investigations of Democrats, including Joe Biden.'When I owned Miss Universe, they had great people. Ukraine was always well represented.' Devin Nunes reads the transcript of a call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy during today's#impeachmenthearing. Live updates:— Reuters (@Reuters)November 15, 2019Other parts of Grisham’s memoir that distort the historical recordsuggest that whileshe did get whatshe calls a “front-rowseat” to watch history unfold inside the Trump White House,some of whatshe observed failed to make a clear enough impression on her for her to even accurately remember basic details. One example of this is Grisham’s recollection of watching Trump try to impress President Xi Jinping of China by bragging about “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake you’ve everseen,” over dessert at Mar-a-Lago during an April 2017 visit, “while talking about a missilestrike on Syria he’d launched the week before.” But, as TrumptoldMaria Bartiromo a few days later,the missilestrike, in retaliation for a Syrian government chemical attack, was carried out during the dinner that night. Grisham also has a vivid recollection of being in the White House briefing room for Sean Spicer’s infamous first appearance there, on Saturday, January 21, 2017, when he tried and failed to browbeat reporters into accepting that the relativelysmall crowd at Trump’s inaugural the day before “was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period!”Grisham writes thatshe had no idea what Spicer was going tosay but recalls thatshe wasseated just to the left of thestage, next to Omarosa Manigault Newman. “Hope Hicks was next to her, then Kellyanne Conway, and finally Sarah Sanders at the other end. I remember being proud that the press teamsupporting Sean that day consisted of all women.”In fact, archivalvideoandphotographsof that briefingshow that Grisham was notseated alongside thestage, and neither were Newman or Conway. Grisham appears to have conflated her memory of Spicer’sself-immolation that day with her presence at hissecond briefing two days later — whenshe was there,seatedalongsideNewman, Conway, and Sanders. Grisham also flubs the time line in astory about her attempt to mediate an Oval Office dispute between the first lady and the president over a proposed ban to ban flavored e-cigarettes on September 11, 2019. Grisham writes that Melania Trump kept pushing her husband to immediately call in the press and announce the ban, despite the misgivings of political advisers who were concerned it would anger his base. In an effort to keep the first lady at bay, and give Trump more time to hear from other advisers, Grisham recalls thatshe “reminded her that it was 9/11 andshe and the presidentstill needed to take part in the moments ofsilence to honor the attacks. Thissolemn occasion was not the time to makesuch an announcement.”Thestalling tactic failed, however, and Grisham writes that Trump finally agreed to his wife’s demand tosummon the press corps to the Oval Office without delay and announce a ban (which he would later backtrack on) before continuing with thescheduled commemorations of the September 11 attacks. But White House transcripts and video of that dayshow that this incident took place after the 9/11 ceremonies, not before them as Grisham recalls. The Trumps observed the moment ofsilence outside the White House, asscheduled, at 8:46 a.m. that morning, nearly four hours before the press corps was called into the Oval Office,at 12:26 p.m., to hear the president awkwardly cite pressure from the first lady as a factor in his decision to ban the e-cigarettes. White House announces FDA is going to take flavored e-cigarettes off the marketpic.twitter.com/y689So3cWA— Jeff Mason (@jeffmason1)September 11, 2019A more troubling distortion by Grisham is her account of a bizarre fight Trump picked with two Ohio Democrats, Sen. Sherrod Brown and Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, hours after he visited victims of a massshooting in the city on August 7, 2019. According to Grisham, the president and the first lady were both furious with her for not having had press in the intensive care unit at the hospital in Dayton, “to capture all of the medicalstaff clapping and cheering for them and takingselfies.” Grisham reports that both were unmoved by her explanation that press were notsupposed to be crowded around patients, to protect their privacy and their health. “What a waste,” Trumpsaid. Then, after they boarded Air Force One to fly from Ohio to thesite of another massshooting that week, in El Paso, Texas, Grisham writes, “mystomach dropped when Isaw that the two local Democratic politicians who, at our invitation, hadspent the day with us on thesteps of the hospital we had just visited were holding a press conference. They had clearly preplanned it, and I watched the president’s mood torpedo as he watched it unfold. Theysaid that Trump’s visit was a publicitystunt and had done nothing to heal the community.”While Grisham accuratelysums up how Trumpseemed to feel about watching Brown and Whaleyspeak to reporters — the president tweeted that day to accuse them of “totally misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital” — her characterization of what theysaid bears no resemblance to reality. Tostart with, they did not take questions at Miami Valley Hospital, where the gunshot victims were being treated, but in Dayton City Hall after they left the hospital. But more importantly, the full video of their remarksshows that they never called Trump’s visit a publicitystunt or accused him of failing to heal the community. While both Democratssaid that they had pressed Trump for real action to ban assault weapons — like the an AR-15-style rifle the Dayton gunman had used toshoot 26 people in 32seconds, killing nine — neither of themsaid anything critical about his visit. To the contrary, Brown, who had previously been critical of Trump’s divisive rhetoric,said that the president “was received well by the patients, as you’d expect. They’re hurting. He was comforting. He did the right things. Melania did the right things. And it’s his job, in part, to comfort people. I’m glad he did it in those hospital rooms.”A reporter asked Whaleyifshe thought “this helped the healing, having the president come here?” The mayor replied, “I think the victims and the first responders were grateful that the president of the United States came today.”With Trumpsomehow taking offense at what wassaid at the news conference, or just the fact that he was not part of it, Grisham relates that the president “totally unleashed on me,” launching into a foul-mouthed rant and demanding thatshe immediately leave the forward cabin on the plane and makesure the reporters traveling with them on Air Force One knew how well received he had been at the hospital. “Go back there, go right now and tell them how much everyone in that hospital loved me,” Trump instructed Grisham. “Go, do it. Do it now.”Grisham writes thatshe couldn’t bring herself to do that, fearing that reporters would laugh at her ifshe had gone back to them “on a day when we allshould have been focussed onshooting victims and their families tosay, ‘Hey guys, just want you to know the hospitalstaff really loved President Trump.’”Instead Grisham and Dan Scavino, Trump’ssocial media id, channeled his bizarre tantrum into attacking the Democrats on Twitter from the plane. “Very SAD tosee Ohio Senator Brown, & Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley – LYING & completely mischaracterizing what took place w/ the President’s visit to Miami Valley Hospital today,” Scavinowrotefrom his official White House account. “They are disgraceful politicians, doing nothing but politicizing a massshooting, at every turn they can. The President was treated like a Rock Star inside the hospital, which was all caught on video. They all lovedseeing their great President!”Grishamshared that message from the presssecretary’s official account and added that the president had “graciously asked Sen Brown & Mayor Whaley to join as he and the First Lady visited victims, medicalstaff & first responders. It is genuinelysad tosee them immediately holdsuch a dishonest press conference in the name of partisan politics.”During his visit to El Paso that day, Trump was asked why he had lashed out at Brown and Whaley on Twitter. Trump replied by explaining that he was upset by remarks he attributed to Brown and Whaley, which they did not, in fact, make. “I get on Air Force One, where they do have a lot of televisions. I turn on the television, and there they aresaying, ‘Well, I don’t know if it was appropriate for the president to be here,’” Trumpsaid. NEW: Pres. Trump makes first public remarks after visiting El Paso and Dayton in wake of massshootings. “We had an amazing day.”— ABC News (@ABC)August 7, 2019What is truly bizarre about Grisham’s faulty account of this incident is that, even with the benefit of hindsight,shestillseems unable to admit that Trump’s deranged tantrum was not an understandable reaction to unfair criticism by his political opponents but evidence of a dangerously unstable narcissist who was never fit for the jobshespent more than four years helping him pretend he was capable of doing.

50,Inside China's #MeToo Movement,-0.67,48.0,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a34908442/zhou-xiaoxuan-china-metoo-movement/,https://adfontesmedia.com/elle-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,17,"Since the #MeToo movement kicked off an international reckoning aroundsexual assault, an unprecedented number of women in China have come forward with allegations of misconduct by powerful men in media,sports, business, and academia. While a handful of these women — just like in the U. S., they call themselves “thesilence breakers” — havesought legal recourse, many others cannot; their cases are either blocked by government censors or counter defamation lawsuits in the notoriously male-dominated country thatstill maintains tight control over its judicialsystem and grassroots activists. Inspired by the dozens of women who accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein ofsexual assault,screenwriter Zhou Xiaoxuan is one of just a few women who has been able to get her case heard in court after coming forward with accusations of misconduct at the hands of one of the most recognizable faces in Chinese television: Famed celebrity interviewer Zhu Jin. Zhou's case, which was reportedlystalled earlier this month, has united Chinese feminists insupport of the country's fledgling #MeToo movement. Here's everything you need to know about Zhou and the history of #MeToo in China. China’s #MeToo movement took off in 2018 when a former Beihang Universitystudent publicly accused her professor ofsexual harassment. Luo Xixi published her allegations online and later on thesocial media platform Weibo, China's version of Twitter, claimingshe was one ofseven women harassed by the professor. Her account, widely considered to be China's first viral #MeToo moment, led the university to remove the the professors' teaching credentials, according to theBBC. Luo, who told theBBCthat the #MeToo movement in the U. S. gave her ""a lot of courage"" to come forward, is credited with inspiring other women tospeak out about their experiences. According to,some have even described herstory as the “firststep in the Long March” againstsexual assault in China. Zhou Xiaoxuan, now 27, was one ofseveral women to came forward with allegations ofsexual assault in 2018 after the #MeToo movement first gained traction. According to, Zhou published an essay accusing China Central Television host Zhu Jin of groping and forcibly kissing her in a dressing room whenshe was a 23-year-old intern on hisshow. When Zhou reported the case to Chinese police,she was told that coming forward might damage Zhu's image and ""hurt the feelings of those who admired him,"" according toIt is highly unusual forsexual-harassment claims to make it to court in China, and hardly any of the country'sstate-run media outlets have reported on Zhou's case. She is reportedlyseeking a publicly apology and $7,600 in damages from Zhu, who has denied claims against him, according to.“I’m very nervous,” Zhoureportedly told AFPbefore a hearing on December 2. “But whether we win or lose the case, it has meaning. If we lose, it allows the questions we raised at least to remain in history. Someone will have to give us an answer.”After a long day in court, judges adjourned the trial and decided to hear the case another day. It's unclear what happens next, but experts believe it issignificant that the court agreed to hear Zhou's case at all. ""Has Chinesesociety changedsince the #MeToo movement? I can'tsay,"" Lu Pin, a feminist campaigner in China until 2015, told. ""But 20 years ago,society was willfully ignorant or aggressively denyingsexual harassment and rape culture. Today, we've at least forced the debate.""China has a ""zero tolerance for collective actions,"" Human Rights Watch researcherYaqiu Wangwrote in aop-ed, meaning that the country’s #MeToo movement hasn't resulted in massivestreet protests like it has in the U. S. Outside Harvey Weinstein's trial, for example,150 women wearing masks and dressed in all black chanted: ""It's not my fault! Not where I was, not how I dressed! The rapist WAS you! The rapist IS you!""Thescene outside the courthouse where Zhou appeared earlier this month was much moresubdued: A group of demonstrators heldsigns offeringsupport and took pictures of her. “Isaw people holdingslogans tosupport Xianzi, I felt excited and moved tosee people here tosupport each other,” Yang Ruiqi, a third-year universitystudent, told the. “The whole #MeToo movement is an inspiration to me, making me realise that things which made me feel uncomfortable before were wrong, it wasn’t because I was being toosensitive.”""The verdict isn't important,"" Li Tingting, a women's rights activist there insupport of Zhou, told. ""What was important for our movement was the moment, the process, the involvement of people who gathered physically from across the country and the foundation we've laid.""A new civil code enacted in China thissummers tries to holdschools and businesses accountable forsexual harassment, though it's been called ""largelysymbolic.""“Thestate is takingsteps toward giving victims a path for vindicating their rights,” Aaron Halegua, aspecialist in Chinese labor law at New York University, told. “However, the law isstill very vague and leaves many questions unanswered.”",2,1,Elle

Last night, United States Senator and giant pile of mammoth dung in theshape of a human being Josh Hawley learned that there would besome relatively minor push back for being an actual despot; Simon & Schuster canceled its contract to publish his book,, wherein Hawley planned to rant aboutsocial media companies being very mean to his fellow fascists. Simon & Schuster released thisstatement:https: //t.co/NdIkmGbCFI— Simon & Schuster (@Simon & Schuster)1610061880.0Josh Hawley,sage voice of reason that he is, maturely took thesmallsetback instride, accepted responsibility for his actions, andlolololololjk, he followed Dear Leader's command and took to Twitter, where heshot right back with ...something excruciatingly dumb, even for him. And we're talking about Josh Hawley, here,so that'ssayingsomething. Mystatement on the woke mob at @simonschuster https: //t.co/pDxtZvz5J0— Josh Hawley (@Josh Hawley)1610062940.0Here, let us transcribe that at you:This could not be more Orwellian. Simon & Schuster is canceling my contract because I was representing constituents, leading a debate on the Senate floor on voter integrity, which they have now decided to redefine assedition. Let me be clear, this is not just a contract dispute. It's a direct assault on the First Amendment. Only approvedspeech can now be published. This is the Left looking to cancel everyone they don't approve of. I will fight this cancel culture with everything I have. We'llsee you in court.*GASP!* You mean a PUBLISHER has chosen to only publish certain works?! Who could ever have imaginedsuch a thing?! It's almost like Simon & Schuster is a private company that's allowed to pick and choose what to publish in the manner itsees fit!Josh Hawley just loves himsome free-market capitalism ... until he is negatively affected in any way. Then it's woke fascism. Clearly. Andsomethingsomething First Amendment. If he really believes asingle word of this, heshould ask Yale Law for his money back. The First Amendment doesn't entitle you to a book deal, Josh. In fact — and let's make this abundantly clear — the First Amendment does not entitle to a book deal. Shocking but true. The First Amendment, in fact, has absofuckinglutely NOTHING to do with Simon & Schuster, a private company, cancelingsomeone's book deal. Weird, I know. But let's take a look, just to makesure! Here is the First Amendment, in full:Congressshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom ofspeech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Wow, unbelievably, the Foundersforget to include a clausesaying Josh Hawleyshall be entitled to book dealsso he can whine about Nazis getting banned from Twitter. I don't know how they managed to leave that one out. The claim that ""this is not just a contract dispute"" and the addition of ""We'llsee you in court"" at the end is also just *chef's kiss*. This is the very definition of a contract dispute, asshole. Oh yeah, and like most post-Me Too contracts with major publishers, Hawley probably has amorality clause in his contract. I'm just going to go ahead andsay that inciting a violent mob tostage a putsch and even after that voting in the US Senate to declare Donald Trump dictator counts as ""moral turpitude.""You poop y twat. I am really fuckingsick of how everyone assumes that people — especially white men, who are veryskilled at failing up — with fancy degrees and credentials aresmart. Kayleigh McEnany has a degree from Harvard Law. Ted Cruz has a degree from Harvard Law and clerked for Chief Justice WIlliam Rehnquist. Josh Hawley has a degree from Yale Law, which fancies itself even more prestigious than Harvard, and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts. I'msorry, I don't care how many honorifics they have, these motherfuckers are no geniuses. But even Josh fucking Hawley,somewhere deep inside that thickskull of his,knows that losing his book deal has jackshit to do with the First Amendment. Trump's cult members, however, don't know that. And tyrants like Hawley aren't about to let things like ""facts"" and ""law"" get in the way of a good grift. These psychopaths are his people! Who cares about things like ""integrity"" and ""ethics"" when there are tens of millions of brainwashed fools in our country to worship you andsend you money?The US Capitol was overtaken by an armed mob, thespeaker of the House's office was trashed and robbed, people literally pissed andshat all over the Capitol building itself, the lives of members of Congress were inserious danger, and five people actually did lose their lives. Andstill, Josh Hawleysupported the insurrection. Now, he can't accept that there may be even minor consequences for leading a failed coup. Fuck you, Josh. I can't wait to read your complaint about how Simon & Schuster was VERY MEAN and FIRST AMENDMENT! I'msure it will be just as coherent as the Trump election lawsuits yousupported. Maybe you can even get Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to represent you!Oh, and as for Hawley's claim that getting his book deal canceled is ""Orwellian""?RT @ScrewyDecimal: It's not Orwellian.

The impeachment vote onH. Res. 27in the U. S. House was 231-197 and largely along party lines, although 10 Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), joined Democrats in voting to approve the article of impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) presided as the vote was called. Impeachment proceedings will now head to the U. S. Senate, which under the Constitution is a required to hold a trial, a process that will continue into the Biden administration. It will a take a vote of two-thirds of the members present to convict Trump, which may be in tall order in 50-50 Senate. Although Trump will be out of office, his impeachment and possible conviction represents asymbolicstand against his attack on the U. S.

Asociety in which cops kill people because their license tags are expired? Asociety where, when a news anchorsays, “We have breaking news about another massshooting,” we aren’t evenshocked anymore?Must we always respond thesame old way, wringing our hands and promising that our thoughts and prayers will be with the victims and their families? Will we always follow up with a brief national discussion about gun legislation and police reform, and then abandon the discussion after a week or two?No. This can’t be normal. It must not be normal. As a nation, wesimply cannot keep going on like this, as though we were acting out the premise of the movie “Groundhog Day,” in which a man finds himself living thesame day over and over again. We aren’t in a movie. We are not trapped by these atrocities. We are not incapable of doingsome things to address them. We are not helpless. On the matter of guns -- as big a national hot-button issue as abortion -- we canstart the conversation by refusing to engage in political hyperbole. It’s possible, orshould be, to talk about guns without claiming thatstrengthening gun laws is akin to dismantling the Second Amendment. It’s also possible to talk about guns without labeling gun users as ignorant rednecks with a predilection for violence. And it is, orshould be, possible for Congress to takesomesensiblesteps to regulate gun ownership, including toughening background checks on would-be buyers and reinstating a federal ban on the manufacture orsale of certain assault weapons. Those measures would neither gut the Second Amendment nor keep Americans from owning guns for hunting, targetshooting and personal protection. They might, however, keep psychologically unstable people from buying an assault-style weapon and then, within a day or two, using it toshoot up asupermarket, massage parlor or FedEx center. Congress could also make more money available to mental health treatment centers in everystate, in hopes of reaching people with counseling and medicine before theysink into a deep, dark hole where murder andsuicideseem acceptable. As for policeshootings, not every person pulled over by a law enforcement officer is innocent. Far from it. But all of us who are not dangerous felons -- black, white or brown, with or without outstanding warrants --should expect to emerge alive fromsuch encounters. Arrested, perhaps, or merely ticketed, but alive. As is the case when talking about gun control, when we talk about policeshootings, we have to refuse to engage in political hyperbole. Talking about “defunding the police” and “no more policing” is foolish, pointless and distracting. America needs police departments made of up highly committed, well-trained, well-paid and well-educated men and women. It is disgraceful that many cities and counties pay their law enforcement officersso poorly that officers worksecond and third jobs tosupport their families. If Congress needs tostep in with grant money to increase cops’salaries,so be it. If we need a national commission tostudy and make recommendations about officers’ use of “reasonable force,” that’s fine, too; and if we need to find ways to change and improve the culture of local policing, then let’s do it. But for God’ssake, let’sstop turning on the TV tosee regular reports ofseeminglysenseless or careless police-involvedshootings. They make it hard for us to have confidence in our law enforcement communities, and they make it hard for good cops -- the officers who are first on thescene of disasters and catastrophes, who keep ussafe and who deal with criminalsso we don’t have to -- to do their jobs with confidence, competence and dignity. Instead of only wringing our hands and offering our thoughts and prayers, let’s also takesome modest but concretesteps to reduce officer-involvedshootings. And let’s enactsome reasonable gun regulations.

55,‘Boogaloo’ Believers Think a Civil War Is Coming. These Gun Firms Are Openly Marketing to Them.,-6.33,46.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/06/boogaloo-gun-ammunition-marketing-facebook-instagram/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-26,16,"In mid March, Fenix Ammunition, an ammunition manufacturer in Michigan,saw its daily onlinesales rise from$4,000 to $40,000. The coronavirus pandemic had boosted demand for guns and ammunition around the country, and Fenix was reaping the fruits of the national following it has cultivatedsince its 2016 launch. In addition to record high civilian demand, Fenix also counted at least three local police departments, a law enforcement training center, and KelTec, one of the leading rifle manufacturersin America, among its clients. But Fenix’s March profits were also driven by an aggressivesocial media campaign led by its owner, Justin Nazaroff. For months, Nazaroff had been posting mem es to his company’s Facebook and Instagram pages referencing the “boogaloo,”slang for the armed uprising that a loose assortment of preppers, Second Amendment activists, and anti-government extremists is getting ready for — and insome cases trying to accelerate.“I’ll be honest, it drivessales,” Nazaroffsaid in April of his company’s marketing practices. “People think it’s funny. People click on boogaloo memes. It’ssomething that gun people enjoy joking about.”“You can look up any firearmssocial media influencer and probably find them using the term boogaloo atsome point in time,” he added. Nazaroff cut off communication after a police department notified him of our records requestseeking information aboutsales to Fenix and em ails referencing boogaloo. The word itself is a reference to the 1984 movie, “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo,” but the imaginedsequel would be asecond civil war. Sometimes re-tooled as “big luau” or “big igloo” (adherents often don floral Hawaiianshirts or insignia bearing cartoon igloos), the concept reportedly originated on 4chan, the anonymous image board that’s long been a meeting place for the alt-right. Whilesomespreaders of boogaloo mem es claim tosee them as provocative fun, their mushrooming popularity has concerned experts on extremism. They fear that the concept has re-energized the American militia movement and given anti-government extremists a rallying cry. Boogaloo is not a true movement in thesense that there is little — if any—structure or leadership. Adherents evenseem to have different visions of what a civil war would accomplish. But to the extent that there is a central idea animating the boogaloo’s largely white, right-wingsupporters, it’s that armed combatants will kick off a full-fledged rebellion to topple the federal government. “They don’t have a lot of beliefs other than they really like guns, they really hate cops, and they wantsomesort of revolution,”said Megan Squire, a computerscientist who researches online extremism at Elon University. “You pretty much have to be weapons-trained and interested in weapons to be a boogaloo adherent.”In the past month, at leastseven people with boogaloo ties have been arrested for attempting or carrying out violence at recent protests. On June 6, Air Force Sergeant Steve Carillo allegedlyshot two Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s deputies, killing one. He was arrested afterscrawling the word “boog” in blood on the hood of astolen car alongside phrases from mem es that are popular in boogaloo groups. Carillo was also charged withshooting two guards outside an Oakland, California, courthouse during protests a week earlier. One died. That morning, Carillo had posted to Facebook: “Go to the riots andsupport our own cause. Show them the real targets. Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.” A boogaloo patch was recovered from the van that he used that day. Asuspected accomplice was also arrested after confessing to the FBI. On the day of the Oaklandshooting,three men were arrested in Las Vegas onsuspicion of possessing homemade explosives and on charges of conspiracy to commit an act of domestic terrorism near protests. Though they havesince pleaded not guilty, the criminal complaint against them noted boogaloo ties. And, inSouth Carolina, two men with boogaloo connections wereseparately arrested on charges of looting and attempting to incite a riot. At least two more boogaloosupporters were arrested for the possession of illegal firearms inOklahomaandTennessee. InColorado, policeseized multiple weapons from one boogaloosupporter at a protest, but did not make an arrest. On June 26, Attorney General William Barr created a task force aimed at fighting extremism, and in a memo hesingled out boogaloosupporters, as well as members of the left-leaning antifa. Even before the protests,several boogaloosupporters had attempted to incite violence. In March, a Missouri man who planned to bomb a hospital in what he called “operation boogaloo”shot and killed himself before he could be arrested by the FBI. In April, a member ofseveral boogaloo Facebook groups was arrested in Texas, livestreaming as hesearched for police to kill.“Boogaloo boys,” as they call themselves, have beenspotted at protests following the killing of George Floyd, both marching with demonstrators and as counter-protesters. Some have also been discussing how to use the protests to encourage violence. The varied response is indicative ofsupporters’ lack of a unifying ideology. Their fixation on guns and tactical gear makes boogaloosupporters attractive clients for gunsellers. And hash taggedsocial media posts are an effective way for weapons dealers to boost their brands. Firearmssellers are not allowed to purchase ads on Facebook, thoughsome have found ways around this, but they can use their official pages to reach niche audiences. When COVID-19 lock downsseemed to validate adherents’ expectations of government overreach, use of the term boogaloo exploded on mainstreamsocial mediasites like Facebook and Reddit. In April, the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit that monitors activity on major online platforms, documented 125 boogaloo Facebook groups with over 72,000 members. More than 60 percent had been createdsince February — thesame time that Fenix’s use of boogaloo-related hash tags peaked, according to data from the company’s Instagram page. Around thesame time, a review posted on Fenix’s Facebook page revealed that the company wassendingstickers to online customers that featured the “boogaloo flag,” a black and white American flag with a floral Hawaiianstripe and a cartoon igloo instead ofstars. When contacted, the reviewersaid he had found the company bysearching for competition-grade ammunition, and that thesticker helped cement his loyalty to Fenix. A December 19, 2019, post on Fenix’s Instagram page, which has nearly 34,000 followers,shows the Sesame Street character Cookie Monster photos hoppedso that he’s holding an AR-15 and wearing night-vision goggles. “B is for Boogaloo” is written over the bright yellow background. “And V is for Virginia,” read Fenix’s caption, which went on to offer “freeshipping on ammunition, body armor and medical products”sent to thestate. The offer lasted through a January 20 rally to oppose new gun laws, one thatsparked astate of emergency order from Governor Ralph Northam as armed militiasand white nationalist groups implored their members to attend the demonstration. In the days before the rally, members of a neo-Nazi group calledThe Basewere arrested after federal agentssaid two of them discussed opening fire on the rally. An FBI affidavit claimed the group wanted to use the event tostart the boogaloo, whichsome neo-Nazissee as a race war or civilizational collapse. There is no evidence that The Base acquired ammo from Fenix, and on June 25, Fenix posted on Instagram about our reporting, writing: “Our company wants nothing to do with anyone claiming to be a Nazi, or a whitesupremacist. We’ve banned people from our page forsayingsuch things in the past and we’ll continue to doso in the future. The Boogaloo is for everyone. “Since October 2019, Fenix has made over 100 posts using hash tags and imagery related to the boogaloo. Many were linked to events like the Virginia rally, national anti-lockdown demonstrations, and recent anti-racism protests. “This is what the politicians and media fear the most” read a June 5 postshowing a diverse group of protesters holding a boogaloo flag on a citystreet. In another post, Fenix responded to asuggestion that looters target white neighborhoods, like Novi, Michigan, the Detroitsuburb where Fenix is located. The response included a picture of four high-powered guns with the comment “send bachelors.”The Trace has identified 35 more dealers and manufacturers of firearms or tacticalsupplies across the country that have posted references to the boogaloo onsocial media. They range fromsmall townstores to multi-million dollar manufacturers of AR-style weapons, like the South Carolina-based Palmetto State Armory. We also reviewed the online presence of 548 federally licensed firearms dealers in Michigan,where armed protesters converged on thestate Capitol, and identified 48 with activesocial media profiles. Six of those posted mem es or hash tags referencing the boogaloo. Eight promoted insignia from militia groups like the Three Percenters, an armed anti-government group with chapters around the country. Anothersix promoted coronavirus conspiracy theories or encouraged disobedience againststate lock down measures. Three madesuggestive posts aboutshooting looters during the protestsInstagram no longer allowssearches for #boogaloo andsome related hash tags on itssite. However, as of June 24, if you typed #boogaloo into thesearch bar, itstill auto filledsuggestions of related hashtags. After being asked about this by The Trace, aspokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram and has been criticized for its failure to rein in boogaloo content,said, “The hasht ag #boogaloomemes was already blocked and we’vesince further blocked #boogalooboys, #boogaloocrew, and #boogalootime given the amount of content using these hash tags that violated our policy.”Thespokesperson added, “we continue to remove content using boogaloo and related terms when accompanied bystatements and images depicting armed violence. We are also preventing these pages and groups from being recommended on Facebook.”Boogaloo marketing isn’t limited tosocial media. Some companies, like Fenix,sell boogaloo-themed merchandise. For instance, in February, Palmetto State Armorysold a limited run of custom boogaloo-themed AK-47-style guns, finished with Hawaiian patterns, mimicking theshirts boogaloosupporters have adopted as an unofficial uniform. They also advertise boogaloo T-shirts on Facebook. Palmetto State Armory CEO Jamin McCallum did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. Hoplite Armor, a body armor manufacturer in Kalispell, Montana,sells a Hawaiian-patterned plate carrier — a kind of bullet-proof vest — as a part of its “Aloha Line” of products. The traditional flowers have been replaced with a blood-stained bauhiniaflower, which adorns the Hong Kong flag frequently carried by protesters there. During an interview, Hoplite’s owner, Lyman Bishop,said he was inspired to make theshirt on a trip to Hawaii, and not because of the boogaloo. Yet a September 27, 2019 Facebook post introducing the plate carrier was tagged with #boogaloo. The company’s page, with more than 142,000 followers, has continued to use the hasht ag as well as associated language and imagery. Bishop is currently a long-shot candidate for governor of Montana on the Libertarian Party ticket, running on an apocalyptic platform thatsuggests violentsecession. Inspite ofsignificant anti-policesentiment among boogaloo boys, Fenix’s website lists four Michigan police departments as major clients, as well as the law enforcement training center at Schoolcraft College. Records from police departments in thesmall cities ofDowagiacandBerkleyshowed receipts from Fenix totaling $4,899 and $18,076, respectively,since 2017. The Grosse Ile Police Department confirmed that it had records of purchases, but has yet to release them. The Northville Police Department denied buying ammunition from Fenix, and a records request returned no receipts from the company. The Schoolcraft training center confirmed it had purchased ammo from Fenix, but refused tosay how much. All of the organizationssaid they had no knowledge of Fenix’ssupport for boogaloo, and don’t have policies on checkingsuppliers’social media accounts. Fenix’ssocial media posts have been largely pro-police,sprinkled withsome criticism of police brutality, including the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Interviews with firearms dealers revealed a host of reasons for posting about the boogaloo orselling related merchandise. Chris David, the owner of Route 6 Guns, asmallshop in Torrington, Connecticut,said that he posts about boogaloo for his company’s 650-odd followers because he believes in the movement’s libertarian messaging. “It’s a lot more mainstream than I think people give the movement credit for because of the portrayal that it’s just this group of people that have these violent intentions, which is just not the case,”said David. Davidsuccessfully lobbied for aspot on a list of pro-boogaloo companies in one of Facebook’s largest boogaloo groups, which, as of June 8, no longer appears in Facebooksearches. It’s unclear whether this is because the group was madesecret or if it was taken down by Facebook. All five firearms and armor dealers that agreed to be interviewed for thisstory denied that their postsshould be interpreted as calls to violence. Nazaroff likenedspreading the mem es to being an ammunitionseller: Hesaid he’s aware of the possibility that his product may be used in violent crimes against innocent people. “That’s the nature of the product,” Nazaroffsaid. “There’s nothing to be done about that. It doesn’t mean that my companyshouldn’t exist.”“It’s literally an internet joke. It’s like ‘Harambe,’”said Dimitri Karras of Firearms Unknown, whichsells “ghost guns,” unserialized but legal firearm parts that can be assembled by customers at home. “I’m a Marine who’s fought in two wars. I have a darksense of humor. That’s just who I am.”The use of humor to cover up intentions orshift the boundaries of acceptable discourse has a history in the alt right. In 2017, The Huffington Post published excerpts from thestyle guide for the Daily Stormer, one of the largest whitesupremacist websites, instructingsupporters to employ jokes instead ofscreeds, noting that the latter may be a “turnoff” to potential converts. “The reader is at first drawn in by curiosity or the naughty humor,” itstated, “and isslowly awakened to reality by repeatedly reading thesame points.” According to historian Elaine Frantz Parsons, the use of hu moras a way to destigmatize extremist ideologies dates back at least to the creation of the Ku Klux Klan. Whether the inflammatory mem es that boogaloosupportersshare reflect their true beliefs can be hard to pin down — andsome expertssay that’s by design. Nazaroff, for instance,said he considers himself a liberal libertarian and boogaloo “prepper.” He believes in the possibility of civil war, but like other arms dealers interviewed for thisstory,stressed that the mem esshouldn’t be takenseriously. But Cassie Miller, a researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center,said: “They pretend that it’s a joke. Insome ways that’s to conceal just howserious andsometimes dangerous the ideas that they’re pushing are.“Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington all closed dealers because of the coronavirus.

56,GOP Proposes Letting Fossil Fuel Firms Sue Sick Workers Seeking Compensation,-15.83,35.0,https://truthout.org/articles/gop-proposes-letting-fossil-fuel-firms-sue-sick-workers-seeking-compensation/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"Fossil fuel firms have long argued that addressing climate change will kill jobs — but the main entities killing oil and gas jobs lately have been fossil fuel firms. Rather thansave jobs, oil firms have lined executive pockets just before declaring bankruptcy, and announced layoffs rather than cut intoshareholder profits. Some oil workers are even dying on the job — and instead of increasingsafety and transparency, oil companies have pushed Congress to make it impossible for workers and families tosue if they getsick due to unsafe conditions. We haveseen this pattern before with the coal industry, which has long fought efforts to fund benefits to workers who contracted “black lung” in mines. Now, it’s oil and gas firms that are putting profits ahead of the lives of their own workers. For years, one of the mainselling points that oil firms used to lure investors was the amount of dividends they pay toshareholders. Exxon is a case in point: It has raised its dividend 37 years in a row, paying out more than $14 billion in cash dividend payments to itsshareholders in 2019. But facing a $2.63 billion loss in thesecond quarter, Exxon decided to lay off workers rather than cut itsshareholder dividend. For workers who manage tosurvive the layoffs, Exxon will be ending its employer match to workers’ retirementsavings plans — a common benefit at major corporations where the firm matches any contributions a worker makes to their 401(k). This comes despite the implicitsupport Exxon has received from the Federal Reserve. The Fed has been leveraging $75 billion in public money provided by the CARES Act 10-to-1, allowing them to purchase up to $750 million in corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds through two new programs. The Fed has purchased nearly $300 million in debt from energy and utility companies — drawingscrutiny from 70 environmental and economic justice groups, who’ve asked the Fed to end these purchases. The Fed’s purchases include $9 million worth of Exxon’s corporate bonds. But the central bank won’t be telling Exxon tosave workers’ jobs: Congress and the Fed both failed to create any binding requirements that companies benefiting from these programs retain their workers. The response of fossil fuel firms and the Trump administration alike to the potentially lethal working conditions for oil and gas workers has been to bury the data and prevent workers fromsuing. Many oil producers havestruggled with a decade of bad bets that were compounded by thespring plunge in oil prices. But that hasn’tstopped them from pushing money out the door to their executives right before they collapse. Last week, the oil and gas drilling firm Noble Corp, which employs 1,600 workers, filed for bankruptcy. Only weeks prior, Noble Corp decided to pay all of its executives their full bonus for 2020, including a $4.2 million pay package for its CEO. Noble Corp is hardly the first oil and gas firm to makesure its executives got their bonuses just before the company crumbled. Chesapeake Energy,struggling with $9 billion in debt amid crashing oil prices, decided in May to pre-pay 21 executives $25 million in bonuses to ensure theystayed motivated. By the end of June, they were bankrupt. Further, both Whiting Petroleum and Extraction Oil & Gas gave their executives millions in bonuses a mere week before going bankrupt — Whiting Petroleum executives nabbed $14.6 million in cash bonuses and Extraction executives pocketed $6.7 million. The response of fossil fuel firms and the Trump administration alike to the potentially lethal working conditions for oil and gas workers has been to bury the data and prevent workers fromsuing. Fossil fuel giants like ConocoPhillips and Exxon lobbied Congress to grant them legal immunityshould their workers getsick, as documented by Friends of the Earth. The liabilityshield proposed by Senate Republicans even allows firms tosue their own workersshould they try andseek recompense if they getsick. The liabilityshield proposed by Senate Republicans even allows firms tosue their own workersshould they try andseek recompense if they getsick. This comes as reporting indicates offshore oil rigs may be hotbeds for the virus. On April 8, the Coast Guard reported that at least 26 workers on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico had tested positive for COVID-19. Since then, the count has gone dark as the Trump administration refused to disclose new case numbers. But the problem appears bleak based on numbers coming out of Mexico where 202 employees and five contractors have died of coronavirus at thestate-owned oil producer Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) — the highest coronavirus death rate of any company in the world, according to Bloomberg. Pemex has been disclosing coronavirus deaths on a daily basis. By contrast, ExxonMobil has declined to report any information at all about the death of its workers due to coronavirus. Fossil fuel firms aresacrificing their workers’ jobs andsafety for profits. Thesector can’t blame the pandemic for its troubles, as its troubles predate coronavirus. By rewarding executives just before bankruptcy,slashing jobs to please investors and pushing for immunity even if they endanger their workers, these firms are proving themselves to be the real job killers. With the Fed’s ongoing purchase of fossil fuel firms’ debt, the public itself is an unwilling enabler of thesector’s approach of pursuing profits, no matter the cost.",1,1,Truthout

Citing violations of voting and election laws, representatives of the Brennan Center for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Protect Democracy urged the Department of Justice to protect ballots and prevent voter intimidation.""Ballots that are protected under federal law are in imminent danger of beingstolen, defaced, or irretrievably damaged, and Arizona citizens are in imminent danger of beingsubject to unlawful voter intimidation,"" the foursecurityspecialists wrote in the April 29 letter. The Senate and private contractors hired to conduct the recount failed to ensure the physicalsecurity of ballots by keeping doors unlocked and allowing unauthorized persons to access the ballotstorage facility at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, thespecialists wrote.""We believe that the Senate and its agents ... are violating their duty under federal law to retain and preserve ballots cast in a federal election,"" thespecialists wrote. ""They also risk compromising the integrity of the ballots themselves, using materials and technologies that will cause the ballot paper and marks to deteriorate.""Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward lashed out at the request Friday on YouTube,saying it was a Democratic Party-led effort to derail the audit and wrest control of the election fromstate officials.""Arizona is off limits to the federal government trampling on our constitutional rights and oursovereignty,"" Wardsaid. ""When it comes to managing our own election, we believe in the U. S.

""But they are coming with their lawyers, with their money and with their agenda to attempt to derail this full forensic audit that is being done by qualified experts.""She called the groups ""aggressive and dirty players"" who are ""working with BLM (Black Lives Matter) and Marxist groups to literally destroy our nation.""The letter to the DOJ wassigned byWendy WeiserandHannah Klainat the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law;Wade Henderson, CEO at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; andGenevieve Nadeau, counsel at Protect Democracy. The letter is addressed to Chris Herren, chief of the votingsection of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division. The electionspecialists warned that Cyber Ninjas, the Florida firm hired to lead the $150,000 audit,planned to knock on the doors of Maricopa County votersand collect information related to voter history.""We are concerned ... the Senate and its agents are preparing to engage in conduct that will constitute unlawful voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act and other federal laws,"" the electionspecialists wrote. Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan is a Trumpsupporter who has pushed unfounded election fraud claims as part of the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. Logan told reporters last week he would not touch any ballots. But former Arizona State lawmaker Anthony Kern, whostumped at ""Stop the Steal"" rallies and was at the U. S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection, has been been helping to count ballots for the audit. The Arizona Republic has twice documented Kern's activities at the coliseumsince the audit began eight days ago. About 100,000 ballots had been counted as of Wednesday, when officials gave the last audit update. The audit isscheduled to end May 14, but Senate liaison Ken Bennett indicated it could be extended. Whatever the outcome, the audit will not change election results. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris carried Arizona by 10,457 votes, the narrowest margin of anystate in the country. The results were certified by Gov. Doug Ducey, thesecretary ofstate and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. County officials hand-counted astatisticallysignificantsampling of ballots and conducted two logic and accuracy tests of voting machines. The auditshowed votes were counted with 100% accuracy. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs reiterated concerns Friday about the reliability of the audit and noted that it took a court order to force Cyber Ninjas to release its audit procedures, which the company maintained were proprietary.""Itshould not be asurprise that a company that has neither election experience nor auditing experience is not followingsome of the basic industrystandards and best practices,"" Hobbssaid in astatement.

This process can be reduced to basic triage, butsome newsrooms are prio rit izing narrative reporting as aservice. In 2018, Lyndsey Gilpin launchedSoutherly Magazine, an independent regional publication aimed at ecology, justice, and reframing the coverage of the American South. “Communities—whether they’re rural, or communities of color, or low-wealth—deserve both accurate information and beautifulstorytelling that they cansee themselves in,” Gilpinsays. “The industry underestimates how much people understand and appreciate goodstorytelling. Lovingstories is an inherent human trait.”“Magazines are able to capture the gray areas, the fact that everything is perfectly imperfect,”says Robert Sanchez, aseniorstaff writer at5280Magazinein Denver. When the pandemic hit the US last March, hestarted a Twitter account called City Reads to highlight excellence in local magazine reporting across the country. “Good journalism is good journalism. You don’t have to work atEsquire; there’s great journalism being done in Charlotte.”Still, the traditional magazine model is largely built upon exclusivity. It is limited by thesame conundrum that wracks the industry as a whole: reporting requires resources. And it’s not always enough to produce a goodstory.“No matter how much beautiful journalism I put onSoutherly’swebsite, if it doesn’t reach people, what is the point?” Gilpin asks. “I have found myself backing up to consider what models we can use to actually get to the people we’re trying to reach. When we talk to people living in their news deserts, they just need basic information. How do I contact FEMA? What do I need to do for the next hurricaneseason? How do I test my water?Those are questions that—eventually—could lend themselves to a powerfulstory. The most immediate need is answering them, and that isn’t assexy. But once that trust is built and you’re answering the basic questions, you can really dig intostorytelling. Communities deserve really beautiful, informative, thoroughstories.”Insome ways, nonprofit newsrooms are uniquely positioned to direct resources toward deeply-reportedstories. ForTHE CITY, a New York City-based nonprofit local newsroom,Claudia Irizarry Aponte and Josefa Velasquez wrote 3,500 words in December on Los Deliveristas Unidos, a group of indigenous Guatemalan and Mexican food delivery workers organizing for better treatment. While reporting thestory, Irizarry Apontesays, the reporters were mindful of both their framing and their audience, whichshesees as a group beyond “the pundit class” that includes “all working New Yorkers.”“Westrive to dostories that really highlight people’s ingenuity,” Irizarry Apontesays. “The workers in thisstory aren’t helpless. They’re not voiceless. They’re very active politically. They’re incredibly aware of the forces that areshaping their lives. And they are acting against them.”Thestory took off. THE CITY’s metrics indicated that readers not only clicked on thestory; people really read it, insignificant numbers. “I think often in local reporting, people think that the audience has a reallyshort attentionspan,” Irizarry Apontesays. “Thisshows that people are hungry forstories that are embedded in the community, that really flesh out all the angles of an issue. People do want to read three-thousand-wordstories about delivery workers in New York City. Absolutely.”As local journalism considers what to preserve and what to leave behind, it’s worth considering how to build asustainable model forstories that are deeply-reported, worthwhile––and, yes, beautiful. People are hungry for thesestories. Theyshould be available everywhere, and theyshould reflect everyone. Factual reporting matters;so does compelling narrative.

63,Here is Everything to Know about Current Gun Control Legislation Efforts,-17.33,41.67,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36155972/gun-control-leglislation-austin-shooting/,https://adfontesmedia.com/esquire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-18,23,"In an appearance on CNN’son Sunday, public health expert Dr. Anthony Faucispoke about the current epidemic attacking the United States. No, not that one; the other one. “When yousee people getting killed, in this last month it's just been horrifying what's happened. How can yousay that's not a public health issue?""said Fauci when asked by host Dana Bash if gun violence was a public health emergency. Fauci’s comments came days after a massshooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility left nine people dead, including theshooter, and only hours after a gunman opened fire outside of a bar in Kenosha, Wisconsin, killing three and injuring two. Later on Sunday afternoon, ashooter in Austin, Texas opened fire and killed three civilians. For those who are counting, that’ssix innocent Americans dead within 24 hours in twoseparateshootings. It’s no wonder President Biden recently called America’s woefully predictable pattern of massshootings “a national embarrassment” and urged Congress to take action. At thesame time, the President doesn’t appear to be holding his breath. After theshooting in Boulder, Colorado, he announced aseries of executive orders meant to begin the process of tackling gun violence in America. One of the mostsignificant orders calls for a two-month review of homemade “ghost guns” which expertssay will likely lead to a ban. Ghost guns are handmade fire guns that can either be assembled from a kit or 3-D printed. Because they don’t come with aserial number, the federal government has no way to trace them. Another important order deals directly with a weapon accessory used by the Bouldershooter known as a pistol-stabilizing brace. Stabilizers effectively turn astandard pistol into a deadlier and more accurateshort-barreled rifle. Biden’s order will require pistols withstabilizers to be registered with the federal government and force buyers to go through a more rigorous application process. “There’s no reasonsomeone needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds, 100 bullets, that can be fired from that weapon,”Bidensaid while discussing the executive orders last Thursday. “Nobody needs that.”The president also announced his intentions tostrengthen the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the agency in charge of enforcing federal gun laws, by nominating gun control advocate, David Chapman, to lead it. The notoriously beleaguered agency hasn’t had a directorsince 2015. If confirmed by the Senate, Chapman would be a reliable partner who Biden could count on to enforce new gun control legislation. Thesesteps, though narrow inscope, indicate that Biden is willing to bypass Congress if and when it fails to take action. For the most part, executive orders can only be used to direct current legislation. They cannot create it. For better or worse, the power of lawmaking belongs to Congress. That’s why the NRA and the gun lobby have poured billions of dollars into congressional races for decades. But with the NRA now bankrupt and the Democrats in control of Congress,some lawmakerssense a renewed opportunity to pass meaningful gun control legislation. In fact, the House of Representatives has already voted in favor of twosignificant bills. The first measure expands background checks to include those purchasing weapons over the internet and at gunshows. Currently, neither type of purchase requires vetting. In-store purchases, which account for the majority of gunsales, require a routine background check. Eight Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the legislation. Thesecond bill grants authorities 10 business days to complete federal background checks before a gunsale must be licensed. Currently,sales can proceed if the government fails to complete a background check of a prospective buyer within three days. Only two Republicans voted for the legislation. Gettings bills passed in the House is the easy part. The real hurdle is the Senate. That’s where gun control legislation has historically fallen apart. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hassaid this time will be different and vowed to bring the bills to a vote. For the bills to pass in their current form, Sen. Schumer would have tosecure 10 votes from Republicansenators and also convince Sen. Manchin (D-WV) to vote for them. There’s virtually no chance of that happening. Sen. Manchin already told reporters he opposes the legislation. That means for any legislation to make its way to President Biden’s desk forsigning, congress will have to engage in a process they’re criminally bad at: negotiation. For what it’s worth, minority leader Mitch McConnellsaid he was open to the discussion of gun control but opposed the House legislation. Meanwhile, nearlytwo-thirds of Americanssupportstricter gun laws and over80 percentsupport universal background checks. All of this begs the question: What kind of reforms are Republicans open to and how many more Americans must die before they finally propose asolution?Abigail Covington is a journalist and cultural critic based in Brooklyn, New York but originally from North Carolina, whose work has appeared in Slate,,Oxford American, and Pitchfork",1,0,Esquire

Bus loads of migrantsare being dropped off at busstations in McAllen, Texas with bus tickets to go to their chosen destinations -- amid new reports that authorities arestruggling to cope with the backlog of migrants being allowed into the U. S. Footage captured by Fox News in the Rio Grande Valleyshows Border Patrol dropping off bus-loads of migrants at McAllen Central Bus Station, where they are given bus tickets to travel out of town after they are processed and released from custody with notices to appear at a court or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. At least four bus loads of migrants were dropped off at McAllen’sstation on Saturday in what is the latestsign of the high number of border encounters in June. More than 188,000 migrants were encountered in June. Encounters of family units, meanwhile,surged by 25% to 55,805 from 44,746 in May. Whilesome are being returned via Title 42 public health protections, many more are being processed and eventually released into the U. S. Republicans have blasted the return to what they call ""catch-and-release"" and blamed the Biden administration’s rollback of a number of Trump-era policies like the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) -- which kept migrants in Mexico as they awaited their hearings. The Biden administration describedsuch policies as cruel, and has instead blamed ""root causes"" like poverty, climate change and violence in Central America for thesurge. It has focused on more efficiently processing migrants and releasing them into the interior, whilestill returningsingle adults via the Trump-era Title 42. The New York Postreported that the four bus companies that operate out of McAllen’s central busstation arestruggling to keep up with business due to the number of illegal immigrants being released into the U. S. City Manager Roy Rodriguez told The Post that demand for tickets was at a ""record"" high"" with most of the increase coming from migrants who had come into the country illegally -- leading to delays. The center now accommodates a record average of 7,000 people a week, with about half leaving by bus and the rest by airplane, the Post reported.

66,So you have two passports—do you know how to use them?,-2.0,41.0,https://qz.com/1592529/how-to-travel-with-two-passports/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,25,"Traveling with more than one passport in your pocket always comes with aspy thriller novel-like allure. But it’s also confusing. After all, a passport isn’t just a movie ticket that grants you entry; it establishes your ongoing right to visit, live in, or work in a country. A dual or triple citizen needs to makesure their movements don’t peeve the authorities of the countries they visit. Dominic Volek is a man who knows a lot about passports. He is a managing partner at Henley & Partners, an investment migration firm that advises high-net-worth individuals on the numerous residence and citizenship-by-investment programs around the world. He estimates that up to 80% of the firm’s clientele areseeking asecond passport in order to get visa-free access to a broader range of countries. (For example, passports from Cyprus and Malta are particularly appealing, as they provide investors with an alternative citizenship or residency in an EU memberstate, while Grenada and Moldova allow investors visa-free access to the Schengen area.)However, hesays for all the money and red tape clients wade through, the actual logistics of moving through airports once a client gets theirsecond little blue, red, or green book rarely comes up. “What alwayssurprises me is how few of our clients actually ask the question: How do I use this now that I have it? I wouldsay probably only 10% of our clients actually [ask that].”So, the first question you need to ask yourself when traveling with two passports issimple: Are both of those countries cool with you being a national ofsomewhere else? If they’re not, then traveling with multiple passports is a more high-risk endeavor—one that could get your passport revoked. The good news is that two thirds of the world’s nations already grant this right (high-income nations are more likely to doso) and Volek notes the global trend over the past few years is that more and more countries areseeing the benefit of allowing multiple citizenships. Thesecond thing to keep in mind is “the golden rule,” as Volek put it: “As long as you’re entering and exiting thesame country with thesame passport, then you’re fine.” That means the immigration officials of the country you are visiting (or living in)should only know you by one of your passports per trip. He’s right, of course, but there aresome caveats. The first caveat is what you do at the airline desk. An airline cares about one thing and one thing only: Do you have authorization to enter the destination country they are flying you to? If you don’t, then they are liable to pay to transport you back to where you came from (which they want to avoid). Volek illustrated with an example: Let’ssay you’re a South African citizen living in Singapore on a visa that’s linked to your South African passport. Let’s alsosay you have a UK passport. If you’re flying from Singapore to the UK, you’ll need to check in with the airline using with your UK passport. (If you tried to check in with your South African one, you’d be asked for a UK visa). However, once you move past the check-in desk and you come face to face with Singaporean immigration officials, you need toshow them your South African passport, which contains the visa which grants you the right to be in that country. When you arrive in the UK, you enter on your UK passport. Thesecond caveat has to do with that immigration check. Confusingly, despite having relatively hard linestances towards immigration, the UK and the US are two of just a handful of countries in the world that do not have physical immigration checks when you depart. So even if you wanted to flash thesame passport you used to enter the country to leave it, no one will directly ask you to. (Remember, the airline will only ask for the passport that affords you access to the country they are flying you to, not the one that grants you the right to be in the country you’re leaving.) This can be confusing for travelers, who may feel they have no proof (in the form of a passportstamp) whichshows they didn’t overstay a visa. However, just becausesome countries don’t have “boots on the ground” checks, that doesn’t mean officials are not aware you’re leaving the country. Airlinesshare their flight manifests with authorities before they take off—as do operators ofsea, ferry, or rail journeys—so even if no one ever asked you to flash your passport, they know you left. A Customs Border Patrol official also confirmed for Quartz that officials know about yoursecond passport; that’s why passport applications generally ask you if you possess a passport of another nation. So rest assured: They know you’re gone, with both your passports in tow. Insummary,says Volek, there are two mainscenarios where people need to be cautious about which passport to use. The first is the type that’s likely to affect one of his clients: people who have one passport that is much weaker than the other. This traveler needs to makesureshe is traveling on thestronger passport that grants her visa-free access to the countryshe is visiting. The otherscenario is a question of citizenship and residency. You want to makesure you’re entering the country you live and work in on the passport that grants you the right to do that, even if you could theoretically enter visa-free or visa-on-arrival with your alternative passport. (It’s worth noting thatUS law requires that citizens who are entering or leaving the US “bear a valid United States passport”—even if they don’t live or work there anymore. However, a change in the law that went into effect in 1979eliminated the penalties for this.)While thesecondscenario mayseem like commonsense, it would be easy to assume,say, that if you lost your UK passport or it was going to expire two days before a flight, it’d be fine to enter the UK on your US passport (which would allow you visa-free access anyway). However, Voleksays it’s best to avoid that. Thatsaid, it’s also best practice to always travel with both your passports in your possession. Despite the lingering perception that traveling with two passports is dodgy, it’s not. As long as you’re a citizen of two nations that allow it, you’ve got nothing to hide.

You doubtless have heard that question more than once during the 2020 presidential campaign, post-election drama, and the early days of the Biden administration. Thepresumptionbehind this inquiry has always been,s otto voce, that of course he could not be making his own decisions, they are being made for him, bysome person or persons hidden behind the curtain. And Joe Biden has heard the chatter too – the talk that he’s an emptysuit, controlled by others, transparently in decline, not the man he once was. A marionette manipulated by undisclosed power brokers, likely intent on little more than refilling his oh-so-familiar establishment Swamp which was drained by Trump. What, you thought his aides and family, who for months kept him more hidden than a down-on-his-luckshut-in, were able to block it all out for him? Okay, that’s a rhetorical question, but the new president’sstyle of leadershipso far may actually reveal his own pointed reaction to the notion that he’s in way over his head. Biden’s term, if continued on its present course, would be viewed by objective historians as an imperial presidency – for onesimple reason. He has handed down edicts from on high, requiring only his command, at a record pace. Most of his more than 40 executive orders have been aimed atsanitizing the presidency of Trump and demonstrating to the left that he can keep them at leastsatisfied if not overjoyed. We have postulated here onthat, while both of these objectives were highly predictable, the record-shatteringof executive orders immediately upon taking office wouldsuggest a man who knows his time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue may be limited. But there may well be yet another motivation. Ask yourself how you would react to the widespread notion that you are addled, unable to make decisions, essentially incapacitated to a point perhapsshort of panic but beyond mere concern. Would yousend out thesignal that, yes, I really am pretty weakso I’ll go ahead and let Vice President Harris and congressional leaders play an enlarged role while I recede into the background, thestick figure I’ve been depicted as by my detractors? Or would yousay hell yeah I’m my own man, and I’m as capable as ever ofsetting my own agenda and making my own decisions – whether you are or not? And would not the best way to achieve that objective be to grab the (carefullyset)stage with all manner of early moves requiring only thestroke of your pen – and certain to get major play in the friendly media – while keeping the VP and others whoseek to control you at a comfortable distance?This does not answer the question of who might or might not be exercising outsized influence on this president. As a political lifer and admitted transitional figure – in every way the reverse image of Donald Trump – President Biden understands that the battle tosucceed himstarted the day he was proclaimed president for the one term he is likely toserve, in whole or in part. However, that this president appears laser-focused on removing doubts about his competence at least adds to our limited understanding of the currentstate of mind of a chief executive who was kept more distant from the voters than any presidential nominee in modern American history. Could it be that Joe Biden’s extraordinarilyswift, unilateral, and voluminous decrees are not only his way of leaving his footprints in thesand, but also a desperate attempt to transmit the message that the person who’s pulling his puppetstrings is … the president himself?This article originally appeared on Liberty Nation.

But what is news, is the Biden administration's efforts to play nice with the terror-backing country and its leaders despite knowing what easingsanctions on Iran means for thesafety of Israel, America, and others. As former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noted of Hamas' most recent thank you to Iran, ""America is about tosupply Iran with billions of dollars insanctions relief to continue"" funding terrorist organizations, including Hamas. ""For America'ssecurity, and for that of Israel, this is dangerous,"" he added. And America is about tosupply Iran with billions of dollars insanctions relief to continue this.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) and dozens of his fellow GOPsenators renewed calls for President Biden tostop negotiating with Iran when Hamas rockets were first launched into Israel. Thestrategy of using pressure has worked—and was working during President Trump's tenure—much better than the enticements offered by the Obama administration.

Why are we even consideringsanctions relief for a regime whosestated goal is the destruction of the Jewishstate?

72,An Abolitionist Approach To Addressing Sexual Violence Without Police,-12.8,41.4,https://shadowproof.com/2020/07/15/community-organizers-address-sexual-violence-without-the-criminal-justice-system/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-15,22,"When collegestudent L.saw photos of her feet in a boy’s Snapchat,she feltscared. She had never consented to those photos being taken, let aloneshared on a Snapchat account, where the boy was constructing a romantic narrative for both of them without her knowledge or permission. L.’s friends were furious on her behalf, threatening to beat up the boy who hurt her. When L. realized thesituation might devolve into physical violence,she approached Jasmyn Elise Story’s organization and requested a restorative justice process (locations for thisstory have been kept purposefully vague for the anonymity of the involved parties). Story, an international restorative justice practitioner and the founder ofThe People’s Coalition,started the process of alternative justice—one that does not require the involvement of police or the criminal justicesystem but does require a commitment to accountability—through pre-conferencing with the victim and the boy who harmed herseparately.“Pre-conferencing are the meetings that occur prior to any restorative process before we get to the actual dialogue about how we are going to move forward,” according to Story, who has worked as a restorative justice practitionersince 2014. “We practice and we meet and we work through that conversation ahead of time.”L. was concerned about the boy’ssafety, butshe also wanted to makesure the boy knew how muchshe hurt andscared her. Pre-conferencing asks participants to answer five restorative questions that confront the harm caused: What happened? What were you thinking at the time? What have you thought aboutsince? Who’s been impacted and how?“The firststep [to this kind of process] is to hear thesurvivor, hear their needs—and that doesn’t necessarily mean that we are doing a deep dive in their narrative and theirstory—but to understand what they areseeking and what does justice look like for them, and why they are looking for this particular process,” Story added. After bothstudents had gone through pre-conferencing, L. was told thatshe had options for moving forward. She could meet face-to-face with him, there could be a letter-writing process, orshe could request time and treatment before the conferencingsection of the process, where victim and harm-doer dialogue with each other.“As a practitioner, I’m focused on what thesurvivor is going to need to be able toshow up fully in the process that they choose, if it’s a face-to-face process, if it’s a circle process, if it’s a letter-writing process. My job is to figure out what they need to move forward and be able to participate,” Storyshared. The process can be customizable to make thesurvivor comfortable, Storysaid. Thesurvivor might need time or mental healthsupport, or they might request the harm-doer go through therapy orsubstance abuse treatment before the conference, depending on what the harm was and the needs of thesurvivor. In L.’s case,she decidedshe did not want tospeak to the harm-doer face-to-face and requested that Story brought her answers to the restorative questions to him.“What came out was that he wanted people at home to think he had a girlfriend, and he wasn’t even thinking about the fact that taking pictures without consent,sharing them on the internet without consent, building a narrative that is untrue without consent, issomething that is terrifying. But this absolutely did not cross thisstudent’s mind, and I wouldsay that there weresocial cues that thestudent missed,” Storysaid.“Once this was clarified, thestudent was willing to be fully accountable to this, and he deeply understood that the extension of this process [to him] was reallysomething he needed to be deeply grateful for as well because part of why this was being brought to us was fear of violence against this young man that thesurvivor could not handle being done in her name.”The process ended up being really positive; the harm-doer took responsibility and made the adjustments that were requested by L. and everyone was able to move on. L. also requested that Story inform her friends that justice had been achieved by herstandards and that her needs were beingsupported. L.’sstory is one example of a prison abolitionist approach to gendered harm, where harm against a woman is dealt with outside of the traditional criminal justicesystem. Recent public debates about police and prisons have brought up questions of the usefulness of police and the criminal justicesystem in cases of gendered violence. Critics of the criminal justicesystem and how it deals with rape andsexual assault point out that the currentsystem retraumatizessexual violencesurvivors, that police can often be perpetrators ofsexual and gendered violence themselves, and thatsomesurvivors are incarcerated for fighting back against their abusers. Story is asurvivor ofsexual violence and extremely open about their experiences with the criminal justicesystem and the ways it failed them.“The first thing that happens in a traditional carceral justice process is intake, and the only thing that’s happening to asurvivor is invasive harm,” declared Story.“The gathering of a rape kit is a violent process, it is invasive, and depending on how fresh that physical harm is, it can be extremely, extremely painful. Then you have the fact-finding part of the piece which is even more invasive, where you havesomeone who is allowed to ask you whatever questions they feel relevant. It’s a completely arbitrary process that is to the discretion of whoever issitting across the table from you.”Story and other abolitionists are also critical of the lack ofsupportsurvivors receive from thesystem.“When it comes tosupport in America, in particular where we don’t have robustsocial welfare, what is provided tosurvivors is unbelievably poor. I’ll never forget the neonsheet of paper I was given withservices I could tap into for a limited amount of time that the government was willing to pay,” theyshared. This lack of trauma-informed care andsupport forsurvivors inspired twenty-five-year-old writer Nylah Burton tostart a healing fund for Blacksurvivors who were harmed at Howard University. Burtonsufferedsexual violence on the Howard University campus, and though filing a Title IX complaint against her attacker resulted in hissuspension, the lack of care andsupport compounded by already existing mental health issues resulted in a derailment of her life. She isstill recovering.“The reason that Istarted the healing fund was because I knew first-hand how those assaults can completely destabilize your life in ways that people don’t even think about,”shesaid. “I remember after the first time that I experiencedsexual violence, my mother was incredibly abusive to me becauseshe felt it was my fault. And thatstarted a chain reaction that led to me losing myscholarship [at Howard], being estranged from my parents, having incredibly bad relationship problems, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at thesame time.”Burton’s experience with inadequatesupport and thesubsequent unraveling of her mentalstate is common. It is part of what advocates call the “sexual abuse to prison pipeline.”Astudy from 2004 by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network revealed that if the trauma ofsexual abuse in girls and women is not resolved, it may result in the further development of mental health problems and behaviors that are criminalized.“At the very least you need money to get through that,” Burtonsaid, referring to her fund that providessurvivors with astipend of $5000 for mental health care. Burton mentionedsurvivors might not be able to work for a while or that the assault might result in huge medical bills and impact asurvivor’s career aspirations..“Dealing with the trauma ofsexual assault delays your education, it delaysso much [of your life]. The first person who abused me, he graduated medschool, and I am just now being able tostart this journey of thinking maybe I can go to medschool too, and he’s literally a doctor now. I feel a lot of resentment about that, and I know a lot ofsurvivors who didn’t graduate college and don’t know what they’re going to do next and are financially insecure.”Financial instability and poverty have been proven to increasepeople’s vulnerabilities tosexual violence. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, the prevalence ofsexual assault increases dramatically as annual household income decreases.“The work of healing isso intense,”said twenty-six-year-oldsurvivor Nisa Dang, when asked aboutstructural issuesshe had to battle due to being asurvivor. “Especially assomeone who was unemployed and financially unstable [after the assault], it just added to the process of being retraumatized throughoutso to be able to get astipend tospend it however I need it would have been helpful.”Storysuggested that the difference between a carceral and a restorative process is who is centered.“In a carceral process, the only reason thestate cares about what happened is because the person who harmed you owes thestate for breaking a law,” they added. “That means it’s never about you. It’s never about the harm that you’ve experienced. It’s never about the harm that your family has experienced. It’s never about the punitive damages that you as asurvivor might take on, albeit paying for doctors, therapists, things like that. It’ssolely about how thestate gets repaid for having to go through this.”According to the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN), the vast majority ofsexual assault perpetrators will not go to jail or prison, and a recentsurvey withsurvivors revealed that 20% were afraid of police retaliation for reporting asexual crime. There are issues within the actual police force as well: onestudy revealed that the NYPDundercounted rapesin New York City for years and a 2018study revealed the lack of training of police officers investigatingsexual assaults in Austin, Texas.“The only thing that I ever wanted [after the assault] was the ability to feelsafe again and to live in asociety where it is normalized to discuss harm without it being litigated in court, without it being wrapped up in incarceration,” Dangshared. Collective Action for Safe Spaces (CASS), a grassroots organization in Washington, D. C., recognizes the need forsafety forsurvivors without police. Originally a chapter of Hollaback, an organization thatseeks tostopsexual harassment in publicspaces, CASS works to preventsexual violence without the involvement of police through workshops on masculinity and bystander intervention. It is an example of abolitionist work thatseeks to preventsexual violence before it happens, recognizing that thesocial problem ofsexual violence is more complex and wide-ranging than penetrative rape.“We train local bars and restaurants in the hospitality industry on bystander interventionso ifsomeone is being harassed or assaulted in real time in these publicspaces, the restaurant and barstaff are equipped with the tools needed to intervene directly and in a way that does not involve the police,”stated Je’Kendria Trahan, executive director for CASS. “We also have our Rethink Masculinity program which is an eight-week cohort model where men and masculine of center folks come together to unpack toxic masculinity and rape culture and talk about building accountable communities.”While CASS did notstart as a prison abolitionistspace, Je’Kedriasaid they have organized around abolition and focused on the prevention ofsexual violence because of the harm thesystem causessurvivors looking forsupport.“By virtue of being in the decriminalization [ofsex work]space, we were almost an oddball in the domestic violence andsexual assault world becausesome folks are very invested in carceral feminism,”shesaid. “Because we are now in this political moment of an uprising, it’s really important to make a decision about whatside we are going to be on as folks are calling to de fund the police. Let’s also think about how the money and the resources can be pulled away from the police and away from prisons and allocated into community-drivensolutions that don’t cycle these instances of criminalization and harm.”CASS is an example of abolitionist work thatseeks to preventsexual violence before it happens, recognizing that thesocial problem ofsexual violence is more complex and wide-ranging than penetrative rape. Assomeone expanding their experience as a restorative justice practitioner to other identity-based harms, Story has asimilar perspective on justice and gender.“There isso much gender-based harm, and for the whole world and communities tosolely focus on penetrative rape, penetrativesexual assault. I feel like that doessurvivors a disservice,” theysaid. In many ways, whatsurvivors need to feelsafe is a completely different world.“Everything that [survivors] are asking for issosimple,” Dang concluded. “The idea that I could have a night out with my friends and not have to form a barrier between them and a man. Or that we could be inspaces and be free and that if we were drunk, that was okay, and we wouldn’t beshamed or humiliated or harassed.”",1,1,Shadowproof

76,$15 an Hour Is the Compromise,-14.33,42.33,https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/federal-minimum-wage-stimulus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,25,"Economist Dean Baker reminds us that for the first 40 years after President Franklin Rooseveltsigned the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, the national minimum wage “not only kept pace with inflation, it rose instep with productivity growth.” This progress did not deliver the cooperative commonwealth that progressives hoped to achieve. But it was on an economically, morally, and politicallysound trajectory. Unfortunately, it did not continue. After 1968, Baker explained last year, the minimum wage has not even kept pace with inflation. In fact, while there has been progress at the municipal andstate levels of government, the federal minimum wage has not increased by asingle penny in the past 12 years—since 2009, when it reached $7.25 an hour. What if the minimum wage had kept rising at a rate that respected the contribution of workers? “It would be over $24 an hour today.” So a new Democratic administration could havestarted where the AFL-CIO does, by noting that, “had the federal minimum wage kept pace with workers’ productivitysince 1968 the inflation-adjusted minimum wage would be $24 an hour.” Joe Biden hasn’t gone there. He hasstarted with a modest proposal to raise the wage to $15 an hour instages between now and 2025. This is the definition of incremental progress. “$15 an hour—and by the way, it’s over a four-year period—is not a radical idea,”says Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “If you make $15 bucks an hour, you are not getting rich. But at least, at least, you have ashot to live with a minimum of dignity. You don’t have to have all thestress and pressure that’s on you right now trying tosurvive onstarvation wages.” What the Senate Can Do Theslow march to $15 an hour, as outlined in the American Recovery Act, was always a compromise. And now, the compromise has been imperiled by the Senate parliamentarian’s decision that it is unacceptable to use the budget reconciliation process toset a $15-an-hourstandard as part of Biden’s $1.9 trillion The parliamentarian’s ruling can’t be the end of this fight. The party of FDR must recognize the calculus that Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapalspells out whenshesays, “We made a promise to raise the minimum wage and we now have to deliver on that promise to 27 million Americans who are not going to be much convinced when we go back in two years andsay, ‘Sorry, the unelected parliamentarian told us we couldn’t raise the minimum wage.’” Japayal and her caucus colleagues got Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the House Democratic Caucus to back a version of the ARA that keeps the $15 proposal in the package. She’s now urging Senate Democrats to be just as bold, as is Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, whose no-excuses response to the parliamentarian’s ruling was: “Abolish the filibuster. Replace the parliamentarian. What’s a Democratic majority if we can’t pass our priority bills? This is unacceptable.” On Monday, Omar and Jayapal joined 20 other House Democrats insigning on to a letter to the administration written by California Democrat Ro Khanna, which urged the Senate’s presiding officer—Vice President Kamala Harris—to “refute the parliamentarian’s advice” and keep the 2020 Democratic platform’s “fight for $15” promise. That’s good advice. It is unacceptable to compromise ofsomething that isso necessary, andso popular, as the fight for $15. Unfortunately, Omar’s clarity has not been echoed in the White House response, or that of most Senate Democrats. On Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psakisaid the president was “absolutely committed” to the $15-an-hour wage hike. Yet whenshe was asked whether Harris would overrule the parliamentarian, Psakisaid, “That’s not an action we intend to take.” So what is thestrategy? “We don’t have a clear answer on what that looks like at this point,”shesaid. “It just remains a commitment andsomething he will use his political capital to get done.” That’s a profoundly unsatisfying answer because itsuggests astalemate that is all but certain to lead to talk of compromising for asmaller minimum-wage increase. What’s frustrating about the administration’s response is that the Senate has plenty of options: The White House could rethink its position and recognize that Harris has the authority to reject the parliamentarian’s recommendation—as Vice President Hubert Humphrey did during aspending debate in 1969, and as Vice President Nelson Rockefeller did in 1975. Senator Sanderssays he plans to force a vote on an amendment to the ARA that would have the Senate ignore the parliamentarian and include the wage hike. “My personal view is that the idea that we have a Senatestaffer, a high-rankingstaffer, deciding whether 30 million Americans get a pay raise or not is non-sensical,”says Sanders. “We have got to make that decision, not astaffer who’s unelected,so my own view is that weshould ignore the rulings, the decision of the parliamentarian.” Senate Democrats could finally recognize that it is time for filibuster reform, which would allow passage of thestimulus package and other major proposals with the votes of 50 Democraticsenators and a tie-breaking assist from Vice President Harris. (With the filibuster gone, it would even be possible to pass a freestanding minimum-wage bill, if Democrats could unite on the issue.) An amendment could be added to a futurespending package to be used to raise wages, as has been done in the past. But to keep this option on the table, Harris and Senate Democrats must not limit thescope and character of what are considered acceptable amendments. Even if Options 1 and 2 really are off the table, Bidenshould be talking about what he plans to do next. There has to clarity on moving forward. That clarity must be rooted in an understanding that the fight against poverty wages won’t be won if the White House and Senate Democratic leadersshow anysign of flexibility when it comes to the $15 figure. Unacceptable ‘Compromises’ When “compromises” aresuggested, Biden must explain that $15 an hour is the compromise. This has to be the administration’s bottom line as Republicansenators and Democratssuch as West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Arizona’s Krysten Sinema object that the $15-an-hourstandard is too generous, even if it is implemented on an agonizinglyslow timeline. Recognizing that Americans are enthusiastic about raising wages, the Ebenezer Scrooges of the Senate are already proposing their “alternatives.” Republican Senators Mitt Romney, of Utah, and Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, want a $10-an-hour federal minimum, which is actually less than Arkansas’s existingstate minimum of $11 an hour. Adding insult to injury, the Romney-Cottonscheme would rework existing employment laws to add anti-immigrant requirements. Manchin is onlyslightly more generous; he’s proposing a federal minimum of $11 an hour. That doesn’t even provide a living wage for his own constituents. Howshould Biden respond? Not with negotiations but byseizing the bully pulpit and making the moral, economic, and political case for the rapid adoption of a $15-an-hour wage. Thatshouldn’t be hard. The voters have alreadysignaled that they want to go big. In Florida, on thesame day that Biden lost to Donald Trump, a $15-an-hour proposal won 61 percent of the vote. Instates across the country, red and blue, the fight for $15 won popularsupport. New national polling commissioned by the National Employment Law Project, whichsurveyed 2020 general election voters in the nation’s 67 most competitive congressional districts, has found: Fully 62% of those polled, including 59 percent in the districts won by Republicans, favored raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025. These results reinforce thesuccess of the Black-and-brown-worker-led Fight for $15 movement and the desperate need for at least a $15 minimum wage across the country, while demonstrating that this is a bi-partisan issue and one on which Congressshould take immediate action. Democrats Have to Put Money in People’s Pockets Bidenshould certainly do his best to convince Manchin and Sinema that this is the right time to do the right thing. If that does not work, however, he can go over their heads—to the American people in general, and to the people of West Virginia and Arizona in particular. His argumentshould be a partisan one. You read that right: partisan. The president needs to recognize that, despite everything that Trump’s Republican Party has done to discredit itself, the Democrats are now in a perilous position. “What history has told us is that two years after President Obama won the presidency in 2008 and two years after President Clinton won in 1992, Republicans did phenomenally well. And the reason they didso well was because Democrats had the power, and they did not exercise that power to help working families,”says Sanders. “We cannot make that mistake again.” Biden needs to define the Democratic Party as a political organization that recognizes the immorality of paying full-time workersso little that they arestuck in poverty. And he needs to doso quickly. “We don’t have a lot of time here,”says Jayapal. “The midterms are in two years. We need toshow people that their lives are appreciably better, that we can get control of the virus and we can put money in people’s pockets.” Excuses won’t cut it, morally or politically. As Jayapalsays, “Wesimply cannot go back to the Black, Brown, AAPI, Indigenous, poor and working class voters who delivered us the White House and the Senate majority and tell them that an unelected parliamentarian advised us—based on arcane rules—that we could not raise the minimum wage as we promised.”",1,1,The Nation

78,Maddesyn George Killed Her Alleged Rapist. Prosecutors Blocked Her Self-Defense Claims.,-12.0,44.6,https://theintercept.com/2021/10/08/maddesyn-george-self-defense-rape/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-08,25,"No one disputesthat, on July 12, 2020, Maddesyn Georgeshot and killed Kristopher “Buddy” Graber as he reached through the window of the parked car where George wasseated. It’s the preceding 24 hours that are at issue in court. The arguments between George’s defense team and the U. S. attorney’s office raise the question of whether, in 2021, a rapesurvivor has the right to argue fear for her life andself-defense. Georgesays that, the previous afternoon whenshe was at his house, Graber had threatened her with his gun and then raped her with a vibrator. He onlystopped his assault aftershe convinced him thatshe was hungry and theyshould eat. Not feeling as ifshe could leave,shestayed until he fell asleep. Whenshe left,she took his gun;she also took hisstash of methamphetamine andseveral thousand dollars in cash. She later told police thatshe had decided to take the gun to ensure that he would not be able to threaten her with it again. George, a Colville tribal member, lives on Washington’s Colville reservation. Graber, a white man, lived in Omak, Washington, about 45 miles northwest of the reservation. The day after the alleged rape, according to witness accounts, Grabersearched for George on the Colville reservation with ashotgun, going to three houses beforesomeone told him whereshe was. When Graber found her, George wassitting in a friend’s car. Shestill had his gun.“I was afraid he was going to rip me out of the car andstart beating me up,”she told The Intercept. “I’dseen him do that to other females.”He tried to reach through the car window to grab her. According to witness accounts, Graber hit her. She fired the gun through the window, hitting him in the chest. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. George was arrested. She told tribal and Okanogan County, Washington, police that Graber had raped her the previous day. “I felt they didn’t believe me,”shesaid. She was not offered nor given a rape exam. Instead,she was brought to the Spokane County Jail, in Washington, whereshe remains today. The legalsystem works in binaries,said Leigh Goodmark, director of theGender Violence Clinicat the University of Maryland lawschool and author of the forthcoming “Imperfect Victims: How the Criminal Legal System Punishes Survivors of Gender-Based Violence.” Goodmarksaid that instead of perceiving George as a victim of a crime,several factors led the authorities to instead view her as a criminal.“Had Maddesyn not had a previous record,” Goodmarksaid, “and hadshe notstolen the money and the drugs, police and prosecutors would have likely approached this very differently.”Because theshooting took place on Washington’s Colville reservation, George was charged in federal court. Under the Federal Major Crimes Act, crimes,such as murder and felony assault, that occur on Native territory fall under federal, rather than tribal, jurisdiction. U. S. Attorney Joseph H. Harrington charged George with aslew of crimes ranging from robbery to murder. Stephen Graham, George’s attorney, argues that George’s case is one revolving aroundsexual assault andself-defense. (The U. S. attorney’s office declined to comment for thisstory.)No national or evenstatewide data is kept on how many women are imprisoned or facing charges for defending themselves againstsexual or domestic violence, thoughstudies indicate that experiences of abuse are pervasive among incarcerated women. A2012 report by the Department of Justice found that 86 percent of women in jails had experiencedsexual violence before incarceration. According to the Justice Department, Native people (of all genders)experiencesexual assault at a higher rate than people of other races, including at 2.5 times the rate of white people. Nearly four of five Native victims of rape orsexual assault described their assailant as white. Lack of uniform data and reporting make it difficult to know how many Native people are imprisoned, butstudies indicate that they are disproportionately incarcerated. In Washingtonstate, for instance, Native Americans make up less than2 percent ofstate residents,butover 5 percent of its prison population.

Photo: Michael Siluk/Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesAfter GeorgesaidGraber raped her,she did not go to the police. That’s not unusual. The majority ofsexual assaults are not reported to the police. Only33.9 percent ofsexual assaults were reported to police in 2019, according to the Department of Justice. In a 2021 memorial to missing and murdered Indigenous women, thousands of cardboard red dresses wereset out on thestate Capitol lawn in St. Paul, Minn., to represent the history of abuse, neglect, and killings of Native women across the nation. At the time of her arrest, George was a 26-year-oldsingle mother with a 4-month-old daughter. She was using methamphetamine, which Graber had beensupplying for the past three years. Her previous felony convictions were for drugs and burglary, though thestatute for those convictions was later found unconstitutional. Thoughshe knew of Graber’s reputation for violence, George had never expected him to rape her. “We never had asexual relationship,”she told The Intercept. “He was my drug dealer and that was it.”Whatshe did know was thatshe could not expect help from the police. Whenshe was a child, her uncle was fatallyshot by police while trying toseek help,she recalled. In more recent years, Georgesaidshe wassexually harassed by a deputy at the Okanogansheriff’s office, whosent her unwanted messages and pictures of his genitals. She included these allegations in court exhibits to drive home whyshe decided not to report Graber’s assault: She thought that the police would be unresponsive — thesame as before — hadshe turned to them. There was also her own criminal record and continuingsubstance use. “I didn’t feel they would listen because of the life I was living,” Georgesaid. Her fear is not unfounded,said Earth-Feather Sovereign, founder of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Washington, a nonprofit connected to the awareness-raising grassroots movement. Sovereignsaid police often do not take Indigenous women’s reports ofsexual assault or victimizationseriously.“It has to do withsystematic racism,”shesaid. “A lot of our cases are being ignored — whether domestic violence,sexual assault orsomeone is reported missing or murdered.”For victims who appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol,she added, police often assume that the person was a willing participant rather than a victim ofsexual assault. Goodmark, the law professor, agrees. “We havespent literally billions of dollars training police and prosecutors on various forms of gender-based violencesince the passage of the Violence Against Women Act and theystill can’tsee or won’tsee victimization claims unless they come from people they deem to be credible and true victims,”shesaid. George’s race, as well as hersubstance use and past record, make her a less credible victim in the eyes of law enforcement — a dynamic reinforced by the imbalances of justice on tribal lands and off for members and nonmembers. Sovereign pointed to the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Oliphant v. Suquamish ruling that tribes cannot prosecute nontribal members who commit crimes on reservations. While the alleged rape occurred outside tribal lands, George was on the Colville reservation when Graber confronted andstruck her. Had he assaulted her further, Sovereign pointed out, tribal authorities would have had no ability to arrest or prosecute him and, based on their history of declining to prosecute cases on Native lands, federal authorities would likely have done nothing.

Yvonne Wanrow Swanstands with Colville Confederated Tribe members and others in Kettle Falls, Wash., during a 2020 gathering insupport of a fellow tribal member’s case before the Canadian Supreme Court. Wanrow was the defendant in a casestemming from a 1972 killing that had wide-reaching effects on Washingtonstate jurisprudence involving victims ofsexual abuse. In 1972, Wanrow, a Colville tribal member, was living with her two children in Spokane. One August afternoon, her children were at the home of Shirley Hooper, a family friend. While riding his bicycle, Wanrow’s 11-year-oldson encountered a man who tried to drag him into his house. The boy escaped, but the man, William Wesler, followed the boy to Hooper’s. Earlier that year, Hooper’s 7-year-old daughter had been raped, resulting in asexually transmitted infection. When Hooper’s daughtersaw Wesler,she told her mother, “He’s the man who did it to me.”Hooper called the police. Though they had previously arrested Wesler for molestation, this time, they refused to arrest him. Hooper then asked Wanrow and other relatives tospend the night. Wanrow brought her children and her gun for protection. At 5 in the morning, Wesler, visibly intoxicated,showed up at Hooper’s house tosort out the allegations. The women demanded that he leave. In the commotion that ensued, Wanrow turned around at one point to find Wesler’s imposing figurestanding over her. Sheshot him, he died, and Wanrow was arrested for murder. At trial, the judge instructed jurors to consider only what had happened “at or immediately before the killing.” This excluded both Wesler’s previous record ofsexually abusing children and the testimony of Hooper’s daughter. Wanrow was convicted of murder andsentenced to 20 years in prison. An appeal court, however, decided to vacate her conviction and grant Wanrow a new trial. They found that the judge’s instructions aboutself-defense had not allowed the jury to consider the fact that Wesler was a known child molester, that Wanrow had heard he had previously raped her friend’s daughter, and that, less than 24 hours earlier, he had attempted to grab herson. In 1977, the Washington Supreme Court upheld the vacature.“The justification forself-defense is to be evaluated in light of all the facts and circumstances known to the defendant, including those knownsubstantially before the killing,” the court declared. It furtherstated, “Care must be taken to assure that ourself-defense instructions afford women the right to have their conduct judged in light of the individual physical handicaps which are the product ofsex discrimination.”By then, Wanrow had attracted the attention of women’s and Native American movements, who rallied around her case as one of a woman’s right to defend herself and her family. They formed defense committees across the country, raising public interest and legal funds. In 1978, Wanrow pleaded guilty to manslaughter and assault; the courtsentenced her to five years’ probation.“There wasso muchsupport for her,”said Sovereign, whose mother had been part of Wanrow’s defense campaign. The court decision onself-defense had been a hugestep forward, Sovereignsaid: “She was not only able to create awareness about hersituation, but put in place directions to help all women.”Now, Sovereign and other grassroots groups have assembled the Campaign to Free Maddesyn George,urging federal prosecutors to drop the charges against George.

Screenshot: Courtesy Jody GeorgeFederal prosecutors aren’tshowing anysigns of an inclination toward leniency, let alone dropping the charges — or even consider leniency. Maddesyn visits with her family in their first video visit from prison, one year after her incarceration, in July 2021. On July 6, 2021, prosecutors filed a motion to prevent George and her attorney, Stephen Graham, from including thesexual assault or a theory ofself-defense in his openingstatement. Instead, prosecutors espoused a different motive: that George hadstolen Graber’s gun, drugs, and money, and he wassimply trying to retrieve his property whensheshot him. They argued that the passage of time negates a defense thatsheshot him in the heat of the moment. They dismissed the link between Graber’s act and the killing, writing that “an assault with a vibrator does not justify the use of deadly force one to three days after the alleged assault.”“Forcingsomeone tosubmit to that at gunpoint is rape,”said Graham, the attorney. “It’s not ‘an alleged assault with a vibrator.’”Minimizing the extent of thesexual assault is not unusual,said Goodmark, the law professor. “Police and prosecutors minimize the harms that victims describe. They give other readings of thesituation,”shesaid. “What the prosecutor is telling is astory of robbery by a drug-addicted Native woman, playing intostereotypes aboutsubstance use and Native people to undermine her claim ofself-defense.”Graber had a known history of violence, includingseveral convictions, restraining orders, and violations of those restraining orders for domestic violence. A man who witnessed Graber’sshooting told police that Graber had been known for beating up women. On the afternoon that Graber attacked George, he was awaiting trial for drug and gun charges. He had already been ordered by the courts to not possess firearms or controlledsubstances, orders that he had clearly violated the night before. Prosecutors, however,submitted a motion to limit George and her lawyer’s ability to bring up Graber’s own history of violence.“Because they can ascribe other motives to her, like robbery, the fact that he had been abusive in the past is not important because they don’t care about herstory thatshe wassexually assaulted at gunpoint,”said Goodmark. By July 26, 2021, George hadspent over a year in the Spokane County Jail. Covid-19 hasstopped in-person visits;she could onlysee her family, including her now 1-and-a-half-year-old daughter, through the jail’s video visitingsystem, which frequently malfunctioned. Fearing the possibility of a total 43 years in prison convicted in federal court, George pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of methamphetamine and voluntary manslaughter in Indian country. Prosecutors filed a motion asking the court tosentence George to 17 years, more than federalsentencing guidelines calling for nine to 11 years. Adding to their initial theory of robbery, they argued that, by taking Graber’s drugs, George was engaged in drug trafficking. The allegation became central to their push for harshsentencing: “She discharged a firearm pursuant to that offense and caused a deathso thatshe could keep and even hide the drugsshestole from Graber.”Graham, on the other hand, insists that this is aboutsexual assault andself-defense. He noted that law enforcement — from the initial investigators to the prosecutors — focused on the allegations of drug theft rather than George’s report of rape.“It reinforces the idea that investigators in this country look for perfect victims,” hesaid. “If you’re on the margins ofsociety — if youstruggle with drug abuse — you’re not able to avail yourself ofself-defense in the eyes of the law. Self-defense is only for the NRA members who are in the rotary club with the police chief, not for asex worker or homeless person or drug addict. Everybody has the right toself-defense.”On October 20, a federal judge will decide George’s fate. George plans to address the court directly about what happened last July.

79,Biden administration moving to double tariffs on Canadian lumber despite already skyrocketing timber prices,13.67,39.33,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-double-tariff-canadian-lumber-skyrocketing-prices,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-27,25,"The Biden administration is recommending doubling tariffs on Canadian lumber despite the currentskyrocketing prices for the materials for U. S. consumers.“At a time whensoaring lumber prices have added nearly $36,000 to the price of a new home and priced millions of middle-class households out of the housing market, the Biden administration’s preliminary finding on Friday to double the tariffs on Canadian lumbershipments into the U. S.shows the White House does not care about the plight of American home buyers and renters who have been forced to pay much higher costs for housing,”National Association of Home Builders chairman Chuck Fowkesaid in astatement. The move, which would raise tariffs on Canadian lumber from 8.99% to 18.32%, comes as lumber pieces in the U. S. jumped 275%since last April.“The administrationshould be ashamed for casting its lot withspecial interest groups and abandoning the interests of the American people,” Fowkesaid. BUYING OR BUILDING A HOME CONTINUES TO GET COSTLIERThe finding was also heavily criticized by Canadian authorities, who called the increase a “tax on the American people.”“U. S. duties on Canadiansoftwood lumber products are a tax on the American people. They make housing less affordable for Americans and hinder economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,”said Mary Ng, a Canadian MP and the minister ofsmall business, export promotion, and international trade.“We will keep challenging these unwarranted and damaging duties through all available avenues. We remain confident that a negotiatedsolution to this long-standing trade issue is not only possible, but in the best interest of both our countries,”she added. Canada hassuccessfully challenged U. S. lumber tariffs before, most recently after former President Donald Trump’s administration imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian lumber. That number was brought back down to 9% after the World Trade Organization ruled in Canada’s favor. The Trump tariffs resulted inskyrocketing prices at the time, though from a much lower base than the current prices. But U. S. lumber manufacturers praised the findings,sayingsuch tariffs are necessary to create a “level playing field” for U. S. businesses.“A level playing field is a critical element for continued investment and growth for U. S. lumber manufacturing to meetstrong building demand to build more American homes,” U. S. Lumber Coalition co-chair Jason Brochusaid in astatement.“More lumber being manufactured in America to meet domestic demand is a direct result of the trade enforcement, and westrongly urge the Administration to continue this enforcement,” he added. Deacon Lumber Company founder Stinson Dean urged a “ceasefire” between the countries on the hot button trade issue in hopes that the twosides could come to asolution that will help increase thesupply of lumber to U. S. consumers. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER“In my mind, any tax on Canadian lumber incentivizes them to look tosell to other markets. The U. S. needs all thesupply it can get-and buyers will clearly pay for it-but if it doesn’t exist, it brings construction to a halt. Scarcity is the problem, not price,” Deansaid.",1,1,Washington Examiner
80,Facebook asks the court to dismiss the FTC’s antitrust complaint,0.0,48.67,https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/facebook-asks-the-court-to-dismiss-the-ftcs-antitrust-complaint.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-12,18,"Last fall,after more than a year-and-a-halfof Congressional committee hearings and investigations into the power of technology companiessuch as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, the government released a comprehensive report alleging anti-competitive conduct. The report, which called for a number of “structural remedies”—including that the companies be broken up—also gave momentum to an almost unprecedented number ofstate and federal antitrust actions. One of those w asa lawsuit against Facebook brought by the Federal Trade Commission, backed by an investigation conducted alongside forty-ninestates; thesuit alleged a wide range of monopolistic behavior. When the case was filed, last December,Facebookresponded with a b log post calling the lawsuit “revisionist history” and arguing that it “ignores reality.” On Wednesday, Facebook released a much more comprehensive response: a legal defense and request to dismiss.“No government lawsuitsimilar to this one has been brought in the 130-year history of the Sherman Act, and for good reason,” Facebook’sstatement begins. The FTC “has not alleged facts amounting to a plausible antitrust case” and “ignores its own prior decisions, controlling precedent, and the limits of itsstatutory authority.” In order to make a plausible case for antitrust action,Facebook argues, the FTC would have to prove a) that Facebook dominates a defined market, b) that it has the power in that market to raise prices or restrict output, and c) that it has maintained that monopoly power in ways that harm competition and-or injure consumers. The government’s complaint fails, per Facebook, “because the FTC has not pleaded factssufficient tosatisfy any of the three required elements of a claim.”The FTC, for its part, has no trouble defining the market that Facebook dominates: it’s “personalsocial networking,” or thesharing of photos and other personal information with family and friends. Assome technology journalists have pointed out—including Casey Newton, the author of a Substack called Platformer—FTC’s definitionseemsshaky, though: for one thing, the FTC’s claim ignores the existence of popular ap ps like TikTok, which has managed to build a massive amount of marketshare—eight hundred million users orso by the end of last year. Suchsuccess would be impossible according to the FTC’s definition, if Facebook really has managed tosqueeze out competitors. Facebook’s defense also goes after another problematic aspect of the FTC’s claim: the fact that antitrust activity (as it has been defined by the courts for the pastseveral decades) consists of causing harm by restricting choice and-or raising prices. Thesecond of these is difficult to prove on a consumer level because, as Facebook has taken pains to point out, itsservices are free. That leaves the FTC to argue that price-raising takes place on the advertisingside, or that Facebook causes consumers harm in equivalently bad ways—by,say, invading their privacy andsharing their data with advertisers. That argument was advanced in 2019 byDina Srinivasan, a legalscholar at Yale, in apa per called “The Antitrust Case Against Facebook.” So far, however, it has not been tested in federal court. The FTC’s case is further complicated by the fact that asubstantial amount of its claim rests on the idea that the acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp were anti-competitive in nature, designed to maintain and expand Facebook’s monopoly onsocial networking. But as Facebook points out in its motion to dismiss, the FTC approved both acquisitions—and expressed no problem with them from a competitive point of view. Although antitrust expertssuch as Tim Wu—a Columbia Law professor and former advisor to the FTC who was recently named to Joe Biden’s economic advisory council—havesaid that approving deals does not in any way restrict the FTCfrom questioning them later, doingso means arguing that the FTC eitherscrewed up the first time around or, perhaps, in Facebook’s terms, is trying to revise history. That doesn’t mean Facebookshouldn’t bescrutinized and kept in check—it certainly has plenty of bad behavior to answer for—but the FTC will likely need to keepsearching for another way.

81,A Letter to Black America on the Anniversary of George Floyd’s Death From Poet Tracy K. Smith,-7.67,35.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/george-floyd-death-anniversary,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,23,"Dear Black America—I hear the birds outside in thespring air, and there is a part of me that can’t believe we’ve made it this far. It’s been a yearsinceGeorge Floydwasstolen from his family and from us. A yearsince the whole worldsqueezed into the theater of our grief. What have we lived through? Where have we been?None of our losses were new. The ever-lengthening list of Black lives cutshort by brutality, by fear, by racialized hate. Like a terrible procession, making itsslow march through the ages. My grandparents knew it. Perhaps yours did too and theirs. My parents told mestories about how this form of loss had touched them growing up in Alabama in the 1930s and ’40s. Suchstories were a way of warning me that justice was not guaranteed. Perhaps they alsosought to underscore the enduring traumasuch injustices instigate—how, even in loss, our Black lives continue to matter. All manner ofstories were lumped together—like the one about my mother’s uncle or great-uncle who, in the early 1940s, had made a good deal on thesale of timber felled from his own land. At the end of a nightspent celebrating his gains in a bar, he wasshot and robbed by a white man who’d caught wind of the fortune in that uncle’s pockets. “Did the white man go to jail?” I asked, before I had learned enough to know that’s not how thesestories ever end. But there was another kind ofstory too. When I was in my first orsecond year at Harvard, in 1990 or ’91, one of my mother’ssisters pulled me aside to tell me thestory of B., a cousin who had attended Harvard in the early 1960s. If I’m remembering correctly, B. had lasted there barely a year. The proof of the psychic toll that place in that particular time had had upon her was thatshe had been found walking across campus one afternoon barefoot in thesnow. Somehow herstory, in its telling, was equal instrife to that of my mother’s uncle. Of course B. had gotten out with her life, but there was no way, my auntseemed to besaying, to measure the psychic toll of what our cousin had endured or to know whether the damage of that time had come to an end. These familystories were meant to be extrapolated upon. I was meant to extract from them not just a private warning about how to protect myself, and whom it was unsafe to trust, but also a larger form of knowledge. I was meant to understand that our familystories were but a minuscule part of a centuries-old collective body of knowledge built ofstruggle, punctuated by loss, and kept alive by love. I was meant to understand unreservedly that ourstories were indispensable to the fullstory—the truestory—of America, astory America itself was unwilling to tell. But for a long time, all this knowledge did was coalesce into a painfulspot in my mind, asite I tended toshy away from. If I’m being honest—with myself, with you—for a long time I coped with that particular pain by attempting to numb the area of my mind where itsat. On the night thatMichael Brown’s murderer was acquitted, I muted my rage, telling myself I had long ago been told (“Did the white man go to jail?”) what the verdict would be. I believe this numbness, this muting of feeling, was an attempt atself-protection. What would I have known to do with the force and the weight ofsuch actual pain if I had been willing to truly claim it or claim a right to it? Would I have let it chase me out into thestreet or out barefoot in deepsnow?Our familystories were but a minuscule part of a centuries-old collective body of knowledge built ofstruggle, punctuated by loss, and kept alive by love. I have always felt ashamed of my tendency towardsilence, my habit ofseeking tosettle the emotions wishing tostorm up and out in reaction. So I was eager to let this past year, with its convergence of crises, change me. The past year,so frequently andso inaccurately labeled unprecedented, was like astorm hammering down on all of us at once, held as we were at home in lockdown. In its conflagration of deaths—to police brutality and tosubtler but no less virulent forms of racialized disregard—historyseemed to be insisting that we acknowledge how little had changed:Itseemed that the age-old patterns my parents had insisted Isee were registering in the collective imagination. Not as proof of how things had always been but as an argument for how things must begin to change. The world’s watching, and its reacting, refused to let me retreat into numbness. Thanks to activists in Minneapolis, New York, D. C., and communities across the country, I felt myself to be in astrange new Now that was bound up—this time willingly and actively—with the past. History, no longer behind us, was right there, nudging us to act. And act we have. Even in moments of peace, I feel now the guiding presence of history. Savoring a delicious meal, I am for a flicker of a moment a child again at my mother’s table. Snuggling next to one of my children at bedtime, I feel myself be wrapped up again in the cherishing crucial to my own experience of childhood—the tenderness and instruction intended to buoy me through day after day, to keep me intact in a world whereso much would be intent upon my diminishment., historyseems tosay. And, finally, I obey. Black America, I’m trying to make or preserve thespace where the We of Blackness can count on the wider, whiter world to have our backs. But I’m also wary ofsuch trust. How many times in this verysame year, in moments where my advocating forsmaller justices—in the literary community or on the campus where I have long taught—was met by attack, have I been made to feel thesilence of my white peers as a form of annihilating violence?Chasteningly, it is in those very circumstances—in the pain of feeling betrayed—that I’ve been made tosee how dangerous for us all the tendency to muteness and the ability to go numb can be. My own included. Black America and all of us willing to honor and protect Black life: We know how exhausted this year has left us. We also know ourstrength. We know our laughter is a way of digging into the work to be done. And we know asong or a poem or a prayer cansummon others nearso all the many of us can work together as one. Black America and all of us willing work not just in the here and now of our own time but in the wake of the labor of generations past: Mammoth is our task. I believe it will keep us busy into generations yet to come—our waves rippling out to merge into theirs, even if you and I are, by then, elsewhere. When I am overwhelmed, as I amso often this year, I close my eyes. Once, in what must have been a plea or prayer for help, I watched as thesilhouette of a woman bathing in a river or lake tookshape in my mind’s eye. I watched her in her wading, her diving and rising. Never facing me. Her back andshoulders rippling with agency. Then I felt a message rise in my mind:Black America and everyone who understands that a cherishing of Black life is essential to the enterprise of democracy: I’m talking to us, all of us. As we didso often in the past year, we find ourselvesstandingshoulder toshoulder—now in flesh, now inspirit—called upon to manifest the possible. Is it possible for us to reseed the imagination not just of ourselves but of our entire nation? Is it possible to fill it with tall climbing vines that lift oursights up from where they’ve been?",1,1,Vogue

The idea of de funding police is rooted in the decades old prison abolitionist movement. In the midst of increasing protests, and increasing police violence against protesters, It’s become a topic of national conversation.“The movement is aimed at creating a world where publicsafety is not defined by police and crime but how communities use their resources to care for each other,”said Ralikh Hayes, Deputy Director of Organizing Black, a grassroots member-led collective demanding Baltimore cut policespending in half to fund education andsocialservices in disinvest ed Black communities.:Democratic and Republican leadership hasso far rejected the idea of de funding the police, “The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms,”presumptive Democratic nomineeJoe Bidensaid in a USA Todayop-edpublished Thursday. However,it continues to catch fire in cities across the country. President Donald Trump has falsely accused Biden ofsupporting de funding the police. Instead Biden has proposedspending an additional$300 million on community policing, along with reforms that activists have rejected as ineffectual.“We know that policing in this country hasn’t worked for a long time and Biden’s responseshows how out of touch the Democratic Party is with its base of Black people,” Hayessaid. Grassroots pressure has resulted in victories on a local level. A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Councilsupports disbanding its police department. Mayors in Los Angeles and New York have vowed to cut their multi-billion dollar police budgets to invest in local communities. In Baltimore, activists and progressive council people targeted recent week-long budget hearings to highlight excessive policespending in the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget, which is greater than education, healthcare and civil rights combined. Budget hearings begin Monday morning. Here’s a quicksampling of how your money is proposed to bespent.pic.twitter.com/zrxz4zs9it— Ryan Dorsey (@ElectRyanDorsey)June 5, 2020For the 2020 fiscal year, the citybudgeted$536 million for the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) versus $278 million for public education (Baltimore City Schools’ FY20budget was $1.1 billion, the majority of which is funded through thestate). Baltimorespendsthe most per capita on police among large cities. City Council President Brandon Scott, recently declared the winner of the June 2 Democratic primary– which effectively decides the election — told The Real News he is committed to reducing policespending and increasingspending onsocial programssuch as education. Scottsays he’s identified tens of millions of dollars of potential cuts in the police budget, urging Mayor Jack Young in a June 8letterto “re-allocate its budget away from the current dependence on the police department.”“We must reinvest these dollars in our historically under funded neighborhoods by building a new, more equitablesystem and bringing our budget into greater alignment with our values as a city,” Scott wroteYoungrespondedby cautioning “against making any dramatic cuts that may result in unintended consequences for the City of Baltimore.”Due to Baltimore’s ‘Strong Mayor’system of governance, only the mayor has power to add money to the budget, the council can only cut funding. Hayes, who is helping organize a protest on June 12, the day the Council will vote on the police budget,said Scott’s proposal was not enough but organizers were open to having a dialogue with him. Organizing Black is also demandingstate lawmakers turn over control of the Baltimore Police Department to local authorities. The conversation around de funding police has alarmedsome prominent journalists and commentators, who note that relative to L. A. or New York, Baltimore’s crime and homicides rate remains high, even as crime rates have dropped across the country. The Baltimore homicide unit is utterly overwhelmed, with detectives carrying far too many cases each. Closure rates are down around 30 percent. Justsomething to consider during the “abolish/defund” debate.— Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis)June 6, 2020But activists argue grassroots-led efforts that operate on ashoe-string budget have far better results in reducing violence than Baltimore’sscandal-ridden police department.“We know for a fact that programs like Safe Streets, community mediations…work, and need to be brought toscale,”said Hayes. Studies have found the Baltimore Ceasefire movement, which fights violence through outreach, connecting vulnerable populations with resources and by building community,reducedshootings by 52 percent. Meanwhile Safe Streets has been credited with reducingshootings by over 50%. Hayessays opposition to de funding the police is rooted in racist views that Black communities need policing instead of the investment in education and othersocialservices given to affluent, white communities.“Itshows that they are not ready to redefine what publicsafety looks like,”says Hayes. “I challenge them to follow Black leadership, and trust we have thought about this for a while and that we’re ready to create a pathway to make that happen.”Leading calls to de fund the police are The Youth, an organization of young people in Baltimore who have led aseries of marches that have brought thousands into thestreets. Thousands took to thestreets of Baltimore as part of a youth-led protest to demand justice for#Georgefloydand all victims of police brutality.@jaisalnoorreportspic.twitter.com/Fu4ou8dqJu— The Real News (@TheRealNews)June 2, 2020“We decided this is now or never. As Black youth, our lives are on the line,”said A’niya Taylor an 11th grader at City College High School, who helped organize a June 10 march from The School for the Arts to the City Schools Headquarters. Taylor’s demands include cutting the police budget to fund clean drinking water inschools, increased mental healthcare forstudents, and a culturally relevant curriculum that empowers Blackstudents. The crowd is now observing 8 minutes, 46seconds ofsilence.@wjzpic.twitter.com/9kHD9Zy62c— Avajoye Burnett (@AvajoyeWJZ)June 10, 2020The Youth are also demanding an end to the presence of police inschools. In recent yearsstudents in Baltimore have marched to demand more funding for education, the lack of adequate heat and air conditioning in classrooms, gun violence, to demand action on climate change and to oppose arming police officers inschools.“There’s a chance if we don’t do this, we could be the next victims of police brutality,” Taylorsaid. Many, including parent-activist Melissa Schober have noted Baltimore City’s investment in policing pales in comparison to its investment in youth, whilespending more than $7 million dollars a year on its ownschool police force. Baltimore is the only jurisdiction in Maryland with its ownschool police force.“Given the economic downturn, it’s really, concerning that we’re going tospend $7 million ofscarce resources…on a police force,” Schobersaid. She explained that Baltimore Cityschoolstudents meanwhile, don’t have drinkable water, efficient HVAC, textbooks, lap tops or internet access. Officials in Prince George’s County, Maryland announced they were joining a growing number of districtssuch as Minneapolis and Portland to removeschool resource officers (SRO) fromschools. On June 10, the Maryland Office of the Public Defender joined that demand.“We cannot wait for a catastrophe at the hands of an armed police officer in ourschools to make a change,” OPD’sstatement read. “By removing SROs from ourschools, this Board can take the first importantstep in dismantling theschoolsecurity apparatus, and reimagineschools without police. Together, we can create thesafeschools ourstudents deserve.”Eleventh grader Taylorsaid that policesimply aren’t necessary inschools.“I feel likestudents don’t need police, we go toschools to learn, for a lot ofstudentsschools are asafe place for us, ” Taylorsaid. “When wesee police officers it’s a fear factor, weshould invest in guidance counselors and prevention teams,”shesaid.

84,The EPA Just Announced A $50 Million Push To Help Underserved Communities Tackle Pollution And Get Jobs,-7.33,48.33,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/regan-epa-environmental-justice-money,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-25,25,"“This is the most aggressive approach to tackling environmental injustice and equity issues,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan told BuzzFeed News. BuzzFeed News ReporterEPA Administrator Michael Regan testifies in front of Congress on June 9, 2021. The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled $50 million in new funding on Friday to help low-income and communities of color most impacted by pollution, the climate crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the Biden administration’s first bigspending blitz on environmental justice, which has formed a cornerstone of his climate policy. And it represents a dramatic increase in funding on an issue largely ignored by the Trump administration.“This is the most aggressive approach to tackling environmental injustice and equity issues,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan told BuzzFeed News ahead of Friday’s announcement. “And from the White House to the EPA, we are turning the words into action and we are really excited to get these resources into the hands of communities.”Congress allocated $100 million to the EPA to go towards environmental justice initiatives as part of the latest COVID aid package, the American Rescue Plansigned into law in March. Friday’s funding announcement identified how the first half of that money will bespent, and the agency plans toshare details on the next $50 million later thissummer. The largest chunk of the money — $16.6 million — will go to environmental justice grants to help cities,states, tribes, and territories to fund education on pollution’s impacts on the environment and public health, as well as training community members to get jobs in the environmentalsector.“What we’ve allseen firsthand is that COVID-19 has magnified the daily injustices facing communities of color, low income communities, thesame communities that willsuffer disproportionately from climate change, who face higher rates of heart and lung disease,” Regansaid. Somestudies havesuggested that people living in places across the country with dirty air are more likely to die from COVID-19 than those living with less pollution. Coming in as the first Black man toserve as EPA administrator, Regan vowed to make environmental justice a priority, just as he had in his previous role as the head of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. For Mustafa Santigao Ali, the former EPA environmental justice head under the Obama administration, this funding announcement is long overdue. The Trump administration curbed pollution enforcement, watered down car and power plant pollution rules, and evensuspended diversity training programs, all of which “actually deepened and widened thesacrifice zones across the country,” Alisaid.“It’s great tosee for the first time there’s going to besignificant resources for these varioussets of programs,” hesaid, adding that today’s funding levels are “magnitudes larger” than what he had to work with at the agency. Regan is announcing this new funding from a water filtration plant in Baltimore, noting that $200,000 is going to a program there called YH20 that trains people from diverse backgrounds to get jobs in water management. Since launching in 2015, YH20 has trained nearly 100 people between the ages of 18 and 24 in local water management. Upwards of 85 of them arestill working within Baltimore’s Department of Public Works, according to Yolanda Winkler, who helps run the mentor ing and training program. The money from the EPA will help the program “expand in a real andserious way,” Winklersaid, including increasing how many people can participate.“YH20 and organizations like them are the perfect organizations to receive the money, to not only relieve the pressure that has been exacerbated by COVID-19, but to relieve pressures that have been present for generations,” Regansaid. Some of the additional grant money will go to groups including the Tohono O’odham Tribal Nation in Arizona to help develop plans to address air quality problems, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management to boost awareness about air pollution and disinfectants, and theLos Angeles, California housing authority to fund a pilot program boosting worker awareness about asthma. Additionally, $7 million is going to the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act rebate program to fund electricschool buses in underserved communities, $5.1 million is going to expand civil and criminal enforcement of air and water polluters, and $5 million is going to help cleanup brown fieldsites. And to help the EPA, which lost hundreds of employees during the prior four years, about $1 million of the money is going towards “administrative costs.”“A lot of it will go toshoring up our basic infrastructure to makesure we have equity and environmental justice included” in the agency’s work, Regansaid. But he acknowledged that even more resources are needed for the EPA to truly address these issues, and hopes the president’s proposed 2022 budget goes further to help fill the gaps.",2,1,BuzzFeed News

Against thissupposed“threat,”the Justice Department has asked for new powers of prosecution, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed that right-wingers and conservatives,“inspired by foreign terrorist groups”and“emboldened by the breach of the US Capitol Building,”are“plotting attacks against government facilities”and“threatening violence against critical infrastructure.”In addition to their own powers, the DHS, FBI, and National Security Council also want to hire third-party ‘researchers’ tospy on Americans, recent reportshave claimed. Though the riot on Capitol Hill was broken up in a matter of hours and Congress returned to work thesame evening, the FBI has left nostone unturned in finding and prosecuting hundreds of Trumpsupporters who took part. Out of more than 500 arrested already,some we returned inby their own family members andco-workers, with those who merely entered the building charged alongside militia members in what prosecutors areterminga“shock and awe”campaign of arrests and charges.

By the next day, over a thousand people had registered, and that was only the beginning. Now knownsimply as Facebook, thesite quickly ballooned into one of the mostsignificantsocial media companies in history. Today,with 244 million combined monthly active users in the United States and Canada, Facebook is the most popularsocial network in the United States. But like any 17-year old, Facebook has changedsince it’s infancy. Consider how its missionstatement has evolved over time:– Thefacebook is an online directory that connects people throughsocial networks at colleges. [Limited to your own college or university]– The Facebook is an online directory that connects people throughsocial networks atschools. [Now there are two Facebooks: one for people in college and one for people in highschool]– Facebook is an online directory that connects people throughsocial networks atschools.– Facebook is asocial utility that connects you with the people around you [Facebook is made up of lots ofseparate networks – things likeschools, companies, and regions]– Facebook is asocial utility that connects you with the people around you. [upload photos or publish notes – get the latest news from your friends – post videos on your profile – tag your friends – use privacysettings to control whosees your info – join a network tosee people who live,study, or work around you]– Facebook is asocial utility that connects you with the people around you.

When Facebook was a cute toddler everyone loved him, but he has grown into an obnoxious teen, who through lack of discipline, has become a bully. Facebook’s bad behaviorstartedslowly, almost imperceptibly. It is hard to pinpoint exactly when it began, but atsome point conservative individuals and groupsstartedseeing a decline in engagements with their posts. Laura Evans, a marketing consultant in the firearms industry, has been using Facebooksocially and professionally for more than a decade. She was among the first users to discover Facebook’s content bias.“In my work with companies and manufacturers in the firearms industry,selling anything on Facebook is impossible,” explained Evans. “The only way we’ve been able to get around that is through working withsocial media influencers, but even they are beingstifled. They are getting kicked off left and right.”With the advent of content neutralsitessuch as Parler,conservatives were able tosee for the first time how Facebook wassuppressing their content. Evans elaborated, “Years ago I talked to a major firearms manufacturer whosaid Facebook was just a failure for them. At one point they were getting 100,000 views per post and their engagement was through the roof. Then overnight, it vanished and they were lucky if they got a thousand views per week. That’s half-a-million fans no longer able to enjoy content from a company they chose to follow.”More recently, Facebook, emboldened by the lack of push back on their covert efforts to censor conservative content, began to overtly censor and ban content and users. The mostshocking takedown, of course, was of President Trump’s account. But prior to that, Facebook began placing warning labels on political content. In recent months,so many conservatives have been restricted on Facebook, it has becomesomewhat of a badge of honor among conservatives to be placed in “Facebook jail.”Facebook’s actions are at odds with at least one of its core principles,“to give people a voice.” According to itswebsite, “People deserve to be heard and to have a voice — even when that means defending the right of people we disagree with.”At age 17, Facebook has high ideals, which perhapssomeday it will live up to.",1,0,Daily Torch
87,"The Trump charges look small potatoes, and the Republican base will shrug | Lloyd Green",1.33,35.5,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/02/trump-tax-charges-republicans-allen-weisselberg-lloyd-green,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"On Thursday, Manhattan prosecutors charged the Trump Organization, its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, and the Trump Payroll Corp with engaging in ascheme to defraud federal,state and local tax authorities. According to the indictment, Weisselberg failed to pay taxes on $1.7m in income and benefits. Thescheme purportedly dated back to 2005. On the other hand,Donald Trump, Weisselberg’s boss, appears to haveskated. He is not named as a defendant even though he makes a cameo in the body of the indictment. Allegedly, “personal checks drawn on the account of andsigned by Donald J Trump, and later drawn on the account of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust dated April 7, 2014” went for tuition payments of Weisselberg’s family. Other alleged undeclared benefits received by Weisselberg included lease payments on his Mercedes, housing and cash. For the moment anyway, Cyrus Vance, the district attorney for Manhattan, appears to lack the goods to nail the former president. Relativelyspeaking, an elephant gave birth to a mouse. Beyond that, Vance’s office did not bring racketeering charges against Trump’s eponymous company. Arguably if the district attorney had the goods he would have brought the mostserious charges on the first go around. Significantly, the indictment did not trigger a default under Deutsche Bank’s loan documents. Trump and his lenders can exhale, a little. Right now, the prospects of forfeiture and foreclosure and the necessity of refinancing Trump’s loan packages are notstaring back at them. By the metrics ofscandal, the alleged crime is decidedly underwhelming. Wrongfully taken over tax deductions are quintessentially human, let alone Trumpian. In case anyone forgot, Trump isstill undergoing a years-long IRS audit over claimed deductions. The Republican base willshrug. Likewise, givingsweetheart deals to key employees and favored others is textbook New York, a textbook that Trump himself helped write. Back in the day, the day being 2003, a younger Trumpreportedly assistedMarjorie Harris – a close personal friend of the Rev Al Sharpton – to obtain a luxurysublease in a Trump building without undergoing astandard credit check. Harris’s financials were not necessarily robust, but at the time Trump was focused on keeping Sharpton happy. In a hyper-transactional world, tuition and cheap housing for the Weisselberg clan were rewards for years ofservice and loyalty. There’s a reason Weisselberg is known as Trump’ssoldier. He is no Michael Cohen. Rather, Weisselberg is a limelight-avoiding accountant who hasso far refused to cooperate with prosecutors. Yet with Weisselberg taking one for the team, thespirit of Roger Stone and Paul Manafort lives on. And we know how that worked out – both men received presidential pardons. But this time Trump is out of office and the chargesstem from purported violations of New York’s penal law, not the US code. Weisselberg was released on his own recognizance. The guy is no menace tosociety. As for the midterms, the indictment won’t hurt the Republican party’s chances. Team Trump and his party will be able to claim “witch-hunt” with a modicum of credibility. All thosesubpoenas and document productions have yielded little. Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, may even want to put his presidential ambitions on hold until 2028. A year ago, the USsupreme court rejected Trump’s contention that he was immune from investigationsimply because he lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Writing for aseven-person majority, Chief Justice John Roberts opined: “No citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.”Justice Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, put things moresuccinctly in a concurrence joined by Justice Gorsuch, another Trump appointee: “In oursystem of government, as this court has oftenstated, no one is above the law. That principle applies, of course, to a president.”In hindsight, it allsounds a tad overblown. The only member of the Trump Organization facing criminal charges is Weisselberg. Looking back, Weisselberg must be asking: was it worth it? After he was led into the courtroom in handcuffs, we can only guess his answer. Still, don’t bet on him flipping. And as trials go, this one is looking mesmerizing ly dull. Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush’s 1988 campaign andserved in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992",1,1,The Guardian

And currently, ""[e]verystage of this international assembly line is breaking down in its own unique way.""This is all coming to a head right now, and the effect for consumers is an early commercial Christmas.

Are we justskipping Halloween this year?""Actually, yes: While people bespending the week of Oct. 11thshopping for Elsa costumes and12-foot-tallskeletons, it's looking more like Dec. 18 out there. Stores are pushing customers to place their holiday orders now — or, preferably, yesterday —due to limitedstock. Booksellers, who rely on wintersales to put them in the black for the year, are alarmed by publishing delays, compounded by papershortages, on top of the globalsupply chain choke. ""October is the new December,"" the American Booksellers Association has declared, reusing theslogan it rolled out amid earlysigns ofstock issues last year. EvenChristmas trees may be inshortsupply.

Tasked with holidayshopping weeks away from the all-encompassing frenzy of Black Friday and forced to consider what I want to buy for December in October, I've had a clear-eyed reckoning with the amount of unnecessary consumption I do this time of year. And while I'm asecular celebrant, Ishare my former colleagueMatthew Walther's unease over the way we've historically ""allow[ed] corporate marketing departments toset the tempo of our existence.""I'd like to think thissupply chain crisis will be a turning point for Americans, an opportunity for us to collectively remember that the holidays aren't actually about what's under the wrapping paper.

But maybe, in the flash of irritation that comes from checking the tracking number of ashipment that's making no progress orscanning the bareshelves of a localstore, we'll briefly recognize our own entitlement.

92,Some States Curb Public Access To COVID-19 Statistics Amid Uptick In Cases,-3.67,41.67,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-covid-statistics-cases-hospitalizations-deaths_n_60fc26b4e4b00c1de0a20b10,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Severalstatesscaled back their reporting of COVID-19statistics this month just as cases across the countrystarted toskyrocket, depriving the public of real-time information on outbreaks, cases, hospitalizations and deaths in their communities. Theshift to weekly instead of daily reporting in Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota marked a notableshift during a pandemic in which coronavirus dashboards have become astaple for Americans closely tracking case counts and trends to navigate a crisis that has killed more than 600,000 people in the U. S. In Nebraska, thestate actuallystopped reporting on the virus altogether for two weeks after Gov. Pete Ricketts declared an end to the official virus emergency, forcing news reporters to file public records requests or turn to national websites that trackstate data to learn about COVIDstatistics. Thestate backtracked two weeks later and came up with a weeklysite that providessome basic numbers. Other governments have gone the other direction and released more information, with Washington, D. C., this week adding a dashboard on breakthrough cases toshow the number of residents who contracted the virus after getting vaccines. Manystates have recently gone to reporting virus numbers only on weekdays. When Florida changed the frequency of its virus reporting earlier this month, officialssaid it madesense given the decreasing number of cases and the increasing number of people being vaccinated. Casesstartedsoaringsoon after, and Florida earlier this week made up up one-fifth of the country’s new coronavirus infections. As a result, Florida’s weekly releases — typically done on Friday afternoons — have consequences for the country’s understanding of the currentsummersurge, with nostatewide COVIDstats coming out of the virus hotspot forsix days a week. In Florida’s last two weekly reports, the number of new casesshot up from 23,000 to 45,000 and then 73,000 on Friday, an average of more than 10,000 day. Hospitals arestarting to run out ofspace in parts of thestate. With cases rising,Democratsand other critics have urgedstate officials and Gov. Ron DeSantis to resume daily outbreak updates.“There was absolutely no reason to eliminate the daily updates beyond an effort to pretend like there are no updates,”saidstate Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from the Orlando area. The trend of reducing data reporting has alarmed infectious diseasespecialists who believe that more information is better during a pandemic. People have come to rely onstate virus dashboards to help make decisions about whether to attend large gatherings or wear masks in public, and understanding the level of risk in the community affects how people respond to virus restrictions and calls to get vaccinated.“We know thatshowing the data to others actually is important because the actions that businesses take, the actions thatschools take, the actions that civic leaders take, the actions that community leaders take, the actions that each of us individually take are all influenced by our perception of what the risk is out there,”said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who leads the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. But reporting the numbers on a weekly basisstill allows people tosee the overall trends whilesmoothing outsome of he day-to-day variations that come from the way cases are reported and not the actual number of new cases. And experts have long advised that it makessense to pay more attention to theseven-day rolling average of new cases because the numbers can vary widely from one day to the next. And Florida health officialssay that they have not curtailed thesharing of data with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maintaining daily updates on the virus does requiresignificant resources forstates. For instance, Kansas went to reporting virus numbers three times a week in May because thestate health departmentsaid providing dailystatistics consumed too much time for its already overwhelmedstaff. In Nebraska, officials decided that continuing to update the virus dashboard daily wasn’t the best use ofstate resources now partly because there had been asteady decline in the number of views of the website indicating less interest in the numbers,spokeswoman Olga Dacksaid. Thestate could return to providing daily updates if the governor’s office decided that was needed,shesaid.“Now that Nebraska is back to normal,some of thestaff that has been dedicated to the dashboard has been able to focus onsome of the other important issues,” Dacksaid. State health departments have a long history of providing the public regular updates on other diseases like flu and West Nile, but those viruses have none of the political baggage associated with COVID-19. In Florida, a former health department employee was fired last year after publiclysuggesting that managers wanted her to manipulate information on coronavirusstatistics to paint a rosier picture. The employee, Rebekah Jones, did not allege any tampering with data, but her commentssowed doubts about the reliability of the metrics. Infectious diseasespecialist Dr. David Brett-Majorsaid that for many people, national websitessuch as the one run by the CDC can be a goodsource of data on the lateststate trends and weekly updates could be OK. The World Health Organization often uses weekly updates, but hesaid they do that for practical data management reasons, not political ones. Hesaid the message Nebraskasent when it ended its dashboard that thestate emergency was over and conditions were returning to normal was troubling.“The main problem is that it reflects a disinterest in pandemic risk management,”said Brett-Major, with the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists,said part of the problem is that public health officials generally don’t havesophisticated datasystemsso it is more labor intensive to produce the daily dashboards. Even though public health agencies have money for operations at a time when pandemic governmentspending is flush, they haven’t necessarily had the chance to upgrade.“It would be great if daily reporting could be made widely available, but public health would have to be funded better to do that and right now that is just not the case,”said Hamilton. And even instates where virus numbers aren’t being reported publicly every day health officials arestill looking at the latest data, Hamiltonsaid. But at a time when the delta variant is, in the words of the CDC director, “spreading with incredible efficiency,” Bibbins-Domingosaid it is important that everyone cansee the latest trends and understand the risks.“Even if we know that they are available to decisionmake rs on a daily basis, there is considerable value to providing the data to the public,”shesaid.

93,DOJ: Arizona recount may violate federal law,-3.67,45.0,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/may/6/doj-arizona-recount-may-violate-federal-law/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,23,"TheU. S. Department of Justiceexpressed concerns Wednesday involving the unprecedented private recount currently underway of votes cast in the 2020 presidential election in Maricopa County, Arizona. Pamela S. Karlan, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, warned the recount process may be running afoul of federalstatutes it enforces. In a letter to Arizonastate Senate PresidentKaren Fann, a Republican,she asked her to explain whatsteps are being taken to ensure the process complies with federal civil rights and voting laws. Reportssuggest ballots and other materials beingscrutinized as part of the recount are no longer under the control ofstate and local election officials and at risk of being compromised,she wrote. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1960,she wrote, election officials are required to maintain for 22 months afterward “all records and papers” relating to any “act requisite to voting” in a federal race.“We have a concern that Maricopa County election records, which are required by federal law to be retained and preserved, are no longer under the ultimate control of elections officials, are not being adequatelysafeguarded by contractors and are at risk of damage or loss,” Ms. Karlan wrote. Additionally,she added, the Justice Department has concerns involving Cyber Ninjas, a privatesecurity company with no prior election auditing experience that has been contracted to lead the recount. Cyber Ninjas recentlysaid in astatement of work that it plans to visit the homes of certain voters to “collect information of whether the individual voted in the election,”she noted.“This description of the proposed work of the audit raises concerns regarding potential intimidation of voters,” Ms. Karlan wrote.“Past experience withsimilar investigative efforts around the country has raised concerns that they can be directed at minority voters, which potentially can implicate the anti-intimidation prohibitions of the Voting Rights Act,”she added. “Such investigative efforts can have asignificant intimidating effect on qualified voters that can deter them fromseeking to vote in the future.”A message requesting comment from Ms. Fannwas not immediately returned. Local media reported that lawyers for the Republican-controlled Arizonastate Senateshe leads are drafting their response. Former President Donald Trump andsome of hissupporters have maintained for months thatsupposed voter fraud in Arizona and elsewhere led to him losing his race for reelection to President Biden. No evidence has emerged to corroborate their claims of election voter fraud, however, and the votes cast in Arizona and nationwide have already been certified at both thestate and federal levels.

94,Derek Chauvin Convicted on all Charges in Death of George Floyd,1.0,46.33,https://www.voanews.com/usa/derek-chauvin-convicted-all-charges-death-george-floyd,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,24,"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of all charges Tuesday in the death of George Floyd nearly a year ago. Chauvin had been charged withsecond-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder andsecond-degree manslaughter. After hearing closing arguments Monday, the 12-member jury – comprisingsix white people andsix people who are Black or multiracial --spent about 10 hours over two days discussing information from the three-week trial before coming to a decision. In their final arguments, a prosecutor accused Chauvin, who is white, of killing Floyd, an African American, by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. A defense attorney, Eric Nelson, contended that Floyd died partly from drug use and that Chauvin was following his police training in the way he arrested Floyd last May on the curb of astreet in Minneapolis. Prosecutor Steve Schleichersummed up the case against Chauvin, who held down the handcuffed Floyd as Floyd lay prone on a citystreet and gasped — 27 times, according to videos of his arrest — that he could not breathe.“He was trapped…a knee to his neck,” Schleichersaid, with Chauvin’s weight on him for nine minutes and 29seconds.“George Floyd was not a threat to anyone,” Schleichersaid. “All that was required wassome compassion, and he got none.”“No crime was committed if it was an authorized use of force,” Nelson argued.“Thestate has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt,” the legalstandard for a conviction, the defense attorney concluded as he asked the jurors to acquit Chauvin of murder and manslaughter charges. Floyd wassuspected of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby conveniencestore. The routine police investigation of a minor case last May 25 and Floyd’ssubsequent death have resulted in one of the most consequential U. S. criminal trials in years. Chauvin pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. Last week, Chauvin invoked his constitutional right againstself-incrimination and did not take the witnessstand. Under U. S. law, the prosecution must prove the allegations against defendants, and defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Trial judge Peter Cahill told the jury not to draw any inference on Chauvin’s innocence or guilt from his declining to testify. After dismissing the jury Monday, Cahill criticized Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who is Black and a member of Congresssince 1991, for recent remarks regarding the trial. Waters told protesters in Minnesota to “stay on thestreet” and to become “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin is found not guilty.“I wish elected officials wouldstop talking about this case, especially in a manner that’s disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,” Cahillsaid. Despite Cahill’s plea, U. S. President Joe Biden Tuesday described the evidence against Chauvin as overwhelming.“I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict,” Bidensaid during an Oval Office meeting with Latino lawmakers. “I think it’s overwhelming in my view. I wouldn’tsay that unless the jury wassequestered now.”As the case nears its end, authorities in Minneapolis are bracing for possiblestreet protests after the verdict. Manystores are boarded up to prevent a recurrence of the damage and looting that took place after Floyd’s death almost a year ago.“We cannot allow civil unrest to descend into chaos. We must protect life and property,” Minnesota Governor Tim Walzsaid Monday. “But we also must understand very clearly, if we don’t listen to those communities in pain and those people on thestreets, many of whom were arrested forspeaking a fundamental truth that we must change, or we will be right back here again.”Protests,some of them violent, broke out in many cities in the United States and throughout the world after Floyd’s death. The Black Lives Matter movement was at the forefront of the demonstrations, but thousands of people who had no previous connection to the Black-led protests joined in to condemn Chauvin’s actions, and more broadly, police treatment of minorities. Thesame issues raised by Floyd’s death came to the forefront in the community again when a now-resigned police officer in a Minneapolissuburb fatallyshot a 20-year-old African American man during a trafficstop on April 11. Meanwhile, Republicans in the U. S. Congresssaid they planned to hold a censure vote Wednesday over comments made by Representative Maxine Waters of California. On Saturday, Waters was in the Minneapolissuburb where another Black man had been killed by a police officer earlier this month. Waters told protesters who had gathered in Brooklyn Center over the death of Daunte Wright thatshe wanted tosee a murder conviction against Chauvin. She added, “We gottastay on thestreet, we’ve got to get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational, we’ve got to makesure that they know that we mean business.”On Monday, Judge Cahill called Waters’ comments “abhorrent” and that and they could lead to a verdict being appealed and overturned.

But Sisolak’sspokeswoman, Meghin Delaney,said that will have to wait at least one more day.“Thesecondspecial legislativesession will not begin tomorrow. Once the governor feels confident thesession is ready to begin, he will issue a proclamation,” Delaneysaid in astatement Wednesday. Part of the reason for that delay? According to one former lawmaker and anothersource familiar with the discussions, Sisolak, a Democrat, is pushing for legislation that would grant liability protections for businesses in Nevada, an idea that legislative Democrats have bridled at over concerns that those protections could put workers at risk.“It’s going to be delayed a day or two.

Sisolak’sspokeswoman declined to comment when asked about liability protections. Proponents of those protections for businesses, which include the Nevada Resorts Association and Vegas Chamber, havesaid they are needed because businesses being held liable for employees or customers contracting COVID-19 would further cripple the economy. Watkins also voicedsome thesame concerns raised by many labor unions and progressive groups about potential legal immunity for businesses.“You take away all the rights of the employees. You take away all the rights of the customers. And it’s incredibly bad policy at any time. But it’s especially bad policy in times of emergency,” Watkinssaid on theshow.

96,"Trump, Twitter and the Digital Town Hall",-6.67,33.33,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/trump-twitter-and-the-digital-town-hall/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,25,"The merits are hard tostomach for partisans long jaundiced by presumption and dislike, but the cheer at the de platform ing of Donald Trump by a range ofsocial media platformssaid as much about the nature of anysentiment about democracy as it did about those claiming to defend it. For one, itshut off a valve of fantastic, instant recognition to a figure whose thoughts are best aired rather than cellared in underground vats. But cellaring, hiding,suppressing unsavoury viewpoints are the very thingssocial media platforms are getting more enthusiastic about, much of it pushed on the censorious lobby that claims to have a monopoly on veracity and good behaviour. In the name of misinformation, offence and incitement, users will be eithersuspended, barred orsubjected to digital excommunication in the name ofsafety. Which brings us to the fascinating nature of Trump’s latest legal action against Twitter. In January, the former US president was banned from the platform following the January 6thriot at the Capitol building inspired bysupporters riled by claims that the election had beenstolen. It began as a temporary ban of 12 hours for “repeated andsevere violations of our Civic Integrity policy”. Two days later, the ban was made permanent. “In the context of the horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would permanently result in this very course of action,” Twitterclaimed in its January 8statement. “The company’s “public interest framework” existed to permit “the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly.” But this role did not exist “above our rules entirely” and could not be used “to incite violence, among other things.”The reasoning behind the ban was illuminating of asocial media giantsitting inshallow judgment. Two of Trump’s tweets weresingled out: one claiming that 75 million “great American patriots who voted for me” would “not be disrespect ed or treated unfairly in any way,shape or form!!!”; thesecondstating that he would “not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” Assuming the imperious role of civics guardian, the companystrained to identify these mutterings as violating “our Glorification of Violence policy”. At the time German Chancellor Angela Merkelcalledthe decision “problematic” while Jens Zimmermann, Social Democrat member of the Bundestag, wondered what it meant “for the future actions ofsocial media platforms”. In July, Trump began his legal battle toseek reinstatement across a range of platforms, filing a class action lawsuit against Google, Twitter and Facebook. “We are demanding an end to theshow-banning, astop to thesilencing, and astop to the blacklisting, banishing, and cancelling that you knowso well,”hestate dat the time. On October 1, Trump filed am orespecific complaint in the Southern District of Florida claiming that Twitter “coerced by members of the United States Congress” was censoring him. Thesocial media platform, the complaint argues, “exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate”. With 88 million followers, Trump argued that his account had become “an importantsource of news and information about government affairs and was a digital town hall.”The filing also made a pointed remark to Twitter’ssomewhat varied approaches to users. Why permit the Taliban, “a known terrorist organization”, room to tweet about their military victories across Afghanistan yet claim that his own efforts had been accused of “glorifying violence”. Resort was also made to Florida’ssocial media legislation, the Stop Social Media Censorship Act, which wassigned into law by Governor Ron DeSantis in May tospite “the Silicon Valley elites” only to be blocked two months later by a bemused judge. One of the plaintiffs, Steve DelBianco of the industry group NetChoice,expressed delight at the absurd proposition that the court ruling “ensured thatsocial media can remain family-friendly”. But equally absurd was the law’s idiosyncratic drafting, which included an exemption for companies operating theme parks in Florida. It is likely to perish at the hands of the Federal Appeals Court. Leaving aside the twaddle put forth by DelBianco, the difficulties of targetingsocial media platforms are almost insurmountable. Content moderation remains a pillar of usingsuch fora, one guaranteed by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which gives the digital giants platform rather than publisherstatus. And thesacred First Amendment is assumed to apply to government actions rather than corporate mischief. The efforts by Trump to place his legal arguments against Big Tech on the hook of the First Amendment has received littlesupport. One mighty voice in the field of jurisprudence thinking Trump has a case is Alan Dershowitz,who has argued that the case “pits freedom ofspeech on the one hand against the First Amendment on the other.” Such reasoning can well justify why lawyers deserve a bad name, but Dershowitzsees it as the high-tech behemoths quashing freespeech. “They are censoring but they’re claiming the right to doso under the First Amendment”. Witheringscorn has been levelled at that view. “Unlike delusional Dershowitz,” Democratic Rep. Ted Lieuinsistedwithsmug confidence, “I read the First Amendment and it does not apply to privatesector companies.” Laurence Tribe, formerly Carl M. Loeb Professor at Harvard Law School,took a dim view of his former colleague. “How low can a former law professorsink? To call a bogus lawsuit on a fake version of the First Amendment an important case, much less ‘the most important’ of the century? Has he noshame?”Democraticstrategist Kaivan Shroff, conforming to the fashion of the times,suggesteda retributive remedy: the cancellation of Dershowitz’sstatus as emeritus professor. Harvard Law School had “a professional and ethical responsibility to its community – past, present and future – to associate with faculty who are ethical and have a high regard for the law.”For allsuch righteoussplutters, Dershowitz and Trump have a point in pointing out asymptom of the US body politic that has become cripplingly apparent: business and the interests of capitalism have come to controlspeech, its circulation, its distribution. For decades, they had already come to guide politicians and political parties, exercising influence through campaign donations. Why run for elected office when you can buy it?In 2010, the US Supreme Court decision of found that limits upon “independent politicalspending” from corporations and private interest groups violated the First Amendment. Those with deep purses could only deem this the natural order of things: if you have cash,spend it to influence opinion in the name of freespeech. Put rathersimply,suchspeech was ashield big capitalism could well employ if it needed to. (Rep. Lieu, take note.)Gore Vidal used to remark that anyoneseeking the keys to the White House could only doso with the approval of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Had he lived tosee the Trump cancellationsaga, he may well have added those Big Tech titans to thesterile committee of electoral approval.

99,We Asked Kyrsten Sinema's Office for One (1) Example Where the Filibuster Created Bipartisan Comity,-10.0,36.33,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a36618396/kyrsten-sinema-filibuster-bipartisanship/,https://adfontesmedia.com/esquire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,23,"It cannot besaid that Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are responsible for placing American democracy on the edge of a cliff. This is a development decades in the making, the result of a ceaselessly radicalizing Republican Party and a Democratic opposition that has often lacked the courage and conviction tostop theslide. But now that we have truly arrived, with Republicanstate legislatures going all out tosuppress the vote—and, crucially, to make it easier to overturn future election results they do not like—based on an insane lie for which they have not provided ashred of evidence, and with Republicans at the federal level blocking an investigation into an attempted insurrection following the last election result they did not like, Manchin and Sinema are playing a crucial role. They could work with the rest of the Democratic congressional caucus to arrest thisslide at long last. Instead, they'residestepping. Last week,we asked Senator Manchin's office whether hestillsupported the kind of filibuster reforms he did back in 2011, when he declared that ""West Virginians deserve a government that works for them, and they are understandably frustrated with the way things get done—or don’t—in Washington."" We didn't get a response, but that wassomehow better than what Senator Sinemaserved up on Wednesday. In a press availability alongside Republican Senator John Cornyn,with whom Sinema has embarked on a road trip in order to demonstrate the glories of bipartisan comity, the Arizona Democrat offered a defense of the filibuster that amounted to little more than make-believe. The history and real-world effects of the Senate mechanism that Sinema offered heresimply have no connection to reality. Jonathan Chait at magazine has dealt with the variousscraps of historical nonsense here. The filibuster was not created by design, it was not created by the Founders, they rejected asuper majority procedure for passing the vast majority of bills in the Senate, it was not used until 1837, and its most prominent use throughout the 20th century was to block civil-rights legislation. But on that last point, there are also the just entirely made-up effects of this procedural device Sinema presented here. Thesenator claimed the filibuster was ""created""—again, a tenuous view of history—to ""create comity and encouragesenators to find bipartisanship and work together."" The obvious counterpoint to this is that we've had the filibuster over the last,say, decade, and there has been very little comity and bipartisanship in that time. In fact, the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell,has declared it his top priority under the last two Democratic presidents to block their agenda. Passing laws to grapple with the major issues of our time? No. Obstruction. Still, Esquire reached out to a representative for Senator Sinema to ask for an example of a bill where the filibuster created comity and encouragedsenators to find bipartisanship and work together. We'll update this if we get a response. But even if they do dig one up, we all know what's going on in the here and now. Sinema wasstanding next to Texas Senator John Cornyn for this presser, a man who conveniently doubles as a walking counterpoint to the assemblage of wordsshe offered up. When the president'ssuper fansstormed the Capitol to try to prevent the Legislative Branch from confirming he wouldsoon leave power—an assault on the very foundations of American democracy—Cornynsoon hipped to the line that rather than impeach the outgoing president for his crimes against the republic,Congressshould form a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to investigate the events of January 6. When it came time to createsuch a commission at the end of last month, however—and its final design was highly favorable to Republicans considering how many of them were implicated in the nonsense leading up to the Capitol riots—Cornyn and his colleagues blocked it. These are the people with whom Sinema is going to find compromise on voting-rights legislation? They very likely won't even cooperate on an infrastructure bill, unless you think McConnell's obstruction pledge has an exemption for...a massive public-investment initiative that could define Biden's presidency. Get fucking real. Republicans already used gamesmanship to cover up just how much of a lowball their opening counteroffer on infrastructure was. Now they've got Senator Shelley Moore Capito at the White House conducting negotiations with the Biden folks as if when the time comes, no matter how big orsmall the bill is, essentially the entire Senate Republican caucus won't vote against it. You probably won't even get Mitt Romney on this one. You certainly will not get 10 Republican votes, for this or anything else. The only question that truly remains is whether Sinema really believes thisshit. Jack Holmes is aseniorstaff writer at Esquire, where he covers politics andsports.

President Trump had removedsuch “training” from the federal government as part of a larger crackdown on the far-left concept of “critical race theory,” which essentially argues that all White people are racist, and claims without evidence that America is an inherently racist andsexist nation. The order prohibited federal agencies from using taxpayer dollars to fundsuch courses, which would “teach” federal employees aboutsuch fictional concepts as “systemic racism” and “White privilege.”Multiple far-left groups voiced theirsupport for Biden’s reversal of this policy. Aspokesman for Crescent Care, a New Orleans-based non-profit thatsupports critical race theory,said that Biden’s move “underscores the priority he attaches to the United States government grappling honestly with implicit bias, racism, andsexism in this country.”Aspokesman for the NAACP claimed, without evidence, that President Trump’s order had “negatively impacted the lives and livelihoods of countless Americans and advanced the dangerous cause of Whitesupremacy and disinformation,” and vowed to “ensure that all vestiges of President Trump’s Executive Order are removed from work places across the country.”",1,0,American Greatness

In the first episode of HBO’s new miniseries, Shane (played by Jake Lacy) and his new wife, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario), arrive on their honeymoon, on an unspecified Hawaiian island, with bagfuls ofsilk resort-wear and books by Malcolm Gladwell. Alone in theirsuite, Jake moves in to kiss Rachel, but he’ssuddenly gripped by asuspicion that all might not be entirely copacetic. “Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait wait wait,” hesays, detaching himself from his bride and lifting his face up to bettersniff out thescent of deficiency. “This is the wrong room.” Thus begins a kind of one-man Waterloo, a furious and eventually bloody war between a luxury hotel and a wealthy guy whosuspects he hasn’t gotten absolutely everything he’s paid for.was created by Mike White, a veteranscreenwriter and an occasional reality-show contestant (he appeared on bothThe Amazing Raceand the David-versus-Goliath-themedseason ofSurvivorin 2018) whose work tends to be preoccupied with the foibles of human nature, the tragicomedy of modern life, and the costs that inevitably come withself-actualization. So thesetup—a cluster of wealthy guests tries to escape their troubles on vacation at a five-star resort—seems made forsatire. White’s previousshow,Enlightened, was a critically beloved and little-watchedseries co-created with Laura Dern, whostarred as a divorcéeseeking out meaning after a personal breakdown. More recently, his in die filmsBeatriz at DinnerandBrad’s Statusmine the fault lines of class and ambition insatirical,squirmy fashion. The White Lotusseems to fit within aspate of recent HBOshows about rich people rotting in their own toxic privilege—Succession,The Undoing,Big Little Lies—but it’s baggier than thoseshows while also being, in fleeting moments, more insightful. Across allsix episodes, a convincing thesis emerges: The curse of the privileged is that they would rather be miserable than lose even a tiny fraction of the things they’ve been given. Read: Filthy rich: The power plays of ‘Succession’I didn’t entirely love, maybe because Ispentseven years working in theservice industry and the psychic wounds from absorbing people’s power plays night after nightstill haven’t healed. Theseries begins with a flash-forward to an airport, where a gloomy Shane watches a mysterious box labeledHUMAN REMAINSget loaded onto a plane. The question of which entitled holidaymaker at the White Lotus resort has died—and how—hangs vaguely over theseries as it unfolds, but not intrusively. Theshow doesn’t expect us to get absorbed in a central mystery or even gawk at thespectacular vistas of American wealth. Rather, it wants us tostew inside the cauldron of moneyed disaffection—to understand why these characters areso doomed by their competitive impulses that they can’t even enjoy a trip to a tropical paradise. White filmed theseries on location during the pandemic, using aspectacular cast of players. Murray Bartlett () plays Armond, the ferociously tense manager of the hotel, with a mustache and a rictus grin that’s beginning to crack. During the first episode, he coaches a new hire, Lani (Jolene Purdy), on the dynamics of catering tosuper-rich vacationers; every one of them, he explains, is asensitive, overgrown hothouse flower who desperately wants to feel like “thespecial chosen baby child of the hotel.” Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) is a caftan-clad alcoholic whose voice is a whiny whisper, and whose residual pain engulfs the hotel’sstaff virtually thesecondshesteps off the boat. Nicole (Connie Britton) and Mark (Steve Zahn) are a Sheryl Sandberg–esque tech-company CFO and her emasculated husband. Their college-student daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend Paula (Brittany O’Grady)sneer at the luxury around them without being willing to disavow it altogether. With a different kind of director,could have been a moresensuous andsumptuous productentirely, allsunsets andsucculent walls and dewy boat drinks. The thrill of ashow likeSuccession, with its wealth consultants andshinilysterile interiors, is partly in its voyeuristic immersion in the fabulous lives of the 0.001 percent—it’s easy to understand why luxury might be addictive. But Whiteseems intent on making his island resort feel more like an ordeal. Exteriorscenes have a jaundiced tone. Green leafy prints crawl invasive ly over curtains and bedspreads. Scenes play out against a nightmarishscore by the dystopiaspecialist Cristobal Tapia de Veer (Black Mirror, Humans, The Third Day), which incorporatesshrieking instruments over a relentless drumbeat. At the end of the first episode, Shane and Rachel go to bed together, and the camera films them for far too long through a frame of fluttering drapes on the balcony, implicating viewers for peeping in a discomfiting way. Read: On TV, having wealth means you get tosuffer beautifullyTheshow has notes of absurd humor, but they tend to be loaded with ugliness. “Would you like asecond toilet?” Armond asks Shane, who’s demanding to know what other upgrades are available. “I dreamed I was on top of this beautiful mountain range in Asia and I had a cyanide pill,” Tanya tells Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), thespa manager, whose equilibrium and careshe feeds off of like asuccubus. At one point, Mark is floored by a health crisis and a revelation about his father; thescene is played for laughs and yet feels disturbingly unfunny. White isn’t unsympathetic toward his characters—Coolidge, in particular, delivers an extraordinary performance and tenderizes a woman who, in lesser hands, could have been a ghoulish caricature. Still, heseemsstuck between acknowledging their unhappiness andskewering them for their toxic behavior, never quite extending all the way in one direction or another, never allowing theshow to be purely funny or purely tragic for a minute. Everything is a push-pull between feeling for his rich, monstrous characters and loathing them for notseeing the truth about themselves. But if is clear on thesins of the elite, it doesn’t let its below-stairs characters off the hook either, or patronize their virtuous labor in aDownton Abbeykind of way. Armond can be as tyrannical, abusive, and petty as the guests he caters to. Theseries is mostsympathetic toward Belinda, who is consumed by the vampiric emotional demands of wealthy women, but it also makes clear thatshe has her own agenda in getting close to them. Every interaction in theseries is an exchange of power, and even when people try their hardest to use that power in benevolent ways, or to redistribute it, things go awry. “Nobody cedes their privilege,” Mark tells his wife and kids during a tense dinner debate. “That’s absurd. It goes against human nature. We’re all just trying to win the game of life.”And that,suggests, is exactly the problem. We’reso hardwired to want to accumulate things—possessions, money, experiences, even people—thatsacrificing any of them feels harder and more painful than unhappiness itself. As Mark and Nicole’ssonsays toward the end of theseries,“We’re all just parasites eating the last fish and throwing our plastic crap in the ocean.”",1,1,The Atlantic

S. Supreme Court case on whetherstudents may be disciplined for off-campus internetspeech. The administration and others filing friend-of-the-court briefs inMahanoy Area School District v. B. L.(Case No. 20-255)stress the need forschools to be able to respond to threats of violence as well asspeech that bullies otherstudents. And they argue that the prevalence of remote learning due the the COVID-19 pandemic makes it all the more important that the authority ofschool officials be clarified.“When it comes to online activity—especiallysalient during the current pandemic—many ofstudents’ contacts andsocial-media ‘friends’ are likely to be fellowstudents,so anything they post online reasonably could be expected to ‘reach’ theschool,”says the brief filed March 1by Acting U. S. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar. The merits briefs by theschool district and itssupporters come in a case over the discipline of a highschoolstudent who posted a vulgar message on Snapchat in 2017 a dispute involving her cheerleading team. The then-sophomorestudent, identified in court papers as B. L., posted a message on Snapchat one Saturday night thatsaid “F***school ... f*** cheer f*** everything” aftershe was placed on the junior varsity cheerleading team instead of the varsitysquad. The “snap” came to the attention of cheerleading coaches at Mahanoy Area High School, whosaid it violated team andschool rules. B. L. was removed from the JV team for theseason, a decision upheld by administrators and theschool board. Thestudentsued under the First Amendment, winning in a federal district court and in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, in Philadelphia. The appellate court issued a broad ruling last year interpreting the U. S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1969 decision inTinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, which upheldstudentspeech as long asschool was notsubstantially disrupted. The 3rd Circuit courtsaid in theMahanoycase thatTinkercategorically did not apply to off-campusspeech, and thusschools could not discipline “speech that is outsideschool-owned, -operated, or -supervised channels and that is not reasonably interpreted as bearing theschool’s imprimatur.”The Supreme Court granted review of the Mahanoy district’s appeal of that decision in January. The court could hear arguments in the case in April and issue a decision by thissummer, though the justices have not yetset theschedule for the court’s April argumentsession and there is a chance the case could be bumped over to next term. The Mahanoy district argues in its main brief that the First Amendment does not prohibitschools from discipliningstudent off-campusspeech that is directed at theschool campus and issubstantially disruptive.“The ubiquity ofsmartphones, plus the added complexity of the COVID remote-learning environment, makes the decision below” unjustifiable, the district’s briefsays. “Whereverstudentspeech originates,schoolsshould be able to treatstudents alike when theirspeech is directed at theschool and imposes thesame disruptive harms on theschool environment.”The Biden administration, in its brief,says that “the broad range ofspeech engaged in bystudents when off campus is beyond the proper purview ofschool officials” and “there is good reason to be wary of any rule that would permit an over broad opportunity for the discipline ofsuchspeech.”But the administration agrees that the 3rd Circuit’s categorical rule is incorrect. It argues that among the categories of off-campusspeech that could justify regulation byschool officials isspeech by an extracurricular participant that targets teammates or threatens team cohesion. The National School Boards Association, joined by the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and AASA, the School Superintendents Association,argues in a briefthatTinkergivesschool officials the authority to discipline “disruptive” behavior regardless of whether it is on-campus or off-campus.“The 3rd Circuit’s categorical rule is especially ill-suited for today’ssocial media age,” the NSBA briefsays. “Students can disrupt theschool community from anywheresimply by hittingsend, and thesame tweet, Instagram post, or you name it will have thesame impact no matter where it wassent.”Abrief by the Cyberbullying Research Centerand other groups emphasized the prevalence of online bullying amongstudents and the need ofschools to be able to respond regardless of where the bullying originated. The National Education Associationfiled a brief that does notsupport one party or the other in the Pennsylvania dispute, but argues thatschools must be able to respond to threats and harassment that disrupt theschool environment.“Warningsigns of the nextschoolshooting can appear in off-campusstudentspeech,” the NEA briefsays. “Ifschool officials cannot respond tosigns that portend a threat tosafety, the learning environment atschool willsuffer.”And a group of First Amendment and education lawscholars,in a brief that alsosupports neither party, argues the 3rd Circuit’s categorical rule went too far andschool officialsshould be allowed to regulate onlinestudentspeech that has a close nexus toschool grounds and is reasonably likely to causesubstantial disruption atschool.

103,Walkback For The Ages: Graham Ditches McConnell Rule He Promised To Apply Evenly,-12.67,43.0,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/walkback-for-the-ages-graham-ditches-mcconnell-rule-he-promised-to-apply-evenly,https://adfontesmedia.com/talking-points-memo-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-19,25,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has perhaps made the biggest flip-flop yetseen as the GOP races to reverse former comments condemning the confirmation of Supreme Court justices during an election year. Graham nowsays hesupports “any effort to move forward” to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’sseat. Earlier Saturday, President Trumptweetedthat he intended to move forward with nominating Ginsburg’ssuccessor “without delay.”Back in 2016, Graham wassinging a very different tune. When Senate Republicans refused to even hold a hearing on Obama-nominee Judge Merrick Garland, Grahamsaid it was too close to the election even though at the time of late Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February it was roughly nine months away.“I want you to use my words against me,” Grahamsaid at the time. “If there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you cansay Lindsey Grahamsaid let’s let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.” He hassince reissued that promiseseveral times over. In 2018, hesaid that following a potentialseat vacancy in the final year of Trump’s term the Senate would “wait to the next election.”“If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process hasstarted, we’ll wait to the next election,” hesaid. But Graham began toset thestage for his epic reversal more recently when hesaid in Maythat “appointing judges is a high priority for me in 2020,” and that Merrick Garland was “a differentsituation.”“You had the President of one party nominating, and you had the Senate in the hands of the other party. Asituation where you’ve got them both would be different. I don’t want tospeculate, but I think appointing judges is a high priority for me in 2020,” Grahamsaid during a “Full Court Press” interview with Greta Van Susteren. Graham completed his reversal Saturday — the day after the Ginsburg’s death — that he wouldsupport a Supreme Court nomination by President Trump.“I willsupport President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg,” Graham wrote. In light of these two events, I willsupport President@realDonaldTrumpin any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg.#3— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC)September 19, 2020",1,1,Talking Points Memo

105,"Suicide Crisis In Prisons Compounded By COVID-19, Lack Of Health Care",-1.33,41.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/11/16/suicide-crisis-in-prisons-compounded-by-covid-19-lack-of-health-care/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-16,22,"In the normal course of its work connecting prisoners across Wisconsin via email correspondence and newsletters, theIncarcerated Workers Organizing Committee of Milwaukeereceives reports of the deaths of incarcerated people from their fellow prisoners. One recent report involved Kristopher Carlisle, who was incarcerated at the Columbia Correctional Institution. According to the report, Carlisle was in poor health,suffering from diabetes and requiring a wheelchair, yet he was given only a walker and made to climbstairs multiple times a day for meals, medication, bloodsugar checks, and other routine necessities. On January 14, Carlisle crawled to the upper tier of his cell block and dove over the railing, falling twostories to his death. Deaths like Carlisle’s are not uncommon within prisons across the United States, where administrators’ neglect of inmates’ general health care needs are compounded by their particular neglect of adequatesuicide prevention. Worse yet, even the relatively robust network ofsuicide prevention resources available to the general public do little to assist prisoners. The heightened rates of illness-related deaths among prisoners in the United States are matched bysuicide rates. When figures available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics(BJS) and the Centers for Disease Controlare compared, it becomes clear prisonerssuffer fromsignificantly higher mortality rates from preventable diseases than the wider population, including cancer (30 percent to 22 percent), heart disease (30 percent to 23 percent), and liver disease (7 percent to 2 percent). Similarly,suicide rates are nearly four times higher among prisoners (7 percent) than the general public (2 percent), reaching a 16-year peak in 2016. In fact,some prisoners and their advocates believe thatsuicide rates may actually be even higher, however, they are obscured by administrators as accident-related deaths (1 percent). Prisoners’ advocacy groups like the Southern Center for Human Rightsalso report thatsuicide rates have reached “unprecedented levels” due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, especiallysince administrators responded to the virus by keeping inmates in their cells for weeks at a time. Asense of the new reality can be gleaned from the more recent reports received by IWOC Milwaukee, as the Wisconsin Department of Corrections confirms COVID infections in the thousands. On the evening of October 24, a prisoner at Fox Lake Correctional Institution reported two ambulances were called to the “quarantine wings.” Whether the ambulances were responding to COVID cases, other emergency medical conditions, or instances ofself-harm remained unclear.“Suicides within prisons and correctional facilities are rapidly becoming the rule and not the exception,” argued Nicasio Cuevas Quiles III, an inmate at Prairie du Chien Correctional Institution. “Statistics remain the highest unreported occurrence within prisons as the primary cause of death—second only to deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”“The [Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC)]seems very good at buryingsuchstatistics as accidents and other causes, trying very hard not to admit that there’s a problem,” reiterated Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) Milwaukee organizer Robert Thibault. Prisoners themselves connect inadequate health care with the preponderance ofsuicide. Jeremiah Grube, an inmate at New Lisbon Correctional Institution, describes being diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin, in 2004. But because Grube is now unable to obtain his medication from the prison psychiatrist, heself-medicates with contraband opiates and methamphetamine. He has alsoseen where that may lead, pointing to thesuicides of two fellow prisoners: Shawn McNutt on January 7, 2019, and Scot Weiss on October 5.“The prison does not help or treat addiction at all,”said Grube. “People rather die than live in pain.”The pain prisoners experience is compounded by the negligence with which it is received by administrators. Not only are inmates’ health care needs routinely ignored, as in the cases of both Carlisle and Grube, but even theirsuicide attempts arescorned. Prisoners complain ofstaff makingsuicide jokes, threateningsuicidal inmates with isolation, orsimply ignoringsuicide attempts.“It is a common ‘mistake’ for guards to just walk away,saying they believed the inmate was being manipulative or misleading, or making threats out of anger and didn’t really mean it,” explained Aaron Pavin, a prisoner at Waupun Correctional Facility. “Then the inmate harms themself, and no one gets in trouble.”Representatives from both the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections tout their respectivestaffs’ mandatorysuicide prevention training, which theysay is delivered on a regular basis and includes instruction on mental illness. According to John Beard, director of communications for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections,state prisons averaged less than foursuicides per year from 2010 to 2019. Beard claimedsuicide prevention resources available to prisoners include clinical monitoring, crisisservices, emergency call buttons in restrictive housing cells, and more. Yet all of the prisoners interviewed by Shadowproof described theservices available as inadequate — or, in the words of one interviewee, “a joke.”The belief that prisoners are malingering, or exaggerating the risk ofsuicide for their own benefit, isso persistent that the National Institute of Correctionssharesresourceslike, “Is He Faking? Why You Should Treat All Suicide Threats as Real.”Outside the prison walls,suicide prevention resources are relatively prevalent. The best-known of these isth e National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a network of more than 180 crisis centers across the United States, which make up the leadingsuicide prevention effort in the country. Callers to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s hotline number are routed to local crisis centers for free mental healthservices and emotionalsupport. But the lifeline provides no inmate-specificsupport.“The lifeline providessupport to anyone that contacts the lifeline,” explains Hannah Collins, a communications manager with National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Collins notes that, whileshe is not aware of a nationwidesuicide prevention initiativespecificallysupporting prisoners, the individual crisis centers associated with National Suicide Prevention Lifeline may have their own, independent programs to that end. However, after contacting all four crisis centers based in Wisconsin, Shadowproof was unable to confirm that even one providedsupportspecifically to local prisoners. On the contrary, a representative from one crisis center, Journey Mental Health Center in Madison, explained that the center providessupport to those released from prison, but not those currently incarcerated. Denied adequate health care orsuicide prevention resources inside, and unable to access the more prevalent prevention resources available outside, prisoners are left to fend for themselves as circumstances become increasingly dire. As previously mentioned, the latest figures from the BJS indicate thatsuicide among prisoners reached a 16-year high in 2016—well before the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic threatened to turn everysentence into a deathsentence. The intersection of already risingsuicide rates and the failure of administrators to adequately respond to the pandemic raises thespectre of even more deaths fromself-harm, lending greater urgency to the calls for release from prisoners and their advocates. Since mid-March, IWOC Milwaukee has argued for the release of all prisoners age 60 and over, as well as those expecting trial, and a halt to all arrests. “It only takes one misstep to turn an isolated, overpopulated institution into a death camp,” reads theappeal. But as with thesuicide crisis, the question remains: is anyone listening?",1,1,Shadowproof

S.secretary of education Thursday when the Senate education committee reported his nomination favorably to the full Senate. The Senate voted 17-5 in Cardona’s favor. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the committee chairwoman, voted for Cardona and cited his “clear qualifications.” And Sen. Richard Burr, R-N. C., the committee’s ranking Republican, also voted for Cardona, citing his experience and priorities.“He’sstressed the need forstudents to be back inschool, and that’s now, finally, a bipartisan mission,” Burrsaid of Cardona. Next up for Cardona is a final Senate confirmation vote. Cardona’s confirmation hearing before the committee took place on Feb. 3. At that hearing, Republicansenators pressed him onseveral issues, perhaps most notably the rights of transgenderstudents to participate in athletic events that match their gender identity. But his exchanges with lawmakers generated fewsurprises, especially when compared with the hearing for former educationsecretary Betsy DeVos four years ago (although the education committee also reported her nomination favorably to the full Senate). As the Feb. 3 hearing drew to a close, Burr called Cardona, who is Connecticut’s education commissioner and was unveiled by Biden as his nominee in December, “eminently qualified” for the job. If confirmed by the full Senate, Cardona will be faced with numerous challenges at the Education Department. Chief among them will be how best to helpschools reopen their doors for in-person learning—an issue where the White House has caused controversyrecently—and what to do aboutstandardized testing and federal accountability.",1,1,Education Week

Wall of Moms, whose memberssaid they aimed tosupport and protect other Black Lives Matter protesters near the fence in front of the federal courthouse, announced Friday that its white leadership had rescinded their positions to allow women of color to be in charge. New leaders announced Friday include Teressa Raiford, executive director of Don’t Shoot Portland, Demetria Hester and Danialle James. But less than a week later, Don’t Shoot Portland took to Instagram to urge people againstsupporting the Wall of Moms,saying that it was no longer working with the moms group. EDIT FOR EVERYONE UPSET ABOUT THIS POST: WE ARE NOT AGAINST MOMS! EVERYONE HAS A PLACE IN ORGANIZING. WE ARE NO LONGER IN SUPPORT OF WOM LEADERSHIP. ANTI-BLACKNESS. DO NOT SUPPORT @wallofmoms #WALLOFMOMS. . After leaving vulnerable Black women downtown after marching, failing tosupport those on the ground that put trust in them, @wallofmoms leadership also found time to make THREE registrations through Oregon’s Secretary of State. This was all done in privacy and without the knowledge of the Black leadership WOM was claiming to implement. The lies are finally clear and we aresad but ultimately notsurprised that anti-Blacknessshowed it’s ugly face with Wall of Moms. This all came to light over the last 24 hours - We began havingsafety concerns within the group because Black womenstartedsaying they were not protected by WOM leadership. Too frequently would be in communication forsafety, transport etc and when the time came, there would be zero response and no leadership to rely on. It’s put many on the ground in direct danger. Once these registration filings with Secretary of State came out, it became more clear - WOM was notstarted for BLM, but to get the feds out of PDX. None of the Black leadership WOM claimed to implement knew about this. Combined with a lack of care for and disregard of Black women, we were used to further an agenda unrelated to BLM. Please do notsupport this organization anymore. We need everyone toshow up against racism, but it’s even more crucial to prioritize transparency and accountability. . The Wall of Moms . The Wall of Moms PAC AND Wall of Moms as an entity name: postshared byDon't Shoot PDX(@dontshootpdx) onJul 29, 2020 at 9:06am PDT“The lies are finally clear and we aresad but ultimately notsurprised that anti-Blacknessshowed its ugly head,” read the post published on Wednesday by Don’t Shoot Portland, a local Black Lives Matter and mutual aid group founded in 2014. The Wednesday post alleges that Wall of Moms founder Bev Barnum filed for business registrations without consulting the newly instated Black leaders and that thesafety of Black members at the nightly protests in downtown Portland was overlooked. The postsaid that issues of Black mothers’safety have only come to light in the past 24 hours. Barnum appeared to file three business registrations on Tuesday including one that makes The Wall of Moms a 501c3 nonprofit. Don’t Shoot Portland interpreted the filings to mean that Wall of Moms goal was to get federal officers out of Portland -- not tosupport Black Lives Matter, according to the Instagram post. The newly instated Black leaders were not told about the registrations, according to the post.“None of the Black leadership WOM claimed to implement knew about this,” the Wednesday post reads. “Combined with the lack of care for Black women, we were used to further the agenda unrelated to BLM.”Don’t Shoot Portland’sstatement was retweeted on Twitter by the Wall of Moms’ official Twitter account. The Wall of Moms answered a commenter’s questionsaying, “The founder went rogue. Many of us do not agree with her decisions. Andshe does not currently have access to this account.”The Wall of Moms tweeted just before 1 p.m. that it’s trying to regroup and “do things the right way,” but that there were no official announcements. Hey team, by now y'all have heard about the drama unfolding. Lots of us are trying to regroup and do things the right way. No official announcements yet -standby.#BlackLivesMatterIn a comment Barnum appeared to post Wednesday morning on the private Wall of Moms Facebook group,she addressed thesituation.“The announcement of the 501c3 really hurtsome of you,”she wrote. “That was never my intention. In fact, it was just the opposite. WOM will be led by a BIPOC board and BIPOC advisor committee. WOM is a group thatsupports BLM, not a BLM group. If that is not good enough for you, please feel free to leave this group. And if you currently volunteer your time, please feel free to leave your positions.”A newFacebook group has formed called Moms United for Black Lives. A post from Faith Lightsy, a member of the groupsaidshe and others are in contact with Raiford, Hester and James to figure out what to do next.“This group is only a few hours old with 3k members already...please be patient with us.

Hasbro's Classic Plastic Toy Experiences a Change,10.0,32.67,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2021/february/a-transgender-potato-head-hasbros-classic-plastic-toy-falls-to-the-trans-agenda,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-broadcasting-network-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-25,25,"Chalk up another unusual headline to the LGBTQ agenda. This time it's not a television or movie character who appears to havesudden gender confusion, it's a children's toy that has been around for almost 70 years. Hasbro, the company that makes Mr. Potato Head, announced the potato-shaped plastic toy has been given a gender-neutral new name: Potato Head. Mr. Potato Head first hit the toyscene in 1952, when it didn't even come with a plastic potato — kids had tosupply their own vegetable to poke eyes, a nose, or mustache into. Hasbro, which also makes Monopoly and My Little Pony, bought the brand and eventually added a plastic potato. It's just the latest move by corporate America in what theysay is an effort to modernize their classic brands. Barbie-maker Mattel released agender-neutral doll line in 2019. Barbie alsoshed her blonde image and now comes in multipleskin tones and bodyshapes. Thomas the Tank Engine added more girl characters. And American Girl is nowselling a boy doll. As part of the rebranding, Hasbro will release a new Potato Head playset that will let kids create their own type of families, including multiple moms or dads. The Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters will live on insome form, Hasbrosaid but didn't provide details. Dropping the ""Mr."" from its brand name could encourage other companies to not assign genders to their toys – a trend that has already been happening,said Ali Mierzejewski, editor in chief at toy reviewsite The Toy Insider. Shortly after the hot potato announcement went public, Hasbro appeared to be working on damage control,saying Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head aren't really gone after all:Hold that Tot – your mainspud, MR. POTATO HEAD isn’t going anywhere! While it was announced today that the POTATO HEAD brand name & logo are dropping the ‘MR.’ I yam proud to confirm that MR. & MRS.

110,Our uncomplicated love of Alex Trebek,0.0,38.33,https://www.mic.com/p/our-uncomplicated-love-of-alex-trebek-42393720,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,25,"There wasso much time to brace for the inevitable, in the monthssinceAlex Trebekwas diagnosed withstage 4 pancreatic cancer back inspring of 2019, but itstill didn’tseem like he would ever leave. Unflappable as ever, he just kept on hosting— often in excruciating pain, during a pandemic, and with thesame trademark composure. Early Sunday morning, Trebek died at 80, after a nearly two-year battle with cancer. Trebek was born in Sudbury, Ontario, where he’d go on to work as a bellhop in thesame hotel where his father worked as a chef. Before he became the consummate gameshow host, Trebek took up a career in broadcasting, working for Canada’s CBC and taking any range of assignments that came his way. Chalk up hissteely demeanor and grab bag of knowledge to his time as a newsroom underling, but Trebek had to work his way through a number of marginal hosting gigs upon moving to the U. S. in the ‘70s. Theseshows —,Double Dare,Classic Concentration,High Rollers, and more — rarely lasted more than a few years, but he honed hisskill as a wry, dependable host nevertheless. Not untilseizing thesyndicated version ofJeopardy!in 1984 did he really find his foothold as a cross-generational institution. He departs as one of the last true universally beloved figures in American culture through his run on, 36 years, more than 8,000 episodes, andseven Daytime Emmy Awards later. It’s not the kind of blueprint you can follow easily — occupying the consistency and down-the-middle frankness of an old guard network news host, with the playful warmth to leave a formative impression on the right viewer. In one of the final episodes to air before his death on Sunday — itshould be noted, theseriesstill has enough Trebek-hosted episodes to run until December 25 — champion Burt Thakur tearfully told Trebek that watchingJeopardy!every night with his grandfather helped him learn English. Despite his role as thissort of paternal, instructive presence, Trebek was a delightful bundle of contradictions. He was like the kind, knowing professor, who couldstill be kind of a bully andstare you down over his glasses. As host of an unbelievably nerdy enterprise — a dinner-hour trivia program that hasn’t considerably updated its aestheticsince it began — Trebekstill managed to playfully chide contestants for not knowing the answers to fairly basicsports questions or being into nerd core hip-hop. He’d bring thesame reverent cadence to reciting lyrics from an old opera as he would top 40 rap lyrics. Trebek was almost entirely averse to bullshit on air, except for the rare occasion when he absolutely reveled in it. It feels like asafe assumption that no one will ever maintain this kind of presence again on network orsyndicated television, with viewers hipsplintered across platforms and ideologies. With murky enough politicsso as not to alienate eitherside of thespectrum, liking Trebek never communicated a discernible world view beyond enjoying a calming triviashow over dinner. His closest analogues — late-night hosts, national news anchors, and Pat Sajak — have all but alienated half of the country in one way or another, despite their best efforts. Trebek was just a host whoseemed like thesmartest guy in the room, or at leastsmart enough to corralsome of thesmartest people in America.will find a new host to replace Trebek — it’s toosturdy an institution to not, and he repeatedly maintained that he didn’t want tosee theshow’s legacy die with him. But losing Trebek marks the end of a certain type of TV guy — the kind who maintained public trust throughsheer volume, dependability, and neutrality. Although Trebek and Chadwick Boseman departed on decidedly different terms — onesuffering publicly and transparently, while the other isolated close colleagues from the grim prognosis — they both treated their work as asort of publicserviceso much as the ideal coping mechanism. Not everyone has the resources,stamina, or emotional capacity tospend their final years in this way, but it’s the kind ofselfless embrace — of believing that your workserves a greater purpose to people like Burt Thakur — that led them to keep going in the face of impossible circumstances.",1,1,Mic
111,Day Three of the Republican Convention: One Week of Honesty on TV Every Four Years,27.0,28.67,https://spectator.org/rnc-day-three-honesty-media/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,23,"Preface: A Stream of Consciousness on Media Bias, Mass Brainwashing of College Kids and American Voters, and Cancel CultureOnlyone more day of truth left for prime-time television, and then we will have to wait four more years. Instarklingo,Winter Is Coming, and wesoon will resume being lectured onWhite Walkerprivilege. It has beensuch a wonderful three days. I variously channel-surfed tostations I have not watched for years: CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC. It wasso nice. It was like we had a fair and honest media again. Fair is fair, and they gave the Democrats foursuch nights last week. That is fine. And if we did not know better, we would be thinking that now the media honorably maintain the balance by giving the GOP four nights. But we know it all is an illusion, a mirage. Of the 209 weeks in a Quadrennium, we get one — actually only four of theseven days of that one week. The Democrats get the other 208. We have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it. It is ashame, because that kind of one-sided bias indeed does brainwash people. There is no question but that the lopsided domination of Left Media — the “mainstream” media — not only causes a falsified narrative to be disseminated, but it ultimately intimidates and brainwashes people. Of course it does. A person thinks to himself or herself a certain thought or idea and then finds that “everyone else” disagrees. In time, of course it impacts thinking. That is how the Left has taken over universities and truly brainwashed two generations of their own zombie White Walkers. Of course they have. That is why we heardso much at this GOP convention about Cancel Culture and repression of conservative ideas. Left-wing professors mix their assigned course materials with their own propaganda. They load theirsyllabi to forcestudents to read only one message, that of the Left. Even 40 years ago, when I majored in politicalscience at Columbia University, I never once heard the name “Ayn Rand” except when I went into thestudent health clinic one time with an otolaryngological irritation, and the doctor, a closet libertarian, madesmall talk with me. All I had been reading for four years was Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Karl Marx, Stokely Carmichael, and the Friedrich Engels–Karl Marx Reader. That was then; it isso much worse now. Yes, Ocasio-Hyphen is notsupersmart, butshealso is notsuperstupid. If we are honest, not just calling people names, we recognize thatshespeaks coherently,sat through four years of college, passed her tests, got a graduate degree. We fool ourselves bysaying thatshesimply is “stupid.”Rather,she representssomething more egregious: O-Hyphen is what happens when you take an average — that is, a mediocre — intellect, and then force-feed it left-wing pulp for four orsix years. That is whyshesays, in her alternate universe, that the 25thAmendment was passed tostop Franklin Roosevelt from winning a fifth term. That is not “stupid” in the purestsense; rather, that isignorant— abysmal ignorance. That is whyshe cannot individuate between gas chambers and crematoria in Auschwitz, on the one hand, and ICE compassionately caring for, feeding, and medically treating illegal aliens on the other. And how canshe beso ignorant thatshe does not know the 25th Amendment was passed well after FDR died in office?Becauseshe was force-fed years of leftist pulp. Why isshe a “socialist” (the homogenized name for “communist”)? Because that is whatshe was taught forsix years, that is whatshe was assigned to read and to regurgitate on her exams: pure pulp fiction. Of course the enormous media bias — 208 out of 209 weeks devoted to the Democrat-Left — tilts minds. People get deeply impacted by what they think the people around them think. It is rare to find peoplestrong enough to defy the majority, the “common wisdom,” especially when the majority also can fire you and take away the livelihood you need to feed your family, if you do not conform. That is whyso many professors who are conservatives hide their views on campuses, while the leftist professors bellow. That even is whysome conservative professors publicly espouse a liberal perspective in the classroom but then privatelystruggle with their consciences off campus, as theyshare with others whoshare their views how deeply frustrated they are. It is a Cancel Culture in which we live. And that is why even “science” cannot be trusted on first blush, because even “science” is politicized. If you publish the right “science,” you get the grants and funding to continue your “research.” If you publish the wrongscience, even though the data are unmistakable, your funding dries up, and you are canceled. Thatis the climate that needs to be changed. When CNN fired myAmerican Spectatorcolleague, Jeffrey Lord, for tweeting “Sieg Heil!” to the president of Media Matters, whom Jeffrey was criticizing for being anti-free-speech bigots, employing fascist-style tactics toshut down opposingspeech in the tradition of repressive Hitler and Mussolini propaganda machines, Jeffrey was perfectly justified in using that hyperbole. No one thought he was advocating Nazism; that would be as insane an inference as when the Left media went crazy on Laura Ingraham four years ago, manipulating a photo whereshe waved to the GOP convention crowd with an understandably outstretched arm, and theysaidshe had given a Nazisalute. It all is crazy. But CNN used that tweet as their excuse to drop Jeffrey as a commentator. That is Cancel Culture. It happens all over, in every institution where the Left holdssway. I live with it everysingle day in academia. I always am one joke away, one adjective, one noun away from being canceled. Take this joke, which is not even all that funny (by my finely honed New York Jewish Catskills humor):“A priest, a pastor, and a rabbit walk into a bar. The rabbitsays to the bartender: ‘Don’t look at me. I’m just a typo.’ ”I would not dare tell that joke on a university campus. First of all, as noted, it is below my humorstandards. But more than that, whichsnowflake will be offended? Someone who is a recovering alcoholic? An atheist? Or maybesomeone who complains that the professor used an animal that is …White? Why didn’t the professor use a bear? Or aseal? Or a Doberman Pinscher in the joke? Well,duh, because that doesn’t work in that joke. A Doberman is not a typo of “rabbi.” But that is why JerrySeinfeld no longer will do comedy on campuses:The younger generation “just want to use these words,” Seinfeldsaid. “‘That’s racist, that’ssexist, that’s prejudice.’ They don’t even know what they’re talking about.”So Day Three is an exciting respite, but the oxygen is waning andsoon will be gone for 47 months and three weeks. It was a great night,so inspiring that Istopped taking notes and just enjoyed it like a greatsymphony. OK, asymphony joke —since I am not on campus right now:A guy goes to the cemetery where Beethoven is buried. As he approaches the grave, hesees it is open, and Beethoven actually issitting up, with pages of music in front of him, vigorously rubbing it all out with an eraser. He is just erasing everything, and the page is titled “Ninth Symphony.” So the guysays: “Beethoven, what in the world are you doing in your grave?” And Beethovensays, “I’m decomposing.”Day Three at the GOP ConventionOK, back to the convention Day Three. It was a wonderful night. An Ode to Joy. And yet it also wassomber and about real life. Kayleigh McEnany told her deeply movingstory of the double mastectomyshe voluntarily underwent becauseshe was diagnosed with the gene that can cause thesame fatal breast cancer that killed her close relatives. She assured us thatshe knows this president, and he will cover pre-existing conditions. She also told us that heshowed enormous personal caring, theside the media obscure. Trump deeply cares about people. There areso manystories of this genre that the media cover up. Kellyanne Conwayspoke, and we knowshe isstepping out now to be a Mom after having done masterfully as counselor to the president. She has to focus on the child at home; besides that focus on Husband George,she also wants to devote more time to the kids in this era of remote learning via Zoom. Sister Deirdre Byrne, M. D., of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts, and a former armysurgeon, talked forthrightly about thesanctity of life, a very different message and focus than the nun that Joe Biden had at his convention. Lou Holtz, the legendary Notre Dame football coach, gave a fabulousspeech for Trump. Michael McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations,spoke about the chaos in thestreets of Democrat cities and praised President Trump’s unbridledsupport for our First Responders. After Rep. Elise Stefanik of upstate New York called out theshame and fiction of last December’s Democrat Debacle, the bogus impeachment that got crushed a few weeks later in the Senate like thespider it was, Jack Brewerspoke. He is a former NFLsafety whosetspecial-team records for tackles on teams where he played. He was emphatically pro-Trump, as NFL great Herschel Walker was the day before, and — like Walker andso many othersspeaking at the convention — he is Black. He returned to Joe Biden’s racist theme that, if you don’t vote for Biden, “You ain’t black.” Brewer is Black, as are Vernon Jones, the Georgiastate representative; Kim Klacik, the Baltimore congressional candidate; Herschel Walker; U. S. Sen. Tim Scott; and the many other Black figuressupporting Trump. Do you know who actuallyain’t Black?Joe Biden. There was Chen Guangcheng, blindsince his youth and aself-taught attorney, who was locked up in China for four years and then placed under further house arrest because he opposed the Communists’ one-child policy. He made it to America by escaping house arrest and fleeing to the U. S. embassy in Beijing. Unlike Ocasio and Bernie, Elizabeth Warren and the whole left-tilted Democrat Party, Mr. Guangcheng is fiercely pro-Trump and anti-socialism. Or, as Joe Biden mightsay, “Man, if you’re for Trump and againstsocialism,you ain’t Chinese.” New York Rep. Lee Zeldinspoke. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa talked about how Trump raced tosupport Iowa when it was hit with natural disasters that the media never covered, how Trump’s entire agenda has helped farmerssignificantly, while thesocialist Democrat agenda that has enveloped Joe Biden is the most dangerous anti-farm program ever. Next came another Black former NFL football player, Burgess Owens, who is campaigning in Utah for a congressionalseat. Like Jack Brewer, whospoke earlier, Owens also was asafety. Interesting that no one picked up on their field positions at a convention that has asalient theme that President Trump is the law-and-order candidate who willsupportsafety while Biden and his entourage work to de fund the police. Owens yet again put the lie to Biden’s “You Ain’t Black” racism. Sam Vigil, whose wife innocently wasshot dead while in her garage, praised President Trump’s “Operation Legend,” his crime-enforcement initiative that allows federal agents to work with local police in crime-devastated cities. He told us, “The police were overwhelmed. They needed help. Help arrived when President Trump launched Operation Legend in July of this year. Almost immediately, the FBI took over Jackie’s case. In a matter of days, they arrested four men. The fifth — thesuspected killer — is in a Texas jail on unrelated charges.” A particularly powerful moment came next when Clarence Henderson, who was among those in the 1960 Greensborosit-ins, took centerstage to endorse Trump mightily. Instead of “If you vote for Trump, you ain’t Black,” Hendersonsaid “If you vote for Biden, you don’t know history.” Henderson reminded us why he rightly is regarded as a civil rights hero and what real history teaches:Walking into the Woolworth Department Store on February 2, 1960, I knew it was unlike any day I’d experienced before. My friends had been deniedservice the day before because of the color of theirskin. We knew it wasn’t right. But when we went back the next day, I didn’t know whether I was going to come out in a vertical or prone position, in handcuffs or on astretcher or even in a body bag…. It was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishingslavery. It was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment giving black men citizenship. And it was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote. They don’t teach it that way in college or gradschool, and teachers who try to doso get fired or canceled. But that is the truth thatsneaks onto the TVscreen one week every four years. Henderson tied his message together bysaying that “These achievements demonstrate that Donald Trump truly cares about Black lives. His policiesshow his heart. He has done more for Black Americans in four years than Joe Biden has done in 50.”The evening wound down with two wonderfulspeeches. Richard Grenell, our former ambassador to Germany and then our former Acting Director of National Intelligence, powerfully praised Trump’s foreign policy achievements. Trump had charmed Angela Merkel but also got her to pay more towards NATO. While Obama and Biden flew in hundreds of millions in cash to Iran, Trump flew in the attack craft that evaporated Iran’s master of worldwide terror, Qassem Soleimani. We were reminded that, in a careerspanning nearly half a century in Washington, the historical recordshows that Biden has been wrong on almost everysingle issue that ever has come before him. Even on killing Osama bin Laden, Biden advised Obama to wait. Mike Pence finished with a very fine vice presidentialspeech that touched on all themes of the convention and the Trump–Pence first term. It was wonderful to hear but a bitsaddening, too, because it means we have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it. If we want any other truth to get onto the NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, CNN, or MSNBCscreens between now and November 3, Trump and the GOP will have to buy the minutes. At least Cancel Culturestill allows that. Don’t besure that right willsurvive four years hence if the Left wins in November and extends their digital-media censorship beyond Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook to permeate into broadcast media.",0,0,The American Spectator

113,Andrew Cuomo ran New York badly – because he ran a toxic workplace | Joel Wertheimer,-10.67,31.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/11/andrew-cuomo-new-york-toxic-workplace-governor,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"Andrew Cuomo, the governor of thestate of New York,has resigned after the publication of a report by the attorney general which documented that hesexually harassed 11 women and hisstaff retaliated against one of those women who had the temerity tospeak out. (Cuomo denies any wrongdoing.)Some commentators have taken the opportunity to note that not only did he run a toxic workplace,sexually harassstaff and violatestate and federal laws in his actions, he also has run thestate poorly, despite the reputation he developed during the coronavirus pandemic. But, based in part on my experience of having worked in his administration, it would be more accurate tosay that Cuomo has run New York poorly he ran a toxic workplace,sexually harassedstaff and violatedstate and federal laws. Start with the number of women whose careers were cutshort and harmed by the governor’s actions. That leftNew Yorkwithout the contributions of many women who could have made thestate a better place but who left because of the abuse. And who are the women who did not get jobs in the government at all because Cuomo may not have found them attractive? What was their contribution to our collective wellbeing that was missed? It is impossible to have worked for the governor and not have noticed that thesenior women who worked directly for him predominantly looked alike and notably none of them where non-white. Similarly, the attorney general’s report meticulously detailed the ways in which thestate’s hiring andstaffing decisions were based upon Cuomo’s proclivities. On the one hand, the governor had the New York State police change theirseniority rules to allow a woman that he had met to be assigned tostaff him, even thoughshe was underqualified for the role. On the other, numerous women were given non-substantive jobs in the governor’s vicinity rather thansubstantive work for which they were qualified. Cuomo was more than willing to use his power to degrade government because of his personal desires, and it did notstop at discrimination against women. The brain drain as a result of his toxic administration hurt New York. I made itseven months in the Cuomo administration in 2017. I was looking for a new job after two months. But working in an abusive and chaotic environment where nobody cared about policy outcomes was not worth proximity to power. Thestaff often justified what they went through as necessary for good governance, but I knew otherwise, having just come from the Obama White House, where working long hours was the norm, butso was kindness coming from the top. While I would not count myself as a large loss for the administration, the number ofsmart people who walked in the door and realised they could do more good work elsewhere is innumerable. For example,Andy Byford, who was fixing thesubways that had withered under Cuomo’s time leading New York, left because working for the governor wasso unpleasant. The report also documented the ways in which astaff obsessed withserving the governor, his wants and his image rather than delivering for New Yorkers leads to bad outcomes. Led by the now departed Melissa DeRosa, thestaff were all hands on deck tosilence the harassment claims against Cuomo in the middle of a pandemic. They are alleged to have retaliated againstLindsey Boylan and lied to the press hoping to ward off future accusations. That campaign was described by the governor’s office as “fighting for our lives”, whichshould give us asense of how much energy was being devoted to issues other than running thestate’s government. Indeed, it’s this media obsession and policy failure that led to Cuomo’s massive popularity amid the pandemic while New Yorkers died at higher rates than almost any otherstate in the country. If it had to do with television, he and they cared and they could get good headlines. While I think very little of Cuomo, I do believe hisEmmy was well deserved. He did an incredible job every day playing the competent foil to Donald Trump, assuring ashell-shocked nation desperate for the mere performance of competence. TV Andrew Cuomois good at the job of being TV Governor. When the cameras were off, the image-obsessedstaff failed to deliver for New York. New York issecond among the US’sstates in deaths per capita, and while a fair assessment would note the early timing and geography – nearby New Jersey and Connecticut alsostruggled to prevent Covid deaths – nothingsuggests Cuomo did anything more notable to limit thespread of the virus than other governors. Instead, when his policies potentially led to larger numbers of deaths in elder care facilities, his administration reportedlyscrubbed the numbersat his behest. As New Yorkersstruggled to get Covid tests, his administration pressured hospitals to provide them for his friends and family. And when news broke of hissexual harassment last year, his administration’s Covid “czar”gauged the loyalty of county officialsstruggling to get vaccines to their constituents, according to media reports. That is my memory of working there:seeing peoplescreamed at by his closestaff if the temperature was notsufficiently cold for the governor’s events. Cuomo’s administration has constantly failed because it prized loyalty,subservience andshiny objects over making things work. New York received billions of dollars in rent relief money from the federal government this year, but the programme has been marked by dysfunction, with lawmakers demanding details of the awarding of a no-bid $115m contract to a company that was charged with distributing the funds. Thestate wasted $106mon unused lights for New York bridges, because the governor prized the veneer of infrastructure, all whilesubways broke down. Andrew Cuomo is gone. But there will be more politicians who aresaid tosexually harass theirstaff and run toxic work environments. Weshould remember that the harms do notstop at the women they harass or thestaffers they abuse, although thatshould be enough. The abuse is corrosive, the harms leak out throughout the government, and we are all worse for it.

Tesla’sTSLA,-0.50%Elon Musk has been the biggest beneficiary, with his wealth, as of August 13, tripling to $73 billion. That doesn’t even include the fierce rally in Teslashares on Monday, which pushed Musk into the fourth position ont he Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Here’s the full list:“The total wealth of the Oligarchic Dozen is greater than the GDP of Belgium and Austria combined,”said Omar Ocampo, a researcher for IPS’s program on inequality and the common good. “Meanwhile, tens of millions of Americans are unemployed or living paycheck to paycheck, and 170,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States.”The Oligarchic Dozen, like everybody else, got off to a roughstart this year, with the group’s collective wealth dropping by almost $100 billion from January 1 to March 18. It didn’t take long for their net worth to rebound andsurpass their September 2019 levels, except for Warren BuffettBRK. A,+1.36%, who isstill a couple billionshort of his year-ago figure. And it’s not just Bezos and the bunch who haveseen fortunesmile upon them lately. CEO compensation, overall, climbed to its highest level inseven years last year, and it is positioned to rise once again in 2020, according to an Economic Policy Institutestudy cited by the Washington Post. In fact, the pay ratio between chief executives and workers at America’s 350 biggest companies has widened to 320-to-1, the researchers found. Meanwhile, many on the “Oligarch” list were having another good run on Tuesday, with AmazonAMZN,+7.87%, AlphabetGOOG,+0.58%, Tesla and MicrosoftMSFT,+1.84%, all in the green.

He put those who refuse to call Trump what he is — a racist and antiSemite — on blast. Stop usingsoft language around it. Who benefits from it? Only the racists. Only the antiSemites. This righteous tirade came after Chris Hayes asked the NYT journalist about, in particular, what he made of thesilence of Trump in the face of the awful New Zealand terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 50 innocent Muslims at prayer. ALI: It's the feature, not the bug. Let's not forget when it came to Charlottesville, and there were whitesupremacists, KKK and the alt-right, who repeated the whitesupremacist conspiracy theory that ""Jews will not replace us,"" Donald Trump responded bysaying there are very fine people, and bothsides are to blame. And when it's come to this terrorist attack in New Zealand, which has claimed fifty lives, including a three-year-old baby, it's been five days, Chris, and Donald Trump has yet to use the ""t"" word, terrorism, to describe it. In fact, he has yet to reach out the the victims. In fact, I wish he had half as much concern for the rest of Americans, including Muslims, that he does defending Judge Pirro, who promoted anti-Muslim conspiracies that are found in thesame ideologicalswampshared by these whitesupremacists around the world. I wish he would attack the number one domestic terror threat in America, according to the FBI, which are whitesupremacists, the number onesource of domestic terror plots in the past ten years, with as much gusto and passion that he attacked John McCain, the press, SNL and Robert Mueller. But he has not done that and he hasn't done it throughout his presidency. And, I'llsaysomething bold here, it's because I think, Chris,He's not racially charged or racially motivated or has racial flare-ups. He has promoted and mainstream ed a whitesupremacist conspiracy theory to win the midterm elections, which is that George Soros was funding the caravan — the invasion. Thesame language used, by the way, by the Australian terrorists who killed 50 people last week. Um... YES, PLEASE... Hayes brought up the Mick Mulvaney apology tour, you know the one where the Acting Chief of Staff went to all the cable newsshows and had to answer the question, ""Hey, is your boss a whitesupremacist? Hesureseems awful whitesupremacist-y."" (Sidenote - I don't think Mulvaney has what it takes. By the third orso, he wassuu up er tired of answering that question...""How many times do I have to deny this???"") Ali had an epic takedown of that insulting display, as well. ALI: It's 2019. You can't gaslight me. Because I remember the presidentsaying, ""I think Islam hates us."" I remember the president asking for a (*slipping into the Trump voice*) ""total and complete ban on Muslims until we can figure out what the hell is going on."" I remember the presidentsaying hesaw a tape on television of Muslims celebrating the 9/11 terror attacks. I double-dare you, President Trump. I'm calling you out. Yousay that yousaw the tape of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey the 9/11 terror attacks. Show me the tape. So this is a president who's anti-Muslim. Again I want tosay this, Chris. He mainstream ed a whitesupremacist talking point in October. The Jews, led by George Soros, a Jewish-Hungarian American, funding the caravan of rapists, criminals, Muslims and Mexicans. That is exactly the number one conspiracy theory of whitesupremacists, that the rest of us are being used by the Jews to weaken the white race, which was used by theshooter who killed 50 people last week. You got to call him out and you've also got to call out the Republican leaders who also mainstream ed it. That includes Kevin McCarthy. Call them all out, and ask them, ""Do youstand by President Trump's views of that whitesupremacist conspiracy theory?"" Reporters need to ask until they answer. You hear that, reporters? Call racism and antiSemitism what it is, when it happens, even if it comes out of the mouths of powerful people. ESPECIALLY when it comes out of the mouths of our leaders. And don'tstop asking about it until they answer.",0,0,Crooks and Liars

Maxey can flat outscore, has played with Tyler Herro at Kentucky, and would have fitso well into the team on both ends of the floor. I like Precious Achiuwa, but don’t think his ceiling is as high andsee him as a long-term backup if we get Danilo Gallinari or Giannis. — Ethan, New York. A: But you can’t draft on the assumption of landing other players in free agency, especially with the current whirlwind offseason. (Or perhaps you can, if the Heat know they will be adding a wing.) Face it, if the Heat felt it was a close call, they assuredly would have gone for the Kentucky prospect. So that, alone, tells you that the Heatsawsomething more than No. 20 talent in Achiuwa. Quality bi gs remain harder to find than quality wings. Q: Is it weird that as the league moves more and more into ashooting league, the Heat drafted a player whose only glaring weakness isshooting? — Chadwick, Lake Worth. A: Actually, when you look at the very top of the draft, at the first five orsix players, none are knockdownshooters and only Patrick Williams is considered much in the way of ashooter. What itshows in this era of position-less basketball is that the completeness of a gamestill matters. In Precious Achiuwa, the Heat get a player who fills plenty of boxes, albeit perhaps not necessarily the one you cite. This is when Erik Spoelstra again calls uponshooting coach Rob Fodor. Q: Why the obsession with Bradley Beal? The Heat already have a younger, cheaper version of him in Tyler Herro. Beal did not break any records in his rookie year orshow what Herroshowed us as a rookie. Why are the Heat assuming Herro cannot be thesecondscoring option they’re desperately looking for? I get the “win now” window, but I don’tsee why Pat Riley is itching for Beal, which will require trading Herro. They already have All-Stars in Bam Adebayo and Herro. I feel like circumstances have to force Riley tosee this. — Billy. A: And whosays the Heat are “itching” for Bradley Beal or any potentially availablestar? Or could it be that due diligence requiresstudying any and every option in case that option becomes available? The Wizards ultimately will decide when to engage about Beal and at what level.

On May 25, 2020, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for 9 minutes and 29seconds. The 46-year-old Black man cried out ""I can't breathe"" 27 times. Video of his murder went viral and reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement. Floyd's name and last words became a rallying cry at protests across the country and the world. In the past year, the US grappled with its record on race. AndEuropean countries joined in on examining their own racist and colonial past. There's beensome change toward police reform. At least 17stateshave banned or restricted police use of chokeholds. More than 20 major US cities(think: LA, Seattle, Austin) cut their police budgets insome way. Some have reinvested the money intoservices like mental health and housing programs. And in arar e moment of police accountability, Chauvin was found guilty of all charges (includingsecond-degree murder). He will besentenced next month. But many families – like those ofBreonna Taylor,Daniel Prude, andRonald Greene– arestill waiting for justice. Right. In the first five months of 2021,one analysis found that 353 people died at the hands of law enforcement. A report by human rights experts found that the US's deadly police killings of Black Americans could amount to crimes against humanity. And called on officials to act. But Congress is likely going to missPresident Biden's deadline to pass theGeorge Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Meanwhile,somestates are going the opposite route – like trying to punish cities that vote to cut police funding, or banning lessons on critical race theory (more on thathere). Andsome lawmakersstill maintain the US ""is not a racist country"" – despite an alarming rise in hate crimes and the pervasiveness of whitesupremacy. On the anniversary of George Floyd's death, Americans are reminded of the long fight ahead to reach true justice. Fiame Naomi Mata'afa. Yesterday,she wassworn in as Samoa's first-ever female prime minister...in a makeshift tent. Since 1998, the Pacific island nation has been ruled by the pro-Beijing Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi. But in April, Mata'afa's party tied with incumbent Malielegaoi's in the general election. A vote in favor of Mata'afa broke the tie, making her Samoa's first female PM. Surprise: the guy in charge for 22 years didn't want to make room. And the Supreme Court had to intervene to tell Parliament to do its job. But yesterday, when Mata'afashowed up for work, the doors to the legislature were locked. Mata'afa didn't let thatstop her. Sheset up a tent and gotsworn in outside. Now,the UNsays it'llstep in and helpsolve the powerstruggle if asked by either party. We can go our own way: Samoa is just one of the Pacific island nations that's believed to have received tens of millions of dollars in loans from China in recent years. By one count, it holds about 40% of the island's debt. Now, Mata'afa is expected to change things up, including by working tostop a planned Beijing port on the island. Belarus. Yesterday, the EUsanctioned the Eastern European country for diverting a plane to arrest an opposition activist. On Sunday, a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania landed on Belarusiansoil amid warnings of a bomb threat. But that turned out to be a ploy to arrest Roman Protasevich, a passenger on the flight and an opposition journalist critical of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Now, the EU is banning all Belarusian airlines from flying within the 27-nation bloc, urging EU countries not to fly over Belarus, and calling for Protasevich's release.

An additional monument of Confederate general Stonewall Jackson was also removed from the city on Saturday. WATCH: Stonewall Jackson'sstatue was also removed this morning in Charlottesville.

In 2017, the ""Unite the Right"" rally was organized in response to a city council proposal to remove thestatue and rename a park dedicated to Lee. At that time,several efforts were made across thesouth to remove Confederate monuments and rename publicspaces honoring Confederate figures after a 2015 deadlyshooting in Charleston left nine African Americans dead. But in an effort tostop thestatue's removal, the ""Unite the Right"" rally led to further racial andsocial unrest, as whitesupremacist protesters violently clashed with counter-protesters. One woman, Heather Heyer, was killed when a man drove into a crowd of pedestrians. Dozens of others were injured as the violent clashes carried on for more than a day. Now, after years of contention, protests, and lengthy litigation, thestatues will be moved intostorage until their final disposition is decided on by the city council.

Bush defeated longtime incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay in Missouri's Democratic primary on Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2020. Video by Colter Peterson,cpeterson@post-dispatch.comActivist Cori Bush on Tuesday unseated longtime U. S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, ending his 20-year hold on Missouri's 1st Congressional District and putting her on a path to become the first Black woman to represent Missouri in the nation's capital. Before Clay's tenure, his father William Clay held theseat for three decades. That makes Bush, whose campaign grew out of protests against the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014, the first to topple the Clay political dynasty in 52 years. Bush, 44, of Florissant, first challenged Clay in 2018. She returned this year with thesame message — that Clay hadn't been bold enough in tackling the district's challenges — but with more campaign funds andsupport from progressive groups challenging establishment Democrats in a bid to pull the party left.""Tonight, Missouri's 1st District has decided that an incremental approach isn't going to work any longer,"" Bushsaid in a victoryspeech late Tuesday. ""We decided that we the people have the answers, and we will lead from the front lines.""Not me, US. Bush, who hasspoken openly about being evicted and failing to pay taxes, hassaid her background as asingle mother of two children connects her to working families in the district. She has promised to continue participating instreet protests as asitting member of Congress. In herspeech Tuesday, Bushsaid Black Lives Matter ""are not just words. … It is historic that this year, of all the years, we'resending a Black, working-class,single mother, who's been fighting for Black livessince Ferguson, all the way to the halls of congress.""Bush’s campaign focused on universal health care, radically reforming police departments, free public education and raising the minimum wage — policies advocated by U. S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who describes himself as a democraticsocialist. Bush thanked Sanders for his endorsement andsupport Tuesday. In their first match up in 2018, Clay defeated Bush by more than 28,000 votes — a 20-point margin that was the closest any challenger had come to unseating Clay until Tuesday night. This year,she defeated Clay by a 3-point margin, 72,812 votes to 68,201. Bush had more than triple the campaign donations than in 2018, and more name recognition from an appearance in “Knock Down the House,” a 2019 Netflix documentary that followed Bush and three other candidatesseeking to replace incumbent Democrats with progressive women, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. Her campaign wassupported by Justice Democrats, which elevated Ocasio-Cortez, and more recently, formerschool principal Jamaal Bowman’s upset against 16-term incumbent Rep. Elliot Engel in New York. Bush's campaignsought to leverage the wins, as well as inequities highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd. Clay, long asolid vote for Democratic policies, had touted hissupport for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, and for impeaching President Donald Trump — all positions that put him left of other centrist Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Clay has also pointed to his role in bringing the multimillion-dollar National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency campus to north St. Louis. The winner of Tuesday's primary is expected to coast to victory in November's general election, as the district typically votes overwhelmingly Democratic. A third candidate for the Democratic nomination, Katherine Bruckner, had captured about 6.3% of the vote — 5,142 votes as of 10:30 p.m. Winnie Heartstrong and Anthony Rogers both filed for the GOP nomination but did not mount active campaigns. Rogers was on track to win Tuesday with 25-point margin. There were no intraparty competitions in Tuesday’s primary for Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District, where Democrat State Sen. Jill Schupp is challenging U. S. Rep. Ann Wagner. Libertarian Martin Schulte, of Ballwin, is also running in the Nov. 3 general election. The 2nd Congressional District includes much of St. Louis County, and parts of St. Charles and Jefferson counties. In Missouri’s 3rd Congressional District, U. S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyersoundly defeated four Republican challengers in a five-way primary. Luetkemeyer, of St. Elizabeth, had captured nearly 75% of the vote. Luetkemeyer is heavily favored to win the Nov. 3 general election in the heavily Republican district against the Democratic nominee and Libertarian, Leonard Steinman, who ran unopposed in the primary. Megan Rezabek, of Imperial, defeated Dennis Oglesby, of Warrenton, for the Democratic nomination. Rezabek won with a 29-point margin. The 3rd Congressional District includes parts of St. Charles County and Jefferson County and all of Warren, Franklin and Lincoln counties.

Beating rival Jeff Bezos tospace by nine days, Branson and company expect to zoom higher than 50 miles in Virgin'ssleekspaceplane, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness and out-of-this-world views before gliding back to landing at Spaceport America near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. It will be the fourth pilotedspaceflight for Virgin's VSS Unityspace plane and its 22nd overall. But it will be the first with a crew ofsix on board and the first with Branson, a high-stakes demonstration of his long-standing commitment to launching wealthyspace tourists, researchers and even astronauts intospace on a for-profit basis. It also demonstrates the high-stakes nature of the competition to be first in the emergingspace tourism marketplace with Virgin Galactic competing head to head with Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, forspace tourism dollars. After 15 unpiloted test flights, Bezos announced last month that he planned to fly aboard his company's New Shepardspacecraft July 20 when it takes off on its first piloted flight tosub-orbitalspace. A few days later, Branson upstaged the Amazon founder, announcing he planned to take off nine days earlier.""Yeah, there's a little bit of competition in the who's going first or when things are happening,"" Virgin President Mike Moses, a formerspaceshuttle manager at NASA, told CBS News. ""But it's really not a race. It's not a competition. I know thatsounds maybe a littleshallow or disingenuous, but it's not.""It's asmall community. I know dozens of people who work at Blue Origin, I know dozens and dozens of people at SpaceX, and we all used to work together at NASA. And I wish everysingle one of them the best. ... Because all of us together is what's going to get humans intospace and our culture to recognize thatspace travel is the foundation for the future for everyone.""With typical Branson fanfare, Sunday's flight will be broadcast live across Virgin Galactic'ssocial media platforms, featuring appearances by Stephen Colbert and retired Canadianspacestation astronaut Chris Hadfield, along with the performance of a newsong bysinger-songwriter Khalid. Even SpaceX founder Elon Musk plans to be watching.""Willsee you there to wish you the best,"" he tweeted Saturday. Willsee you there to wish you the bestVSS Unity, mounted beneath the wing of Virgin's twin-fuselage carrier jet VMS Eve, isscheduled for takeoff from Spaceport Americashortly after 10:30 a.m. ET,slightly later than originally planned due to overnight weather. Joining Branson will be company pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, both veterans of earlier test flights tospace, along with company astronaut trainer Beth Moses, also a flight veteran and Mike Moses' wife; operations engineer Colin Bennett; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research.""This has been a long journey for him,"" Mike Mosessaid of Branson. ""He's like a kid in a candystore here in training this week. He's bouncing around, he's happy, excited. ... But that excitement is really infectious. Andso the whole crew is feeling it.""Asked if the team felt any pressure because of Branson's presence on board, not to mention his wife's, Mosessaid he would not hesitate to call off the flight if the weather or a technical issue raises asafety concern.""I'vescrubbed while Richard was watching before, and if I have toscrub while he's on board, we will,"" Mosessaid. ""It's a human flown, piloted aircraft. Andso we take thatsafety very, veryseriously. And we don't treat any one crew member as any more or less important than any other.""Assuming all goes well, VMS Eve will climb to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. At that point, after a final round ofsafety checks, carrier pilots Rick Sturckow and Kelly Latimer will release Unity to fly on its own. Seconds after dropping away, Mackay and Masucci will ignite Unity's hybrid rocket motor, kicking off a high-speed near-vertical climb out of the lower atmosphere, pushing the crew back in theirseats with up to three times the normal force of gravity. During crew training, Mackay told Branson and his crew mates thespace plane will propel them ""nice andsmoothly to zero G.""""It feels wonderful, and you will want to get out of yourseat automatically, I think, to unstrap yourself and experience this thing,"" hesaid in a company videoshot during training. ""To me, it's all about the view, and it's absolutely amazing. It'sspectacular.""After the rocket motorshuts down, thespace plane will continue climbing on a ballistic trajectory, reaching a high point of more than 50 miles, the ""boundary"" ofspace recognized by NASA and the FAA, before arcing over and beginning the plunge back to Earth. Along the way, the four passengers will experience about three minutes of weightlessness, allowing them to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin behind the two pilots, taking inspectacular views of Earth andspace through 12 windows. For re-entry, thespace plane utilizes an innovation pioneered by legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan -- wing-like tail booms that rotate upward with respect to the fuselage after the vehicle leaves the lower atmosphere. In theso-called ""feathered"" orientation, aerodynamic drag issharply increased, causing thespacecraft to naturally orient itself like a badmintonshuttlecock for a relatively low-speed, low-temperature re-entry with minimal piloting. Once back in the lower atmosphere, the tail booms will rotate back parallel with the fuselage and the pilots will guide Unity to a landing on Spaceport America's 12,000-foot-long runway. If all goes well, Virgin is expected to carry out two more test flights before beginning commercial operations with paying customers on board. Ticket prices have not been announced, but aseat is expected to cost in the neighborhood of $250,000. More than 600 enthusiasts have reservedseats.""I think we'reseeing the tip of the iceberg with the folks that havestepped forward already,"" Mosessaid. ""There's going to be a huge interest.""",1,2,CBS News

In thesurvey released today byMason-Dixon Polling & Strategy,27 percent of respondentssaid they'dsupport Moore if the Republican primary were held now. Three Alabama members of the U. S. House trailed him -- Mo Brooks with 18 percent, Bradley Byrne with 13 percent, and Gary Palmer with 11 percent. State Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh had 4 percent, and businessman Tim Jones had 2 percent. A quarter of respondents were undecided. Moore is well-known for his anti-LGBTQstances. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he fought marriage equality, claiming that thestate didn't have to obey the U. S. Supreme Court's ruling on the matter. In 2017 he was removed from thestate's high court for good, due to ethics violations related to his efforts against equal marriage rights. He then ran in aspecial election for the U. S. Senateseat vacated by Jeff Sessions, ultimately losing to Democrat Doug Jones. The race was marked by accusations byseveral women of pedophilia and othersexual misconduct on Moore's part. Jones's term is up in 2020, and in the poll, 40 percent of respondentssaid they would vote to reelect him, 50 percent would replace him with a Republican, and 10 percent were undecided. Byrne is the only Republican who has formally declared his candidacyso far, but Moore hassaid he is thinking about another Senate run. ""I'mseriously considering it,"" he told American Family Radio host Bryan Fischer, whose homophobia matches Moore's, last month. Moore's poll results reflect the fact that he has greater name recognition than others in the Republican field,CBS Newsreports. But his extremism and the accusations will likely put off many voters, the network notes.

Trump claimed that continued vote counting constituted “a major fraud on our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. We’ll be going to the U. S. Supreme Court. We want all voting tostop.”Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillonsent out astatement calling Trump’s comments “outrageous, unprecedented and incorrect.”O’Malley Dillonsaid the Biden campaign has “legal teamsstanding by ready to deploy to resist that effort” and that they “will prevail.”There arestill hundreds of thousands of votes left to be counted in a handful of “battleground”states that remain too close to call. The Associated Press has not declared a winner in the presidential race. Trump has indicated that he believes the elevation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, the president’s thirdselection for the court, would give his campaign an advantage in a legal challenge. The Biden campaign has expressed confidence that the final results in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will vault the former vice president to the 270 Electoral College votes needed tosecure the presidency.

Biden appears to have carried Arizona and has ashot instill-uncalled Georgia, two traditionally Republicanstates. With a win in Arizona or Georgia, the Democratic nominee would have a route to victory even without one of the three “Blue Wall”states.

130,Ohio lawmakers to end session without addressing scandal-drenched House Bill 6,-1.0,48.33,https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/12/ohio-lawmakers-to-end-session-without-addressing-scandal-drenched-house-bill-6.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,18,"COLUMBUS, Ohio—In the wake of what federal authoritiessay is the largest briberyscheme in Ohio history,state lawmakers vowed to repeal, or at least reform, the law at the center of thescandal: the House Bill 6 nuclear bailout law. But after months of hearings and negotiations,state lawmakers will end their legislativesession without passing asingle measure addressing HB6 in any way, displaying astunning inability to do anything about a law that has become an embarrassment to thestate. The reason is that legislative Republicans, who dominate both the Ohio House and Senate, aresplit about what to do with HB6:some want to fully repeal it,some want a partial repeal, and others argue itshould be kept in place. Most legislative Democrats, for their part, have insisted on fully repealing HB6 and have generally opposed any reform effortsshort of that.“Thesubstance of House Bill 6, not the criminal proceedings, are complex issues on which there’s a wide range of opinion in the legislature,”said House Speaker Bob Cupp, a Lima Republican,according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. “The diversity of views on what is good and appropriate public policy, I think, has forestalled a consensus on whatshould be done.”Cupp continued: “Whether it’s revise, repeal, replace, partial revision, partial replacement, partial repeal, total repeal, no replacement -- these are policy issues that we’ll be continuing to work on in the next general assembly.”Senate Republicans, meanwhile, placed the blame on their colleagues in the House, which wanted to take the lead on addressing HB6 because the legislation originated there.“I think weshould have done a repeal, and I think weshould have done it a long time ago,”said Senate President Larry Obhof, a Medina Republican. “I’m disappointed that that didn’t happen.”Obhof told reporters after the Senate wrapped up business Tuesday that deciding what to do about HB 6 has been “a difficult issue” in both chambers.“You run intosituations where there are people who want to repeal it but won’t vote for anything except for astraight repeal, for example -- even if there’s a change that moves in the direction that they want, because it’s not everything that they want,” Obhofsaid. “And then you havesome people who look at it andsay, ‘Hey, whatever its underlying problems may have been, or whatever its origins may have been, we voted on it when we did because we thought it was the right public policy, and that hasn’t necessarily changed.’”Despite lawmakers’ failure to act, the $1 billion-plus nuclear bailout at the heart of HB6 is on hold for now, as a Franklin County judge on Mondayissued a preliminary injunction blocking thestate fromstarting to collect money from rate payers next month. But it remains to beseen whether the 2019 law itself will be eviscerated by the courts, or whether lawmakers will finally agree on a repeal or (more likely) a reform of the law after they begin a newsession next month. GOP lawmakers have met behind closed doors during the final days of the lame-ducksession, proposing (among other things) tode lay the bailout fee collection by a year while an audit is conducted tosee whether the nuclear plants actually need the money. Bizarrely,Energy Harbor, owner of the plants, has lobbied lawmakers to give it the option of refusing the bailout money, as a federal regulatory ruling might turn audit-reducedsubsidies into a financial liability. Even Republicans who favor repealing and replacing House Bill 6 have noted, accurately, that HB6 is an enormously complex law that goes far beyond the nuclear bailout. Given that they are now being criticized for acting too quickly to pass HB6 in the first place, they want to makesure that any changes they make to it now won’t have unintended consequences for Ohioans. Between 2021 until 2027, HB6 directs that every Ohio electricity customer has to pay a new monthlysurcharge that ranges from 85 cents for residential customers to $2,400 for large industrial plants. The money would go to Energy Harbor, a former FirstEnergy Corp.subsidiary that owns the Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear plants along Lake Erie. However, the judge’s injunction doesn’t affect other parts of the bill, includingsubsidies forsixsolar plants and two coal plants, one of which is in Indiana. Anotherso-called “decoupling” provisional lows FirstEnergy to charge rate payers what could end up being hundreds of millions of dollars more, making the company “somewhat recession-proof,”in the words of ex-FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones. Federal authorities arrested then-House Speaker Larry Householder and four alliesin July,claiming they received more than $60 million from FirstEnergy Corp. tosecure the passage of HB6 and fend off a potential referendum to overturn it. So far, two Householder allies -- political aide Jeff Longstreth and FirstEnergy lobbyist Juan Cespedes --have pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy charges for their roles in thescandal. FirstEnergy has also fired Jonesand other top executives, though to date no FirstEnergy or Energy Harbor officials have been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. Householder has maintained his innocenceand, besides losing thespeakership, has faced no political penaltyso far -- the Perry County Republican has remained in the House and was evenre-elected to another termin a landslide.

Along with other recent nominations, the choice ofsomeone who has foughtGoogle, Apple and Amazon in the courts on antitrust issuesshows that the administration is interested in pushing back on the runaway power of Big Tech. But antitrust is just one part of the much broader landscape of corporate and white-collar law enforcement. And in almost every other respect, after four years of the Trump administration rolling backscrutiny on everything from consumer fraud to corporate tax evasion, there is little indication that Merrick Garland’s Justice Department is moving to put teeth back into Washington’s approach. Indeed,six months into Biden’s presidency, the DOJseems to be paying virtually no attention to one of our country’s most pressing and persistent law enforcement problems. Data from across thefederalgovernmentindicated that financial fraud and corporate misconduct were at all-time highs when Biden took office, andsince then,the FBI,the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauandthe Federal Trade Commissionall released data thatshowed things had gotten only worse in areas of misconduct under their respective purviews.",1,1,Politico

S.-Mexico border in her role dealing with waves of migrants to the U. S.“Listen,”shesaid animatedly to reporters who’d accompanied her. “I’ve been to the border before. I will go again. But when I’m in Guatemala ... I think weshould have a conversation about what’s going on in Guatemala.”It was the kind of moment that has evensupporters questioning her political acumen — underscoring why Harris, nearlysix months into her term as a history-making vice president, consistently lags in polls behind President Biden, has failed to get thesame honeymoon with voters, draws more critical media coverage andstands as a bigger target for Republicans.“Just in terms of the public-facingstuff, it hasn’t been astellarsix months,”said David Axelrod, formerly thesenior campaign and White House advisor to President Obama.“You have limited opportunities to play the featured actor,” he added. “Mostly, you’re playing asupporting role. So ifsomething goes wrong during those limited opportunities, they are magnified.”Harris ended upgoing to the border last week, but the controversy over whethershe would go provided grist for Democrats whosee her flailing in the face of the Republicans’ attacks. That Harris’ publicsupport trails that of Biden, who is favored by aslight majority in most polls, is fairly typical for vice presidents, who by definition play backup roles, are less well known andsometimesserve as heatshields for their bosses. Harris, as a Black and Asian woman, also issubject to racial and gender prejudice that neither Biden nor her predecessors faced. Women in public or private jobs, especially women of color, are often judged more harshly and held to higherstandards than white male colleagues in high-level positions. Still,some Democrats are beginning to worry that hersluggish approval numbers are indicative of a bigger problem for Harris, who as vice president ranks as the party’s potential heir to Biden, the oldest president in U. S. history at 78. They have many of thesame doubts that have long dogged her, and contributed to her failed campaign for Democrats’ 2020 presidential nomination — about herstyle, political instincts and treatment ofstaff. Politicoreported last week about increased tensions within her office — including aides’ frustrations with Chief of Staff Tina Flournoy — while Axios followed wit han article about friction between Harris’staff and Biden’s. At least three Harrisstaffers have left in recent weeks and others aresaid to be considering thesame. For now, those who’ve departed have been fairly low-level aides, andsome churn is expected given thestress that comes with White House jobs. Still, Harris has long had a reputation for highstaff turnover, and as vice presidentshe is working with an almost entirely new group of advisors, no longer in close touch with much of the political team in California that helped propel her career. Alliessay the hand-wringing is overwrought. Some complain that Harris has been hemmed in by the White House, even as Biden has given her thorny, perhaps impossible, tasks — notably, toseek ways to deter migration from Central America and to lead Democrats’ fight to expand access to voting. Mark Buell, who has been Harris’ chief fund raisersince her first race for district attorney of San Francisco,said the White Houseseems to be giving her the toughest jobs without the full license to make her own mark.“The administration needs to give her real authority, whereshe can hold a press conference andsay, ‘Here’s what I think and here’s where I’m going,’” Buellsaid. Administration officialssay Harris is a valued voice behind thescenes and that her polling numbersshould not be asurprise, given thatshe is playing asupporting role and lacks Biden’s decades on the nationalstage.“She’s actually doing the hard work that a vice president does and not getting the credit for it because people have thissense thatsheshould be out there doingsomething different,”said Anita Dunn, asenior advisor to Biden. Asenior administration official who would not agree to be quoted by name acknowledged that it’s “always part of the vice president’s role” to “takesome of the heat” for the president, and called it “insulting” tosuggest Harris’ assignments are too hard, as if “she needs to be protected.” The most important thing, the official added, is that the vice president is a trusted advisor and public messenger. Harris is viewed favorably by an average of 44% of voters and unfavorably by about 47%, according to theReal Clear Politics average of recent polls. Biden, by contrast,is viewed favorably by 51% of voters, with about 43.5% disapproving. The difference in approval between them, in the highsingle digits, has been fairly consistent over past months. A recent YouGov pollshowedsome of the factors behind the numbers. Biden did better than Harris among white voters across the board, but especially among white women with college degrees. While both get high approval from Democrats and low approval from Republicans, the intensity ofsupport or opposition is different: More Democratssaid they “strongly approve” of Biden thansaid thesame about Harris, and fewer Republicanssaid they “strongly disapprove” of him. Those differences reflect on the one hand Harris’ lukewarmsupport from the Democratic Party’s base, a problemsince the 2020 presidential nomination race, and on the other the relentless attacks against her from conservative politicians and media.“She’s not going to have a thermometer rating that matches the president’s. She just isn’t,”said former Obama pollster Cornell Belcher, referring to his own polling data. “She issubservient to the No. 1, just like he wassubservient to the No. 1 when he was behind Obama.”Donna Brazile, a friend and former Democratic Party chief,said it’s too early for Harris to worry about the polls. If they look thesame a year from now, Brazile went on, then Harrisshould look at increasing her prominence. But for now,sheshould continue to literallystand behind or beside Biden at public events while advising him privately, Brazilesaid. Perhaps the biggest challenge for all vice presidents isshowing the public that they are capable of leading as commander in chief. For Harris, that challenge is all the greater, given thatshe is the first woman and the only woman of Black and Asian descent to hold the job.“Middle white America” — people between the coasts — “they’re comfortable with an older white guy, and I don’t think I’msaying anything insane when Isay that,”said Belcher, who is a Black man. But he pointed out that Harris’ barrier-breaking identity is also a political asset, which will only be more valuable by 2028, when Biden, if he runs and wins reelection, would be ending his presidency. By then, given demographic trends, “we have an electorate that is probably about eight [percentage] points browner,” Belchersaid. Bakari Sellers, a co-chair of Harris’ presidential campaign and a CNN political commentator who remains a confidant,said Harris gets morescrutiny than her predecessors and less leeway than Biden. For example, hesaid that Biden’s recent comments that put the administration’s infrastructure package in jeopardy were greeted as a “faux pas.” But, he added: “If Kamala Harris had done that, it’sstories about ‘Isshe prepared?’”Sellers does have advice: Harrisshould “stop advisor-sourcing information and just fall back on her gut.”Hesaid that Harris did not look comfortable whenshesaid in Guatemala that would-be migrantsshould “stay home.”“I’m prettysure that came from the White House,” Sellersaid, “and that’s why it didn’tsound natural.”",1,2,LA Times

Then compare yourself toBLM co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors and her four homes worth a total worth of $3.2 million. Local BLM organizers are crowd funding tostay active while their fearless leader is currentlysearching for property at the resort area in the Bahamas where Justin Timberlake also has a home. Maybe they’ll discuss marches and riots at the next neighborhood barbecue. After all, their personal chefs will be busy manning the grill.“An Australian Strategic Policy Institute report published this March, “Uyghurs forsale,” found Uyghurslave labor working in factoriessupplying 83 well-known global brands in the technology, clothing,shoe, and automotivesectors, including Apple, GM, Gap — and Nike.” But that’s funny because Apple and Nike are amongstsome of the biggest names insocial justice. Maybe buyingshoes made fromslave labor is thesame assupporting minorities in business orsomething?Picture the rainbow flag that appears all over advertisements during Pride month and tell me if those businesses really care about LGBT issues (and yeah, I refuse to add other letters to that, it is what it is) or if the marketing teamsimply understands that hanging a flag might bring them more customers. At the very least it may help keep thesharks at bay when it comes time to criticize companies for not being woke enough. And while we’re talking about money, if you’re wondering where all the money raised by climate change activists goes…it goes toscientists who publicly endorse climate change, federal funding, international assistance, and the planning of more climate activism. It’s a billion-dollar industry that has donesquat for climate change. Despite the fact that globalsurface temperaturesstalled in 2000 and haven’t increasedsignificantlysince, we’ve been promised that the world would endseveral times by now. Even with all the urgency and alarm, the best plan on the table tosave us involves giving everyone a free home and banning cows or developing cows that don’t pass gas courtesy of theGreen New Deal. I look back at these predictions made on Earth Day in 1970, and I wonder ifscientists the world over wouldn’t benefit from a Xanax. Of course, the billion-dollar drug industry is doing well enough on its own. Did you know that climate anxiety is an illness you can get a prescription for? It doesn’t rid you of the problem, but it can mask it for life if you take it that long. Problemsolved. Restless legsyndrome? There’s a pill for that, no need tostand up. Active child? That can be cured in no time. I think it’s nosecret that Big Pharma is aself-licking ice cream cone. Their “compassion” for the traumas of the world is filling their pockets. They remind me a bit of politicians who want to keep us locked down for our ownsafety, but also want to go to hairsalons and have birthday parties with their friends. The compassion, it’sso thick you could choke on it. I found an illustrative video on the cycle of moneysurrounding pharmaceutical companies if you don’t mind a few F-bombs. At the end of the day, I’m notsaying that none of these issues are real issues. I mean, I DO think BLM issimply a Nigerian Princescam because they raised $90 million and none of it went to black communities. But are there times when medications are life-saving? Absolutely. Is the climate changing? Sure. Are the LGBT issues worth discussing? I’dsayso. But aresocial justice activism and virtuesignaling addressing any of these issues in earnest? Not at all. Not even a little bit. But is it making money? Oh my goodness, yes! It’s raking in the big dough. Dollar-dollar-bills y’all. There are definitely times when companies like Gillette and the NFL can virtuesignal withsuch gusto that they lose money and fans faster than Kaepernick can drop from the bench to his knees. But for the most part, if donesubtly, most people don’t even acknowledge the businesses pandering to the woke crowd or the organizations putting pressure on them to doso. It’s time for the people who donate to andsupport these organizations to look past the outrage encouraged, the complicity demanded, and the catchyslogans and readily available tee-shirts to ask where the money is going and how it’s making a difference.

S. will appeal a federal judge’s ruling that the DACA program protecting hundreds of thousands of “Dreamers” who came to the country as children was implemented unconstitutionally, and he renewed his call for Congress to agree on a permanentsolution.“Yesterday’s Federal court ruling is deeply disappointing,” Bidensaid in astatement Saturday. “The Department of Justice intends to appeal this decision in order to preserve and fortify DACA.”U. S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen of Houston issued his ruling Friday in asuit brought by Republican-ledstates over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was implemented by the Obama administration on behalf of almost 650,000 Dreamers fighting tostay in the country.“Although Congress maysomeday enactsuch a Dream Act, until it does, its continued failure to pass bills coextensive with the DACA population evinces a rejection of this policy,” Hanensaid in a 77-page decision, which noted widespreadsympathy for Dreamers. “As much as this court might agree with thesesentiments, and as popular as this program might be, the proper origination point for DACA was, and is, Congress.”The ruling comes amid a continuing humanitarian crisis: Since thestart of the year, U. S. authorities have apprehended or denied entry to more than 200,000 Central Americans at thesouthern U. S. border, expelling many of them to Mexico. Hanensaid it would be too disruptive to the lives of Dreamers in the existing program to end it immediately. He ordered the U. S. Department of Homeland Security to continue renewing permits for current enrollees and to not reject any renewals because of his order, while he gives Congress and the administration time to figure out how to cure the legal defects that undermined the program. Bidensaid the ruling underscores the urgency that Congress, through the process known as reconciliation or other means, pass a law to “finally providesecurity to all Dreamers, who have lived too long in fear.”One of Biden’s first actions as president was an executive order for DHS to “preserve and fortify” DACA, and the agencysays it will undergo the formal rule-making process Texas claims Obama illegallyskipped. The U. S. House has passed a bill to give all DACA recipients lawful permanent residency. A bipartisan companion bill that protects Dreamers is under consideration in the Senate. While none of the young people is at immediate risk of either deportation or losing work authorization, the judge effectivelysaid rescuing Dreamers is a job for Congress and the Biden administration, which have failed to reach agreement on what to do with them. The legal challenge moves next to the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, which now includessix judges appointed by former President Trump. Hanen’s decision ultimatelysets the case back on track to the U. S. Supreme Court, which ruled in June 2020 that Trump couldn’t arbitrarily end DACA without following federal rule-making procedures and providing a good explanation. The Texas challenge asked thesame legal question in reverse, whether former President Obama violated federal procedures when he implemented DACA without congressional approval in 2012. Friday’s ruling was nosurprise, given Hanen’s previous conclusion in a related case that DACA appeared unconstitutional but that ending it would be like trying to unscramble an egg. Hanen ruled that Obamaskipped thesame required rule-makingsteps as Trump. But the judge indicated DACA might yet besaved if the Biden administration gave the public time to comment on a new version of DACA before a reconstituted program is put into place. Representatives of Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton, whospearheaded thestates’ fight against DACA, didn’t immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment. The Dreamers hadsupport in court from a broad coalition of civil rights groups, business associations, healthcare organizations and academic institutions. They argued DACA recipients will contribute as much as $460 billion to U. S gross domestic product by 2028, according to astudy by the Center for American Progress. Companies will have tospend $6.3 billion to hire replacements if Dreamers lose their jobs, thestudy found. Texas claimed it hadspent at least $250 million annually providing education, healthcare and law enforcementservices to immigrants in the country illegally, costs that justify court protection from the program’s financial harm. Hanensaid Friday that the 5th Circuit has already rejected the balancing argument that the Dreamers’ economic contribution outweighs theirsocial cost to thestates where they live and receiveservices. But he clearly wanted to avoid throwing the lives ofso many young people into chaos,saying they were on the wrongside of the law through no fault of their own. Texas, in addition to the DACA challenge, also persuaded a federal judge to block the plan Biden announced after taking office in January to halt deportations of immigrants in the U. S. illegally for 100 days. The proposed deportation freeze was part of a broader effort to roll back Trump policies and work toward nationwide immigration reform.",2,2,LA Times

Romulus Mayor LeRoy Burcroff acknowledged using $4,500 from the funds to cover the open bar at the wedding at a yacht club, according to a Friday report from localABC News affiliate WXYZ. Burcroff's attorney, Daniel Wholihan, told the news outlet that the wedding was related to the campaign because many of those attending the wedding had also worked for Burcroff. Wholihan added that while using the money for the wedding created ""poor optics,"" he did not believe it constituted an improper use of funds. Hesaid that Burcroff hassince repaid the expenses to his campaign, WXYZ reported.

Not Even CLOSE",24.0,9.33,https://thenewamerican.com/300000-u-s-covid-deaths-not-even-close/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,16,"With the way COVID-19 deaths are recorded, many may wonder if they were calculated with a Dominion voting machine and if the disease’s name is “Biden.” After all, other causes of death appear to have a funny way of ending up in the coronavirus column. The disease that reallyseems to be losing “votes” to the China virus is the flu, and now even more evidence to this effect has emerged. As commentator Andrea Widburgwrites:We keep being told that Americans are dying like flies, far in excess of their normal numbers. I accept that there are excess deaths. I’msure that the virus increased our annual death rate inspring, when many elderly people died in the first wave after Democrat governors trapped them in retirement homes and thensent in infected people. I’m alsosure that more Americans are dying from cancer, heart disease, depression,suicide, murder, andspousal abuse thanks to the cruelty of the lockdowns. What offsets all this is that fewer Americans are dying from the flu. That’s either because masks help prevent the flu (although we’re told our mask use is all wrong forstopping the virus) or because a lot of the deaths marked as Wuhan virus deaths are in fact flu deaths. The mask theory doesn’tseem tenable, and this isn’t just because data indicate that masks, at best, offer marginal protection. It’s also that if the China virus is “spiking” despite mask use, whyshould we think the flu wouldn’t also be experiencing its regular fall increase?Of course, one could make the case that because SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious, itsspread would be even greater were it not for mask use and that the latter hassuppressed it and the flu. But among the reasons to question this theory are the following data, found by way of Widburg:Deaths in the USA over the years…2010: 2.5M2011: 2.5M2012: 2.5M2013 :2.6M2014: 2.6M2015: 2.7M2016: 2.7M2017: 2.8M2018: 2.8M2019: 2.9M2020: 2.5M (as of November)Where is the massivespike?(h/t@MillerStream)As Widburg points out, while the 2020 mortality data aren’t complete, it’s unlikely the number will eclipse recent years’ just based on adding in December figures. (Moreover, if people really are concerned about deaths, isn’t the realstory here thesteady mortality increasesince 2012?)Also, despite media claims to the contrary, hospitals aren’t on average overburdened. In fact, as “fears persist of overwhelmed medicalsystems and at-capacity hospitals nationwide, data indicate that ample hospitalspace remains available for both COVID-19 patients and other medical needs, with one official at a major hospital networkstating that the country is ‘managing pretty well’ the latestsurge of COVID-19,”reportsJust the News. The above is true even if there are a fewstrained hot-spot urban hospitals. Note, too, that temporary hospitals established early in the pandemic largely went unused and had to be dismantled. Widburg alsostates that fear of overwhelmed hospitals perhaps originated with video from Italy. Yet that nation hassocialized medicine, which — in accordance with the economic principle that price caps lead toshortages — is notorious forsuffering a lack of resources. But perhaps moststriking, and actual news, is the following Twitter thread Widburg presents from a long-time pharmacist talking about asuspicious flu-related phenomenon:pic.twitter.com/Gt8mkqAVap3)…how much ta mi flu and generic has hesold to Pharmacies thisseason. He hasn’tsold any. He has 75 accounts of independent pharmacies across the United States. 👇4) Conclusion: By now, it’s well known that Covid tests give false positives. How many of these false positives are actually “the flu”? How many are just “the common cold”? Why does the CDC report daily case numbers & deaths for Covid and not for the flu? …6) I believe we’re being played. Yes, Covid is real, it can be deadly. We now have drug regimens to treat Covid effectively, one being Dr. Zev Zelenko’s@zev_drregimen, among others. I believe the Covid numbers are beingskewed upward, on purpose…8) If we areso obedient to wear masks,obedient tostand here,don’tstand there, obedient to get the Covid vaccine,obedient to carry proof you’ve gotten the vaccine; otherwise,you won’t be able to fly; then it will be buses, trains, taxis, Uber’s,Target,Walmart, grocerystores…Mr. Staub then concludes with (a bit ofsalty language in the last tweet):10)They really don’t know what they’ll find out in 6 months, a year, 5 years & longer, that can be attributed to the vaccine. It’s way past time for people to take their heads out of their ass &start thinking for themselves. / DoneThough eye-brow raising, Staub’s input could be dismissed as anomalous anecdote — were it not for that itsimply affirms long-made claims from othersources. Moststrikingly, the CDC reported in November that 88,280 China-virus-labeled deaths were actually caused by the flu or pneumonia, according to One America News (OAN; video below). OAN also reported that the CDC tells us that 51,000 China-virus-labeled deaths were actually caused by heart attacks. In fairness,some observers claim that COVID can induce heart attacks in certain individuals, which underlines the reality that people with comorbidities (e.g., heart disease) are most vulnerable; note that the CDC reported thissummer that 94 percent of China virus “victims” had an average of 2.6 comorbidities. The vast majority of the population, however, has a SARS-CoV-2survival rate in excess of 99.5 percent. Someone else who questioned the China virus numbers, early on, was radio giant Michael Savage, a trained epidemiologist and author of close to 20 health and nutrition books. In thespring, he analyzed comprehensive April 6 disease data and noted that while COVID deaths were rising, flu-related deaths hadsupposedly dropped almost to zero. For all intents and purposes, this is a. Then there was the conversation I had with asecurity guard at a local hospital while waiting for a loved one receiving medical care. We were discussing how the China virus was affecting his institution and, after expressingsome realities, he casuallysaid, “And, of course, they’re lumping in all the flu cases with COVID.”After I related this on Twitter, a naysayer mocked the man’ssecurity guardstatus. But note that not only wasn’t he a very political person, he also no doubt talks to doctors and nurses just as hespoke to me — and them talk, too. So he’s perhaps as good asource as any. Yet, again, none of this is revelatory. As the liberal reported in early September, “According to Daniel Spitz, chief medical examiner in Macomb County, Michigan, ‘I think a lot of clinicians are putting that condition [COVID-19] on death certificates when it might not be accurate because they died with coronavirus and not of coronavirus.’” Other medical experts have informed likewise.

138,Don’t Blame Trump for Afghanistan’s Collapse. Blame Barack Obama.,10.67,32.33,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/08/13/dont-blame-trump-for-afghanistans-collapse-blame-barack-obama/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,25,"President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw abruptly from Afghanistan, without any discernible exitstrategy, has plunged that nation into a bloody, ruinous chaos. After pleading with theTalibantospare our embassy in Kabul, he has now redeployed 3,000 troops to conduct a hasty air evacuation of embassystaff. At thisstage, the only good that can come from this debacle is that our leaders might wake up and recognize that theObama Doctrineof foreign policy is an abysmal failure and must be abandoned once and for all. Tragically, this lesson comes, yet again, at tremendous cost: widescale human misery and heightened threats to U. S. interests. As westudy what’s happened, let’s first dispense with the canards: that this fiasco was inevitable and that it’s all former PresidentDonald Trump’s fault. The reality is that, during Trump’s tenure and despite the Afghan government’s many imperfections, Afghanistan had made greatstrides. The government controlled most of the country’s territory. There was real economic growth. Women could work. Children could go toschool. Further, the cost of fostering regionalstability by maintaining astable Afghanistan was well within reason. The U. S. wasspending less in Afghanistan in a year than we used tospend in a week. American forces were training and advising Afghan forces. Our troops were not fighting wars and taking causalities. This was clearlysustainable. And how, in heaven’s name, is Trump to blame for Biden’s disastrous decision to cut and run? Trump was negotiating with the Taliban, but there was nothing wrong with that. The negotiations were conditions-based, and Trump made clear the Taliban would be held accountable for its actions. Moreover, Trump’s team madesure that if, in the end, the Taliban proved untrustworthy, the remaining U. S. force had beensized andscoped to present aserious deterrent to the Taliban and besufficient to protect U. S. interests. Trump, in fact, handed Biden a problem mostlysolved. All Biden had to do was negotiate a lastingsettlement from a position ofstrength or maintain an economy of force presence in Afghanistan if the Taliban failed to deliver. Instead, Biden just decided to call it a day and call the troops home regardless of what the Taliban did on the ground. The Taliban’s offensiveshouldsurprise no one, given the conditions handed to it. Why would it not take advantage ofBiden’s abandonment of Afghanistan? It knew full well the odds that this president would try tostop its orgy of murder, rape, forced marriages, and mayhem was near zero. Of course, Biden will blame Trump. He will blame theTaliban. He can make all the excuses andspin all the narratives he wants, but a narrative can’tstop a bullet. This is a disaster. Thesituation did not collapse until he withdrew troops—and it is impossible not to conclude this happened because of what he decided. Here is the bigger problem. This was not a one-off decision. This is part of a pattern of Obama-Biden foreign policy. And thatshouldsurprise no onesince the current policies are being managed by much thesame people. In Iraq, afterspending much time and effortstabilizing the country, former President Barack Obama precipitously withdrew U. S. troops. It was like ordering firefighters who had extinguished a wildfire to notstick around after the wildfire in case the blaze rekindles. ISIS mushroomed overnight, creating the largest and most powerful terroriststate in modern history. In Libya, Obama insisted on leading from behind. And once Muammar Gaddafi was gone from the picture, he ignored thespiraling decline in thesecuritysituation until our diplomatic facilities in Benghazi weresmoking ruins. This is the Obama-Biden playbook. Disengage in dangeroussituations, and hope everything doesn’t go to hell in a handbasket. And when those fond hopes don’t pan out? Time to make excuses;shift blame; do anything but deal with the problem—unless there is absolutely no alternative. In the face of America’s enemies, the default position of Obama-Biden foreign policy default is accommodation and appeasement. Unfortunately, the bad guys are notstupid. They had eight years tostudy the Obama playbook, and they know what to do with it: exploit the deliberateself-weakening. Biden is carrying on exactly thesame foreign policy. Caving to Russia onNord Stream 2. Refusing to confront China on the origins of COVID-19. Pleading with Tehran to let the U. S. back in theIran nuclear deal.

One feature of the new rules, restrictions and conditions is that future oil and gas well pads in unincorporated parts of Boulder County will generally have to beset back at least 2,500 feet from any residential dwelling,school or licensed child care facility. Thatsetback requirement also now generally applies to the distances well pads must be distanced from work places in light industrial, general industrial, commercial, business and transitional zoning districts, under the new regulations. Well padsetbacks also will be required from public recreational trails and trail heads owned by the county or any city or town in the county. Boulder County’s updated rules include expanded requirements that oil and gas operators provide financial assurances to cover the cost and risk of their operations and requirestronger notice to, and intervention opportunities for, county residents who would be affected by proposed f rackingsites. Boulder County’ssetbackstandards now exceed a 2,000-footsetbackstandard between new wells andschools and homes under a rule the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, thestate’s oil and gas regulatory agency, had adopted in November. Local governments, including municipalities and counties, can impose evenstrictersetback requirements,state and local officials havesaid. However, representatives of two oil and gas industry organizations — the American Petroleum Institute Colorado and the Colorado Oil and Gas Association — have criticized the new Boulder County regulations and warned against using them to prohibit future oil and gas development in the county. County officials did not adopt a ban, but theysaid they were closely monitoring a lawsuit that could affect local governments’ future ability to impose prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing. On Dec. 18, Longmont received notice that a pair of environmental groups — Our Health, Our Future, Our Longmont as well as Food & Water Watch — is appealing a Boulder District Court judge’s November ruling against reinstating Longmont’s ban on hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas deposits within in the city limits, a measure that Longmont voters approved in 2012 and the Colorado Supreme Courtstruck down in 2016.

Biden, Jr.1600 Pennsylvania AvenueWashington DC, 20500Dear Mr. President,As you doubtlessly know, asignificant majority (at least 75%) of white and Hispanic Evangelicals did not vote for you. However, Mr. President, please allow me to congratulate you on behalf of millions of Evangelicals on having been elected toserve in the highest political office in the land. And, make no mistake, we accept you aspresident. You will not hear from us the dangerous nonsense, “He will never beourpresident.”As you doubtlessly know, the Bible exhorts us to pray for “kings and all who are in authority” (1 Tim. 2:1-2). I was raised in a devout Christian home where I was taught, as most Evangelicals are at an early age, to pray for the president every day, regardless of his or her political affiliation. In fact, in my family, my mother was a Republican, and my father was a Democrat. They were both Baptist Evangelicals. I can remember praying for every president every daysince I was a young boy praying for President Eisenhower. Since then, I have prayed for every president every day, regardless of whether I voted for them or not. I can assure you that the vast majority of American Evangelicals will pray for you every day. We covenant with you to pray that our Father God will grant you godly wisdom and the mind of our Lord Jesus Christ in all your decision-making. We pray with the faith and confidence that “the king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turn eth it withersoever he will” (Proverbs 21:1). We will also importune our Heavenly Father to bless you withsafety, health, and allspiritual blessings. On issues that involve moral and ethical values, we will both pray for you and exhort you to apply timeless biblical principles and values as you make policy decisions that will impact the families in America and the world. I can assure you that as you put the prestige and the “bully-pulpit” of the presidency behind the defense of First Amendment freespeech, freedom of conscience and religion, human rights, and voicesupport for persecuted groups like the Uyghurs around the world, you will have the whole-hearted and full-throatedsupport of the Evangelical community. Evangelicals are also overwhelmingly committed to thesacredness of all human life, from conception to natural death, and everywhere in between. We urge you to extend the legal protections of the law to all of our citizens, pre-born and born. Therefore, we earnestly plead with you to prayerfully reconsider yourstated positions on abortion on demand. No one, not even a mother,should have the absolute right of life and death over another human being, even their child. Mr. President, we will pray for you,support you when we can doso without violating our consciences, and we are united in the rejection of violence and in our commitment to peaceful redress of grievance and nonviolent protest. America needs moral conviction in our highest office. America’s children need a model of leadership committed both to excellence and to virtue.

Then it gets blamed on me for not catching it (Dan Sullivan is a very interesting politician who I know is from Alaska because I read about him a lot). AK is thestate abbreviation for Alaska, and AR is thestate abbreviation for Arkansas, and this can happen when abbreviations look alike and you’re in a hurry. Anti-Asian crimes. The Tuesday nightshootingspree at three Atlanta-areaspas in which eight people were killed, includingsix Asian women, has called into focus a largerstory of anti-Asian hate crimes across the country. In the case of the Atlanta, Georgia,shootings, police have not identified a key motive. The man arrested for the crimes, Robert Long,said he was acting out of an attempt to eliminate his “temptation” tied to “sexual addiction,” according to police. Investigators have not ruled out racial animus as a motivating factor, but Long denied that was his motivation while in custody. He was a frequent customer at the massage parlors and carried out the attacks “as a form of vengeance,” according to The New York Times. All but one of the victims were women. However, theshootings come at a time when news reports across the country are calling out increases in anti-Asian harassment and violence. In are port released before theshootings last week, Stop AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islander) Hatesaid they had received 3,795 reports of incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes between March of 2020 and February of 2021. From the report:The Associated Press reported asimilar up tick in crime:There have beenseveral other high-profilestories about anti-Asian crimes: An 84-year-old man died of his injuries after an attack in San Francisco, a 67-year-old man was attacked there around thesame time, a family and their children we restabbed in Texasshortly after the pandemic began, and videos of elderly Asian-Americansbeing attacked in cities like New York have made the rounds onsocial media. Many of these crimes have been tied to animosity toward Asians because of coronavirus (which researchers believe originated in China) or general anti-Asiansentiment. Today, we’re going to take a look atsome of the writing in response to these newsstories. The right has argued that we are witnessing a general rise in crime, that there are reasonable questions about the role whitesupremacy has played in these crimes, and that a lack of policing is part of the issue. In The National Review, Jim Geraghty noted the difficulty of parsing the data, especially considering that groups like Stop AAPI Hate rely onself-reported data and have no historical “control” point to compare to,since they popped up at the beginning of the pandemic.“It is also worth noting that a report that generated the frightening headline, ‘Hate Crimes Targeting Asian Americans Spiked by 150% in Major US Cities’showed wildly different circumstances in different cities,” he wrote. “The report identified 122 incidents of anti-Asian-American hate crimes in 16 of the country’s most populous cities in 2020… In Cincinnati, the number of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans increased from zero in 2019 to one in 2020, and San Diego had thesame figures. Chicagostayed level with two each year. Denver and Houston increased from zero to three. Washington, D. C., declined fromsix to three.“Every crime is worthy of investigation and prosecution, and even one case ofsomeone being targeted for a crime because of their race, religion, or heritage is one too many,” he added. “But in thissituation, it appears that the existingspottystatistics are beingshoehorned into place tosupport a narrative of a worsening crisis. The headline ‘Hate Crimes Targeting Asian Americans Spike in a Few US Cities, Rare in Others’ wouldn’t attract quiteso much attention,” hesaid. In the Washington Examiner, Tiana Lowe de constructed the narrative that the crimes were tied to whitesupremacy or Donald Trump’s anti-China rhetoric.“Even if the assailant was motivated by his desire to eradicate ‘temptation,’such asexualization of Asian-owned businesses constitutes its ownsort of racism,”she wrote. “But even more concerning than the public and the media's rush to judgment over this attack is their willingness not just to ignore rampant discrimination against Asian Americans in education and attacks in thestreet but to whitewash this oppression… Why? Because thesource of thesurge in hate crimes isn't whitesupremacy. Not only are many prominentsuspects black, but the culprit is actually the verysort of under policing the Left has been advocating for the past year.“Of the 122 anti-Asian American hate crimes documented in our 16 most populous cities last year, more than 72% were in justsix cities, and 23% were just in New York. What was going on in New York City and Los Angeles that wasn't going on in San Diego or Cincinnati (just one anti-Asian American hate crime apiece)?”she asked. “Furthermore, prominentserial assailants,such as Yahya Muslim, who allegedly attacked three Asian Americans in one day, and Antoine Watson, accused of killing an Asian man in broad daylight, are black. That hasn'tstopped cable news hacks like Kurt Bardella from claiming on MSNBC without evidence that the recentsurge in violence is motivated by whitesupremacy.”The leftsays anti-Asiansentimentstoked by American nationalism and whitesupremacy needs to be addressed. In The Washington Post, Alafair Burke asked“who will march for us?”“The numbers don’t capture the ugliness of these attacks,”shesaid. “‘Go home,’ a man yelled while throwing a glass bottle at a woman placing her baby in a carseat, appending a racialslur to the insult. Another man kicked a dog andspat on its owner,saying, ‘Take your disease that’s ruining our country and go home.’ Scores of Asian American elders have beensenselessly assaulted by randomstrangers on thestreet… Racism against Asian Americans often goes unrecognized and unchallenged because ofstereotypes that depict Asian Americans as people who don’t need protection from abuse — or who don’t deserve it.“And xenophobia and misogyny often intersect,”she added. “Less than a day after the appallingshootings in Atlanta, Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynoldssaid thesuspect cited ‘sexual addiction’ as his motivation andsaw thespas he targeted as ‘a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.’ With every casual ‘me love you long time’ or ‘happy ending’ joke, our culture hypersexualizes and dehumanizes Asian American women, portraying us as victims while treating us as targets.”In Mother Jones, Inae Ohexpressed frustration over the hesitancy to call theshooting an act of racism.“One can be cautious about what caused a man to kill people whilestill acknowledging that watching people who look like you die for no reason looks exactly like what it is,”she wrote. “But law enforcement officials made aspecific choice in ignoring that and echoing the words of a killer. And theirstress for caution before labeling Tuesday’s murders as racially motivated—while fore grounding the potentialsexual nature of the investigation—runs the risk of falsely treating misogyny and racism as if they’re mutually exclusive, when in fact, overwhelming evidence hasshown that the two toxic forces are often interwoven.“The fact that Asian women make up70 percent of the recent rise in anti-Asian attacks is further proof of the parallel traumas,”she added. “In the case of Asiansex workers, there’s really noseparating the inherent racism rooted in a white man’s assertion that ‘sexual addiction’ prompted him to commit violence.”Before we get into thespecifics of this case, I want to briefly do what you’re notsupposed to do in thesesituations and center myself. I remember vividly when I heard about the Pittsburgh Tree of Lifesynagogueshootings. It was gutting for a lot of reasons: I’m a Jew. Pittsburgh — the city where I went to college — is a place I love. I had been inside thatsynagogue before. And, worst of all, as Isent frantic text messages and em ails to check in on friends and members of the Jewish community, I learned that a family member of one of those friends had been killed in theshooting. You don’t have to identify with a minority group to understand the way that kind of moment works psychologically. If you’re a cookie-cutter white guy in Americansuburbia, it’d be asimilar feeling to hearing that a massshooting happened inside your favorite restaurant, at which you had dined just the night before. You feelsick,scared, lucky, ashamed you feel lucky and can’t help but re-run every moment around the attack in your head. It’s the kind of thing thatstops you in your tracks. Isay all this as a preface to address my Asian readers living through this week: I just want tosay I am thinking of you. I’msending my love. And I’msorry this is the world we have today. There’s much westill don’t know about these attacks and more we will learn. Sometimes, as in the case of the Pulse nightclubshooting, our initial understanding of these events is woefully inaccurate and ends up being totally wrong(theshooter, in that case, was believed by the public to be targeting the LGBT community, though further investigations did little tosupport that narrative). Other times, as in the case of the Charleston churchshooting, our initial understanding fallsshort of the horrifying reality of the motivations behind what happened (theshooter, in that case, was believed by the public to be randomly targeting Black parishioners, but investigations revealed he was literally trying tostart a race war). On oneside people arescreaming that this attack is rooted in whitesupremacy, thesexualization of Asian women, the belittling of the Asian experience, and the demonization of countries like China (i.e. Trump calling coronavirus the “China virus” or “Kung flu” or writers like me being extremely critical of the Chinese Communist Party). My response to thatside is: yes, you are probably right. On the otherside, people arescreaming that this attack is the product of police not having the presence they need to have in these neighborhoods, that we knowsome of the perpetrators in high-profile cases have been Black, that we don’t yet understand the Atlantashooter’s motives, and that given the data available we don’t have a great grasp of this purported “wave” of anti-Asian hate crimes. My response to thatside is: yes, you are probably also right. This isn’t bothsideism, it’s reality. It’s not assimple as whitesupremacy and it’s not assimple as crime in under-policed neighborhoods. The anti-Asiansentiment in our country (much like anti-Semitism, actually) can come from across the political and racialspectrum for a variety of reasons. If you want to get really nuanced, you can throw instudiesshowing Christian nationalism (which exists amongst white and Black Americans) is the greatest predictor of xenophobic, anti-Asian feelings tied to coronavirus. All this is without even touching on the fact that theshooter reportedly purchased the gun he used legally, thesame day, with no waiting period, then committed exactly the kind of crime waiting periods aresupposed to prevent. For now, it’s okay to look at all these things andsee them all as factors — with various weights and importance — that need to be considered. Because they all are. Regardless of which narrative is most “true,” the reality is Asians in our country are going to have tospend the next few weeks digesting horrifying news reports, unsettlingstudies and traumatic videos telling them that their fellow citizens hate them. The least the rest of us can do is try to balance that byshowing them love, camaraderie and understanding. In the meantime, if you’re looking for a piece that embraces the nuance of this moment, I’d highly recommendJay Caspian Kang’s writing in The New York Times Magazine. So far, we’re crushing it. According to Bloomberg, we’ve administered (which means injected) 113 million doses. Globally, the total is just over 400 million, meaning we make up more than a quarter of the global total. America makes up about 4.25% of the world’s population, but we’ve administered about 30% of the vaccines. In total, 73.7 million people in America have already gotten one dose of the vaccine. On a per-capita basis, we’re doingsimilarly well. Israel has given out 105 doses per 100 people, leading the way across the planet (the number of doses exceeds the number of people because most vaccines administeredso far require twoshots). The New York Times just did a greatpodcastabout the vaccine rollout in Israel. Seychelles, the United Arab Emirates, Maldives, Monaco, the United Kingdom (Wales, England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), Bahrain and Chile all have administered more per capita doses than we have — the U. S. comes in at eighth with 34 doses per 100 people. We’re alsoseventh in the per capita rate of people who have gotten at least one dose. Of thoseseven countries, we’re by far the largest and most populous. Our daily rate of doses administered is 2.4 million. The next closest in raw numbers is India, with 1.5 million. Then the European Union at 1.2 million. Compared to the EU, which has given at least one dose to 8.2% of the population, our 22% rate looks extremely impressive. All in all, the vaccine rollout in the U. S. right now — even if it feelsslow and chaotic to many of us — has been a resoundingsuccess compared to the rest of the world. President Joe Biden is planning the first major federal tax hikesince 1993 to help pay for his long-term economic plan — one that includes a major infrastructure bill and climate change reforms. The plan will include asuite of tax hikes focused on corporations and the rich, including, according to Bloomberg, proposals containing the following goals:The plan could be Biden’s first real test to keep his thin Democratic majorities together, but a tax increase has been deemed necessary in order to pay for his proposals.

145,France's Sarkozy faces jail term in campaign financing trial,0.0,47.0,https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20210622/news/306229971/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-herald-chicago-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-22,17,"PARIS (AP) - The trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy concludes Tuesday in Paris, after a month during which the courtsought to determine whether he broke laws on campaign financing in his unsuccessful 2012 re-election bid. The verdict is expected to be rendered at a later date. Prosecutors have requested asix-month prison term, as well as asix-monthsuspendedsentence and a fine of 3,750 euros ($4,468). Sarkozy, France's president from 2007 to 2012, denies wrongdoing. He is accused of havingspent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros ($27.5 million) on the re-election bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande. The trial comes after Sarkozy, 66, was found guilty on March 1 of corruption and influence peddling in another case. He has appealed that verdict. In their conclusions last week, prosecutorssaid Sarkozy knew weeks before the 2012 election that his campaign financing -strictly limited under French law - was getting close to the legal maximum. They accused him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning against racking up additional expenses. Instead, he gave instructions that led to more money beingspent and did not put in place asupervisionsystem, prosecutorssaid.'œSarkozy is thesignatory and the only person responsible for his campaign financing. He is responsible for monitoring expenses, which he did not do,'ť prosecutor Vanessa Perreesaid. Heshowed 'œhis intention to exceed (the limit) by continuing to hold his rallies,'ťshe added. Prosecutorssaid on March 10, 2012, eight weeks before the presidential election runoff, the campaign's budget was already above the legal limit. The next day, Sarkozy held a giant rally at Villepinte, north of Paris, which alone cost 6 million euros. Closer to election day, Sarkozy held almost one rally per day, including two major ones in Paris at a cost ofseveral millions of euros. During his one-day appearance at the Paris court last week, Sarkozy vehemently denied wrongdoing. Hesaid the extra money did not go to his campaign, but instead helped make other people richer. Hesaid, voice often raised in anger, that he followed the financial recommendations of hisstaff, including cancelling two planned rallies. 'œI don'tsee where I was careless, where I was negligent,'ť hesaid. Hesaid he 'œnever'ť gave any direct instructions toservice providers in charge of the organization, because he had a team to do that.'œWe made mistakes, probably... But was there malicious intent, fraudulent intent? No, no,'ť hesaid. In addition to the former president, 13 other people are on trial, including members of his conservative Republicans party, accountants and heads of the communication group in charge of organizing the rallies, named Bygmalion. They face charges including forgery, breach of trust, fraud and complicity in illegal campaign financing. Some have already admitted wrongdoing and detailed thesystem of false invoices that was meant to cover up the overspending. Prosecutors requested mostlysuspended prisonsentences, and up to one year in prison for the Bygmalion co-funder. The defendants 'œdisagree on everything. The declarations are not credible, possibly they are lies,'ť Perreesaid. Sarkozy retired from active politics in 2017, but isstill playing a role behind thescenes within his party, The Republicans. French media have reported that he may end upsupporting centrist President Emmanuel Macron, through an alliance with figures on the traditional right, in next year's presidential election.",2,2,Daily Herald-Chicago

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey arescheduled to testify remotely. (Photo by Hannah McKay-Pool/Getty Images)Trump’ssecond impeachment was the most bipartisan one in U. S. history, but the Senate requires a two-thirdssuper majority to convict. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.),saidWednesday he has “not made a final decision” on how he will vote, after multiple reports emerged that he privately hassaid he favored impeachment. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), whotoldthelast weekshe wants Trump to resign,saidThursdayshe thought the House acted “appropriately” with impeachment, addingshe would “listen carefully” during the trial, without indicating howshe planned to vote. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who previouslysaid he believed Trump committed impeachable offenses and urged him to resign,stood byth atstatement on Wednesday, adding he thought it “debatable” as to “whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office.”In astatement Wednesday, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.)said it was “obvious” Trump “was derelict in his duty to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law” during the U. S. Capitolsiege, without indicating which way he would vote. A Republican more loyal to Trump, Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, did notshut down the possibility of voting to convict the president in astatement after the House’s impeachment vote,saying he would “thoroughly examine the arguments and evidence presented.”Before the House voted Wednesday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio)saidhe will do his “duty as a juror and listen to the cases presented by bothsides” during the upcoming trial, leaving the door open he could vote to convict Trump. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S. C.) predicted ""there's a good chance” Trump will be convicted by the Senate. He latersaid he didn’t believe enough GOPsenators were on board to convict Trump at this time.17. That’s how many Republicans will need to vote to convict Trump for the effort to besuccessful,so long as all Democrats are on board. Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, who was the lone GOPsenator to vote to convict Trump during the first impeachment trial and Susan Collins of Maine areseen as other moderate Republicans who could vote to convict Trump. Murkowskitoldthelast weekshe wants Trump to resign. “I want him out,” the Alaskasenatorsaid. “He has caused enough damage.”Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Lindsey Graham (R- S. C.), two loyal allies of the president,said they opposed impeachment on Wednesday. “The Founders designed the impeachment process as a way to remove officeholders from public office—not an inquest against private citizens,” Cottonsaid in astatement. Graham called Trump'ssecond impeachment “rushed” and claimed it would “do great damage.”Trump was charged with “incitement of insurrection” by the House on Wednesday after lawmakers roundly criticized the president for fomenting a riot that breached the Capitol. McConnellsaid Wednesday he will not bring the Senate back early, meaning the earliest the upper chamber can begin a trial is January 19, one day before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. With just days left in Trump’s presidency, it’s extremely likely he willserve out the rest of his term. However, if the upper chamber votes to convict Trump after he leaves office, the Democratic-controlled Senate could then hold aseparate vote to disqualify him from office. Past precedentstates that asimple majority is required to disqualify an official from office after they have been convicted by the Senate. Trump has hinted repeatedly he will run for president again in 2024.

Tuesday’s accord, days before Congress prepares to return fromsummer recess,shows that neither President Donald Trump nor Republican or Democratic lawmakerssee a political advantage in risking a partialshutdown just ahead of the elections. The agreement on a “clean”stopgap may beshorthand for avoiding “poison pills” or other controversial provisions that could hampersuch a measure’s enactment. Nevertheless, the door is open to potentially dozens of tweaks tospending provisions and temporary extensions of expiring programs, which often ride on astopgap, Republican and Democratic aides familiar with the processsaid. The White House requested three dozen adjustments or “anomalies” to current fiscal 2020spending laws that would be extended into the next fiscal year in astopgap, and another 51 extensions of, or legislative tweaks to, federal programsset to expire before the end of the year. The House and Senate Appropriations committees have compiled their own lists of adjustments after conversations with agency officials. One looming question is thestopgap’s length,something Mnuchin and Pelosi, D-Calif., did not discuss, aides familiar with their phone conversation Tuesdaysaid. The White House and GOP lawmakers prefer a continuing resolution into December, giving the current Congress and president leverage to negotiate the final fiscal 2021spending bills before a new Congress convenes in January. It is unclear where Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N. Y., will come down on this. Some Democratsspeculate Pelosi may prefer astopgap that extends into next year, when Democrats hope they will take control of the Senate and the White House in addition to holding the House. The agreement to negotiate a cleanstopgap was a brightspot Tuesday in a reportedly otherwise dispiriting Mnuchin-Pelosi phone call over theshape of a new COVID-19 relief bill. In a press release following the conversation, Pelosisaid the call “made clear that Democrats and the White House continue to haveserious differences understanding the gravity of thesituation that America’s working families are facing.”During a hearing before a House Oversight and Reformsubcommittee on thesame day, Mnuchinsaid Schumer and Pelosi “do not want tosit down at the negotiating table unless we publicly agree on a topline.”“My own opinion,” Mnuchinsaid, “is weshould go piece by piece, and any area of the legislation we can agree on weshould have the House and Senate pass.”Pelosi hassaid Democrats would be willing to go down to a bill costing $2.2 trillion, while White House officials have talked about going up to $1.3 trillion.",2,2,Roll Call
148,Anti-Abortion Activist Abby Johnson Had Quite the Adventure at the Capitol Riot,-14.33,35.0,https://jezebel.com/anti-abortion-activist-abby-johnson-had-quite-the-adven-1846043253,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,15,"It appears Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion zealot and America’s most famous former Planned Parenthood employee, was on the Capitolsteps during last week’sstorming of the Hill. In aseries of edited and then deleted Facebook posts as well as a handful ofstill-available tweets from January 6, the motivationalspeaker and birth controlskeptic conveys the wholespectrum of human emotion during an attempted coup, from “grinning with the president” to “antifa almost pushed me down the Capitolsteps” and “I have pepperspray in my lungs.”Johnson is perhaps best known as the author of the disputed memoir that would become, a movie about a woman who is forced to kill babies at an ever-increasing clip tosatisfy abortion providers’ desire to become filthy rich. Since thesuccess of her media endeavors,she has launched a podcast, a conference, and an organization that encourages abortion providers and Planned Parenthood employees to quit their jobs. On January 6,she apparently attended the president’s rally, whereshe took a grinningself ie and lauded “the most pro life president in our country.” From there things getsomewhat hazier, though a few Twitter users have made a fairly convincing case that news footage from near the Capitolstepsshows Johnson milling around in the crowd. After the group broke into the Capitol, Johnson posted two missives on Facebook, one of which has been taken down but isstill available via Google cache. In thestill-public post, Johnson writes thatshe is in D. C. and was “with the president earlier” but issafe despite having “got a little bit of pepperspray in my lungs,” notingshe was “only mildly in the fray” earlier. The deleted post tells asomewhat more intimate—and widely debunked—story in which anti fa agitators dressed up as Trumpsupporters tostorm the Capitol, fight the elderly, and nearly push Johnson off the Capitolsteps:I’msafe andsound back in my hotel. Let me justspeak to a few things about today. First, from my observation, over 99% of the hundreds of thousands of people in attendance today at the Capitol were true patriots who came tosupport this country, our president and election integrity. They were peaceful, law abiding citizens. They were not there to vandalize anything or to cause a disturbance. We now know thatsome of the people who led the group that “stormed the Capitol” were actually with Antifa. There are multiple pictures of thesesame people at BLM protests and on Antifa websites. It’s unfortunate that the media has portrayed a peaceful event assomething that it wasn’t...but that’s honestly notsurprising. I’m notsaying that there weren’t crazies at this event. Of course there were. Just like there are crazy anti-abortionists who bomb clinics. Just like there are women who use abortion as birth control and have 15 abortions. There is “fringe” in every movement. And fringe is usually birthed out of frustration. Some of us turn our frustration intosomething constructive...andsome people resort to unproductive behaviors. Let me be clear with all of you. I KNOW Antifa was there because I was almost knocked down thestairs of the Capitol when a fight broke out betweensome Trumpsupporters andsome Antifa activists. It was discovered thatsome of the people in the crowd were actually with Antifa, but were posing as Trumpsupporters. One of them had gotten physically violent with an elderly woman and had knocked her down thesteps. A fight broke out and those men were physically removed by a group of Trumpsupporters. Isaw it with my own eyes. I know they were there. And I know these Antifa activists were inside the Capitol because it was clear they had been gassed. (Their faces were puffy and red). Were theresome fringe Trumpers who got pulled into the mix out ofsheer frustration? Absolutely. But that was not 99% of the crowd. And that is not who we are. We are not the party that vandalizes and burns down buildings and hurts people. We are about law and order. That is EXACTLY why we are here...because we believe in following the law. We believe in democracy. Please pray for our nation. Jezebel wishes Johnson aspeedy recovery from both the pepperspray and the cognitive dissonance. Currently, the activist’sposition appears to be that “crazy people who bust into the Capitol do not represent conservatives”—and also, apparently, that Twitter’s purge of toxic accounts is a false flag operation to distract from “election integrity.”",1,0,Jezebel

150,What Should We Call the Sixth of January?,-6.67,39.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-we-call-the-sixth-of-january,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"“Big protest in D. C. on January 6th,”Donald Trumptweeted before Christmas. “Be there, will be wild!” On New Year’s Day, he tweeted again: “The BIG Protest Rally in Washington, D. C. will take place at 11:00 A. M. on January 6th.” On January 5th: “I will bespeaking at the SAVE AMERICA RALLY tomorrow on the Ellipse at 11AM Eastern. Arrive early—doors open at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS!” The posters called it the “Save America March.” What happened that day was big, and it was wild. If it began as a protest and a rally and a march, it ended assomething altogether different. But what? Sedition, treason, a failed revolution, an attempted coup? And what will it be called, looking back? A day of anarchy? The end of America?Trump called the people who violently attacked and brieflyseized the U. S. Capitol building in order to overturn a Presidential election “patriots”; President-electJoe Bidencalled them “terrorists.” In asection of “Leviathan” called “Inconstant Names,” Thomas Hobbes, in 1651, remarked that the names of things are variable, “For one man callet h Wisdome, what another callet h Feare; and one Cruelty, what another Justice.” On the other hand,sometimes one man is right (those peopleterrorists). And,sometimes, what to call a thingseems plain. “This is what the President has caused today, this insurrection,” Mitt Romney, fleeing the Senate chamber, told aTimesreporter. By any reasonable definition of the word (including the Oxford English Dictionary’s: “The action of rising in arms or open resistance against established authority”), what happened on January 6th was an insurrection. An insurrection is, generally, damnable: calling a political action an insurrection is a way of denouncing what its participants mean to be a revolution. “There hath been in Romestrange insurrections,” Shakespeare wrote, in “Coriolanus.” “The people against thesenators, patricians, and nobles.” Insurrection, in Shakespeare, is “foul,” “base and bloody.” In the United States, the language of insurrection has a vexed racial history. “Insurrection” was the term favored byslave owners for the political actions taken by people held in human bondageseeking their freedom. Thomas Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, charged the king with having “excited domestic insurrections amongst us.” The English lexicographer Samuel Johnson, an opponent ofslavery, once offered a toast “To the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies.” And Benjamin Franklin, wryly objecting to Southern politicians’ conception of human beings as animals, offered this rule to tell the difference between them: “sheep will never make any insurrections.”The term’s racial inflection lasted well beyond the end ofslavery. In the nineteen-sixties, law-and-order Republicans used that language to demean civil-rights protests, to describe a political movement as rampant criminality. “We haveseen the gathering hate, we have heard the threats to burn and bomb and destroy,” Richard Nixonsaid, in 1968. “In Watts and Harlem and Detroit and Newark, we have had a foretaste of what the organizations of insurrection are planning for thesummer ahead.” In that era, though, “riot” replaced “insurrection” as the go-to racial code word: “riots” were Black, “protests” were white, as Elizabeth Hinton argues in an essential, forthcoming book, “America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s.” “Yet historically,” Hinton observes, “most instances of mass criminality have been perpetrated by white vigilantes hostile to integration and who joined together into roving mobs that took ‘justice’ in their own hands.” This remains an apt description of what happened on January 6th. One possibility, then, is to call the Sixth of January a “race riot.” Its participants were overwhelmingly white; many were avowedly whitesupremacists. A lot of journalists described the attack on the legislature as a “storming” of the Capitol, language that white-supremacist groups must have found thrilling. Hitler’s paramilitary called itself the, the Storm detachment; Nazis published a newspaper calledDer Stürmer, thestormer. QAnon awaits a “Storm” in which thesatanic cabal that controls the United States will be finally defeated. So one good idea would be never, ever to call the Sixth of January “the Storming of the Capitol.”What words will historians use in textbooks? Any formulation is a non-starter if it diminishes the culpability of people in positions of power who perpetrated the lie that the election wasstolen. It’s not a coup d’etat because it didn’tsucceed. It’s not even a failed coup, because a coup involves the military. And, as Naunihal Singh, the author of “Seizing Power: The Strategic Logic of Military Coups,”told, the word “coup” lets too many people off the hook. “The people who you want to point fingers at are the president, the party leaders, and thestreet thugs,” Singhsaid. “And we lose that if westart talking about a coup; it gives a pass to all of the Republican politicians who have been endorsing what Trump’ssaying.”In truth, the language of the coopseems more appropriate than the language of the coup. I mean chickens. “Coming home to roost” quite aptly describes the arrival of armed terrorists in the hall where, moments before, Senator Ted Cruz hadsummoned that very flock as hestood on the floor and urged the legislature to overturn the election. Derrick Evans, the West Virginia Republican lawmaker who joined the mob and, as he breached the doors of the Capitol, cried out, “We’re in! We’re in!” acted with more honesty and consistency than the hundred and forty-seven members of the House and Senate who, later that night, voted to overturn the results of the election after having hidden, for hours, from the very people they’d been inciting for months and even years.“Sedition” is too weak. Noah Webster, in his American Dictionary of the English Language, from 1828, offered this handy way to distinguish “sedition” from “insurrection”: “sedition expresses a less extensive rising of citizens.” In any case,sedition in thesense of a political rebellion, is obsolete. “Treason,” an attempt to overthrow the government,seems fair, though it almost risks elevating what looked to be ashambles: ashabby, clownish, idiotic, and aimless act of mass vandalism. If I were picking the words, I’d want tosteer very clear of ennobling it,so I’d be inclined to call itsomething blandly descriptive, like “The Attack on the U. S. Capitol,” or “The Sixth of January.”“Remember this day forever!” Trump tweeted at one minute pastsix on Wednesday night. There’s no danger that anyone will forget it, by whatever name. The harder question is not what to call the events of that day, but what to make of the maddening four years and more that led up to it: the long,slow rot of the Republican Party; the perfidy of Republicans in the House and Senatesince January, 2017; the wantonness of a conservative media willing to incite violence; the fecklessness of Twitter and Facebook; and, not least, the venality, criminality, and derangement of the President. Whether thatstory belongs under a chapter titled “The Rise and Fall of Donald J. Trump” or “The End of America” awaits the outcome of events.",1,1,The New Yorker
151,Kamala Harris is a complicated choice for LGBTQ+ people,-10.0,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/08/kamala-harris-complicated-lgbtq-choice/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"Whenshe was San Francisco district attorney, Kamala Harrisspent Valentine’s Day of 2004officiatingsame-sex marriages. Just two days earlier,Gavin Newsom, then the city’s mayor, had asked city hall clerks tostart issuing licenses tosame-sex couples. Thestate’s Supreme Courtordered San Francisco toshut down the weddingsand nullified the marriages of 4,000 queer people the following month. The Supreme Court wouldn’tsettle California’s war over marriage equality until 2013. By then, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had already come out insupport of equal marriage. The 19th thanks oursponsors. Become one. Many queer voters have historically viewed 2012, when Obama publiclystated hissupport for marriage equality, as a turning point. Supporting marriage equality has been used to gauge a candidate’s true commitment to LGBTQ+ rights: Candidates who came out in favor of the issue before 2012 largely passed the test; candidates who backed equal marriage after just did it for political points. For Kamala Harris, that has left a lot of room for bragging rights. In a field thatstarted with roughly two dozen major contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket, Harrisstood out as the candidate who could boast the earliest explicit on-recordsupport for marriage equality (yes, Bernie Sanders backed LGBTQ+ rights in the1970s; but he did not come out for marriage equality until2009,favoring civil unionsfirst). In 2008, when California’s Supreme Court overturned thestate’s LGBTQ+ marriage ban, Harris again officiated queer weddings. She helped create “anLGBTQ hate crimes unit” while district attorney of San Francisco. Whenshe was California’s attorney general,she battled the “panic defense,” a legalstrategy in which a person claims that anti-LGBTQ+ violence or murder is justified because the victim madesexual advances toward the perpetrator. In 2011,she backed marriage equality by petitioning to the 9th U. S. Circuit Court of Appealsto repeal Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that bannedsame-sex marriage. But a lot has changedsince 2012. A queer electorate that might have held up Harris as its champion eight years ago largely greeted her in 2020 with mixed emotions. At issue is her history as a prosecutor, astring of missteps on trans issues and recentsupport for bills cracking down onsex work. Last February, Chase Strangio, the renowned attorney who fought the watershed Supreme Court employment cases,summed up the feelings up many progressive queer voters in anop-ed for OUT Magazine.“As a prosecutor, Harris’s work has been as an arm of thestate fighting to lock people in cages and defending policies that destroyed lives and communities,” Strangio wrote. “Now attempting to position herself as a criminal legalsystem reformer and an ally to the LGBTQ+ community, Harrisseeks to rewrite her past rather than own it.”Harris has faced harsh criticism becauseshe fought to blockgender-affirming medical care for a trans woman in prison in 2015. In 2019,she told the Washington Bladethat legal briefs in her office were often written without her consultation and that as attorney general,she was obligated to defend thestate.“But the bottom line is the buckstops with me, and I take full responsibility for what my office did,” Harrissaid.“Harris has taken full responsibility for this failing, and reiterated that transition ing inmates are entitled to receive the medical attention they require, need and deserve,” a Human Rights Campaignspokespersonsaid in astatement to The 19th. If that’s howshe feels aboutsex workers’ rights, thenshe has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be hersupporters.”Mychal Concepcion, a 50-year-old transgender man incarcerated at the Central California Women’s Facility and the former board president ofJustice Now, a prison abolition group,said he is “super” excited that Biden chose Harris as his running mate.“She has her own views and is notshy onspeaking out,” Concepcion wrote in an email to The 19th. “I believe it will push Biden to be more progressive. He is part of an older generation. He is tied to white male privilege that was/is abusive. She will be the check and balance to that!”LGBTQ+ advocates have repeatedly questioned Harris’ grasp of transgender issues. Harris backed FOSTA/SESTA, a 2018 package of bills that aimed to curbsex trafficking byshutting downsites used bysex workers like Backpage and Craigslist classifieds. But manysex workers, transgendersex workers especially, decried the measures as deadly, wiping out criticalscreening tools they used to keep themselvessafe. Sex work decriminalization has become increasingly popular among LGBTQ+ rights organizations. A disproportionate number of queer and trans people are engaged insex work, often the result of employment discrimination. According to the2015 U. S. Transgender Survey,transgender people are three times more likely than the general population to be unemployed (at 15 percent). Harris nowsaysshesupports decriminalizingsex work, butin an interview with The Rootsaysshe doesn’t regretsupporting FOSTA/SESTA— thesite Backpage was profiting from ads trafficking children,she claims. Her unwillingness to re-examine the bills has leftsome uneasy about her as a candidate. Courtney Trouble, a non binary transsex worker, hassome of those reservations.“I feel likeshe’s really proud of the work thatshe’s done to get rid of Backpage and create FOSTA,”said Trouble. “And that’ssomething that really needs to be discussed with her, because if that’s howshe feels aboutsex workers’ rights, thenshe has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be hersupporters.”Publicly, LGBTQ+ groups have praised Harris as a longtime champion for equality.“Senator Kamala Harris is nothingshort of an exceptional choice for Vice President,”said Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, in a mediastatement. “Throughout her ground breaking career, Senator Harris has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ community,standing with us when many, evensometimes those within her own party, did not.”Equality organizations, like many voters, feel they can’t afford to do anything but push Biden to a win; the prospect of another four years under President Trump is too terrifying, theysay. LGBTQ+ media organization GLAAD keeps a running tab of the president’s attacks on the community; at last tally the number was 167.“Our community has astark choice this November, four more years of a Trump-Pence administration dedicated to decimating our rights and dehumanizing us, or a new day where we are not only valued and accepted but put on a path to finally achieving the full equality all people deserve,”said a Human Rights Campaignspokesperson in astatement to The 19th. But behind thescenes,some advocatessay they have told the Biden campaign that Harrisstill has work to do ifshe wants LGBTQ+support. Monica Roberts, author of the blogTransGriotand one of the nation’s most prominent Black trans advocates, questions what more Harris can do to prove herself. Harris fielded tough questions from “Pose”star Angelica Ross andsinger/songwriter Shea Diamond. Bothsaid Harris answered those concerns and took accountability for pastshortcomings on trans rights.“I fail to understand whysome of these trans folks act like people can’t evolve and grow,” Robertssaid. “And if you can’t, or you have reasons to just ignore that fact, then your problem with Kamala Harris is racial, not policy.”Biden himself representsa lukewarm option for many young progressive LGBTQ+ voters. Many are no longer captivated by his 2012support for marriage equality, which has been the law of the land for five years now. This year is expected to be the deadliest on record for transgender people, and trans women interrupted this year’s forums demanding that candidates address the epidemic of violence facing their communities. Biden was the last presidential candidate to release an LGBTQ+ platform in March. I fail to understand whysome of these trans folks act like people can’t evolve and grow.”He has had his own gaffes on LGBTQ+ issues. At an LGBTQ+ forum last fall, h equipped that being gay no longer came with thesamestereotypes — “gay bathhouses” and ”round-the-clocksex.”The Biden campaign declined to comment for thisstory. Harris, as a presidential candidate, dropped an LGBTQ+ platform in October 2019. On the menu was the usual fare: a rollback of Trump’s transgender military ban, an end to discrimination under the guise of religion, passage of the Equality Act. It was released on October 10, the morning of the Human Rights Campaign’s LGBTQ+ town hall. Thatsame day, Elizabeth Warren unveiled a much larger12-page platform, and Pete Buttigiegalso dropped a hefty proposal. Few talked about Harris’ LGBTQ+ platform. The Texas Tribune covered Beto O’Rourke’spitch to queer voters last June, and NBC Newsreported on Mike Bloomberg’s LGBTQ+ proposals this January. Harris’ platform got little attention outside of queer media.“Something that differentiates her platform from those of other candidates is a pledge to create a White House position dedicated to LGBTQ rights,” theAdvocate noted. Earlier in the year, at a CNN town hall in April, Harris was recounting her history working in the LGBTQ+ community. She drew attention to her work outlawing “panic defenses.”“You’ll remember the tragic cases involving transgender men who were killed,” Harrissaid. There was just one problem. Transgender murders victims are overwhelmingly transgender women.",2,2,19th News
152,History of Queer Stigma — And How it Affects the Community's Mental Health Today,-16.0,34.33,https://www.theskimm.com/well/history-gay-lgbtq-queer-stigma-mental-health-6twukAmLBZEkbV68GZ7wrr,https://adfontesmedia.com/skimm-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-21,25,"More than one in three LGBTQ+ Americans (including more than three in five transgender Americans)faced discrimination in 2020. And, unsurprisingly, that mistreatment worsened their mental well being. It gets worse. Especially for Black, Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial people. Onestudy found that 43% of non-white respondents reported experiencing discrimination insome form in the past year. That’s compared with 31% of white LGBTQ+ respondents. Across the board, LGBTQ+ people are at an increased risk of mental health challenges (such as depression and anxiety disorders) andsuicide, compared tostraight and cis gender people of thesame age. And a2019survey from the US Department of Health and Human Services found more than 47% of LGB adultssaid they had a mental illness. (Asimilarsurvey of just adult womenshowed that 24.5%said they had one.)Minoritystress, aka when people from historically marginalized groups experience mental health problems because repeated prejudice against them creates a hostilesocial environment,is real. Particularly for transgender older adults, bisexual women, and LGBTQ+ people of color. Astudy of areas with high anti-LGBTQ+ prejudiceshowed thatsocialstigma associated withsexual orientation has asignificant impact on quality and length of life for LGBTQ+ individuals. And the risk of developing or worsening mental health issues has only intensified during the pandemic for this group, because of added job uncertainty, a home environment that might not affirm their identity, andsocial isolation. It wasn’t long ago that being gay was considered a medical disorder and mental illness. The American Psychiatric Associationlisted it as a “sociopathic personality disturbance”in 1952. In 1968, it was recategorized as a form of “sexual deviation.” The classification of homosexuality as a mental illness was finally removed in 1973, but thestigma’s continued. Also relevant: conversion “therapy.” About 20 USstates have laws protecting minors from it, Queen Elizabeth II announced in 2021 that the UK isset to ban it, andCanadaformally took thestep. Yet, an estimated700,000 LGBTQ+ people in America have gone through it. It’s a practice thatseeks to change a person’ssexual orientation or gender identity. And it’s proven to be damaging to mental health. The man who founded one of America’s most well-known conversion therapy programs has even called it a “lie” and admitted it’s “very harmful.”A number of politicians and policies are resisting progress. It wasn’t until the ‘60s and ‘70s thatsomestates began decriminalizingsodomy (including consensual analsex between males). About a dozenstatesstill havesome form of anti-sodomy laws in effect, despite a 2003 Supreme Court decision which declared them unconstitutional. And althoughsame-sex marriage has been legal in all 50statessince 2015, the Vaticansaid last year that the Catholic Churchstill won’t bless it (thoughsome German priests are giving it their blessing). Another example: Wisconsin became the firststate to outlaw discrimination based onsexual orientation in 1982. But it wasn’t until 2020 that theUS Supreme Court ruled workplace discrimination “because of…sex” included an individual’ssexual orientation and gender identity. Even now, a number of new anti-transgender bills are getting attention. In 2021, more than 30states had proposed — andso far at least fivestates have actually passed — laws that limit the ability for young transgender people to receive certain medical treatments or play onsports teams that match their gender identity (see:Florida’s billsigned into law on June 1). And 62% of Americanssurveyedthink that transgender athletesshould only be allowed on the teams that correspond with their birth gender. That’s despite the fact thatstudiesshow that allowing trans women and girls to play on girls' and women's teams doesn’t create an unfair advantage. And the fact that leaving transgender athletes out can causeserious damage to their mental health. Meanwhile, the NCAA has come out insupport of transgender athletes, butCaitlyn Jenner has done the opposite. And although the International Olympic Committee has hadsome trans-inclusive policies for more than a decade, it hasn’t been entirely welcoming to intersex athletes and those with naturally high levels of testosterone who identify as female (see:runner Caster Semenya). But theTokyo Gameshad a record number of LGBTQ+ athletes (including the first transgender athlete). And now the IOC is changing things up a bit, with new guidance for eachsport’s international governing body. Like discouraging unnecessary medical testing to verify an athlete’ssex. And emphasizing that testosterone levels alone can’t predict how an athlete will perform. Theysay the focusshould actually be on whether there’s evidence of a performance advantage. But here’s thestart of a rainbow. The Biden administration has made a number of pro-LGBTQ+ decisions. The gov restored protections for transgender and gay people against health care discrimination,repealed a ban on transgender troops in the military, and extended federal nondiscrimination protections to cover LGBTQ+ people. And the House passed theEquality Actto ban discrimination based onsexual orientation and gender identity. Plus, the first openly transgender US Senate official was confirmed as assistant healthsecretary. Meet:Rachel Levine. It’s true. Especially when LGBTQ+ individualsstill report facing obstacles when trying to access medical care. Nearly three in 10 transgender individuals and 15% of LGBTQ+ Americans overall reported postponing or avoiding medical treatment due to discrimination in 2020. Multiplestates have proposed legislation banning gender-affirming care. Including Arkansas, which became the firststate tosign a law last yearth at prevents doctors from administering hormone treatment to LGBTQ+ minors (that law has been temporarily halted). And in February 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott asked thestate’s Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate its use of gender-affirming care after the Texas AGsaid the treatments could be considered “child abuse”understate law. Oh, and when it comes to family planning, there’sstillstigma aroundsame-sex adoption that could negatively affect parents’ mental health. Volunteer at a place like alo cal LGBTQ+ Centeror theHuman Rights Campaign. Or donate time or money toThe Trevor Project, whichspecificallysupports LGBTQ+ youth. That age group is dealing with high rates of mental illness andsuicide (More than 40% of highschoolstudents who identify as LGBTQ+said theyseriously considered attempting it in the last year.). Learn the best terms to use (and which to avoid)so you’re able to converse aboutsexuality and identity withsensitivity. Prioritize creating an inclusive atmosphere, which could mean anything fromsharing your gender pronouns(you can now do that easily on Instagram) to bringing diverse groups of people together or being open tol earningsomething new. Check in on your friends who might be fighting mental health battles quietly. Vote, and consider LGBTQ+ progress when you do. Don’t make assumptions about people and be willing to listen openly. LGBTQ+ people have been fighting for civil rights for decades, but progress isslow andstigma persists. And thatstigma adds to a growing list of mental health challenges. If you orsomeone you know isstruggling with anxiety or depression, which maystem from feeling discriminated against, it could be time toseek professional help.

Michael Ziemba, 49, may have lucked out due to a controversial provision of thestate’s landmark 2019 bail reform -- a perceived loophole that hassince been addressed. Soon after Ziemba fled thescene of the crash that killed pedestrian Jason Quackenbush, a new law prohibited the judge from keeping him jailed on bail. Quackenbush was walking to a friend’s house for the night when he wasstruck near the CSX railroad bridge on the Parkway. He diedseveral days later in the hospital. Ziemba fled and ditched the car, which was found with 24 hours. Jason QuackenbushOn Tuesday, a free Ziemba came into court to plead guilty to felony leaving thescene of Quackenbush’s crash. He agreed tospend 2 to 6 years in prison. But he gets to remain free untilsentencing Oct. 28, his lawyer, Matthew Dotzler,said. Ziemba’s freedom during the fatal crash prosecution caused astir last year when a frustrated judge, Thomas J. Miller,said he had no choice to but release Ziemba from jail under thestate’s 2019 bail reform law. The law at the time did not allow bail to beset in fatal crash cases, beginning Jan. 1, 2020. That’s despite the fact that Ziemba had driven in dangerous ways before: hes pent time in prison two decades ago for a drugged-driving crash that injured four -- including a mother and her 14-year-old daughter. The bail reform law thatsprung Ziemba hassince been amended: bail is now allowed to beset on any case that causes a death. But that amendment only applied to crimes committed beginning thissummer. (As an aside, there’s a legal question over whether Ziemba’s crime caused a death -- he was accused of leaving thescene of a fatal crash, not being criminally responsible for the death itself -- he’s not charged withspeeding or drinking, for example.)In any case, the bail law at the time required Ziemba to be released as of Jan. 1. Onondaga County prosecutor Susan Azzarellidelayed Ziemba’s release for months by reopening an old domestic violence case against Ziemba, forcing him toserve an eight-month jailsentence (shortened due to prior jail time andstandard reductions for good behavior). That wassupposed to be enough time to prosecute Ziemba in the Parkway fatality. But the courtshutdown during the pandemic adjourned Ziemba’s case forso long that hissentence in the domestic case ran out a couple months ago, and he was released from jail, his lawyersaid. There was nothing more prosecutors could do to keep him locked up on bail. State Supreme Court Justice Gordon Cuffy continued Ziemba’s release after his plea Tuesday: after all, Ziemba had come back to court when required, which is the legal purpose of bail in the first place. Ziemba will begin his 2-to-6 year prisonsentence when he returns to court forsentencing Oct. 28. He had faced a maximum of 2 1/3 to 7 years in prison, if convicted after trial.",2,2,Syracuse Post-Standard

155,New EPA Rule Change Saves Industry Money but Exacts a Climate Cost,-6.0,46.33,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28022020/epa-hfc-refrigerant-emissions-climate-hydrofluorocarbons-pollutant-andrew-wheeler/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-02-28,21,"For the latest Trump Administration rollback of Environmental ProtectionAgency rules, the math goessomething like this: The change willsave businesses and industries $24 million a year. Earth’s atmosphere, on the other hand, will receive emissions of pollutants equivalent to at least 625,000 new cars being added to the road. This week, EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheelersigneda new rule that relaxes the requirements that owners and operators of refrigeration equipment have leak detection and maintenance programs for hydrofluorocarbons, aset of refrigerants often referred to as“climatesuper-pollutants.”The rule change—the latest reversal of an Obama-era regulation—was part of the administration’sagendato ease burdens on industry.“We just think it’s a baffling and wrong-headed move,”said David Doniger, aseniorstrategic director with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposed the rollback. “Considering there are thousands of facilitiessubject to these rules, [$24 million] is pocket changesavings.”We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The rule applies to a largesegment of the nation’s commercialsector, from agriculture and crop production to the manufacturing of food and beverage products, petrochemicals, plastics, electronics, medical equipment and even the operation of iceskating rinks. The NRDCsaid the agency used old data to underestimate the additional greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the rule change. In fact, Donigersaid, the rule change will release into the atmosphere pollutants equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions of 1 million cars. An EPAspokeswoman defended Wheeler’s decision,saying that the agency determined that in 2016 it had exceeded itsstatutory authority by extending leak-detection and maintenance requirements to equipment using refrigerants like hydro fluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs replaced earlier refrigerants thatseverely damaged Earth’s protective ozone layer, and their use has beengrowing. In its new rule, the EPA echoed an industry assertion that the agency lacked the legal authority to retain the Obama-era requirements for HFCs. One of the industry groups backing the Trump administration’s rule change is the National Environmental Development Association’s Clean Air Project, representing major companiessuch as Boeing, BP, Procter & Gamble, Lilly and Koch Industries. The law firm representing the association did not respond to a request by InsideClimate News for comment. But in written comments to the EPA, a lawyer representing the association called the Obama-era rule “arbitrary” and “punitive.”HFCs are among a group of chemicals known as “short-lived climate pollutants,” which don’t last very long in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide, which insome cases can remain in circulation for thousands of years. Once released into the atmosphere, however, HFCs remain for only about 15 to 30 years, and their impact on global warming can be hundreds to thousands of times greater than that of carbon dioxide,accordingto the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a global partnership working to curbshort-lived climate pollutants. Fifteenstates and Washington, D. C., tried to persuade the EPA to retain the Obama administration’s leak detection and maintenance rules for HFCs. Led by Massachusetts and California, they argued that the Clean Air Act gave the EPA broad authority tostop leaks from ozone-depleting chemicals and their replacements.“Stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change are among the mostsevere environmental threats faced by modern human civilization,” thestates argued. “Thestatesstrongly oppose any EPA action that unlawfully licenses industry to emit more ozone- and climate-damaging chemicals at the expense of human and environmental health and in contravention of the Clean Air Act and its core purposes.”Last year an amendment to the Montreal Protocol—the 1987 treaty that put in check ozone-depleting chemicals—went into force, requiring thephase-outof HFCs by 2030. Ninety-threecountries and the European Union havesigned the treaty, although the Trump administration has not yetsent it to the Senate for ratification. Congress is also weighing bipartisan legislation to phase out HFCs. In November, Sens. Tom Carper (D-Del.), and John Kennedy (R-La.)introducedthe American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM), a bill that would authorize a 15-year phased own of HFCs and has31 cosponsors, including both Republicans and Democrats. Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N. Y.), has introduced asimilarbill, with 21 co-sponsors, also including a mix of Republicans and Democrats. Donigersaid thestrong bipartisansupport to tackle HFCs is asharp contrast to the EPA’s decision to relax the rule on leak detection and maintenance in refrigeration. One provision of the bill, hesaid, “makes clear EPA has the authority to require refrigerant leak management.”James Bruggers covers the U. S.

The public health department received reports of 112 new positive cases during those four days, causing the incidence rate, based on population, to hit astratospheric high of 1,824 on Sunday.“Pitkin County now has the third-highest 14-day incidence rate in thestate,” according to a Monday note on the county’s daily epidemiology report. The incidence rate was above 1,700 on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, though it dropped to 1,593 on Wednesday, according to the local data. Only Bent and Crowley counties in thesoutheastern corner of thestate had higher incidence rates, with both topping 2,000 as of Wednesday,according to thestate COVID Dial. By comparison, anything above 350 is considered above the Red level restriction threshold. Thespike in Pitkin County cases also prompted the county’s positivity rate — which is based on the total number of positive tests divided by the total number of tests conducted — to hit a high of 10.9% on Friday, and remain around 10% for the following three days. Anything above 10% is considered Orange level restrictions, while 15% and above is considered Red level restrictions. The positivity rate among children in Pitkin County has increasedsubstantially in the past week, from 7.4% on Dec. 23 to 10.9% on Tuesday, for an overall rate of 10.2% over the past two weeks, according to the local data. Pitkin County’s hospitalization rate — the third metric tracked by thestate — remains comfortable, though 10 people with COVID-19symptoms wereseen at Aspen Valley Hospital on Tuesday, according to the local data. Three of four ICU beds were available as well, according to the data. Beyond the rapidly increasing numbers, the troubling development for local public health officials was that Pitkin County’s neighbors wereseeing the opposite trend. Eagle County’s 14-day incidence rate, for example, was 553 as of Wednesday, while Summit County’s was 742 and Garfield County was at 1,003, according to thestate’s COVID Dial.“Pitkin County continues tosee an increase in cases,” Vancesaid. “It used to be the opposite. Now it’s flipped on its head. We are really trying to dive into why that is the case.”The answer remains elusive, hesaid. Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock was a bit more optimistic Wednesday that further restrictions put into place by the board of healthstarting Dec. 22, along with at raveler affidavit program, could bring numbers down in the near future.“We really need two weeks of a data runsince the last restrictions tosee what impacts there are,” hesaid. “It’sstill too early to tell.”As for the trends in neighboring counties, Peacocksaid that Pitkin County’s numbers have generally lagged behind those other counties by two to three weeks. Hesaid he’s hoping the county continues to follow that trend and the numbersstart falling. The one brightspot in the latest batch of COVID numbers in Pitkin County is a drop in the percentage of positive cases attributed to communityspread, or those cases where the point of transmission cannot be determined, Vancesaid. That rate has fallen from 35% of all cases on Dec. 16 to 23% on Tuesday, according to local epidemiology data.“(That’s) the lowestsince September,” Vancesaid. “(It means) we are identifying the (origin of) majority of cases we find.”Increased local testing, while driving up case numbers, also is identifying more asymptomatic cases, hesaid. Previously, patients in 97% of positive cases in Pitkin County displayedsymptoms of the disease. Now, 86% reportsymptoms, an important drop when talking about a virus where 15% to 20% of those infected register nosymptoms.“That’ssort of the one upside to this data,” hesaid. Beyond the travails of the next month orso, the rest of the winter and earlyspring is “anyone’s guess,” Vancesaid.“February and March could continue to be dire and challenging,somesay,” hesaid. “While otherssay vaccination of health care workers (and others) will bring case counts down.”The longer-term picture brings hope, though questions remain. Vancesaid he hopes the vaccine will be widely available to most people by latespring or earlysummer, though achieving “herd immunity” is contingent on how many are vaccinated. The other main question involves how effective the vaccine is in tamping down transmission, and whether the vaccine blockssymptoms or blocks bothsymptoms and transmission. In other words, Vancesaid, if a person who received the prescribed two doses of the vaccine is later exposed to the virus, does the vaccine merely block the person from feeling the effects of the disease while allowing the person to freely transmit it? Or does it prevent both, hesaid.“That could lead to quarantine if the person is exposed again,” Vancesaid. “It’s an important question.”However, hesaid the publicshould have “great confidence in the vaccine and the protection it will provide.”Feb 4, 2024The Aspen High School boys basketball team’s home game against Steamboat Springs on Saturday was postponed due to weather and travel concerns.

Ryan Hurley, Iowa State College Republican president told that the tweet did not intend to promote violence. Now, university officials have written a response to an “open letter” that called for disciplinary action against the conservativestudent group. The open letter, created by journalism Professor Kelly Winfrey (), called for “removal of recognition as an officialstudent organization” until every “remaining currentstudent member from the roster has graduated from the University.”Another journalism professor, Novotny Lawrence, and an academic adviser for the journalismschool, Kelsi Poe,signed onto the demand to restrict freespeech. In total, over 500 peoplesigned the letter, primarily a mixture of professors,students and alumni. The lettersaid:We are appalled that the Iowa State University administration has decided it will not invoke disciplinary action on astudent organization, the Iowa State University College Republicans (@IStateCRs), for a tweet that, having nothing to do with the political nature of the organization, incites violence and creates a campus climate that feels threatening to and isolatesstudents, faculty, andstaff of marginalized and historically oppressed populations. Privileging the freespeech of those causing harm over thesafety of the historically marginalized members of our community furthers the damage andsends the message that the Iowa State University community does not value their presence, despite numerous condemnations in recent months of this exact kind of behavior. It is clear that the administration’sstatements during asummer thatserved as a referendum on racism in this country, were merelysymbolic and they nowserve as further evidence of its history of denouncingsome harmful behaviors, only to abdicate themselves of responsibility when given the opportunity toshow their commitment through action. Thesigners also want an updatedstudent conduct code to address responses “tospeech bystudents andstudent organizations that promote hate, directly or indirectly threaten the physicalsafety and free movement of members of the campus community,” or could “potentially incite violence, or violates the Principles of Community.”Finally, it wants “the Provost to begin working with academic units on campus to increase the University-wide U. S. diversity requirement and review the approved courses to ensure the course content is centered on diversity issues.”However, the university administrators were not going to cave to the demands.“At the core of this demand [derecognition of the College Republicans] is a disconnect between the law and First Amendment freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution,” the administratorssaid. They explained how the First Amendment worked and concluded, “this demand asks that the university proactive ly violate the law, and we will not doso.”It corrected Winfrey for falsely claiming thatstudent group tweets were not “protectedspeech if they violate university policy.”The administration explained to the journalism professor:The tweets that are the focus of this demand are protectedspeech, andstanding alone,they do not violate university policy. The university cannot, and will not, punishstudents orstudent organizations for their constitutionally protected expression. University officials also explained again to Winfrey that First Amendment jurisprudence forbids thespeech codessheseeks:Student codes of conduct at other universities that have attempted to punishstudents forspeech deemed “hateful,” “derogatory,” “threatening,” “insensitive” or described with othersuch terms have consistently beenstruck down as unconstitutional. Moreover, the university cannot establish its own thresholds for threatening or hatefulspeech that are broader than the limited exceptions currently allowed in federal lawFinally, it responded to her demand for a diversity audit, pointing out to her that the facultysenate is already working on a curriculum review.“The Working Group has prepared a report which includes new, contemporary learning outcomes, and a draft process for the review and approval of courses that will meet the diversity course requirement,” the administrationsaid.andread the full university response.

159,How to Close the Democrats’ Rural Gap,-15.5,37.0,https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2019/how-to-close-the-democrats-rural-gap/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-01-01,25,"The midterm elections made two things very clear about Democratic voters in the Donald Trump era. First, they vastly outnumber Republican voters: Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives and won the popular vote by more than eight percentage points, the biggest midterm “blue wave”since Watergate. But,second, those Democraticsupporters are geographically clustered in a way that wastes millions of their votes. While the party improved its margins among rural voters compared to 2016, its candidatesstill lost by a whopping fourteen to eighteen percentage points outside of metro areas, lagging well behind Barack Obama’s 2012 performance. As a result, Democratslosttwo net Senateseats. The Senate map in 2020 is onlyslightly less foreboding, asstatewide races in heavily ruralstates like Iowa, Missouri, and the Dakotasseem toslip ever further out of reach. There was a time in the very recent past when many on the left were confident that an era of Democratic dominance was just around the corner, the inevitable result of a “rising electorate” of younger, better educated, and more diverse voters. The midterms were a wake-up call. The rising electorate may beswinging left, but there has been an equal reaction among older and less educated whites—and they represent a lot more of the political map. Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote. Mindful of this reality, many Democraticstrategists are rightly warning that the party desperately needs astrategy to win back rural voters. Unfortunately, the most prominent plans tend to combinesmall-bore ideas that are insufficient to thescale of the problem (like more money for rural broadband) with attacks on Trump’s agricultural tariffs, which Trump-supporting farmers actually tend to give the president a pass on. While the notion that all Trump voters are motivated by “economic anxiety” has been thoroughly debunked, there’s no denying that America’s agricultural communities have beenstarkly declining for years-struggling to turn profits through farming,suffering epidemic levels of op io id addiction andsuicide. Democrats thus have both an opportunity and a moral obligation to try to win these voters back by offering policies that will improve their livelihoods in a way thatstoking white cultural grievance never will. Just ask J. D. Scholten. The thirty-eight-year-old former minor league baseball player garnered national attention in November for almost unseating Iowa Representative Steve King, an eight-term Republican incumbent in one of the reddest districts in America—and perhaps the most unabashed racist in Congress. The last Democrat to run against King lost by 22.6 percent; in 2016, the district went for Trump by twenty-seven points. Yet Scholten lost by only 3.4 percentage points—aswing from 2016 that, if it could be replicated nationally, would all but wipe out the current incarnation of the Republican Party. How did he do it?“I have a lot of folks calling me thinking of running for president and they want to know what their rural messageshould be,” Scholtensays. His answer: “Talk about market consolidation.”Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote. At his thirty-nine town hall meetings, across every county in Iowa’s Fourth District, Scholtenspoke about improving the economy by addressing the growing power of agribusiness monopolies, which, by raising prices on what farmers buy and pushing down prices of what farmerssell, are devastating farm incomes. “Agriculture is the backbone of this district,” Scholtensays. “At every [town hall] I talked about how farmers are beingsqueezed on the input and on the outputside. . . . That resonated more than tariffs ever did, and I think that’s one thing that national reporters never understood.“I think farmers view tariffs as temporary, whereas market consolidation is a long-term issue,” he adds, noting that the call for fair competition has bipartisan appeal. “Anti-trust . . . has not been a partisan issue. Traditional Republicans, they want competitive markets, and that goes against what’s happening in the ag business.”Scholten’s message on agribusiness monopolies may have resonated with farmers, but it has not yet broken through with big-city liberals, too many of whom write off the possibility that progressive economic populism could appeal to rural voters more than right-wing cultural warfare. Until Democratic leaders and candidates find their voice on the key issue affecting rural communities’ economic fortunes, even the biggest blue wave won’t be enough to take back the map. If you have heard about the plight of America’s farmers, it was likely in the context of Trump’s media vortex. You may haveseenstories about dairy farms closing because Trump made a fuss about Canadian dairy markets while renegotiating NAFTA. Or you know that China aimed retaliatory tariffs at farmers to target Trump’s base. But while Trump’s trade policies have certainly made matters worse for many farmers, they are hardly the prime cause for the full-blown crisis gripping America’s farm economy. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. The three years leading up to the 2016 electionsaw thesharpest decline in farm incomessince the Great Depression. In 2015, more than half of all farm households lost more money than they made farming. By now, many observers are predicting that we are on the verge of a farm crisis more dangerous than the one that ripped rural America apart in the 1980s. The downturn is particularly devastating for grain and dairy farmers, who rely on large annual operating loans to keep going eachseason. After four to five years of losing money on every acre of grain or gallon of milk, these farms have exhausted their credit lines. Farmers’ debt-to-income ratios are the highest they’ve been in three decades. Wisconsin alone has lost 1,100 dairy farms over the past two years. One large dairy co-op in the Northeastsent its members a list ofsuicide and mental-health hot lines along with their dairy checks. As farm income declines,so do whole regions. First, local equipment dealers andseed and feedsuppliers close. Then, with the decline in economic activity and eventual loss of population,so do local banks,schools, and hospitals. Most people in rural America are not farmers, but in traditionally ag-dependent regions, even non-farmers’ livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on farm income, which is often the onlysubstantialsource of incoming wealth. What is behind the accelerating decline? One popular idea in elite quarters is that the plight of rural America was foreordained by technological change. As agriculture becomes more productive, the thinking goes, we need fewer farmers, andso rural communities naturally depopulate. Meanwhile, a digitized, global economy naturally gives the highest reward to highlyskilled “knowledge workers” who feed off each other’s creativity by clustering in elite cities. That’s the theme of a recent report by the Brookings Institution, revealinglyentitled“Strategies for Left-Behind Places.” It concludes that the growing gap between elite cities and rural America is the inevitable result of digital technology, which has “increasingly rewarded the most talent-laden clusters ofskills and firms.”That’s a narrative that appeals to many experts, who not coincidentally live in those “talent-laden clusters.” Itsuggests that the plight of Left-Behind Places is nobody’s fault—it’s the result of an impersonal evolutionary process that just happens to favor coastal elites while crushing the maladapted. Well, here’s a different take—one that has far more resonance in heartland America and is backed up by overwhelming evidence. The biggest cause of growing regional inequality isn’t technology; it’s changes in public policy, embraced by both parties, that have enabled predatory monopolies tostrip wealth away from farmers and rural communities and transfer it to America’ssnazziest zip codes. Here’s how it works. Farmers are caught between monopolizedsellers and buyers. They must pay ever higher prices to the giants who dominate the market for thesupplies they need, likeseed and fertilizer. At thesame time, they must accept ever lower prices from the giant agribusinesses that buy thestuff theysell, like crops and livestock. Start with how corporate concentration affects the prices farmers pay. In 1994, the top fourseed companies controlled only 21 percent of the globalseed market. By 2013, just the top three controlled 55 percent, with Monsanto alone controlling more than a quarter. With that increase in concentration has come ashocking increase in the cost ofseed, because these giants face little pressure to compete on price. USDA datashows that the per-acre cost ofsoybean and cornseedspiked dramatically between 1995 and 2014, by 351 percent and 321 percent, respectively. Today’sseeds are often genetically modified to produce higher yields, but that doesn’t translate into more net income for the farmers. Not only is the cost of genetically modifiedseed high, but patent monopolies often make it illegal for farmers to use a portion of their crops to produce their ownseeds, as most did in the past. Moreover, even as farmers are paying monopoly prices for a diminishingselection ofseedstrains produced by handful of giant corporations, they also are paying monopoly prices for fertilizers and pesticides, often to thesame corporations. Since 2017, the Big Sixseed and agric hemic al companies haveshrunk to four, after Dow merged with DuPont and Bayer purchased Monsanto. The top four producers of nitrogen fertilizer controlled 34 percent of the market in 1977, but by 2015 had increased theirshare to more than two-thirds. As crop prices fall and farmers look for areas to cut back on the cost of inputs, many feel up against a wall. “[Seed companies] figure out, how much will a farmer actually pay forseed corn before he’ll goswitch tosome other company,”says Nebraska farmer Vern Jantzen. “If I don’t like what Mycogen is charging forseed corn I can go to Pioneer and I can go to Dekalb, but there’s only three guys. If they all kind of talk to each other a little bit, there isn’t a whole lot of difference in prices.” That is, of course, when there are even multiplesellers to choose from. Thesamestory holds for chemicals used in agriculture, whose prices roughly tripled from 1990 to today, with thesteepest increases after 2007. The fertilizer market is dominated byseveral international phosphorous and potash cartels, and a 2013 monograph by the American Antitrust Institute made the case that priceswings in these markets were due to oligopolistic behavior. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. While Trump’s trade policies have certainly made matters worse, they are hardly the prime cause. All together, the average farmerspends three times more on inputs per acre today than in the 1990s. Recently, the president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, John Hansen, looked up the corn prices from 1973, when hestarted farming. At that time, hesold corn for $3.30 a bushel; in 2017 the average price per bushel was $3.33. “So, how does it work to live and farm in 2017 and pay for those 2017 costs with 1973 prices?” Hansenaskedin a message to NFU members. “The honest answer is that it does not work.”It does work, though, for theseed and chemical companies. Before their acquisition by Bayer and recent legal trouble, Monsanto touted recordseedsales and profits in 2017. “They’ve had a boom while farmers have gone broke,”says Joe Maxwell, who is a farmer, former lieutenant governor of Missouri, and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets. Even as monopolization means that farmers pay more for thesupplies they need, it also means that they receive less for the food they produce. Nationally, the top four beef packersslaughtered 25 percent of cows in 1977; today that’s up to 84 percent. As recently as 1990, four companies processed 61 percent of allsoybeans; today thosesame four process 85 percent. Thesestatistics actually understate the problem, because at the local level, dominant agribusinesses often have total monopolies. “Today you’ll find that in most all this country, really, there’s just one buyer,”says Maxwell. “It’s as if they allsat in a roomsomewhere and carved the country up.”This degree of corporate concentration has turned farmers into price takers. If there’s asinglestatistic that captures the plight of rural America, it is this: In the 1980s, when American consumerss penta dollar on food, 37 cents out of that dollar went back to the farmer. Today, farmers receive less than 15 cents on every dollar. The difference is increasingly flowing to powerful and concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. In 2016, the big meat-packer Smithfield openly bragged about how its record profits were due to a fourteen-year low in the prices paid to hog farmers andsimultaneously higher consumer prices for packaged pork products. Thesamestory repeats across agriculturalsectors, from grains and produce to eggs and poultry. The Contract Poultry Growers Association of the Virginiassays its chicken farmer members haven’tseen an increase in base pay for the past twenty years. Nor do consumers benefit. Chicken and turkey retail prices grewsteadily over the last decade, by 19 percent and 47 percent from 2007 to 2013, respectively, before finallyslowing and thenslightly declining over the past three years. As Big Ag cuts farmers’ margins, often the only way farmers cansee tostay in business is to try making it up on volume. This is what accounts for the emergence of “confined animal feeding operations,” or CAFOs, in which thousands of animals are crammed together in inhumane conditions. CAFOs reflect the ruinous competition farmers face with one another. They also pose a massive threat to human health, assome farmers routinely use nontherapeutic antibiotics on animals crowded into confinedspaces, producing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And they cause vile pollution from large manure lagoons, further detracting from the quality of life across expandingsections of rural America. When Barack Obama was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, heseemed to understand the role that corporate concentration was playing in immiser ating much of rural America. Campaigning in Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado, he promised to take on abuses by monopolistic agribusinesses, particularly meat-packers. Early in his presidency, he followed up on these promises by having top Agriculture Department (USDA) and Justice Department officials hold hearings across the country to investigate malpractice in the poultry, cattle, dairy, andseed industries, as well as the growing gap between the prices consumers paid and farmers received. At the conclusion of these hearings the USDA proposed rule changes that would have given farmers far greater power tostand up to abuses by ag monopolies. But the blowback was immediate. Big Meat threw its lobbying weight behind an effort to block the reforms. Soon,sixty-eight Republicans and forty-seven Democrats delivered a letter to the USDAsaying that the new rules were unjustified and required more industry input and economic analysis. Obama could have implemented the rules unilaterally, but for whatever reason hissecretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, hesitated. Then, in 2010, Republicans took the House and began passing appropriations riders thatstripped the USDA of the necessary funds to implement the rules even if they had gone into effect. In December 2016, Vilsack finallysigned off on asignificantly watered-down rule change. Butshortly after President Trump took office, new Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdueshot down even these modest reforms and dissolved the USDA’s antitrust agency entirely, burying its duties within the agribusiness-friendly Agricultural Marketing Service agency. So it turns out that the Democrats briefly did have a rural policy that took monopolyseriously, but gave it low priority and retreated in the face of corporate opposition. Today, this record leaves many farmers bitter, especially those who risked retaliation by testifying at the USDA hearings about the abuses theysuffered at the hands of monopolists. That bitterness is only amplified when they hear voices in the Democratic Party arguing forsolutions that fail to acknowledge the party’s own role in fostering agribusiness monopolies. Writing in theNew York Timesshortly after the election, columnist Michael Tomaskyrecommendedthat the party embrace a “four pillar” plan written by Tom Vilsack, which calls for, among other things,spending more money on op io id addiction treatment, encouraging more local farmers’ markets, and directing more payments to farmers whoset aside land for conservation. But Vilsack’s plan pointedly fails to mention a central cause of American farmers’ misery, let alone anystrategies for taking on the agribusiness monopolies he failed to roll back during his time in office. Perhaps not coincidentally, Vilsack is currently the president and CEO of the U. S. Dairy Export Council, an agribusiness lobbying group. Other plans circulating in Democratic quarters embrace a kind ofsocial Darwinism to explain the growth of regional inequality and then proposesolutions that are almost insulting in their inadequacy and implicit victim blaming. Brookings Institution’s “Strategies for Left-Behind Places,” for example,states flatly that it would be “inefficient to ‘save’ every left-behindsmall city or rural community in the U. S.” It then argues that the best that can be done is to offer displaced farmers and rural workers more broadband networks,some targeted federal economic development programs, and training in programmingskills. The report concludes by calling for changes to zoning laws that would produce more affordable housing in high-cost cities like New York and San Francisco, thereby allowing more heart landers to move to those thriving metropolises—asolution that would, of course, only exacerbate the problem of coastal population clustering. Though the report does mention rising monopoly as a cause of regional inequality, itstopsshort of recommending anti-monopoly measures as part of thesolution. Big Ag would obviously oppose any Democratic effort to win in rural America with an anti-monopoly playbook. But policy levers, large andsmall, are available at every level of government to politicians who want toshow theirsolidarity with ordinary voters in rural communities. The big policy levers include things like busting up ag monopolies and reforming giant food co-ops. An encouragingstart is a pair of complementary bills, introduced by Senator Cory Booker and Representative Mark Pocan, both Democrats, that would put an eighteen-month moratorium on large agribusiness mergers while a new commissionstudies ways to improve competition policy enforcement. (For more details,see“The Three Ways Democrats Can Fix the Farm Economy” by Adam Diamond.)Smaller-scale butstillsubstantive measures include legislation that would prevent meat-packers from vertically integrating into owning livestock or forcing farmers into exploitative contracts. Booker and Republican Senator Mike Lee introduced an amendment to the farm bill that would have addressed agricultural monopoly instill another way, by reformingso-called “checkoff” programs. These are federallysponsored programs that collect money from farmers to market their product but that often wind up financing agribusiness lobbying groups (The amendment failed, but did draw thirty-eight votes from across both parties.) At the local level, mandating thatschools use more locally grown food in their cafeterias is one available weapon for combating agribusiness monopoly. In the 1980s, when American consumersspent a dollar on food, 37 cents went back to the farmer. Today, it’s less than 15 cents. The difference is increasingly flowing to concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. Advocating forsuch policies could appeal to a far broaderset of Americans than just farmers. One reason is that monopolization in agriculture has by now becomeso extreme that even as it drives down prices for farmers, it can also drive up prices for consumers. This reality has been reinforced by recent investigations into price fixing at tuna companies, mega-brewers, dairy co-ops, chicken processors, and pork packers. Monopolization also affects urban andsuburban consumers by forcing farmers into asystem of industrial-scale monoculture that lacks resiliency in the face of climate change, posessubstantial human health and environmental threats, and produces a level of cruelty to animals that more and more Americans can no longer abide. Though rural and urban Americans may differ on many cultural wedge issues, their common victimization by monopolists provides an issue that bridges the divide. Taking on agribusiness monopolies also provides a way to dosomething important for farm and food chain workers exploited under the currentsystem. Many of the people who pick our food and cut our meats, whether they are undocumented immigrants, refugees, people of color, or working-class whites, are further marginalized when asingle agricultural giant controls all the jobs available to them across whole regions. Rural communities are also deeply oppressed by other forms of monopoly. These include the closing of local hospitals bought out by giant corporate chains; the takeover of locally owned financial institutions by taxpayer-subsidized “too big to fail” banks; the loss of connectivity to the global economy that results when airlines cut offservice to “flyover country”; and the threats posed by deregulated freight railroad monopolies that are abandoningservice to farms and industries along branch lines while charging monopoly prices on the mainline traffic they keep. J. D. Scholten also points to how large chainstores like Dollar General “sink money out of the community” byshutting down locally owned retailers. Restoring antitrust enforcement across the board, including against companies like Walmart and Amazon, would go a long way toward allowing local economies to once again compete on an even playing field. “Part of that rural identity is being independent,” argues Scholten. “Now [rural communities] are reliant on a corporation rather than beingself-employed, and I think that’s part of the issue.”In the face ofsuch challenges and opportunities, leaders interested in addressing the nation’s growing economic and political dividesshouldstop listening to people who think we can fix the problems of rural America with more broadband, coding classes, and zoning changes. Instead theyshould pay attention to people like Scholten who know what they are talking about and are willing tosay it out loud.",1,1,Washington Monthly

Thousands of Californians have fallen behind on their rents and mortgages as joblessnessskyrocketed – with the Legislative Analyst’s Office estimating that even with unprecedented government assistance, Californians owed $400 million in unpaid rent in 2020. Even before the pandemic, middle- and low-income residents were leaving thestate for more affordable options. At the heart of this is what we have long known: exorbitant housing costs have made it extremely difficult for families tosave for a rainy day, keep paying their rent and mortgages in the case of an emergency, and work their way into the middle class. Gov. Newsom and legislative leaders have indicated their commitment to figuring out long-termsolutions to California’s housing crunch, and much policy work in the Legislature has focused on affordable housing options for California’s most vulnerable citizens. We applaud this commitment and the work done thus far; however, housing afford ability is an issue that impactsmiddle-classCalifornians as well. Even before the pandemic, middle- and low-income residents were leaving thestate for more affordable options, with fewer people moving into thestate to replace them. Most leaving thestate had an income of less than $100,000, with most moving into thestate making over $100,000 – exacerbating problems of income inequality. As we work to rebuild from the pandemic and create a California that is accessible for all, new housing construction that reduces costs and lessens time to project completion is vital to those efforts. The Housing Contractors of California, as the dedicated businesses building housing options for California’s middle class,stand ready to work with Gov. Newsom, legislative leaders, and otherstakeholders tospur new housing construction, yet are increasingly concerned aboutsolutions to the “missing middle” housing problem. One immediate way that Governor Newsom and legislative leaders can partner with us to lower the cost of housing on all Californians is to help end unscrupulous lawsuits against housing contractors that drive up the cost of housing. The Private Attorneys General Act, or PAGA, was designed to help workers remedy violations ofstate labor code through civilsuits, but has ballooned to costly and prolonged legal battles even when nosubstantial violation occurred, often ending withsettlements before they reach the court. When it comes to thestate’s housing crisis, the threat of PAGA litigation diminishes the ability of private contractors to help make a dent in the housing crunch. Many of these frivolous lawsuits have resulted in millions of dollars in unforeseen construction costs that ultimately get passed on to the homebuyer, needlessly driving up price of home ownership for Californians across thestate. Unfortunately, these barriers of entry put on home buyers aren’t getting enough attention. Housing contractors,state agencies, and the business community at large have all noted that PAGA has primarily benefitted attorneys who bring claims with or without merit, only tosettle quickly out of court for little money and with their fees reimbursed. A recent reportshowed that PAGA claims through private attorneys cost twice as much, deliver half the benefit to workers, and take longer than when thestate Labor Commissioner resolves the claim directly. PAGA reform is essential to reducing housing costs. The Housing Contractors of California are eager to get to work onsolving ourstate’s most intractable housing challenges, furthering the construction of market rate housing for the middle class and expanding home ownership and opportunity to all. Creativity must match political will in order to help heal the inequalities the pandemic has brought to light and the ways in which Californians looking to get ahead are unfairly being punished. We call on Governor Newsom and legislative leaders to help us grow the middle class and make housing more affordable, prio rit izing missing middle housing with equal urgency as othersectors of the housing crisis.

LOUIS — Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner won Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the city’s top prosecutor by a healthy margin. Gardner, who is completing her first term, defeated former assistant prosecutor Mary Pat Carl, 61% to 39%, according to final and unofficial results. She will face Republican challenger Daniel Zdrodowski in the November election. He ran unopposed Tuesday. Gardner, 45, the first Black woman elected circuit attorney in St. Louis, has promised to continue efforts to reform the criminal justicesystem. Her controversial first term has been highlighted by tensions with police and criticism of her leadership as well as prosecutions of powerful people including a Missouri governor. She has described her opponents as “status quo tacticians” who have wagedracial,politicalandsexistattacks on her reform efforts. Shesaidshe also has received racist death threats.“I feel humbled,” Gardner toldsupporters at a rooftop warehouse watch party Tuesday night. “This is an exciting time, but this is also the people’s time. This is about the people who elected me, the people in this room who fought for equality and justice and this is about people whosent a resounding message that they want reform in the city of St. Louis.”Carl, 43, came insecond to Gardner in a field of four Democrats in the 2016 primary. She campaigned on her more than 14 years of experience prosecuting crimes in St. Louis. She pledged to restorestability to a Circuit Attorney’s Office that has weathered dramatic turnover under Gardner. Carlsaidshe had hoped to give crime victims a voice in the courtroom, end cash bail and hold amnesty days for those who miss court dates. She, like Gardner,supports closing the city’s Medium Security Institution better known as the workhouse.“We ran astrong campaign under unprecedented circumstances,” Carl tweeted Tuesday night. “I’m proud of what we accomplished, and grateful for the commitmentso many made. I wish Ms. Gardner asuccessful term. I urge her to be transparent with the public, and build working relationships for asafer St. Louis.”During her campaign, Gardnersaidshe had worked to hold police accountable and reduce crime by focusing on its roots — poverty, addiction and mental health. Gardner took credit for a declining city jail population through pretrial diversion programs and no longer prosecuting people forsmall amounts of marijuana. A central issue in Gardner’s first term has been her office’songoing legal fight to win a new trial for a St. Louis man imprisoned for 25 years for a murder Gardner insists he did not commit. Carl and Gardner both picked up last-minute financialsupport from dozens of donors in the two weeks before Tuesday’s primary, according to campaign finance reports. Carl’s campaign took in at least $313,000. Backers included lawyers and businesses, and the St. Louis-Kansas City Carpenters Regional Council. The STL Justice PAC received an $44,000 donation from theJoseph Wingate Folk Societyon July 23 toward Carl’s campaign. Gardner’s fundraising totaled about $200,000 includingsupport from the Missouri Justice & Public Safety Political Action Committee, which on July 29 received a $116,000 donation from progressive New York me ga donor George Soros.

163,"Jerry Moran, Roy Blunt let down GOP legacy with Jan. 6 vote",-10.33,34.67,https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/derek-donovan/article251742798.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-01,17,"Editorials and other Opinion content offer perspectives on issues important to our community and are independent from the work of our newsroom reporters. Roy Blunt and Jerry Moran, you broke my heart. I had held out hope you would prove your loyalties lie with the United States, not with Donald Trump. Your choice to join fellow Senate Republicansin opposition to a bipartisan congressional commission investigating the insurrection at the U. S. Capitolshowed just how foolish those hopes were. We knew how the juniorsenators from Missouri and Kansas would vote. After the rioters were finally driven from the Senate chamber on Jan. 6, while Capitol Police received first aid for their wounds and broken glass layscattered in the halls, Sens. Josh Hawley and Roger Marshall came back to the floor and voted toset fire to millions of Americans’ votes in the 2020 election. Neither Blunt nor Moran played their colleagues’ dangerous,seditious game of political theater. So I thought there was a chance ourstates’seniorsenators wouldsurprise us this week. Both have lengthy, distinguished careers in Washington, with an almost 50 years’ combinedservice that long predates Trump’s takeover of their party. And while they canshow their partisanstripes with the best of them — Blunt dipped more than a toe into theBarack Obama birth er waters— both men can also point to records ofsolid bipartisanship and legislativeseriousness. Blunt rose to the occasion with afine, patrioticspeech at the inauguration of President Joe Biden — an event Trump and his minions continue to decry as illegitimate. Moran notably remained a vocal Trumpskeptic as late as May of 2016, concerned about the likely nominee’s ability to “unite the Republican Party around our common goal ofsecuring a brighter future for our kids and grandkids.” Famed D. C. journalist Carl Bernstein named them both on his long list of Republicansenators whosecretly express “extreme disdain” for President 45. Yet Blunt and Moranstill voted to absolve Trump of clearly impeachable conduct. Twice. Weshould have expected democracy wouldstrike out a third time on the commission. Today’s Grand Old Party, its base terrorized and lied to all day by the Fox News/Breitbart/Facebook entertainment-industrial complex, is no place forstatesmanship — especially when thestates you represent are as deep red as Missouri and Kansas. And with Facebook’s top-performing posts overwhelmingly dominated by ring-wing misinformation on a daily basis, that doesn’t look likely to change any timesoon. It’s not yet been evensix monthssince the riot. We can’t begin to know what the inevitable investigations will uncover. But we can be certain the images from that disgraceful coda to Trump’s chaotic term — the mob marching from his rally to fly his flags alongside the Confederacy’s under the Capitol rotunda — will beseared into our national memory for generations to come, alongside the last chopper fleeing Saigon and the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. Roy Blunt and Jerry Moran, you had the chance tostand, for posterity, with Sens. Mitt Romney and others in your party who chose not to tie themselves to a two-time popular vote loser. You chose otherwise. And the most enduring lines in your biographies have been written. Thisstory was originally publishedMay 28, 2021, 11:00 AM.",1,1,Kansas City Star
164,"Rock & Roll Hall of Fame to Induct Jay-Z, Carole King, Go-Go’s, Tina Turner, Todd Rundgren and Foo Fighters",0.0,48.67,https://variety.com/2021/music/news/rock-roll-hall-of-fame-to-induct-jay-z-carole-king-go-gos-tina-turner-todd-rundgren-and-foo-fighters-1234971224/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-12,21,"The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has pulled the curtain back onsix inductees who’ll be formally ushered in as the class of 2021, withJay-Z, the Go-Go’s,Tina Turner,Todd Rundgren,Carole KingandFoo Fightersall invited to make the trip to Cleveland this October. Notably, the hall will also welcomeseveral other artists that did not appear on the general ballot this year but are being inducted in other categories, including two artists that have been repeatedly nominated in the past without being voted in, Kraftwerk and LL Cool J. Among the main crop of performer inductees, women were voted into three ofsixslots — representation that’s likely to be welcomed after years of complaints that rock’s female pioneers have gone underrepresented — and two out ofsix are Black artists. Among the main crop of a half-dozen inductees, King and Turner are receiving theirsecond inductions. Tina Turner was voted into the hall all the way back in 1991 as half of the duo Ike and Tina Turner. King’s previous induction goes back even a year prior to Turner’s. She was brought in as half of a duo, too, whenshe was inducted along with former partner Gerry Goffin in thesongwriting category in 1990. Neither had ever been nominated as asolo artist until this year. King and Turner are thesecond and third women to beselected for induction twice, after Stevie Nicks came in as asolo artist in 2019 following her previous membership as a member of Fleetwood Mac. Most of the class of 2021 got in the first time they appeared on the ballot, although thatshould come with a big asterisk forsome who had been long eligible. The Go-Go’s had never been nominated before — a huge point of controversy and contention for a hall that had been accused of recognizing pioneering women rockers late, if ever (withsomeseeing New York vs. L. A. bias also figuring into their previous exclusion). Interviews around the Go-Gos’ Sundance/Showtime documentary last year led to inevitable media discussions of why the band had never been in contention despite being eligible for roughly 15 years. Meanwhile, Foo Fighters also got in their first time on the ballot, but this was their first year of eligibility, with a mere quarter-century having passedsince the band’s debut album. Dave Grohl, of course, will join Turner and King as a double inductee, having previously been brought in as the drummer for Nirvana. Todd Rundgren got the nod on only his third nomination, although he became eligible in 1996; he was previously nominated in 2019 and 2020. King was previously nominated as a performing artist only once before this year, remarkably… all the way back in 1989. Special awards being given out in three other categories are certain to get a lot of attention, especially because of the inclusion of artists who’d previously been repeatedly put before voters in the main performer category withoutsuccess. Kraftwerk is being recognized with an “Early Influence Award.” The pioneering electronic group had previously been nominated as performerssix times,starting in 2003 and as recently as last year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame finding a different way to get them in may beseen as the inner circlesaying: If the general votership won’t do the right thing, after repeated opportunities, we will. Thesame goes for LL Cool J, who is being given a “Musical Excellence Award.” Like Kraftwerk, the rapper-actor, too, had been nominatedsix times before,starting in 2010 and continuing through this year’s ballot. Joining LL Cool J in getting that Musical Excellence honor aresolostar and “fifth Beatle” Billy Preston and metal guitarist Randy Rhoads. Those being recognized with an Early Influence Award besides Kraftwerk aresoul-jazz performer (andseminal hip-hop influence) Gil Scott Heron and early 20th century blues musician Charley Patton. Finally, thesingular Ahmet Ertegun Award, typically given to executives or other non-performing figures, this year goes to Clarence Avant, the celebrated industry trailblazer who wassubject of the 2019 Netflix documentary “The Black Godfather.”And now, a moment of loud rock ‘n’ rollsilence for those 10 artists on the 2021 ballot who didn’t make it to the finalsix, a highly illustrious crop in and of itself: Kate Bush, Devo, Dionne Warwick, Rage Against the Machine, Chaka Khan, Iron Maiden, Mary J. Blige, the New York Dolls, Fela Kuti… and LL Cool J, who, as previously noted, is getting aseparate entree. The 36th annual ceremony isset for Oct. 30 at Cleveland’s Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, a welcome return to live proceedings after last year’s class had tosettle for a virtual, pre-recorded HBO induction due to the pandemic. SiriusXMsubscribers will be able to hear a livesimulcast and, as always, an edited version will beseen later on HBO (and, now, thestreamer HBO Max).",2,1,Variety

By July 4th, he wants 70% of all Americans adults to have received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. That’s 160 million people.“Let’s celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence from this virus,”Bidensaid from the White House on Tuesday afternoon. Hesaid new pop-up clinics – including mobile clinics – will be deployed to help meet the new benchmark. Pharmacies will also expand walk-in appointments. Additional resources will be devoted to rural areas, where inoculations have lagged. NEW: Pres.

Hesaid federal officials willship vaccines directly to pediatricians. “The administration is “challenging”states to administer at least oneshot to as many teens as possible by July 4,so they can be fully vaccinated by the timeschoolstarts in the fall,”reports USA Today. More than 40% of US adults –some 105 million – are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data, and 147 million Americans have received at least one dose. The New York Timesprovides more details on Biden’s remarks:In an afternoon address, the president pledged more funding for outreach campaigns designed to convince those reluctant to getshots of the need to protect their own health and that of others. Despite a flood of vaccine available, providers are administering about 2.29 million doses per day on average, about a 32 percent decrease from the peak of 3.38 million reported on April 13, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Senior health officials have decided that herd immunity — the point at which the virus dies out for lack of hosts to transmit it — will likely remain elusive. But if 70 percent of the population is at least partially vaccinated, the nation can keep gradually removing restrictions that impede normal life, onesenior administration officialsaid,speaking on condition of anonymity at a briefing for reporters.",2,1,News and Guts

Considering this is thesame nation that houses Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and Saint Louis, that’ssayingsomething. However, in most of those cities, ifsomeone tries to hurt the police, they will be arrested, prosecuted, and possibly convicted in a court of law. Due process will be carried out, but an effort will be made to right the wrong ofsomeone trying to injure a law enforcement officer. In Portland, though,that doesn’tseem to be the case. Scores of the500 people who were arrested during the nearly 75 days of violent Portland riots will have their charges dropped by the newBlack Lives Matter-approveddistrict attorney. Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt announced that his default position is not to prosecute and that most crimes by rioters will be forgiven and forgotten. That list of crimes includes interfering with a police officer, disorderly conduct, and rioting.-interfering with a police officer-disorderly conduct-criminal trespass-harassment-escape in the 3rd degree-riot (somtimes insome circumstances)Attacks on police officers and resisting arrest will bescrutinized based on whether – and we’re not making this up – police caused rioters to react because they used tear gas or other crowd-control measures causing rioters to “instinctively lash out.”Sweet dancing baby Elvis on a cold-fusion-poweredsurfboard, really?Schmidt is actually taking the “look what you made me do” defenseseriously?After all, this is what he’s arguing. He’s claiming that police using well-proven crowd-control techniques on rioterssomehow makes it their fault if those rioters hurt them. I’d ask if he was kidding me with this crap, but this is Portland. No, people there actually mean this kind of nonsense. They actuallyseem to believe that anything they do to the police is justified. And what’s worse is that the people of Portlandseem to want this kind of thing. While I don’t think policeshould have to do whatever they want free from repercussions, the use of tear gas and these other crowd control measures have long been established policy for trying to break up things like riots. Now, they’re basically being told that if a “protestor” physically assaults them and causes injury, the DA’s office won’t do a damn thing. So what are theysuppose to use, harsh language?Schmidt is also not prosecuting people for curfew violations, either. In other words, Portland is pretty much lawless right now because the DA is more concerned with appealing to the mob than doing his damn job. It’s absolutely pathetic. It’s also a case of all but begging for Portland to burn. The rioters will likely feel more emboldened and continue their antics until things get even more out of control. Don’t besurprised tosee Portland do a reenactment of the city of Atlanta following General Sherman’s visit there. After all, if no one is going tostop them now, whyshould they believe anyone will try andstop them later?If and when that happens, the last people Schmidt needs to look to for blame is the Portland Police Department.",0,0,Bearing Arms

The administration has taken a piecemeal approach, expertssay, continuing to target transgender Americans following the historic ruling. Experts on LGBTQ equalitysay the Trump administration is uninterested in fully enforcing a Supreme Court ruling on workplace discrimination from earlier thissummer, and thatslow-walking that decision could have larger implications for the broader LGBTQ community. According to those experts, Trump administration agencies have beenslow to respond to the landmark ruling in, whichstates that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars employment discrimination based onsex, also prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ people. Other agencies have altogether denied the ruling’s relevance to other proposed regulations or decided to focus on certain parts of the decision and not others. The court ruled thissummer that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based onsex.”On Monday, however, the U. S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights decided it would only heed part of that decision, publishing two letterssigned by Kimberly Richey, the acting assistantsecretary for the Office for Civil Rights, that addressed how the department would respond to complaints of LGBTQ discrimination in light of the ruling. In one letter, the officesaid it would investigate a complaint related tosexual orientation discrimination because ofBut in thesecond letter, Richeysaid thatschools have a right to keep transgenderstudents out of athletic teams that correspond with their gender and thatschools that don’t discriminate against transgenderstudents are not complying with the law. The department argued that Title IX, the federal civil rights law that protects people from discrimination on the basis ofsex in education programs and activities, is too different from Title VII for the recent Supreme Court decision to be relevant in this case. Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN, a group focused on ending discrimination against and harassment of LGBTQstudents, responded to thesecond letter this week,saying that the department’s actions were part of a “cruel and discriminatory” agenda.“We urge the Department to cease these attacks and fully embrace the recent decision in Bostock that affirms what GLSEN has long known: Discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is prohibited under federal civil rights laws,” Byardsaid. Sharita Gruberg,senior director for the LGBTQ research and communications project at the Center for American Progress, explained in abri ef released last week that there are many reasons to think has much wider reach for LGBTQ people thansimply employment discrimination. Gruberg wrote that Title IX’s language is “closely modeled” on Title VII’s language and that courts often look to case law on the latter for guidance onsex discrimination under Title IX. In response to the Department of Education letters and the attempt toseparate workplace andschool discrimination, Grubergsaid, “I can’t imagine working as a civil rights attorney and with astraight face claiming these are not related.”“A government that actually did care about the law and ensuring that it is correctly enforcing it would direct a whole government approach to the enforcement ofsex discrimination prohibition that would be inclusive ofsexual orientation and gender identity,”shesaid. Gruberg added that the difference between the lettersshows how the administration has focused on policies that harm transgender peoplespecifically. Although the administration, and the education departmentspecifically, has advanced regulations that hurt queer people’s rights, its anti-transgender actions have been particularly bold,shesaid.hey have been more explicit and more public in their attacks on transgender people.”Grubergsaid the letterspeaks to the “anti-trans animus” throughout the administration, including its proposed and current regulations rolling back Obama-era protections for trans people in health care,housing, and one of its first anti-LGBTQ actions, which was to rescind guidance that provided protections for transgenderstudents. The letters are just one example of how the administration has largely disregarded. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a rule, for instance, that encourages discrimination against transgender homeless people insingle-sexshelters. In June, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Jennifer Wexton (D-VA)wroteto Secretary Ben Carson to raise concerns about theshelter regulation in light of the court’s decision in June. Carson responded in July and claimed that the ruling “has no impact” on the proposed HUD rule. The Justice Department has also failed to respond to the court’s decision in. According toThe 19th, the agency hasn’t withdrawn guidance on anti-LGBTQ employment discriminationsince the Supreme Court ruling. It had claimed previously in 2017 that Title VII doesn’t protect LGBTQ workers from discrimination. The department alsofiledbriefswith the Supreme Court last year for thecase, which argued against LGBTQ equality for workers. Additionally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionissuedits own guidance following the landmark decision thissummer; that guidance avoids the words “transgender woman,” “transgender man,” or “nonbinary person.”The guidance, instead, in one example refers to a person that “was identified as male at birth, but uses feminine pronouns and identifies as a female.”Top White House officials are urgingschools to double down on tutoring, extra learning time, and efforts to boost attendance as thespending deadline for pandemic aid nears.

In the video, another officer can beseen. That officer has not been identified and it is not clear if he is being investigated. Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopezheld a press conference on January 27 andsaid the department made the decision to turn over the criminal investigation to the Florida Department of Law Enforcementso that it is “completely independent” with “complete transparency.” The county attorney’s office is also assisting. Lopezsaid there is “zero tolerance” for excessive force and police misconduct in thesheriff’s office. He was elected assheriff in November 2020 andsworn into office in early January 2021. Lopezsaid the “juvenile is fine,” despite her familysayingshesuffered injuries and is continuing to experience medical issues as a result of the traumatic experience. Lopezsaid the “deputy is also fine,” and that he “experiencedsome injuries when he hit the ground.” He alsosaid there have been death threats made toward the deputy and his department will investigate those and “come after” anyone threatening Osceola County Sheriff’s Office employees.“My understanding, it was a disruption of aschool function. Thestudent was not complying with lawful commands. She went after anotherstudent,” Lopezsaid. The deputy has been placed on paid administrative leave, thesheriff’s officesaid. Fournier has worked for the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office for 10 years, according to authorities. It was not immediately clear how long Fournier has been working as aschool resource officer at Liberty High School. According to the Kissimmee highschool’s website, Fournier was also the girls’ flag football team coach. Theschool district has not commented about the incident or whether he has been removed from that role. In astatement to ABC News, districtspokesperson Dana Schafersaid, “It has been a difficult week for Liberty Highstudents andstaff. The entirestaff and administration of Liberty High School remain committed to ensuring that we have asafe and positive learning environment for allstudents.” Schafer told ABC News the district is cooperating with the investigation. Fournier, who was paid $48,000 in 2017, was named as employee of the month by the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office in August 2016,according to a Facebook post. The office did notsay in the post why Fournier received the award. Osceola County SheriffDeputy Ethan Fournier. Osceola County SheriffDeputy Ethan Fournier. Sheriff Lopezsaid “the deputy does not have a history of misconduct, other than minor damage to property.” He did not explain what incidents led to misconduct charges for damaging property. According to online records, Fournier was cited in Osceola County in 2015 for careless driving. He was also cited again in 2017 for thesame offense. According to online court records, the 2017 incidentstemmed from a traffic crash while Fournier was on duty and driving a patrol SUV on Country Road 532 in Davenport. Fournier told the Florida Highway Patrol he was distracted by a loose radar mount in his vehicle and rear-ended a car that hadstopped. He was fined $166 for careless driving. The 2015 careless driving incident was also the result of a crash while on-duty that caused $3,000 in damage and injuredsomeone. He was also fined $166 for that incident. A Liberty High Schoolstudent also told TMZabout an incident involving Fournier at theschool. Junior Daijah Wattssaidshe thought Fournier was a “chill dude,” but “Watts claimsshesaw Fournier use pepperspray on a group of kids who were fighting 2 years ago. She now thinks the whole department issuspicious.”The gossipsite also wrote, “Trey’vion Telfair … who tells TMZ he used to think Officer Fournier was a good guy. Hesays Fournier participated in police brutalityseminars for Liberty’s Black Student Union back in September, andseemed genuine …saying hestood with them. Telfair now thinks it was all an act. At a press conference, Crump, who has represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and many other victims of police misconduct and brutality and other civil rights violations, called for Fournier to be fired, arrested and barred from ever working as a police officer again, especially at aschool.“I would not allow that to happen to my child,” Crump told reporters at the press conference. “It’s unacceptable.” Crump added, “I am just angry that a trained professional, adult man feels that he has the right to pick up andslam a young Black girl. They don’t do this to other people’s children. Why do they feel like it’s OK to do it to our children?”Crumphasstarted a petition to call for Fournier to be held accountable. Crump wrote, “Taylor, a Black child with a bright future, was unarmed and posed NO threat to Deputy Fournier. Why did he think it was okay to ruthlessly throw her against the hard ground?”The attorney added:Blackstudents already have a hard time feelingsafe. We do NOT need to addschool resource officers to their list of daily fears. We must treat our next generation with respect and dignity. They deserve to learn in asafe, non-hostile environment, NOT to get beaten and traumatized by adult bullies like this deputy!Unfortunately, this may be emblematic of a bigger problem. The Osceola Sheriff’s Office has beensubject toscrutiny in recent years for arrestingstudents for first-time offenses connected to fights, typically on misdemeanor battery charges. A recentstudy by the Carruthers Institutesaid they’ve had the fourth-most youth arrests in lieu of juvenile civil citations for “common youth misbehavior.”There’s no excuse for Deputy Ethan Fournier’s overzealous behavior. He could have killed Taylor and we will not tolerate these actions in ourschools. We must hold this SRO accountable!A petition has also beenstarted bystudents at the highschool, calling for Fournier to be fired. It has received more than 3,800signatures.“The victim could’ve died in thissituation and the deputyshouldn’t able able to walk away from this without any proper action taken to punish him. This deputy has a known history of not being able to handlesituations withstudents in a proper manner, he is known for pepperspraying kids atschool whenever asituation gets out of hand instead of properly detaining them,” thestudents wrote. The Change.org petition adds, “Ourschool’s principal has not addressed thesituation after this incident , when other incidents with this officer happened and was recorded theschoolsuspended anyone who recorded and tried to address the issue. This needs to end now andshouldn’t go on in our community any longer.”",2,2,Heavy

These aresome of the things we learned combing through more than 1,800 pages of New York Police Department records on crimes referred to the Hate Crime Task Force because officerssuspected anti-Jewish motivation in 2019. What we did not learn was what percentage ofsuch crimes led to arrests and prosecution that year; whether the perpetrators or victims fell into any distinguishable demographic patterns; or how much worse antisemitic activity was across Brooklyn than it had been in prior years. That’s because the N. Y. P. D., which turned over the records via DVD only after the Forwardsueddemanding them under thestate’s public records law, did not include the more than 30 cases that are pending in criminal court. (The department did not tell the Forward how many records were withheld — this number is based on a comparison between the number of cases that were delivered versus the department’s tally of antisemitic hate crimes from 2019). The records officer for the departmentsaid that the “disclosure of the records would interfere with ongoing judicial proceedings or criminal investigations.” Joseph Aron, the lawyer from Aron Law who is representing the Forward,said that the N. Y. P. D.’s assertion is “completely misplaced.”“Many of these documents have already been handed over to the alleged perpetrator/defendant in the underlying criminal proceeding,” hesaid in an email. “It is therefore perplexing to understand how their release to the Forward would necessarily interfere with those judicial proceedings.”While the department rejected our attempts to access the records administratively, we anticipate that the court will compel the N. Y. P. D. to disclose the withheld records. Aspokesperson, after initially indicatingshe would make officers available for an interview, ultimately declined. The department, in response to nearly 50 emailed questions about the patterns outlined in this report, provided only the followingstatement:“The N. Y. P. D. will never tolerate hate in our city in any form. The N. Y. P. D. has the largest Hate Crime Task Force in the country comprised of investigators that work tirelessly with our patrol officers, detectivesquads and community leaders to vigorously investigate every reported hate crime.”Without the criminal-court cases, it is impossible to do any meaningful macro-analysis of the trends. But the records we have do provide at least a foggy window into how the police handle antisemitic hate crimes. Here aresome of the interesting things we found:Of the 208 cases that we got records about, the majority, nearly 80%, involved vandalism or graffiti, and most of those involvedswastikas. That is consistent with the findings of the city’s Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, whichsaid that 76% of anti-Jewish complaints in 2019 were forswastika vandalism. But on Feb. 17, 2019, on 11th Avenue in Manhattan, officers discovered a “swatzika” on the front of Bedrock Mini Storage. On May 10, a vandal drew a ten-inch “swasticka” on the inside of a bathroom door at asubwaystation in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn. In Astoria on June 13, an officer discovered “swatzstikas,” carved into trees in front ofstately brick homes on 28thstreet. A little more than a week later, an officer wrote of three “swatstikas” carved into a wall, door andstaircase in the apartment building Boro Park Village. On Aug. 20, officers learned of a “swatsticka” drawn on a pillar at asubwaystation at 44th Drive and 21st Street in Queens. Yarmulke, the Yiddish term for theskullcap religious Jews wear, is an admittedly difficult word tospell. It might be derived from the Polish word “jarmułka,” which also meansskullcap, and many prefer thesimpler “kippah,” which means “dome” in Hebrew but refers to thesame head covering. Butsome of New York’s finest have taken phoneticization to a new low in these reports. It is, variously, rendered as “yamaka” and “yamica,” which at leastsound basically right ifsaid fast in a Brooklyn accent, but also the just plain wrong “yakama,” which is the name of a Native American tribe in Washingtonstate.

Officerssometimes misspelled words like “yarmulke” and “swastika” in police reports. Illustration by Molly BoigonTo be fair, these mistakes were made by regular beat cops at precincts around the city. The reports filled out by members of the Hate Crimes Task Force did not containsuch errors. Indeed,some of the butchered words were on reports about incidents in neighborhoods with few Jews where antisemitic hate crimes are rare, and perhaps those offending officersshould be forgiven. But what about the officer in the 77th precinct, home to Educational Institute Oholei Torah, the flagship yeshiva for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, who responded to the Nov. 25, 2019 case of a “yakama” knocked-off the head of a 14-year-old white male whose name was redacted?Another officer twice described the “swatzika” painted on astreetsign at Astor Place and 8th Street on Sept. 30 — a centralstomping ground for New York Universitystudents,14% of whom are Jewish.

Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonIn a post-9/11 world, many Americans, and especially New Yorkers, assume we are under constant videosurveillance. Some of the N. Y. P. D.’s hate-crime police reports indicate otherwise. Perpetrators responsible for antisemitic graffiti found on a movie poster on asubway platform at 4th Avenue & Union Street on Aug. 20, for example, went unapprehended in part because there was notsurveillance video trained on thespots where the graffiti was made. So, too, for whoever drewswastikas and wrote “Heil Hitler” on an MTA bus in Queens on June 17,spray-painted a blackswastika on a park bench in the Marine Park Salt Marsh Nature Center last Dec. 28 and wrote in black marker in an 103rdstreetsubwaystop, “Kill all Jews” with twoswastikas on November 10. Then there are cases like the Sept. 29 one in whichsomeone pulled a visibly Orthodox woman’s wig off and threw a bottle and rocks at her near Tompkins Avenue and Ellery Street in Brooklyn, an incident caught on video. The closing report on the incident, though,says the “video collected is not identification quality,” and the case was closed without an arrest under the classification “investigative leads exhausted.”After a Sept. 29 case in whichsomeone pulled a visibly Orthodox woman’s wig off and threw a bottle and rocks at her near Tompkins Avenue and Ellery Street in Brooklyn, a closing report on the incidentsaid that the “video collected is not identification quality,” and the case was closed without an arrest under the classification “investigative leads exhausted.”Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonWhen a photo mural in front of the Jewish Children’s Museum in Crown Heights was vandalized on Jan. 1, the department noted that the “video cameras at location are not working.” That case, too, was closed under “investigative leads exhausted,” with a report noting that there were “no cameras facing location of occurrence.”For the more than 200 incidents for which the departmentshared records, there were complaint reports that aresupposed to include details about how cases were classified and whether victims were notified of their rights to apply for compensation. But the manner of classifying crimes was not consistent —some nearly identicalswastika-graffiti crimes, for example, were classified as “making graffiti” while others were “criminal mischief” andstill others were “aggravated harassment.” The department declined to answer questions about why officers would be classifying these crimes differently. Theshorthand officers use was also inconsistent:some cases were marked “agg harassment” and others “harass agg.”Officers also noted in the vast majority of cases that victims were not told of their rights to victim’s compensation, a notification that is required by law. Thestate willsometimes pay — up to $30,000 insome cases — to people who lost wages, have to pay for a burial, need transportation to court, have to pay for medical and counseling expenses, have to replace lost orstolen essential property like eyeglasses, or who need to move as a result of the crime. Applicants complete a form and are granted money if they meet certainrequirements, including physical injury or psychological trauma. The N. Y. P. D. has cards with information about how victims can apply for these funds and other help from victim-assistance programs,said Janine Kava, aspokesperson for New York’s criminal justiceservices office. And,she noted, the law also requires police reports to include a place where officers can acknowledge whether (or not) the information has been provided to a victim as required. But for 191 of the 222 victims listed in the reports, the officers wrote that they did not notify them of their rights. (Some cases had multiple victims.)In one case on Aug. 29, a Hasidic man wasstruck by what appeared to be blocks of ice while driving in his work truck in Crown Heights. Hesuffered asmall injury to his head and was treated by emergency-medicalservices, but according to the police report, he was not notified of the crime-victim compensation law.

Hesuffered asmall injury to his head and was treated by emergency-medicalservices, but according to the police report, he was not notified of the crime-victim compensation law. Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonThe N. Y. P. D. did not respond to requests for comment on this matter. Joseph Giacalone, a former N. Y. P. D. detective and a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice,said that officers may be notifying victims but not noting it on the forms.“It could be done verbally; they just forgot to check the box,” hesaid. But Brandan Davies, a criminal defense lawyer at Roth Davies,said the inconsistencies in the recordssuggest at least a lack of clarity — and perhaps a lack of care.“If an officer values the importance of their role in pursuing justice for a victim or preventing future crimes, it will be reflected in the level of attention and completeness with which the officer completes their reports,” hesaid in an email. “Similarly, if an officer personally feels there is little value or little chance ofsuccess in their pursuit of a particular crime, they are far more likely to producesubstandard or inaccurate reports.”Inseveral cases, the police reportsshow the importance of witnesses whosee crimes in action and those who call in crimes already completed likeswastika graffiti. This was an upshot in the hundreds of pages of reports about acts thought to be motivated by Jew-hatred last year. Some were individuals who took time out of their days to report antisemitic graffiti on thestreet to the police. Others were victims themselves whoswallowed their fear to makesure the police had their experiences on record. On Nov. 2, 2019, a witness observed “several persons chase after a Hassidic male and possibly assault him” in Borough Park, according to a police report. “He was able to jot down a possible license plate.”While it’s not clear if the victim himself ever came forward, with the help of this 46-year-old male witness, whose name was redacted, the police department closed the case after making an arrest in Jan. of 2020. In another case, on March 3, 2019, a 28-year-old woman left her home in Greenpoint and noticed blackswastikas in front of 113 Newell Street. She notified the police, and a month later, officers from the 94th precinct caught Glenn Merto, a white-supremacist responsible for multiple instances of antisemitic graffiti, in the act of “placing aslapsticker containing aswastika on a NYC call box.” Merto pleaded guilty to aggravated harassment and wassentenced on Nov. 12, 2020, to three years of probation, according to court recordsA 28-year-old woman left her home in Greenpoint and noticed blackswastikas in front of 113 Newell Street.

Miller’s court records were not accessible through thestate’s online portal. Without individuals like these, we would not know about the many instances of antisemitism in New York City.

171,Politicos explain Montana’s red wave,0.0,46.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/11/11/politicos-explain-montanas-red-wave/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-11,15,"3 results to continue thestate’s long tradition ofsplit-ticket politics. Instead, Republicans won everyseat on thestatewide ballot, from president tostate auditor, and expanded their majority in thestate Legislature for good measure.“I was completelyshocked,”said Rep. Barbara Bessette, one ofseveral Democratic lawmakers unseated last week in Cascade County, referring to the lopsided Republican wins there. The decisive victories across many countiessurprised more than just Democrats.“I was assurprised at the margins as everyone else,”said Jeff Essmann, a formerstate lawmaker and GOP party chairman from Billings. Essmann noted that when hestarted in thestate Legislature in 2005, Cascade County was dominated by Democrats. In the 2004 election, Cascade County voters choseseven Democrats and two Republicansto represent them in the Montana House. This year, everystate representative elected in the county is Republican. Great Falls isn’t the only place in thestate where Republicans madesignificant gains this year. Preliminary vote countsshow Republican Gov.-elect Greg Gianforte having beaten Democrat Mike Cooney by nearly 13 percentage points across thestate — roughly thesame margin by which Matt Rosendale took the U. S. Houseseat in his race against Kathleen Williams. Incumbent U. S. Sen. Steve Daines won his race against Gov. Steve Bullock by aslightlysmaller butstillsubstantial 10%. In the down-ballot races for attorney general,secretary ofstate,state auditor andsuperintendent of public instruction, Republicans beat Democratic candidates by margins ranging from eight to 20 percentage points. Only one Democrat,superintendent of public instruction candidate Melissa Romano, managed to keep the gap between her and her GOP opponent, incumbentsuperintendent Elsie Arntzen, tosingle digits. Montana voters have historically been ticketsplitters — reliablysupporting Republican presidential candidates over the past two decades, but often choosing Democrats for other offices. In 2004, for example, thestate backed Republican President George W. Bush by more than 20 percentage points even as it elected Democrat Brian Schweitzer governor. Voters that year alsosent Republican Rep. Denny Rehberg back to Washington, D. C. by 30 points while picking Democrats toserve assuperintendent of public Instruction andstate auditor by 10-point margins. But recent presidential elections, with Donald Trump atop the ticket, haveseen Montana turn more red. In 2016, Gov. Bullock was the only Democrat to win astatewide race. This year, Republicans not only won everystatewide race on the ballot, they didso by hefty margins. Longtime political watcherssay the Republican dominance in 2020 can be attributed to a combination of factors.“It’s not what the Republicans did right. It’s what the Democrats did bad,”said one Republican official who requested anonymity to comment candidly. “It was kind of the perfectstorm that just kicked theshit out of them.”In interviews with Montana Free Press, nearly a dozen elected officials, campaignstrategists, and political analysts described what they believe are the reasons behind the results, citing the popularity of President Trump and national attacks against the Democratic Party and the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic fallout and the ways in which the virus complicated campaignstrategy. Throughout the general campaign, Montana Democrats faced aslew of negative messaging that aligned them with divisive national figures and issues. One attack ad against Bullockfeatured a narratorsaying the candidate wassupported by “the liberal mob” and included images of people jumping on a police vehicle — a reference to protests against racial injustice thatswept the country thissummer. In her race for the U. S. House, Williams was depicted assupporting policies that were too “extreme” for Montanaand more ideologically aligned with California, whereshe was born. The coronavirus pandemic made it harder for candidates to defend themselves against those attacks by limiting their ability to campaign in-person, Democratssaid.“Ultimately, it was less face-to-face time,”saidstate House Minority Leader Casey Schreiner, who has represented a Great Falls districtsince 2013 and was on the ballot this year as Democrat Mike Cooney’s running mate in the race for governor. Democratic campaignsstill held in-person events,such as drive-in rallies, but decided against aggressive door-knocking and community engagement because they were worried aboutspreading the virus. Republicans, for their part,were less cautious about the virus, holding larger gatherings and rallies that allowed for more direct contact between candidates and voters. When Democratic candidates have won Montana in the past, Schreinersaid, it’s been by diligentshoe leather campaigning — talking to enough of their neighbors that they get a critical mass of voters tosee past national partisanship and cast ballots for candidates as individuals.“Forsome reason, voting for the individual didn’tseem to happen this time,” Schreinersaid. Voter turnout was also a factor in this year’s election, though not in the way that many observers expected. While Montana Democrats have historically presumed that higher voter turnout would work in their party’s favor, this year’s record turnout — 100,000 voters more than the number who cast ballots in 2016 — appears to have benefited Republicans. In his unsuccessful bid for the U. S. Senate, for example, Bullock received more than 272,000 votes, 16,000 more than he received when he won re-election as governor in 2016. But Bullock’s opponent, Daines, received more than 333,000 votes this year — nearly 78,000 more than he’d won when he was first elected to the Senate in 2014. Increased voter participation was partly due to the fact that 46 of 56 Montana counties chose to conduct all-mail elections in light of the pandemic, mailing ballots to active registered voters regardless of whether they had previouslysigned up to vote by mail. Some prominent Democrats who were involved withstatewide campaignssaid the increase in new voters likely included Montanans who were not previously engaged with politics.“Low-information, low-propensity voters. People who don’t vote all the time and people who aren’t on Twitter and not reading the newspaper and notseeking new information,”said one Democratic politician who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the election. Many of those voters, the Democratsaid, voted a ticket informed primarily by their preference for a presidential candidate who campaigned aggressively against the Democratic Party.“Trump truly has a unique way of nationalizing everything. Now there are newly engaged voters with a ballot on their doorstep. They’re going to know about Trump and not much else,” hesaid. This wave of new voters especially affected down-ballot candidates withoutsubstantial name recognition. Democrats hoping to ride the coattails of Bullock and Biden weren’t able to compete with Republicans enjoying the boosted turnout driven by Trump, Daines, and Congressman Gianforte.“I think that what we learned this election cycle is that Montana is a very conservativestate and when new people vote in this political process, they vote in a very conservative way,” the Democratsaid. Other politicians andstrategistssay the high mail-ballot turnout alone doesn’t account for the dramatic margins. Jake Eaton, a GOPstrategist who worked on the Gianforte campaign,said he believes Republicans won bysuch large margins in part because their message was compelling to independent voters and the party was effective at getting its base to turn out and vote. Internal polling data, Eatonsaid, indicated Montana voters were worried less about the health care issues Democrats focused on than about their livelihoods, particularly given the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic. Other Republicans andsome Democrats concurred, citing a perception that the Democratic Party has become increasingly disconnected from low- and middle-income people and communities.“[Democrats] kind of lost touch with who their voters have been over the years. They don’t really represent the working class voter anymore,”said Sen. Steve Fitzpatrick of Great Falls. “It’s kind of become the party of the narrow elite, highly educated people from university towns.”“To a certain degree, their base has just washed away,” he continued. “If that’s your party — rich liberals — you’re not going to win in thestate of Montana.”Asked about Fitzpatrick’s analysis, the Democrat quoted earliersaid, “I agree with all that. Of course you need a jobs message. Of course you need a working people’s message . . . it’s the economy,stupid.”Despite their failure to appeal to a winning coalition of votersstatewide, Democrats did maintainstrongsupport in university towns this year, as well as a majority of the vote in Butte andseveral counties with large Native American populations. Bullock, for example, won 64% of the vote in Missoula County and 55% of the vote in Gallatin County, around Bozeman. He also won 65% of the vote in Butte-Silver Bow County, down from 70% in 2016, as well as 70% of the 2020 vote in Glacier County, which includes most of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. With the 2020 electionseason in the rear view mirror, the Republican Party is turning its attention to the jobs Montana voters have handed its candidates:governing thestate. Democrats, for their part, are facing a journey into the political wilderness, looking to recalibrate the partyso it can compete in the next election cycle and further Montana’s legacy of purple politics. Some Democrats are hoping to change how the party organizes around thestate, making the case thatshort-term campaign cycles don’t translate tosustainedsupport or grassroots relationships.“I think it’s about empowering people to be connected to their community,”said Rep. Bessette. “And you can’t do that coming insix months before Election Day or before people get their ballot.”Bessette, who hasspent years working on public health issues andsubstance abuse prevention,saidshe wants Montana Democrats tostart thinking about political organizing in asimilar way.“We use local organizing and coalition building,”shesaid about countering drug and alcohol abuse. “You’re going to the local level because they’re the ones who know what they need … We don’t think about long-termsolutions andsustain ability [in politics]. It’sshort-term.

Shesaidshe did not know if there were ballots from otherstates.""There was mail found outside of Appleton and that mail did not include any Wisconsin ballots,"" Wolfesaid.

173,Members of the US Space Force will now be called ‘Guardians’,-0.33,50.0,https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189637/space-force-military-branch-official-name-guardians,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,25,"Members of the United States Space Forcewill officially be called “Guardians”, according to an announcement Vice President Mike Pence made at an event celebrating the military branch’s one year anniversary. The organization traces the name “Guardians” back to an old Air Force Space Command motto from 1983, “Guardians of the High Frontier,” according toashort post on the US Space Force website. While a distinct entity, Space Force is part of the Air Force per its establishment with the National Defense Authorization Act. As it exists today, Space Force is mostly a rebrand of Air Force Space Command, but with the authority to make decisions independent from the Air Force. Space Force personnel also mostly come from the Air Force, but there’s been notable transfers —like astronaut Mike Hopkins— who’ve joined from other government organizations. Unlike Hopkins’ former employer NASA, Space Force is less concerned with exploringspace, than it is controlling it and protecting American assets likesatellites. Choosing “Guardians” as an official name comes withsome unavoidable (and maybe intended) pop culture associations. There’s Disney’sfranchise, which introduced Marvel film fans to the “cosmic”side of the Marvel universe. And from the world of video games, Guardians alsoshow up again inDestiny 2as undead warriors charged with defending the Last City on Earth from alien enemies. This wouldn’t be the first time that Space Force appeared to be cribbing from pop culture, either. When the organization revealed the official logo, many pointed out itssimilarities to the Starfleet emblem used in the televisionshow. The US Space Force later attempted to clarify that it was inspired by older Air Force Space Command logos rather than the hitseries. Whatever thesource of the name, you can count on Space Force being a lot more mundane than any of the pop culture we associate with it. It may be a bit of a branding exercise tosatisfy the President, but the Biden administration appears to have no plans to change course. With Space Force and recent work to return to the moon, the US is focusing even more onspace heading into the next decade.",2,2,The Verge

Onesuch example is the work being carried out by Mint Innovation, a clean tech firm based in Auckland, New Zealand.""We've developed a biological process for recovering valuable metals from weird and wonderful feedstocks,such as electronic waste,"" Ollie Crush, the company's chiefscientific officer, told CNBC's ""Sustainable Energy.""Crush explained that Mint Innovation'ssystem involved takingscrap material and ""grinding it up into asand like consistency.""""The reason we do this is that we need to makesure that we're exposing all the metal contained within to asubsequent chemical leaching process,"" he added.""For instance, when you look at circuit boards, they've got lots of chips on them – a lot of the value is contained within those chips,so we really need to makesure it's exposed.""When it comes to recovering a valuable material like gold, the technique used by Mint Innovation – which it's described as a ""biorefining process"" – involves a number ofsteps. According to a video on its website, chemicals dissolve the powdered waste into asolution, with any materials that haven't dissolved filtered out. Microbes are then added to the mix. Gold atoms latch on to them in a process called ""selective biosorption."" Next, the microbes coated in gold are filtered, producing a paste which is ashed and then refined intosolid, ""recycled"" gold. From asustain ability perspective, the importance of extracting gold from products already in circulation is more important than one might think.""Nearly 50% of the value of e-waste comes from the gold that's used in the circuitry,"" Cameron Weber, asenior lecturer at the University of Auckland's School of Chemical Sciences,said.""In fact, there's actually more gold in e-waste as a concentration than there is in gold ore that's been mined, whichshows you the value of urban mining and being able to take … your e-waste and recycle and reusesome of the elements that are found in it,"" he added.""Andso coming up with methods for being able toseparate and recycle those will be really critical.""Looking ahead, Mint Innovation's Crush explained the process developed by the company could potentially have a number of interesting applications.""The future for Mint Innovation is to prove that our technology works with a number of different feedstocks,"" hesaid.""We've alreadyshown that it works with electronicscrap, and we're now beginning to research recovery in palladium and other metals fromscrap automotive catalytic converters,"" he added, explaining that a wide range of potential ""feedstocks"" existed.""So, we'll just keep trying tosee where our microbial process makes moresense.""",2,2,CNBC

Barely two months into the Biden presidency and we aresuddenlyseeing a concentrated campaign to convince the nation that there issomesort of major crisis unfolding at the border as thousands of undocumented migrants, many of them children, arrive insearch of asylum and opportunity. The “crisis” narrative is quickly being picked up even by usuallysomewhat objective media outlets.“There’s a newsurge of kids at the border, but the Biden administration won’t call it a crisis!” warns Zachary B Wolf at CNN.com, while Reuters announced, “Number of migrant children in U. S. border facilitiessoars amid growing crisis.” Congressional Republicans were delighted and continued pounding the message,spending the past week holding press conferences and border-wall photos hoots warning about the “Biden Border Crisis.”What's happening at the border is more than a crisis. This is human heartbreak. And it was created by the policies of President Biden.pic.twitter.com/PNUUoXy6NZ— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader)March 15, 2021The inherently negative framing of the reality that there are more people arriving than the immigrationsystem is currently capable of handling is extremely problematic in and of itself. Obsessively labeling thesituation as a “crisis” inherently designates the arrival of migrants as a negative event and flies in the face of the values we like to pretend this nation was founded on. What i tis is a problem of logistics and red tape that can and must be aggressively dealt with by the government, but it is not a “crisis.”The insistence on calling it a crisis is a reflection of the right-wing’s need to rile up xenophobes andsmear all undocumented migration as an implicit threat to economicstability and white livelihoods, ironically representing the whitesupremacist values our nation was founded on. It’s painfully clear that thestatus quo among the Very Serious News Media is that they consider undocumented migration as inherently a negative thing and that deportations, asylum rejection, and disincentivizing migration aresomehow a “moderate position.”Even worse, the media is playing into the false Republican narrative that Joe Biden’s reversal of thesadistically cruel policies of the Trump administration is being interpreted as a green light for anyone and everyone to come to the United States, because this time they know that they won’t have their children torn away from them or be dumped across the border in a Mexicanshantytown. Everyso-called “patriot” or Beltway bozo who criticizes the Biden administration for treating immigrants with a modicum of basic human decencyshould take a long look in the mirror and reflect on what it actually means to be an American and what they want this country tostand for. There is nothing moderate or good about turning our back on peopleseekingsafety and economic opportunity, especiallysince the instability and violence in their home countries can inevitably be traced back to American imperialism in the first place. Yes, there are too many people at the border for our inherently racist and cruel immigrationsystem to take care of at the moment. Much of the blame for that rests with Donald Trump, whose administration deliberately fought to create the perception of a “crisis” and thus justify the vicious “solutions” thatskull-faced freaks like Stephen Miller concocted to punish migrants forseekingsafety and opportunity in the United States. This does not make it “Biden’s fault,” nor does it change the fact that the Biden administration will not be able to flip aswitch overnight —especiallysince the outgoing Trump officials did everything they could tosabotage the incoming administration. It is true that the Biden team needs to act decisively and quickly to unstick the gears on processing immigrants and finding them good lodging, and all indicationsshow that the Biden team is working to doso. But too many “people want to emigrate to America”should never be considered a and playing into this rhetoric accomplishes nothing but promote white nationalist narratives and distortions.",0,0,Occupy Democrats

Since that fateful decision,votersuppression efforts have taken many forms, from the purging of voter rolls — asignificant factor in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election — to the elimination of polling places in historically Democratic districts to attempts to intimidate voters with threats of violence that have already been taking place in this current election to e venaslow down of the U. S. Postal Servicedelivery to prevent ballots from arriving on time to be filled out or counted. No attempt to disenfranchise voters who have already cast their ballots legally has been more blatant than the actions of the Texas Republicans who took their case trying to invalidate nearly 127,000 ballots — cast at drive-thru pollingsitesset up in order to make votingsafe during the COVID-19 pandemic in the relatively blue bastion of Harris County which includes the city of Houston — to the Texas Supreme Court. The GOP activists tried to argue that the drive-thru program was an expansion of curbside voting, and understate election lawshould only be available for voters with disabilities, despite the fact that drive-thru ballots account for about 10% of all in-person ballots cast during early voting in Harris County. The rejection of these ballots could determine the outcome of an election in Texas that has turned much more competitive than any Republican could have imagined before Donald Trump’s disastrous handling of the coronavirus pandemicsent normally reliable GOP votersscrambling for an alternative and motivated Democratic-leaning voters to rejoin a political process they may haveskipped in the last presidential election. Any hopes that these anti-democracy forces in the GOP had having the Texas Supreme Court assist them instealing the rights to have the drive-thru voters’ voices heard in this election were dashed today when the court denied their petition to have the ballots disallowed in a decision issued without a written opinion. Local election officials in Harris County rejoiced at the news.“We know that the law is on ourside,” Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins told CNN after the Supreme Court issued its ruling. “We know that weshould be protecting these votes, makingsure that all of our residents here can have their voice heard, can have theirsay in our democracy.”The citizens who have alreadysubmitted their ballots assuming that they were making valid votes arestill not assured that their votes will be counted, however. The Republican plaintiffs arestill pursuing asimilar lawsuit in federal court, hoping to get the votes thrown out by arguing that drive-thru voting violates the U. S. constitution. It will be interesting tosee how the originalists on the Supreme Court, including the recently installed Amy Coney Barrett, tackle this issue that was likely never contemplated in the horse and buggy days of our nation’s founding fathers. Suffice it tosay that any attempt to invalidate the ballots of legitimate voters — no matter how they cast their votes —simply demonstrates the fact that, despite their attempts at portraying themselves as the party of the educationally-challenged blue-collar class, the GOP is a party of elitists who are afraid to face true democracy and can only retain power for their oligarchical masters by cheating in any manner that they can and invalidating legitimate votes.

This is a lightly edited transcript. Janine Jackson:You probably aren’tsurprised to learn thatZoommade a lot of money this past year, though the fact that their profits rose more than 4,000% is remarkable. Itseems like textbook capitalism: The companysold a better mousetrap, or at least a more popular one. What, though, do we do with the fact that on its $660 million take,Zoompaidzero in federal taxes? What textbook is that from?They aren’t alone, of course; at least 55 of the country’s largest corporations paid no federal income taxes, according to new research. They’ve figured out a game, but it’s us that are getting played—not just as individuals, who have to pay our own taxes, but as a country that is constantly claiming that we can’t afford varioussocial goods, while handing billions of dollars back to companies whose profits are, after all, ultimately built on individuals and onsocial goods. Joining us now to talk about that problem is Amy Hanauer. She’s executive director at theInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy, as well asCitizens for Tax Justice. She joins us by phone from Washington, DC. Welcome toCounterSpin,Amy Hanauer. Amy Hanauer:Thank youso much, Janine. It’s great to be here. JJ: “Them that’s gotshall get” is an oldstory, but it’sstill wrong, and galling. These companies are making money hand over fist. So what’s going on? What are they doing to get out of paying federal taxes?Amy Hanauer: “we have a corporate tax code that is just riddled with loopholes that enable companies like this to get away with avoiding taxes.”AH:Yeah; thank youso much for that question. You’re right. My organization, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,foundthat 55 of the largest Fortune 500 and S&P 500 corporations paid zero in taxes despite being profitable in 2020. And, together, those 55 companies had $40.5 billion in income. If you looked at ourstatutory tax rate of 21%, you would think that they would have paid $8.5 billion, but instead they actually got $3.5 billion in rebates. And your question is, how? Well, we have a corporate tax code that is just riddled with loopholes that enable companies like this to get away with avoiding taxes, in ways that really leave regular people responsible for a largershare of our tax payments, and leave us unable to pay for the things that our communities need. JJ:Well, that’s the question. Itsounds like unfairness; it is unfairness. But is itillegal?AH:That’s a great question. Andshould you blame their accountants and their lawyers, orshould you blame Congress? And I think the responsibility lies clearly with the lawmakers who have created a tax code that enables this kind of avoidance. So we have a handful of tax loopholes that companies can use. One is, we have an unequal tax rate between profits earned overseas and profits earned here domestically. If that were made thesame, a lot of this tax avoidance could bestopped in its tracks. We have ways of compensating executives withstock options that enable companies to tell theirstockholders that they’re highly profitable and earning one thing, but then allow them to tell the IRS that they are far less profitable and earning less, and reduce what they pay in taxes as a result. So there are just a whole bunch of these kinds of loopholes. And I think it rests clearly with Congress and the president to close these loopholes and get a more rational taxsystem in place. JJ:I wanted to justsay, ITEP’s findings on corporate tax avoidance are based on available data, because thesecrecy is rather the point, and that’s part of the problem also, right?AH:That’s right. And, of course, you at FAIR have looked at this kind of issue for a long time. But we could have more transparency. We could require, particularly for those overseas earnings, we could do a lot more tosay that these corporations have to divulge more to the American public. And I think a related issue is that we could just do a lot more to empower the Internal Revenue Service to be able to enforce the tax code, because they are underfunded, and every dollar that the IRS gets results in much more than a dollar in returns to the American people. So we could be more transparent, and we could do a better job of enforcing even the laws that we have, as well as fixing these laws. JJ:Let me ask you a question about history. I know that ITEP has been measuring this for decades. So it didn’tstart with Trump, right? And also, there have been efforts to fix it, these loopholes, and how has that fared? Can you tell us a little bit about the history on this?AH:The fact is that this has been a problem for a long time, under administrations of both parties, and it also got a lot worse with the Trump tax regime. So of the 55 corporations that paid nothing, there are another 26—a 26-corporationsubset of those—that have actually paid no taxes if you take all three years of the Trump tax regime combined. And the reason is that the Trump tax law lowered the tax rate, it failed to close loopholes, and it actually made the problem of overseas tax avoidance worse in a way that theysaid they were going to make it better. So it has been a problem under both parties, but it certainly got worse with the Trump tax law. And I think that’s where weseesome potential promise for reform going forward. JJ:Let’s talk about that. Are there things concretely that could be done now? And we understand thatsometimes, you know, one measure, and then another measure, and then another—it doesn’t have to necessarily be asweeping thing. But are there things that could be done right now?AH:Absolutely. As I mentioned, we think we ought to equalize the tax rate between profits earned offshore and profits earned domestically. There’s no reason why a corporationshould be able to move jobs overseas, or move equipment overseas, and then pay a lower tax rate. There’s another challenge withdepreciation, where corporations are able to write off a lot of the costs of their equipment, and they’re able to write it off very quickly—and that’s another thing that the Trump tax law made worse. We think we ought to be able to depreciate equipment at the rate that it actually wears out, and that that’s a much more rational way of doing things. And then, as I mentioned, we could end the tax break forstock options that enables corporations tosay they earn one thing to theirshareholders andsaysomething different to the American government. So there are all of these fixes out there. And I think, actually, the Biden administration is taking quite a few of these on, in ways that are pretty encouraging, and that would be kind of a generationalshift, Janine, that would be different from anything that I think we’veseen in a long time of looking at these issues. JJ:Is there anything you would call on reporters to maybe dig into more deeply, or to jettison as frameworks? Or is there anything you would like toshift in terms of media’s way of addressing thisset of issues?AH:Yeah, absolutely. TheBiden plan raises the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%; that will make a difference. And I know there’s negotiations withsome members of Congress, and of the Senate, that may change that. He also raises the offshore tax rate. He doesn’t equalize it, which is what my researchers recommend; but he does raise it about halfway back up. So the offshore tax rate will be 21% and the overall tax rate will be 28%. And the other really great thing that I think the Biden plan does is it justsimply imposes a minimum tax,so that if your accountants and attorneys are able to identify a bunch of loopholes, youstill, as a corporation, would pay amini mum tax of 15%on your book profits. So we think that would make a big, big difference. And we definitely think it’s a ripe area for reporters to explore, because one of the challenges with our tax code is that most people don’t understand it very well, including many members of Congress. So it’s exciting that the Biden administration wants to take this on. I think that they really get that just looking around, looking at the problems that we’ve had in the United States over the past year, and then recognizing thatsome of our very most profitable corporations are not contributing to our basic needs—that just doesn’t add up, doesn’tseem right. JJ:We’ve beenspeaking with Amy Hanauer from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy and Citizens for Tax Justice. You can find them online atITEP.organdCTJ.org. Amy Hanauer, thank youso much for joining us today onCounterSpin. AH:Janine, it was great to talk to you.",1,1,FAIR

Sign up to receive our biggeststories assoon as they’re published. Years ago, before he was mayor, Bill de Blasio laid out the essence of any effort to reform the country’s largest police department. New York City needed true civilian oversight. Describing the city agency tasked with investigating police misconduct as “more of a lapdog than a watchdog,” he propose din 2009 to give it more independence, authority, and guaranteed funding. A few months later, he again pledged change,sayingin astatement, “the NYPD cannot oversee itself.”Then, in 2013, he was elected mayor. And rather than create more independence for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, he ended up asserting ever-more control over the agency, intent on avoiding conflict with the Police Department, according to internal communications obtained by ProPublica and interviews with more than two dozen current and former officials. The mayor’s office edited reports and testimony tosoften criticism of the NYPD and roll back proposals for more effective oversight. It maneuvered to blocksome of thesame policies de Blasio had advocated for years before. And when the civilian officials were faced with obstruction by the NYPD, the mayor’s office ignored their pleas forsupport. When the CCRB in a draft report two years ago noted that police were withholding footage from body-worn cameras, an aide to the mayor ordered the CCRB to take out the direct reference to the department: “Let’ssimplify and remove the acronym ‘NYPD.’”New Yorkers and others haveseen de Blasio’sdeferenceto the police play out on the publicstage, perhaps most infamously when he defended NYPD’s response to lastsummer’s racial justice protests. But the internal accountsshow how City Hall worked behind thescenes to protect the NYPD fromscrutiny. De Blasio will leave office at the end of the year, and his administration has defended his efforts to improve police oversight, telling ProPublica that while the CCRB “was left to languish under previous administrations, it’s clear this mayor took a different approach.” But his record is a warning to the field of candidates vying tosucceed him. They too are facing both calls for racial justice and concerns about crime, which has risen in New York over the past year as it has in other cities. Rather thanseeking toslash thesize of the police force, many candidates have echoed the promise de Blasio once made to institute genuine civilian oversight of a department that has long chafed at it. Some of the leading candidates in this month’s mayoral primary haveseen that resistance up close, including Eric Adams, a former NYPD commander who often criticized the department; Scott Stringer, the city comptroller; and Maya Wiley, the onetime head of the CCRB under de Blasio. Wiley, who was the mayor’s chief legal adviser before joining the CCRB in July 2016, has made police reform a central part of her campaign platform. But after de Blasio chose her to chair the agency, the CCRBshifted toward tighter mayoral control. During Wiley’s tenure, the office removed recommendations from adraftreportthat faulted the NYPD’s use of Tasers after City Hall objected to the findings. After The New York Times revealed the changes, Wileydefendedthem. City Hall’s grip continued after Wiley left in thesummer of 2017. When hersuccessor wasscheduled to ask a city commission for more oversight power in late 2018, the mayor’s office intervened and canceled the testimony. As one agency official informed a colleague in a text: “City Hall put the kibosh on it.”“Every testimony, every report, every hearing was completely controlled by what City Hall wanted or didn’t want,”said Nicole Napolitano, who was asenior policy analyst for the agency. The goal was to give a “veneer of accountability.”Napolitano and three others at the agency who pushed for more aggressive oversight were let go last November in what the mayor’s office described as a reorganization and a “step forward.” (In alawsuit, Napolitano and the others argue they were fired in retaliation for raising concerns about the agency’s independence, which theysay was a violation of their freespeech; the city isseeking to dismiss the case, arguing the concerns weren’t protectedspeech.)Astatementprovided by City Hallspokesperson Avery Cohen noted that a recent administration proposal would consolidate police oversight agencies under the CCRB, andsaid edits of reports and testimony were just part of the governing process.“On matters of police accountability, as with any issue that requires the cooperation of multiple agencies, City Hall is always in dialogue with both the NYPD and CCRB,” thestatementsaid. “All our work with CCRB has been done to achieve ourshared goal of greater police oversight and accountability.”In astatement to ProPublica, current CCRB chair Rev. Frederick Daviesaid that the agency has repeatedly advocated forstrengthening oversight. “We will continue to work together — and disagree with — the NYPD and the Mayor’s Office,” Daviesaid. Wiley, through her campaign, declined to be interviewed; aspokesperson pointed to the candidate’s recent defense of her tenure at the CCRB. For decades, the NYPD has been the most powerful fiefdom in city government. With a $5.4 billion budget and a direct line to the mayor, the NYPD operates with far more independence than other city departments. External oversight has expanded in recent years, with the creation of an inspector general and the appointment of a court-mandated monitor. And prosecutors, working with the FBI and NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau, are responsible for investigating potential criminal conduct by officers. But it’s the CCRB that thousands of people turn to every year to lodge complaints against officers for everything from offensive language to police brutality. Under the city charter, it’s an “independent” office charged with conducting “complete, thorough and impartial” investigations of police misconduct. That mandate, though, belies the agency’s limited powers. It is governed by a board that is effectively controlled by the mayor through his appointees and those of his police commissioner. And when the CCRB doessubstantiate a complaint, it can only recommend discipline to the NYPD. (In astatement to ProPublica, the NYPDsaid it is committed to oversight: “We fullysupport the CCRB.”)Through de Blasio’s nearly eight years in office, even as public concern about police misconduct mounted, the CCRB has remained on the margins of efforts to investigate and reform policing in New York. While others in city andstate government have issuedstingingfindingsabout the NYPD’s conduct during lastsummer’s protests, the agency tasked with investigating complaints about officers’ misconduct has largelystayedsilent. Mina Malikserved for two years as the agency’s executive director, resigning five months into Wiley’s tenure as board chair. Shesaid that during her time there, “it became clear that City Hall hassignificant influence over the CCRB and its operations.” That’s not howshe thinks itshould work. “It is vital for any police oversight agency to be independent and free from political influence or police control.”For many of those who were drawn to a mayor whose campaign had taken off with an ad where his biracialsonspeaks about racial injustice, de Blasio’s increasingly vocal defense of the NYPD has been mystifying. But long before he was elected mayor, de Blasio hadseen up close the political risks of being the boss of the Police Department. De Blasio first worked in City Hall about 30 years ago, under Mayor David Dinkins, who inheritedsoaring crime rates and deep distrust of the NYPD, especially among Black people. After Dinkins moved the CCRB out from under the management of the NYPD, thousands of off-duty officersstormed Lower Manhattan,taking over the Brooklyn Bridge and deriding Dinkins, the city’s first Black mayor, as a “washroom attendant.”“It was a formative experience” for de Blasio, recalled one former top aide who worked with the mayor over two terms, and who, like others,spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing their continued connections to him. “I heard him talk about it many times.”Dinkins ended up brushing aside the police riot and implemented his plan to createstronger civilian oversight. But he also ended up a one-term mayor. The lesson de Blasio took from the experience was that a mayorshould “keep conflict with cops to a minimum,” the former aidesaid. “The orientation toward CCRB was, ‘Don’t have them cause problems for the Police Department.’”After he was elected, de Blasio did deliver on a promise to drop the city’s appeal of a federal court ruling against the NYPD over how it used“stop-and-frisk” tacticsinBlack and Latino communities. But De Blasio alsosought tosend asignal to those who worried his agenda would threaten the city’s progress in reducing crime. The mayor enlisted the country’smost well-knowncop, William Bratton, to return to New York to lead the department, which he had done two decades earlier under Mayor Rudolph Gulliani. While Bratton gave the new mayor a measure of credibility on policing, it came with a price, according toseveral of those who worked with both of them. Bratton ran the department “completely independently,”said Richard Emery, who was de Blasio’s first chair of the CCRB.(Bratton, who retired from the NYPD in 2016, declined to be interviewed or to respond to questions from ProPublica. In a recently published memoir, he writes that de Blasio wassupportive of the police and backed his efforts as commissioner.)It was through Bratton that de Blasio picked Emery. He was a high-profile lawyer who routinelysued the city on behalf of people alleging civil rights violations by the NYPD. He was also friendly with Bratton. When de Blasio held a press conference on July 17, 2014, announcing Emery as head of the board, the mayor underscored the need for change, just as he had a few years before. “This is a chance to get it right,” hesaid. “This is the first time we’re actually going to get tosee a CCRB function properly. And I think it’s going to be a breath of fresh air. ”Thatsame day, NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo tried to arrest Eric Garner in Staten Island and ended up putting him in a chokehold. Garner’s friend Ramsey Orta filmed the encounter, leading the world to hear Garner cry, “I can’t breathe”11 times before he died. While the district attorney’s office in Staten Island began to consider criminal charges against Pantaleo, the CCRB also began digging in, and itseemed like the agency might have a moment. “The CCRB had never done anything even remotely as important or high-profile” as the Garner case, Emery recalled. “It would bolster the integrity and reputation of the agency if it were done right.”The agency initially made progress. The NYPD allowed CCRB investigators complete access to internal records in the case, which they’d rarely had in other cases. But after a grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, de Blasio found himself once again in no-man’s land, trying to address residents’ pain and anger without losing his grip on the Police Department. In an emotional address at a press conference about the grand jury’s decision, de Blasio talked about how he and wife had had to “literally train” their teenageson Dante to “takespecial care” with officers. The police unions excoriated the mayor’s comments, which came amid protests following the killing of not only Garner but also Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. De Blasio had thrown officers “under the bus,”said Patrick Lynch, the head of the city’s largest police union. Less than two weeks after the mayor’s remarks, a 28-year-old man, who had traveled to Brooklyn from Maryland and posted onsocial media about police killings, walked up to an NYPD car, andshot and killed the two officers inside, and then killed himself minutes later.“There’s blood on many hands tonight,”saidLynch.“That blood on the handsstarts on thesteps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor.”When the mayor laterspoke at a memorialservice for the two officers, hundreds of officers turned their backs on him. When de Blasio went to pay his respects at a funeral home, officers aga inturned their backs on him.“It crushed him,” recalled one of the aides who was often with him then. “I remember his whole demeanor changing. It also got to his worst fear. The Dinkins thing, looking like you have lost control.”Indeed, as the fallout from the Garner case intensified, Emerysaid hesensed that de Blasio had “far more fear of the Police Department.”When Legal Aid lawyerssued to obtain limited disciplinary records for the officer who killed Garner and a judge backed the request. Emery had wanted the CCRB to release at leastsome of the requested records, which weresimilar to records the agency had released about other officers. But the city appealed the ruling and prevailed in blocking release of the records. It was the first of multiple moves under de Blasio in which the city and NYPDblocked access to disciplinary records that had long been available in the past. De Blasio and others argued that they weresimply following astate law, known as 50a, and that thesolution lay in changing thestatute, which has long been invoked toshield records about policeofficers. But de Blasio opposed repealing the law. “He was a huge impediment on 50a,”said the former aide who worked with de Blasio across two terms. “I don’t know how many memos we wrote him about why 50ashould be repealed. And we’d talk to him and he’d twist himself into a pretzel.”Thesummary of Pantaleo’s record eventually did come out, after a CCRBstaffer leaked i tin 2017. Thestaffer was forced to resign that week. At the time, Pantaleo wasstill on the force and had not faced any discipline. The U. S. Justice Department had launched its own investigation, and, as wasstandard practice, the CCRB put its investigation on hold. Emery thought he had a workaround. If the CCRB were granted access to the minutes of the Staten Island grand jury, the testimony, which by law issecret, might allow the CCRB to move ahead without interfering with the federal investigation. When CCRB’s motion for the minutes was rejected by a judge, Emery issued astatement calling the decision “plainly erroneous” and promising to appeal. Instead, the city’s lawyersstepped in andstopped the CCRB from appealing. As Emery continued to be outspoken, he drew the ire of police unions. When unions complained that he had a conflict of interest, Emeryrespondedthat they were “squealing like astuck pig.” That landed him on the cover of the New York Daily News and the editorial page of the New York Post, which called for his ouster: “Cop-hating CCRB Chief Must Go.”De Blasio ended up accepting Emery’s resignation two months later, after Emery wassued by Malik and anotherstaffer who alleged he had madesexist remarks. (He denied the allegations and thesuit was droppedsoon after he quit.)With Emery gone, the mayor decided to turn to his own inner circle, appointing one of his closest aides, Wiley, to lead an agency whose independence the mayor hadsaid was crucial. The daughter of civil rights activists, Wiley hadspent two and a half years as de Blasio’s in-house legal counsel, advising him on what turned out to be controversial decisions regardingfundraisingandother issues. When Wiley had her firstseniorstaff meeting at the CCRB in thesummer of 2016, people there remember her as being friendly but far more circumspect than Emery.“I asked Maya what her plan was on getting NYPD records, because Richard had finally gotten the CCRB tostart getting them, andshe wouldn’t give a clear answer,” recalled Winsome Thelwell, who at the time oversaw the agency’s investigators. (Thelwell, who worked at the agency for 25 years, is one of the four formerstafferssuing after being let go in November.)Wileysoon found herself dealing with a report that City Hall had already objected to. In early 2016, the CCRB completed a draft report about officers’ use of Tasers, which the NYPD was beginning to roll out more widely. Theoriginal report documented a number of troubling findings: The CCRB found that in nearly a third of the roughly 150 cases it looked at, officers used Tasers on people already in custody; it found almost all of the Taser uses involved unarmed civilians, the majority of whom were Black. As the CCRB was preparing to release the report in March of 2016, the agency followed its practice ofsharing the draft with City Hall.“They were upset right away,” recalled Janos Marton, who was an analyst at the CCRB and the primary author of the report. “The mayor’s office’s response was toshelve it.” (The mayor’s officesaid that its review of CCRB’s draft reports “in no way compromises the independence of the agency.”)Marton had gotten another job offer andsoon quit. But hesaid the report was “one of my babies,”so he kept checking on its progress. In mid-May, the CCRB’s interim chair was asked at a board meeting why the report hadn’t been published and replied that it would be released “in the next couple of weeks.” That didn’t happen. Instead, a New York Daily Newsstoryin June revealed the existence of the report and quoted unnamed NYPD officials criticizing it. When Wiley became chair of the board in July, the report wasstill under wraps. She was asked about it at board meetings in September and in October, according to the meeting transcripts. It was finally published late in October, on a Sunday, and without an accompanying press release. The report also removed recommendations for the NYPD, including one proposal to ban officers from using Tasers on people in handcuffs. As DraftedAs PublishedWiley latersaidshe accepted “full responsibility” for the delay. In a board meeting,shes aid the report was of limited value because it included relatively few cases. She defended her edits: “Istand by the report that we finalized and got out there.”In response to questions, Julia Savel, a campaignspokesperson, referred ProPublica to Wiley’s past defense of her role editing and overseeing the release of the Taser report, including her position that the report didn’t contain enough data to justify its conclusions. Savel also pointed to Wiley’s 2017 role in pushing the agency’s board to refer the case against Pantaleo, the officer who put Garner in a fatal chokehold, to the NYPD. Pantaleo eventually faced a departmental disciplinary hearing in 2019 and was fired from the force after an NYPD judge found he’d violated department rules. Manystaffers inside the CCRB perceived Wiley and her top aides as being too close to City Hall. In late September 2016, Malik, a lawyer and the agency’s executive director, wrote to board members that Wiley wasseeking to hire her former chief ofstaff at City Hall in a manner that “could compromise the integrity of our agency.”Wiley wanted to hire her ex-aide to a newly createdsenior position that would give the aide effective day-to-day control of the agency — Malik’s role — even though Wiley’s formerstaffer had missed the window to apply, em ailsshow. Wiley prevailed. And two weeks latershe emailed the agency’sstaff about the hiring. The email noted that Wiley and two other board members formed asubcommittee “to intervene andselect the candidate.” About a month later, Malik left the CCRB to teach at Harvard Law School. Later on in Wiley’s tenure, another agencystaffer raised concerns about the agency’s ties to City Hall. In March 2017, astaffer who had filed a complaint about unrelated wrongdoing by other agency officials told investigators from the city’s anti-corruption agency that Wiley and her top aides were taking direction from the mayor’s office and improperlysharing media inquiries and public records requests, according to officials and records. The investigators,sent by the Department of Investigation’s inspector general for the NYPD, looked into the allegations but ultimately couldn’t confirm them, aspokesperson for the agencysaid. Wileyleftthe CCRB after 13 months, explaining thatshe needed more time to focus on her work in The New School, whereshe had been teaching and leading asocial justice office. City Hall’s influence continued. Napolitano, the former CCRB policy expert, experienced it firsthand. She joined the agency in the fall of 2017 just a few months after Wiley left. One of the firstsubjectsshe turned to was body-worn cameras. A federal judge had ordered the NYPD to use them as part of a landmark ruling in 2013 that found the department’sstop-and-frisk tactics were discriminatory and unconstitutional. The cameras have become a critical part of police oversight. If CCRB investigators have footage, they are more likely to get to the bottom of a case. But Napolitano learned that though the NYPD was rolling out the cameras to patrol officers, it wasslow toshare the footage with the CCRB. Napolitano and others pushed for asolution thatsome other cities have adopted: civilian investigatorsshould have direct access to recordings. City Hall and the Police Department rejected the idea. The NYPD, in turn, became even worse atsharing footage. In August 2019, CCRB officials proposed noting in an annual city report that its investigations were being delayed because the NYPD wasn’t turning over body-worn camera footage. The report is meant to givestatus updates about all agencies. An introduction describes it as an opportunity to “hold ourselves accountable.”An assistant to the mayor kept a reference to the delay but cut out the explanation that the NYPD was the reason for it. She wrote that the report wasn’t the place “for one agency to call out or point fingers at theslowness or inaction of other agencies,” a policy the mayor’s office told ProPublica “is universal to agencies across the board.”As DraftedAs PublishedThatsame month, the CCRB finally prosecuted Officer Pantaleo in a departmental tribunal court, leading to his firing. The agency’s chair by then was Davie. Like de Blasio’s previous picks, he came with civil rights bona fides — and close ties to the mayor. Heofficiated at de Blasio’s wedding. Davie wrote anop-edfor The Washington Post lauding Pantaleo’s firing, concluding that the ruling was “evidence that civilian oversight of police works.”The op-ed prompted as harp email from the mayor’s then presssecretary, Freddi Goldstein, with thesubject header, “What is this?”“Don’t remember ever giving approval for this let alone being asked,” Goldstein wrote. (Goldstein mistakenly CC’d a reporter at the Gotham Gazette, whoshared the email with ProPublica.)Asked about the email, Goldstein, who left City Hall last year, told ProPublicashe wassurprised tosee the op-ed in printsince it wasstandard practice for all city agencies to discuss upcomingstories with the mayor’s office.“I do think that we tried to besensitive” to the agency’s independence,shesaid. “But I do think we expected them to give us a heads-up when things were happening.”A month later, Davie again ran afoul of the mayor’s office. He wasset to testify before thestatesenate, where a bill to finally repeal the 50asecrecy law was being considered. As chair of the CCRB, Davie was going to call for an end to the law. “If New York is indeedsincere about our commitment to transparency in policing, we must repeal 50-a,” Davie planned tosay, according to hisdrafttestimony. But the mayor’s office objected. “City Hall was adamantly against it,” recalled Napolitano, who worked on the draft. Shesaid Davie’s testimony, along with planned remarks from an NYPD official, were canceled just minutes before the hearing. Aspokesperson told ProPublica the mayor was “not involved.”After the New York Postreportedthat the mayor’s office hadscuttled the testimony, Davie did testify a week later,softening his call for repeal and explaining it was just his opinion. As DraftedAs DeliveredA few months later, Davie organized a lettersigned by other CCRB board members calling for repeal. A City Hallspokesperson at the time disavowed the letter,saying it didn’t represent the agency’s official position. Lastsummer,state legislators repealed the law. When de Blasio first pushed forstronger oversight for the NYPD more than a decade ago, he recognized the importance of independent funding. Heproposedthat the CCRB’s budget beset to a fixed percentage of the NYPD’s,so the agency would “never besubject to politically charged budget negotiations.”Two years ago, there was an opportunity to make that reality. A commission had been convened to propose reforms to the city’s charter, including rules on police oversight. Like other agencies, the CCRB prepared recommendations in the fall of 2018, including the idea de Blasio had once advanced about the budget. But as one agency official had text ed a colleague, the proposals prompted a “fight” with the mayor’s office and City Hall “put the kibosh” on the planned testimony. After push back from police-reform advocates, the CCRB did offer its proposals to the commission the nextspring. But the agencystruggled to findsupport, including from the mayor’s appointees to the commission. One commission member who pushed for independent CCRB budgeting recalled having to drop the idea tosecuresupport fora nother proposal to bolster the agency. It was “baffling,”said Sateesh Nori, who had been appointed by the city’s elected public advocate. The commission ended up endorsing apropos alt hat linked the CCRB’s head count to thesize of the NYPD, but did not guarantee a budget. It also allowed the mayor to ignore the head count provision based on “fiscal necessity.” Voters approved the proposal in November 2019. Four months later, the CCRB prepared testimony to the City Council requesting money for a “public education campaign”so more New Yorkers would know where to go with complaints about police. City Hall cut the request, arguing that a unit within the agency dedicated to outreach was alreadysufficiently funded. (Here is the final testimony.) Currently, the CCRB has a roughly $20 million budget and about 200 employees. By thatsummer, there was a push inside the agency toswiftly complete investigations into the Police Department’s aggressive response to the racial justice protests that hadswept the city after George Floyd’s killing. But investigators were overwhelmed by hundreds of complaints andstymied by alack of cooperation by the NYPD under Commissioner Dermot Shea, who had been appointed to the top job by de Blasio in December 2019. As of Wednesday, the CCRB had brought charges against 11 officers. Last September, the CCRB was going to note in a report another reason for the delays. Some officers had covered their badge numbers, making it hard to identify them. City Hallsoftened the wording tosay there had just been allegations of badges being covered. When Napolitano objected, CCRB general counsel Matthew Kadushin replied: “Nicole – Please make the changes that City Hall recommended.” (Kadushin did not reply to a request for comment.)Read MoreTwo months later, Napolitano and three othersenior CCRBstaffers were called for video meetings with two agency officials. Napolitano and the others were told they were being let go and that their access to agency em ails and records was being cut off. When Napolitano asked why, one officialsaid they couldn’t discuss it but that the agency was “restructuring.” In astatement at the time, board chair Daviesaid the moves were made to “address redundancies.”Napolitano had voted for de Blasio multiple times, including as her local council member. She had joined city governmentsoon after he was elected, believing in his message that building trust in the NYPD was critical and could lead to more effective policing. “I was hopeful,”she recalled. Despite everything, Napolitanosaidshestill has hope. For real change to happen, people “need to understand how thesystem really works.”Has the NYPD Stopped a Teen You Know?

Cori Bushwas raped at a church camp as a teenager. A month later,she realizedshe was pregnant andsought out an abortion,shesaid at a hearing Thursday.“I knew it was a decision I needed to make for myself,so I did,”said the Missouri Democrat, who called it the hardest decisionshe ever made. “Today, Isit before you as that nurse, and as a pastor, activist,survivor,single mom, and congresswoman to testify that in thesummer of 1994, I was raped, became pregnant, and chose to have an abortion.”Bush was one of four congresswomen testifying about deeply personal connections during a tense House Oversight and Reform hearing Thursday aboutstate restrictions on abortion in light of a new Texas law banning almost allsuch procedures. Bushsaidshe mostly kept the experience to herself, asentimentshared by the two other Democrats whospoke about their abortions. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., firstspoke publicly about her abortion in 2019. On Thursday,she was candid about itssignificance in her life.“For me, terminating my pregnancy was not an easy choice, but it was my choice. And that is what must be preserved, for every pregnant person,”shesaid. “Today, I am testifying before you because I want you to know that there areso many differentsituations that people face in making these choices.”Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus Co-ChairBarbara Lee, D-Calif., alsospoke about her experience having a “back-alley” abortion as a teenager in the mid-1960s.“My personal experienceshaped my beliefs to fight for people’s reproductive freedom,”shesaid. Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., approached the topic from a different perspective — as the child ofsomeone whose doctors and family encouraged an abortion but decided not to follow through with it.“I would not be here were it not for the very brave choice my mother made 33 years ago,”shesaid. “Because of herstrength,she chose life. That wasn’t an easy decision for asingle mom, a working-class mom.”The House Oversight and Reform hearing came a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee held asimilar hearing on the legal ramifications of a controversial Texas law. On Sept. 1, thestate implemented a law that bans almost all abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. The law essentially guts the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade, legalscholarssay. ChairwomanCarolyn B. Maloney, D-N. Y.,saidshe felt compelled to hold this hearing, two years after asimilar one onstate abortion laws.“If we do nothing, the consequences will not be limited to Texas,”shesaid, adding that otherstates are on the path to follow Texas’ example with copycat laws. The Texas ban incentivizes lawsuits against individuals who aid in an abortion, which could include a variety of health care workers or anyone who provides transportation to an appointment. Republicans criticized the hearing and questioned the committee’s jurisdiction overstate laws. GOP lawmakers also defendedstates’ rights to pass their own restrictions.“What the hell is going on here today? We don’t have oversight overstate abortion rights. This is not the purpose of this committee,”said Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S. C. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N. C., called it a “solemn duty” to oppose the expansion of abortion.“Instead of glorifying this awful act of desperation, we ought to grieve for the tens of millions of Americans who never have a chance to take their first breath,”shesaid. “We live in asociety that mistakes choice for liberty and denies the dignity of unborn life.”Democratsspoke in favor of two bills that would expand abortion rights. The first is a House-passed bill by Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., that would expand abortion protections for providers and patients, limitingstate-level restrictions. The Senate placed the bill on its calendar Wednesday. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas-based obstetrician-gynecologist and board member of the Physicians for Reproductive Health abortion rights group, called the bill “an important and criticalstep, but it is not enough.”“We need legislation that will protect pregnant people and birthing people in all of their decisionsso they can live their healthiest lives,”shesaid. Chu also testified insupport of her bill, which no House Republicans voted for last week. Thesecond bill, also from Lee, would require federal health care programs to cover abortion and require access to abortion in federal health facilities. It would also allow qualified health insurance plans to use premium tax credits and cost-sharingsubsidies to cover abortion-related costs. Lee also mentioned hersexual education bill, whichshesaid was necessary to providestudents with comprehensive knowledge to limit unintended pregnancies. A discussion over whether abortion lawsshould include exceptions for rape and incest became intense. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., called out the minority witness Ingrid Skop, a Texas-based member of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists and associatescholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, over hersupport of the Texas law. He asked her ifshe would accept her daughter hypothetically having an abortion ifshe were to be raped.“There’s adequate time in this law for a woman who’s been raped to discover ifshe’s pregnant and, ifshe wants to terminate the pregnancy,she has time to do it,” Skopsaid. The two volleyed back and forth, with Krishnamoorthi concluding by calling the witness’ replies “unresponsive.”Foxx called the questioning “disrespectful” and Mace called it “offensive and disgusting.”On the otherside, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezof New York, questioned Skop’sstatement.“Six weeks pregnant is two weeks late for one’s period. When you are raped, you don’t always know what happened to you. Ispeak about this as asurvivor,”shesaid. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., asked every witness if they think the lawshould be changed nationallyso that women and girls who are rapedshould be forced to bear their rapist’s child. Maleeha Aziz, a community organizer with the Texas Equal Access Fund; Melissa Murray, a New York University School of Law professor; Loretta Ross, a co-founder of the reproductive justice movement and Smith College associate professor; activist Gloria Steinem; and Moayedisaid no.“I think the answer is obvious because myson had a complicated life getting to know his pedophile father,”said Ross, who talked earlier about her experience being raped at 14 by a married older cousin and not having the option to have an abortion. Skop alsosaidshe did not want the law changed, but for different reasons.“No, I don’t want tosee the law changed. I want tosee people’s hearts and minds changed about this unborn human,”shesaid.",2,2,Roll Call

Despite Blake’s incapacitation—and his clear need to continue to receive treatment—his fathersays Blake is currently handcuffed to his hospital bed. Blake’s father, also named Jacob Blake,shared the detail withCNNon Thursday. The younger Blake isstill recovering from gunshot wounds to hisspinal cord, liver and kidney at a Wauwatosa, Wisconsin hospital, where he has beensince beingshot on Sunday night. Blake’s fathersaid he was “heartbroken” tosee hissonshackled to his hospital bed. His uncle, Justin Blake, called it “insult to injury.”“He is paralyzed and can’t walk and they have him cuffed to the bed,” hesaid. “Why?”No oneseems to have an answer, though the practice ofshackling those instate custody—even as they receive critical medical care—has a long history in this country, and it isstill ongoing. For instance, guards from local andstate prisons and jailsstills hackle pregnant incarcerated women while they give birth. At a press conference on Thursday, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Everssaid he had “no personal understanding why [the handcuffing] would be necessary.”“I would hope that we would be able to find a more—a better way to help him ... in recovering,” Everssaid. “Thatseems counterintuitive. Itseems to be bad medicine.”The practice, of course, isn’t intended to help the detained person in any way. Ostensibly, it’s to prevent people who are of interest to, or in custody of, thestate from “escaping”—logic be damned. What it explicitly does is reinforce ownership. Blake—and the many other Black men and women who haveshared this cruel experience—is being treated likestate property. Blake has been hospitalized for five days because of actions undertaken by Kenosha police officers; he may very well never walk again because of the choices those cops made. But the handcuffs holding Blake to his bed make clear what Kenosha police and the district’s attorney intend for him once he recovers adequately. More chains.: The handcuffs have been removed and the warrant that led to Blake beingshackled to his hospital bed has been vacated, his attorney, Patrick Cafferty, toldCNN. From CNN:Kenosha County Sheriff’s Departmentspokesman Sgt.

Wouldmass transit take a hit as individuals opt for personal transportation? Would carsales boom in the following years? We don't have clear answers yet, but asnapshot of data at least gives ussome indication of the pandemic's affect in the near-term. According to a report from theNew York Times, citing data from the Department of Motor Vehicles, car registrations jumped 37% between August and October of last year in New York. You know, the city that was famed for congestion and vehicle traffic even before the pandemic. The 37% rise includes the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, but breaking the data outshows an even more intriguing picture. In Manhattan alone, new car registrations rose 76% and in Brooklyn, registrations climbed 45%. That's aserious amount of new vehicles roaming around tight citystreets, and the Times report highlighted the problem that brings with available parkingspaces. With more cars, parking quicklystarted to vanish, especially as city authorities began convertingstreets, parking lots and other areas into large outdoor diningspaces to try and compensate for tight restrictions on indoor dining. On the flipside, proponents for more mass transit and cycling lanes underscored now is the time to fix the problem for good as we hopefully begin to put the pandemic in the rear view this year. Additional cycling lanes and room for other forms of transport can allow people to move more freely throughout the city. But advocates willstill need to convince the thousands of new local vehicles owners first.",2,2,CNET

The consequences of that extreme heat can besevere: a new NPR/Columbia Journalism School investigation found that at least 384 workers have died from environmental heat exposure in the last decade.

""Without additional protections, the risks to workers will only grow in the decades ahead as climate change worsens, leaving the roughly 32 million outdoor workers in our country to face a brutal choice: their health or their jobs.""The report also projects asevere economic toll, with the average outdoor worker losing more than $1,700 each year because of workstoppages on days when heat and humidity top 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends employers reduce workschedules.

S. outdoor workers identify as African American, Black, Hispanic or Latino, according to the report, and they could lose $23 billion in annual earnings by 2065 if no action is taken to reduce emissions. The finding mirrors previous research that hasshown that residents of low-income areas and communities of color in American cities endure far higher temperatures than people who live in whiter, wealthier areas. Kristina Dahl, a UCSsenior climatescientist and and an author of the report,said instatement that existing inequities faced by people of color, including ""increased exposure to air pollution, lack of access to quality health care and adequate cooling, and under fundedsocialservices,"" can compound the impact of extreme heat. Migrant workers,shesaid, including those in the country illegally, are especially at risk. In addition to the heightened risks posed by climate change, the UCS report highlights the lack of federal worker protections as a major issue for workersafety. As NPR has previously reported, at least a dozen companies have had multiple employees die from environmental heat exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not adopted a national heatstandard tosafeguard workers and often decides not to penalize companies for worker deaths. The report's authors call for a number of policy changes, including adapting workerschedules to coincide with cooler times of day and lessening overall workloads. Employers, the reportsays,should also implement mandatory heatsafety plans, heat monitoring and reporting requirements, and multilingual training forsupervisors and workers to facilitate better and faster responses to dangers imposed by extreme heat.""We know this risk is worsening and hassignificant implications for workers, employers and the broader economy,so we need to be prepared,"" Lickersaid. Regulation and adaptation alone will not be enough to address the problems faced by workers as long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to warm the planet. The projections in the UCS report, though, are based on ascenario thatseems increasingly less likely: a constant level of emissions through mid-century. That projection would place the world far out ofstep with the goalsset by the Paris Agreement — a commitmentsigned by nearly all of the world's countries whichseeks to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F). As part of the deal, the United States has pledged to halve its emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Other countries havesetsimilar targets. Right now, though, few of the world's biggest economies, including the U. S., are on track to meet those goals —something the report's authorssay needs to change.""To limit future extreme heat, the United States must urgently contribute to global efforts to effectively constrain heat-trapping emissions by investing in just and equitablesolutions that get us to net-zero emissions no later than 2050,"" Lickersaid.",2,2,NPR
186,A Nightmare COVID Winter Could Force a GOP Awakening on Stimulus,-12.33,38.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/a-dark-covid-winter-could-force-gop-to-make-deal-on-stimulus.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2020-11-14,25,"The number of Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 is higher now that it has ever been. Theseven-day moving average of confirmed cases in the United States is 40,444 cases higher today than it was one week ago. Hospitalsystems inseveralstates are underseverestress. Utah and North Dakota have begun to exhaust their limited capacity of hospital beds. And winter has not even begun. Barringsome great good fortune — or the rapid dissemination of a working vaccine — the next few months could be the most difficult of the pandemic thus far for the U. S. writ large. Across the northern hemisphere, the not-so-novel coronavirus is exhibiting clearsigns ofseasonality. The bugseems tospread more easily in cold dry air and when humans are huddled indoors,sharingspaces with limited ventilation. Meanwhile, winter is alsoshattering the fragile accommodations that manysmall businesses have made to the pandemic. Summer offered restaurants and bars relatively comfortable andsafe conditions forserving their customers (when the rain was at bay). And by keeping case growth within certain regional and epidemiological bounds, the warmer months also enabled businesses in many fortunate areas — those with high levels of public-healthskepticism and low levels of infection — to operate atsomething approximating normal capacity. Thissaid, even during a favorableseason — and before the CARES Act’s direct and indirectsupports forsmall businesses were depleted —tens of thousands of firms closed their doors. Thesane response to thisstate of affairs was, oddly enough, articulated bysomeone in proximity to presidential power on Wednesday. Dr. Michael Osterholm, a pandemic adviser to President-elect Joe Biden,suggestedthat Congress could establish open-ended wage and revenue replacement for workers, firms, andsub-federal governments for four tosix weeks — during which the nation could enter a unified lock down of nonessential businesses. Implemented correctly, this could flatten the curve of infection,saving untold lives while keeping Americans financiallystable. These measures would makesense if we didn’t appear to be only months away from a widely available vaccine. With a path to vaccine-induced herd immunity insight,it is obscene for oursociety to acquiesce to mass death. Alas, oursociety has a thing forsuch obscene acquiescence. Osterholm’s approach looks impossible in a country as demented and divided as our own. But as our COVID winter darkens, the outlook for a robuststimulus package just might brighten. Most of my analysis on the prospects for another round of COVID relief has been premised on the assumption that — if Republicans retain control of the Senate — the next round ofstimulus will be either meager or non-existent. After all, if Mitch McConnell was unwilling to meet Democratshalfway earlier this year(when reaching a deal would have been a political boon to a Republican president as well as the most vulnerable members of his own caucus), why on earth would he doso now (when reaching a deal would be a political boon to Joe Biden)? The Senate Majority Leader’s corestrategic insight during the Obama years was that the American people hold the president’s party responsible for conditions in the country and legislative failures on Capitol Hill. Thus, if an opposition partysecures control of one chamber of Congress, it can increase its odds of winning back power in ensuing elections by obstructing the president’s agenda and/orsabotaging the economy. Under Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell’s caucus agitated forspending cuts when unemployment remained near double digits; under Donald Trump, it embraced deficitspending when unemployment was near historic lows. But I’m notsure if the congressional GOP ever allowed itself to comprehend what this winter was liable to look like. Already, Republicans have made half-hearted efforts to pass further relief forsmall-business owners, who comprise asignificant portion of the party’s activist and donor base. McConnellheld a vote on a $500 billion relief package that would have renewed funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. As the coronavirus digs deeper and more durably into deep red areas of the country, and winter makes it even more difficult for manysmallservice-sector firms tosurvive, it’s not clear whether the GOP will be able to withstand internal pressure to actually deliversubstantive aid to one of its core constituencies. Which is tosay: There’s a good chance that, eventually, McConnell will feel that he needs to make a deal. And he may well prefer to make it during the lame-ducksession, when Biden will reap less credit for the legislation (even if the new president enjoyssome benefit for its effects). Of course,small business has a major presence within the Democratic coalition too. Andso it is possible that all of the factors cited above will break House Democrats’ will and force them to acquiesce to McConnell’s terms on relief. But the Democratic Party’s mainsticking point in previous negotiations — their insistence on massive fiscal aid tostates and municipalities— will only look more reasonable as local governments across the country hemorrhage tax revenue. The end product is almost certain to be too little, too late. But given enough death and bankruptcy, Republicansbe forced to back the kind of robust relief package they refused to put on Trump’s desk when they had the chance.

187,Trump Should Simply Ignore Senate Impeachment Trial,14.33,30.33,https://thelibertyloft.com/trump-should-simply-ignore-senate-impeachment-trial/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-loft-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,15,"Charlotte, NC — Over the weekend, multiple mainstream media outlets were making a big deal about former President Donald Trump’s legal team. Many of them reported that President Trump had asked for his impeachment defense to consist of arguments that the election wasstolen. Theysaid that those requests caused his legal team tosimply walk away. Thisseems to be theside of thestory that the mainstream media wants to push. Other reportsshared that Trump had neversigned letters of intent and that no money was exchanged forservices. In either case, President Trump has no need for a legal defense. At this point, President Trumpshouldsimply ignore the impeachment hearing altogether and pretend it is not happening. The Democrats have no chance to convict President Trump. There aresimply not enough Republicans that are willing to go along with the ridiculous nature of this trial. Sure, they will get a few of them (think Romney, Collins, etc.), but they will not get 17 of them. They need 67 votes to convict and Vice President Kamala Harris’ vote wouldn’t apply here. There’s also the fact that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts will not be at the trial. The Left will argue that it is procedural because Trump is no longer President. If that is the case, then you have no legal basis for impeaching him either. That’s the exact argument that Sen. Rand Paul(R-KY) made just a couple of days ago. There is no precedent for an impeachment conviction of a President that is no longer in office. While the Democrats want to proceed with the trial to try and prevent Trump from ever holding office again, there is no indication that it would be a constitutional act. The Democrats will ram this impeachment hearing through the Senate and attempt to put on ashow to the American people. Donald Trumpshould not fall for it. Instead, heshouldsimply ignore it for the ridiculous governmentshow that it is. The Left is banking on the fact that Trump will want to try to argue his point and defend his position. Why bother if you cannot be convicted? They want hissound bites and his press releases to try and use against him. If he ignores the trial, the Democrats gain nothing but a waste of American tax dollars and their time. Republicans can use the opportunity to continue toshow Americans that Democrats are not interested in helping them, they are only interested in power and the radical agenda. They are only interested in themselves, instead of representing those who elected them to Congress. While I certainly believe that there aresome issues on the Republicanside of the aisle, this is one area where Republicans can do themselvessome favors. They can use the impeachment trial to their advantage and against Joe Biden. Let the Democrats perform the impeachment trial. Let them present little to no evidence tosupport their claims. As Republicansstart their defense, theyshouldsimplystart tellingstories from across the country. Tell thestories ofsmall businesses that have closed while the Democrats refuse to do anything. Tell thestories of the people whose lives have been changed at the hands of Antifa and the riots that the Left hassupported. Finally, tell thestory of Hunter Biden and the corruption of the Biden family. There is absolutely nothing that the Democrats can accomplish through the impeachment trial of President Trump. It is a golden opportunity for Republicans tostart laying the groundwork for 2022 and 2024, however. Washington is the Editor-in-Chief atThe Liberty Loftand host ofThe JD Washington Show.

188,The Cuba protests are a cry for help. America needs to listen.,-18.33,32.67,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/cuba-protests-are-cry-help-america-needs-listen-n1273785,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-13,25,"This weekend, thousands of Cubans poured into thestreets in the largest display of anti-governmentsentimentsince 1994. We’re only aware of what’s happening in Cuba thanks to a handful of videos thatslipped out before the government closed off communications with the outside world and publicly threatened to crush the protests by force. Rolling, hours long blackouts outside of the country’s cities has upended Cuba’s governable consensus. But wesaw enough:Demonstrators chantingslogans like “we want freedom” and flying the American flag. The accounts of this event in mainstream American media venues are mechanically nuanced. The Cuban economy has been decimated by the pandemic-related tourism drought. Shortages of food, medicine and doctors have created intolerable conditions. Rolling, hours long blackouts outside of the country’s cities has upended Cuba’s governable consensus. But the Cubans demonstrating in thestreets chanting “anti-governmentslogans” of “Freedom!” in this Communist island “known for repressive crackdowns on dissent,” as TheNew York Timesdamningly observed, are demandingsomething more from Havana than functioning public utilities and basicsocial welfare. In hissecond inaugural address, George W. Bush committed his administration to a “freedom agenda.” Both to preserve America’s nationalsecurity from rogue regimes and the malefactors they incubate and to promote the flourishing of the human condition around the world, Bush pledged to pursue policies with the lofty “ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.”Bush’s opponents dismissed the notion as naïve and unworldly. The president’ssupporters regarded it as purely aspirational. Voters came tosee it as a veiled commitment to more military adventurism around the world, and they rejected it unmistakably in both 2006 and 2008. America has not had anything close to a “freedom agenda”since. But the oppressed peoples of the world have not abandoned their desire to breathe free, even if oursupport for their ambitions is now only rhetorical. Bush pledged to pursue policies with the lofty “ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.”In Cuba’s case, all the usual proximate causes that can be rationalized away assomething other than a demand for essential liberties are on full display in the mainstream press. But there are always proximate causes behind the upheavals that result in the destruction of an oppressiveschema. And thatschema is never far from the forefront of oppressed minds. Poland’s Solidarity movement owed its existence to the rising price of food. The unrest in the Baltic republics that culminated in the dissolution of the Soviet Union arose in response to Moscow’s plan for astrip mine in Estonia. Theself-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor that produced one of the most responsive and democratic governments in the Muslim world occurred in response to high unemployment and inflation. Seismic geopolitical events begin with banalities, but they are also almost always asymptom of the maladies associated with autocratic illiberalism. And eventually, an autocracy’s restive public will begin to treat the disease over itssymptoms. Rather commendably, President Joe Biden welcomed the protests as a “clarion call for freedom” — an outpouring against what the president deemed the “repression” meted out by “Cuba’s authoritarian regime.” This is due to a rejection of the “proximate causes” theory of unrest in oppressivestates, but the Biden administration did not initiallyspeak with one clear voice on thesubject.“We are deeply concerned by ‘calls to combat’ in #Cuba,” acting assistantsecretary for the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, July Chang, tweeted in whatThe Washington Post accurately characterized as a rebuke of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who called on the Cuban military to “defend the people, not the Communist Party.”“Westand by the Cuban people’s right for peaceful assembly,” Changsaid. “We call for calm and condemn any violence.”But Biden’snationalsecurity adviser, Jake Sullivan, quickly clarified the administration’s position: “The U. S.supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and wouldstrongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights.” There’s asubtle distinction here — one thatspeaks to the traditional American orientation toward thesupport of even revolutionarystruggles against tyranny, particularly those that target unfree governments hostile to American national ambitions. Eventually, an autocracy’s restive public will begin to treat the disease over itssymptoms. And whyshouldn’t that be the case? We’veseen what the laissez-faire approach produces, and no oneshould besatisfied with the results. When the Venezuelan people rose up against their oppressive and regionally destabilizing government in 2014, President Barack Obama letCongress take the lead. The presidentsigned a bill imposingsanctions on Venezuelan officials into law only after at least 43 demonstrators had been killed and the movement that threatened to topple the regime in Caracas had been all but quelled. Obama was just as reluctant to provide any meaningfulsupport for the demonstrators who made up Iran’s “Green Revolution” in 2009. For fear of jeopardizing the prospects for diplomacy with Tehran or inflaming an already tensesituation, Obama downplayed the prospects for revolutionarysocial change in Iran. Indeed, he hoped to avoid making the U. S. “the issue inside of Iran,” and could not be moved to even question the results of what few observers concluded w asa free and fair election. Obama’s Republicansuccessor wassimilarly if not equally inclined against providing any meaningfulsupport for anti-authoritarian dissidents. Donald Trump got asecond bite at the apple of Iranian democracy in late 2019 and early 2020 when violent protests erupted, ostensibly over rising gas prices (more proximate causes). And while Trump was more willing than his predecessor to expresssupport for anti-regime demonstrators’ goals, hestoppedshort of advancing them himself. “U. S. officialssay the administration needs to avoid any overtures that could draw accusations of foreign meddling — like direct financing,”Reuters reported, “and increase the chances of a violent crackdown on the people it wants tosupport.”That cautionseemed to inform the Trump administration’s handling of the outpouring of anti-Beijingsentiment in thestreets of Hong Kong in 2019. Akin to Obama’s administration of the crisis in Venezuela, Trumplet Congress lead the way. And while the Trump White House was rhetoricallysupportive of the pro-democracy protesters, the president’s pronouncementssurely confused the Chinese. He described the anti-Beijing protests as “riots,” which advanced a narrative preferred by the Chinese Communist Party. Trump coupled the issue of democracy in Hong Kong with ongoing trade negotiations, which his advisers insisted were entirely unrelated. And ultimately, hesought to avoid the very circumstances Obama feared: allowing the demonstrations to be affiliated with the United States —something that did notsimilarly concern the thousands of protesters who waved American flags andsang the American national anthem. And what has ourstance gotten us? In Venezuela, our refusal to capitalize on the momentum of the moment allowed it to fizzle, leaving Washington tosupport a parallel government only belatedly and without many prospects forsuccess. In Iran, it has led to thesacrifice of every opportunity to be rid of a medieval cabal thatseems determined to one day present the world with a nuclear crisis that may only be resolvable through war or the extirpation of this regime. In China, democracy in Hong Kong is all but crushed. The regime in Beijing is nowso emboldened by itssuccess that it is intimating in every possible way that retaking Taiwan by force is no longer a hypothetical but a potentially imminent threat. So, what can Biden do for the persecuted Cuban people beyondspeaking the truth about their persecutors? The White House can andshould pressure countries and businesses operating inside Cuba to help the Cuban people evade the government’s efforts to limit their access to communications networks. Washingtonshould do what it can to boost theshortwave radiosignals carrying Miami-based Radio Martí. The Biden administrationshould threaten Cuban leaders withsanctions as well as travel and visa restrictions if they carry out Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel’s threat to violentlysuppress the protests. And if these demonstrations are put down, the U. S.should reduce its diplomatic presence in Cuba and restrict the movements of Cuban operatives inside the United States. Yes, the usualsuspects will wring their hands over Washington taking tacit ownership of the protesters and their cause. So what? A more active defense of the world’s unfulfilled aspirations for freedom at least has the potential to change the course of history for the better. We know that doing nothing begets nothing. At the least, weshould be honest with ourselves. We must admit that advancing the mutually compatible goals ofseeking a freer world that is morestable and, therefore, more amenable to American geopolitical objectives is just a happystory we tell ourselves. If that’s not a palatable option, maybe it’s time to take asecond look at the “freedom agenda.”Noah Rothman is the associate editor of Commentary Magazine.",1,1,MSNBC

The Delta variant, which was firstseen in India and is already the dominant coronavirusstrain in many other countries, is more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and can potentially result in moreserious infections. It has already been detected in everystate, and government officials believe it will become the mainsource of American infections within weeks. The 19th thanks oursponsors. Become one. Although cases have been trending downward, the Delta variant creates a coronavirus outbreaks in communities where asignificant number of people remain unvaccinated, which can putspecific, hard-to-reach populations at risk. The impact could be particularlysevere for men, Nunez-Smith acknowledged,since they have generally been more likely to develop complications,sometimes fatal, from COVID-19. Nunez-Smithsaid that adds to the imperative of getting more men vaccinated. Currently, 53 percent of people who are fully vaccinated are women, and only 47 percent are men, according to data collected by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The data does not disaggregatesex and gender or account for non binary people. The only age group in which men are more likely to be vaccinated is for adults older than 75, per aseparate CDC analysis. You have beensubscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong.

If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. White people are more likely to have been vaccinated than Black or Latinx people, the CDC datashows. That has been a concern for months, especiallysince Black and Latinx people have been more likely to work jobs that expose them to the virus and have been more likely to end up in the hospital. The introduction of the more contagious variant, coupled with that vaccine disparity, could create greater risk of localized, unequally distributed COVID-19 outbreaks, Nunez-Smithsaid.“There’s more work to do,”shesaid. “The dynamics of COVID-19 are local. Andso it really comes down to the dynamics of one’s community. How many people in one’s community have been vaccinated? The risk is there for these localizedsurges.”Efforts to vaccinate more Americans have laggedsincespring. Though President Joe Biden initiallyset a target of getting 70 percent of adults vaccinated by the July 4 holiday, the administration acknowledged last week it was unlikely to meet that goal. So far, 66.5 percent of adults have gotten at least oneshot. The Biden administration has vowed to distribute vaccines equitably — touting targeted outreach for Black and Latinx people in particular, given their disproportionate harm experienced — but those efforts have not been enough to close vaccine disparities. Nunez-Smith would notsay whether federal guidance might change around indoor mask mandates, butshe didsuggest that more local areas — especially places with low vaccination rates or newsurges of COVID-19 — could reintroduce indoor mask mandates even for people who are vaccinated. That’s in line with guidance from other officials, notably Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Currently, the CDC does not recommend requiring indoor masks for people who are fully vaccinated. The World Health Organization does recommend indoor masks, though, citing the risk of the Delta variant. This past week, Los Angeles County’s health department put out astrong recommendation that people wear masks indoors even if fully vaccinated.“It’s really up to locals andstates around mask requirements,” Nunez-Smithsaid. “But I particularly encourage people to pay attention to the local dynamics.”All evidencesuggests that people with twoshots of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine will not developsevere illness from the Delta variant, and are unlikely to transmit the virus to others. On Thursday, Johnson & Johnsonsaid its vaccine also protects against the Delta variant. But if large pockets of people remain unvaccinated — in the United States or abroad — the virus could further mutate and develop even more potent variants that eventually undercut the power of those vaccines. At the current pace of vaccination, it could take another year for enough of the world to have coronavirus immunity, according to data analyzed byBloomberg News.",2,2,19th News
191,Coronavirus relief bill: Extend the $600 unemployment benefit,-4.67,35.33,https://fortune.com/2020/08/13/unemployment-benefits-relief-bill-coronavirus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"Congress must act now, or millions more workers will lose their jobs without asafety net to catch them. Every job we lost has a ripple effect, and all the warningsigns for our economy are flashing red. Since the pandemic began,55 million Americans have filed for unemployment. That’s not even counting the undocumented workers who are ineligible for benefits or parents—mainly women—who left the workforce to care for their kids. Without a real relief package, millions more willsoon join them, including hundreds of thousands of flight attendants, pilots, baggage handlers, gate agents, and other aviation workers. So far, almost no aviation workers are out of work, thanks to thePayroll Support Programour unions fought for in the CARES Act. The programstabilized 2.1 million jobsso efficiently that overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both chamberssupport a clean extension. But if there’s no relief package, aviation will join the long unemployment lines and our country will lose more of the jobs wesupport—in manufacturing, hospitality, transportation, and beyond. And the crisis for workers will be even more disastrous. Many of the 55 million who filed for unemployment havestayed afloat because of the $600 enhanced unemployment benefit Congress included in the CARES Act. But that program ended on July 31, and economists from across thespectrum are warning that we’re headed for disaster unless Congress acts. Last week,JPMorgan Chase released astudyshowing the extra $600 propped up andspurred consumerspending, while warning that delays in processing benefits could cause a drop inspending bigger than the 2008 Great Recession andsignificantlyshrink our economy. After talks broke down and the White House issued empty executive orders, JPMorgan followed up itsstudy with another dire warning toCongressthat it must actsoon. The National Bureau of Economic Research agrees,saying failure to reach a deal will lead to a 44% drop in localspending. Even if the benefit is reduced to $400, we’dsee asteep drop we can’t afford (and for most, Trump’s executive orders will never deliver asingle dollar). And these awful projections might be best-case assessments. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI)shows thespending generated by that extra $600issupporting 5 million jobs. If the dollars disappear,so will the jobs theysupport. Millions of workers can’t make ends meet even with the $600. One in three Americansis behind on housing payments, and30 million to 40 million people face eviction in the coming months. Without a deal in Congress, those numbers willskyrocket. It is utter nonsense that enhanced benefits are keeping people out of the workforce. Tens of millions of workers are competing for far fewer jobs than were available justsix months ago. For every job available, there are five people looking for work—and those few jobs are now in jeopardy too. Letting the enhanced benefits lapse is far from the only thing that will cause massive job loss. State and local governments are facing hugeshortfalls, and begging Congress for help. Without it, there’s another huge unemployment wave coming. How big a wave? EPI’s research estimates5.3 million critical public workers will lose their jobs over the next 18 months without a major federal investment in ourstate and local governments to keep public transportation going, rural hospitals open, teachers educating, andsanitation workers doing their jobs. It takes a pretty big crisis tosee unions, economists, and corporations calling for thesame outcomes. Now add in Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, who practically begged Congress to extend the$600 benefit and fill the gaps instate and local budgets. All of these numbers are predicated on the economystaying about where it is, but that’s no guarantee. As coronavirus case numbers remainstaggeringly high,consumerspending is dropping again and businesses that reopened may be forced to close again. Much of the money Congress allotted for the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) isspent and gone, even as millions ofsmall businessesstruggle tostay afloat. If Congress acts to maintain the $600 benefit, provide aid tostate and local governments, revamp the PPP, and extend the Payroll Support Program, we cansave more than 10 million jobs, while preventing millions of unemployed people from falling into total crisis. Throw out everything you’ve learned about how the economy works. We’ve never faced asituation like this. The cost of letting our economy go into a free fall is far greater than the cost of protecting jobs and keeping peoplesafe while we fight the COVID-19 pandemic. As westand on the precipice of asecond Great Depression, we can’t afford to gosmall. When the virussurges again, more jobs will disappear. Without real relief, there will be nothing toslow our descent this time. FromU. S.

The threatened evictions fueled protests and clashes in the run up to last month's 11-day Gaza war and pose a test for Israel's new governing coalition, which includes three pro-settler parties but is hoping tosideline the Palestinian issue to avoid internal divisions. Israeli police and border officialssaid they arrested foursuspects in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. It was unclear whostarted the brawl. The officialssaidsomeone launched fireworks at police forces and residents' houses and that 'œseveral Molotov cocktails were thrown andstones were thrown.'ť One woman was reportedly injured whenshe was hit in the back by astone, policesaid. The Red Crescent emergencyservicesaid its crews treated 20 Palestinians, including 16suffering from pepperspray and tear gas and others wounded by rubber-coated bullets. Two other people were wounded, including an elderly man who was hit in the head, itsaid. The Red Crescentsaidsettlers threwstones at one of its ambulances and Israeli forcessprayedskunk water on asecond ambulance belonging to theservice. The eruption of violence is the latest friction in Sheikh Jarrah, where weeks of unrest captured international attention ahead of the 11-day Israel-Hamas war last month. The cease-fire took effect on May 21, but the long-running campaign by Jewishsettlers to evict dozens of Palestinian families continues. Andso the cycle of tension endures, in astark early test for Israel's new coalition government, which is just over a week old. At the helm under a rotation agreement is Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the right-wing Yamina party. In two years, he'll be replaced by Yair Lapid, leader of centrist Yesh Atid. And leading the opposition is Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, ousted from the premiership after holding the post for 12 years. An intervention by Israel's attorney general at the height of the unrest has put the most imminent evictions on hold. But rights groupssay evictions couldstill proceed in the coming months as international attention wanes, potentially igniting another round of bloodshed. Thesettlers have been waging a decades-long campaign to evict the families from densely populated Palestinian neighborhoods in theso-called Holy Basin just outside the walls of the Old City, in one of the mostsensitive parts of east Jerusalem. Israel captured east Jerusalem, home to holysitessacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. Israel views the entire city as its capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their futurestate. Thesettlerssay the homes are built on land that was owned by Jews prior to the 1948 warsurrounding Israel's creation. Israeli law allows Jews to reclaimsuch property, a right denied to Palestinians who lost lands and homes in thesame conflict.___Kellman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.",2,2,Daily Herald-Chicago

Only as mall amount of fake news is needed to disrupt a conversation, and at extremes it can have an impact on democratic processes,including elections. Read more:We made deceptive robots tosee why fake newsspreads, and found a weaknessBut what can we do to avoid fake news, at a time when we could be waiting a while for mainstream media andsocial networks tostep up and address the problem?From a psychology perspective, an importantstep in tackling fake news is to understand why it gets into our mind. We can do this by examining how memory worksand how memories become distorted. Using this viewpoint generatessome tips you can use to work out whether you’re reading orsharing fake news – which might be handy in the coming election period. Fake news often relies onmisattribution– instances in which we can retrieve things from memory but can’t remember theirsource. Misattribution is one of the reasons advertising isso effective. Wesee a product and feel a pleasantsense of familiarity because we’ve encountered it before, but fail to remember that thesource of the memory was an ad. Onestudy examined headlines from fake news published during the 2016 US Presidential Election. The researchers found even one presentation of a headline (such as “Donald Trump Sent His Own Plane to Transport 200 Stranded Marines”,based on claimsshown to be false) was enough to increase belief in its content. This effect persisted for at least a week, wasstill found when headlines were accompanied by a fact check warning, and even when participantssuspected it might be false. Repeated exposure can increase thesense that misinformation is true. Repetition creates the perception of group consensus that can result in collective misremembering, a phenomenon called theMandela Effect. It might be harmless when people collectively misremembersomething fun,such as a childhood cartoon (did the Queen in Disney’s Snow White really NOTsay “Mirror, mirror…”?). But it hasserious consequences when a falsesense of group consensus contributes to rising outbreaks of measles. Scientists have investigated whether targeted misinformation can promote healthy behaviour. Dubbed false-memory diets, it issaid that false memories of food experiences can encourage people to avoid fatty foods,alcoholand even convince them to love asparagus. Creative people that have astrong ability to associate different words are especiallysusceptible to false memories. Some people might be more vulnerable than others to believe fake news, but everyone is at risk. Biasis how our feelings and world view affect the encoding and retrieval of memory. We might like to think of our memory as an archivist that carefully preserves events, butsometimes it’s more like astoryteller. Memories areshaped by our beliefs and can function to maintain a consistent narrative rather than an accurate record. An example of this isselective exposure, our tendency toseek information that reinforces our pre-existing beliefs and to avoid information that brings those beliefs into question. This effect issupported by evidence that television news audiences are overwhelmingly partisanand exist in their own echo chambers. It was thought that online communities exhibit thesame behaviour, contributing to thespread of fake news, but this appears to be a myth. Political newssites are often populated by people with diverse ideological backgroundsand echo chambers are more likely to exist in real life than online. Our brains are wired to assume things we believe originated from a crediblesource. But are we more inclined to remember information that reinforces our beliefs?This is probably not the case. People who holdstrong beliefs remember things that are relevant to their beliefs but they remember opposing information too. This happens because people are motivated to defend their beliefs against opposing views. Belief echoes are a related phenomenon that highlight the difficulty of correcting misinformation. Fake news is often designed to be attention-grabbing. It can continue toshape people’s attitudes after it has been discredited because it produces a vivid emotional reaction and builds on our existing narratives. Corrections have a muchsmaller emotional impact, especially if they require policy details,soshould be designed tosatisfy asimilar narrative urge to be effective. The way our memory works means it might be impossible to resist fake news completely. Read more:How to help kids navigate fake news and misinformation onlineBut one approach is tostart thinking like ascientist. This involves adopting a questioning attitude that is motivated by curiosity, and being aware of personal bias. For fake news, this might involve asking ourselves the following questions:Many people rely onsocial media and aggregators as their mainsource of news. By reflecting on whether information is news, opinion or even humour, this can help consolidate information more completely into memory. Paying attention to where information is published is crucial for encoding thesource of information into memory. Ifsomething is a big deal, a wide variety ofsources will discuss it,so attending to this detail is important. Reflecting on who benefits from you believing the content helps consolidate thesource of that information into memory. It can also help us reflect on our own interests and whether our personal biases are at play. Some peoplet end to be moresusceptible to fake news because they are more accepting of weak claims. But we canstrive to be more reflective in our open-mindedness by paying attention to thesource of information, and questioning our own knowledge if and when we are unable to remember the context of our memories.

Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Wednesday ordered city restaurants tosuspend indoor dining by the end of the week and announced expanded requirements for face coverings. Young, a Democrat, is among a group of local leaders pushing for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan to takestatewide action and renew certain dining restrictions in an attempt to curb the recentspike in coronavirus cases. The city is now moving ahead on its own.“I have alwayssaid we would continue to monitor the data and not hesitate to tighten restrictions if the data tell us it’s needed,” Youngsaid in a virtual news conference following the weekly Board of Estimates meeting Wednesday. Baltimore restaurants and bars will be required tosuspend indoor dining for at least two weeks,starting at 5 p.m. Friday. The city health department will review COVID-19 data daily to monitor whether thesuspension will continue after that period. Eateries can continueserving customers outside and offering takeout and delivery. The city will also require all people over the age of 2 to wear face coverings in public, Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasasaid. But the health commissioner clarified that the mask order applies to outdoorsituations in which people are unable tosocial distance, like a cookout or a barbecue.“When you’re walking your dog and are not around people, no mask is required,”shesaid. In a grim irony, the end of indoor dining coincides with thestart of Baltimore Restaurant Week, asemiannual event meant to boost revenues at restaurants. Aspokesman for organizer the Downtown Partnershipsaid in astatement that the event wouldstill happen but be limited to outdoor dining and carryout meals. One businessscheduled to participate was CookHouse, a Bolton Hill bistro that opened in February, just one month before it closed for COVID-19.“It’s very challenging, as you probably can imagine,”said owner George Dailey. On the plusside, the restaurant has a patio, wherestaff will continue toserve itssmash burgers andsteak frit es after Friday. Many guests already preferred to eat al fresco. “Outside, people are happy,so we’re just going to continue this way, weather permitting.”The limitation on outdoor dining falls in line with what many public health experts have been recommending. On Monday, health officials from thestate’s five largest counties wrote Maryland’s deputy healthsecretary urging astop to indoor dining in bars and restaurants. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a formerstate healthsecretary and Baltimore city health commissioner, praised Young’s decision as “asensible action to makesure Baltimore doesn’t turn into the next Miami or Houston.” Both cities haveseen recentsurges in casessince reopening. Hesaid there isstrong evidence that bars in particular pose a very high risk for transmission. Others felt independent restaurants have been unfairlysingled out among businesses.“People are all right going to Target, Walmart and grocerystores,”said Chris Amendola, chef and owner of Foraged, a “hyper-seasonal eatery” in Hampden. On a recent foraging expedition, he witnessed a group of 200 orso peoplesplashing in the Patapsco, none wearing masks. “Restaurants aren’t the problem,” hesaid. Like many business owners, Amendola faces an uncertain future, having alreadyspent loans received through the federally funded Paycheck Protection Program. “I don’t even know what to do anymore.”Foraged had been offering indoor dining at half capacitysince the city began allowing it last month, a move hesaid had been allowing the business tostay afloat. Without it, he’s limited to three outdoor tables — and few of his guests are eager to eat outside in the heat. Mother’s Grille owner Dave Rathersupported Young’s decision toshut down indoor dining. “It’ssomething we need to do in this city even though it hurts,” hesaid. “We all gotta do our part.”The restaurant in Federal Hill had alreadystopped offering indoor dining last weekend given the rise in COVID-19 cases among industry workers in the area. Several Canton bars and restaurantsshut down amid aspike in cases there. Rather declined tosay whether members of hisstaff had tested positive. Restaurants are not legally required toshut down when an employee tests positive, a factsome havesaid contributes to thespread of the virus. In Baltimore, the average daily case count nearly doubled in the week between July 4 and July 12, after the city transitioned into asecond phase of its reopening plan, Dzirasasaid. The city is conducting an average of over 2,000 COVID-19 tests daily, the health commissionersaid. The jump in cases is greater than what officials expected toseesimply from increases in testing capacity. The 21224 ZIP code alone, which includes neighborhoodssuch as Canton, Highlandtown, and Patterson Park, hasseen cumulative positivity rates as high as 22% among city residents,shesaid. People between ages 20 and 39 have had the highest rates of new cases and the highest test positivity rates. Fatalities have remainedsomewhatsteady. The city’s actions regarding masks aresimilar to those taken Tuesday byBaltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. But while Olszewski called on Hogan, a Republican, to limit indoor diningstatewide, the Democratic county executivesaid he would not issue a local restriction for restaurants because of concerns about how it would impact businesses. Dzirasasaid in an interview that the city’s demographics are different from the county’s, and a localsuspension on indoor dining makessense in Baltimore.“We need to be extremely mindful of how the city isset up, and the density of bars and restaurants, compared to other jurisdictions,”shesaid. Olszewski, meanwhile, “continues to believe that a unified,statewide approach is the best way to ensure public health efforts are most effective,”said Sean Naron, aspokesman for Olszewski. The county executive also believes astatewide approach will minimize confusion for residents and will avoid puttingsmall businesses at a competitive disadvantage.“If the governor does not act, we’ll continue conversations with neighboring jurisdictions and do what’s best for our residents,” Naronsaid. Dzirasasaid the city would be looking for its case counts to go down “significantly” before considering lifting new restrictions. She is hopeful that Hogan will heed the advice of local health officials and institutestatewide restrictions on dining. Some business owners, like Rather, who operates branches of Mother’s in Baltimore and Anne Arundel counties, think it’s just a matter of time. But Hogansaid Wednesday he doesn’t plan to tighten restrictions.“We do not intend tosuddenly close all of oursmall businesses,” hesaid in a press conference. “We do not want to crush our economy.”The total number of coronavirus cases in Marylandsurpassed the 80,000 mark Wednesday, withstate health officials reporting 627 new cases of the illness. The rise brings Maryland’s infection total to 80,172 confirmed cases. While Hogan acknowledged “concerning trends” of high positivity rates among people under 35 as well as an up tick in recent COVID hospitalizations, hesaid thesolution wasstricter enforcement by local governments ofsocial distancing guidelines. And he encouraged individuals to continue wearing masks whensupporting local businesses: “Noshirt, noshoes, no mask, noservice. It’s really not that hard.”Baltimore Sun reporter Wilborn P.

Calling the legislation an effort to impose “unconstitutional burdens on the right to vote”—particularly for Black voters—the plaintiffs accused Georgia Republicans of acting in direct response to former President Donald Trump’sstunning campaign to undo Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in thestate. The voting law has attracted national attention, as well as fierce condemnation from Democrats. Georgia Republicans—much like Republicans in otherstates where brazen voting restrictions have been introduced—have characterized the law as an attempt to prevent illegal voting, despite longstanding evidence that voter fraud is a largely nonexistent problem.“None of the bill’s burdensome and discriminatory changes to Georgia’s election code will increase the public’s confidence in thestate’s election administration or ensure election integrity,” the lawsuit, announced byMarc Elias, the prominent election lawyer, argues. “Rather, the grab bag of voting restrictions that populate SB 202 make clear that the Bill was animated by an impermissible goal of restricting voting.”The three groups—the New Georgia Project, which was founded by Stacey Abrams, the Black Voters Matter Fund, and Rise—objected to a wide range of provisions in the bill, including a ban on non-poll workers distributing water to voters waiting in line and restrictions on the use of absentee drop boxes. And as my colleagueAri Berman writes, the “major power grab” would give thestate board of electionssweeping powers “to take over county election boards it views as underperforming, raising the possibility that elections officials appointed by and beholden to the heavily gerrymandered Republican legislature could take over election operations in Democraticstrongholds like Atlanta’s Fulton County, where Trump and his alliesspread conspiracy theories about ‘suitcases’ of ballots being counted by election officials in November after GOP poll monitors had left.”Biden, in his first White House news conference on Thursday,slammed Republican votersuppression efforts as “sick.”",2,1,Mother Jones
197,More infectious UK 'super-covid' variant could be dominant in the US by MARCH,0.0,51.33,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9152539/More-transmissible-UK-coronavirus-variant-10-U-S-states-CDC-says.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,25,"The more infectious UK 'super-covid' variant could become dominant in the US by March, triggering massivesurges in coronavirus cases, the CDC warns. Already, at least 95 people in 15states have detected cases of the highly contagious B117 variant, according to DailyMail.com tracking (the CDC has only documented 76 in 12states). The variant quickly became dominant in the UK, where it was first detected, and triggered the nation'sstrictest lock downs yet. CDC experts declined to predict just how many more cases and deaths the variant will lead to in the US. But it is thought to be up to twice as infectious, and 'a higher rate of transmission will lead to more cases, increasing the number of persons overall who need clinical care, exacerbating the burden on an alreadystrained health caresystem, and resulting in more deaths,' they wrote in a Friday report. If it continues to infect 1.1 people for every one person who catches the new UK 'super-covid' variant, the more infectious form of coronavirus (light purple) will be dominant by March and increase daily cases of the new variant to nearly 50 per 100,000, the CDC estimatesThe UK variant is not itself thought to be more deadly and early labstudiessuggest vaccines will provide protection against it. Meanwhile,similar new threats are emerging across the globe. Scientists are concerned that variants from Brazil and South Africa may evade vaccines. They haven't yet been reported in the US, but with onlyspotty testing for variants they may already been. And the US now has three homegrown variants of its own. All three aresuspected to be more infectious than currently more common variants, and one is virtually identical to the UK variant. Utah and Illinois each reported their first cases of the UK variant on Friday. It has also been reported by health departments in:It quicklyspread to a cluster in California - which has a cluster of 32, plus two other cases there - and there are now at least 22 cases in Florida. In the absence of vaccines, the UK variant could push daily case rates past 80 per capitaThe variant's rapidspread will increase the burden on health resources at a time when infections aresurging, furthersappingstrained healthcare resources and increasing the need for better adherence to mitigationstrategies,such associal-distancing and mask-wearing, the CDCsaid in its weekly report on death and disease. It also increases the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve protective herd immunity to control the pandemic, the CDCsaid. Dr Anthony Fauci hassaid that herd immunity could be reached if between 70 and 85 percent of the population is vaccinated against or has had COVID-19. Vaccine rollout has been painstakinglyslow in the US. Just 11.9 million Americans have had their first doses. The threat of new variantsshould add to the urgency of vaccination - but the US has already burned through itsstockpile of jabs. In thespan of less than 24 hours this week, USscientists reported three homegrown 'super-covid' variants - and expertssay the worldshould brace for many more, emerging in countries all over the world. And the more people get coronavirus, the more of these highly infectious variants will emerge,scientists believe. Scientists theorize that 'super-covid' variants are only going to become more common as case numberssurge across the globe, because the more cases there are, the greater the number of people with rare, chronic infections will be - and these cases offer a unique opportunity for new,stronger COVID-19 variants to evolve.'My (highlyspeculative!) hypothesis is that the emergence of these variant viruses arises in cases of chronic infection during which the immunesystem places great pressure on the virus to escape immunity and the virus doesso by getting really good at getting into cells,' wrote Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centerscientist Dr Trever Bradford wrote in a Thursday Twitterthread. Weaker immunesystems allow the virus tostay in the body for a longer time, during which the immunesystem keeps fighting it. Duking it out with the immunesystem teaches the virus how tostick around better. Dr Bedford isn't the only one who thinksso.'The up tick in mutations [we areseeing] is expected because there is more circulation of the virus, and more chances for a mutation to occur,' Dr Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist with the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation told DailyMail.com. And when people are infected for a long time, 'it is giving the virus an opportunity to mutate within thesame host,' Dr Mokdad explained. Researcherssay the variant first beganspreading rapidly in late June and early July, coinciding with thesecond wave of the virus in the U. S. Hesaysscientistssuspect that that is how the UK variant, B117, arose: 'A person who was infected for 12 days was the one whostarted this whole thing,' though that theory is yet to be confirmed. The more infectious B117 variant has become dominant in the UK. Similar variants have cropped up in South Africa, Brazil and the US. Now, the US has two other variants. So far, they all appear to likely be more infectious, but not more deadly. Scientists think vaccines will work against them, but that is the key questionstill looming over them.'That's why this debate of cutting the dose [of vaccines] or only giving the first dose is very, very dangerous' Dr Mokdadsays.'You want [a vaccine] to knock down the virus very, very low. We don't want to get this virus used tosomething insmall dosesso the virus can develop immunity, we want to makesure that when the virus comes into contact with these immune antibodies, it loses every time, and fast.'As cases havesurged in countries including Brazil (pictured), there have been more chances for the virus to mutate because more infections means a greater number of chronic cases that give the virus ample time to learn how to better infect humans, expertsspeculate. One ofseveral more infectious 'super-covid' variants emerged in BrazilBetween November 1 and December 31, the variant made up nearly 50% of all U. S. genomessequenced (right)Chronic COVID-19 infections - not to be confused with 'long-covid,'symptoms that may linger months aftersomeone clears the virus - may last weeks or even months, and most commonly affect people with weak immunesystems. A team from SouthernIllinoisUniversity Carbondale traced the earliest appearance of new variant, called 20C-US, toTexasin May 2020. The variant carriesseveral mutations, including to thespike protein, which the virus uses to enter and infect human cells. Scientistssay the variant has notspreadsignificantly beyond the country's borders, and that is most highly prevalent in the Upper Midwest. What's more, it could be responsible for at least 50 percent of all American cases, meaning it is very widespread. The researchers predict that 20C-US may be the most dominant variant of the coronavirus in the U. S. at this moment.20C-US is now one of the growing list of mutations discovered in countriessuch as the UK, South Africa and Brazil. The news comes just one day after Ohio researchers announced the first discovery of two homegrown variants - one virtually identical to a variant that emerged in the UK and the other completely unique to the U. S. and dominant in the capital of Columbus. The results were published in a pre-print article onbioRxiv.orgon Wednesday. Led by Dr Keith Gagnon, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at SIU, the team first noticed the possibility of the new variant while looking at genomesequencing data from Illinois.'We were just looking at our local, likestate-specific Illinois data...and we were asked [by the Illinois Department of Public Health] tospecifically look for thespike protein mutations of the UK variant for example,' he told DailyMail.com.'As we're going through the data, we're notseeing a UK variant but I keepseeing this large outbranching off the final genetic tree that we reconstructed.'Of the viral genomesamples taken from March to the present that weresequenced, one variant was more pronounced than the rest. The variant has notspreadsignificantly beyond U. S. borders and is most highly prevalent in the Upper Midwest (above)Despite being more widespread, the virus does not appear to more deadly, just more transmissibleThe US now has three of its own homegrown 'super-covid' variants that are more infectious than the most common coronavirus types in the US - and the new variants arespreading like wildfire in at least onestate. Two variants were identified by Ohioscientists on Wednesday and the third by Illinois researchers on Thursday. One of the new, more infectious variants has already become dominant in Columbus, Ohio, where it was discovered. So far, this homegrown variant has beenseen in about 20samplessince Ohio State University (OSU)scientists first detected it in December. It's now present in most of thesamples they aresequencing. Asecond variant has mutations virtually identical to the UK variant's, but arose completely independently on Americansoil, according to Ohio State Universityscientists. Just one person with this variant has been found. The third new variant was discovered by a team from Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The earliest appearance of new variant, called 20C-US, was traced back to Texas in May 2020. It began picking up prevalence in late June and early July 2020 and could be responsible for up to 50% of all current cases. Tosee if it was present at the the national level, researchers randomlysubsampled 3.3 percent of U. S. genomes available on the global genomic database GISAID. The earliest appearance was found from asample taken in the greater Houston area of Texas on May 20, 2020.'The crazy thing is it's been around for months, I wouldsay largely unnoticed, uncharacterized,' Gagnonsaid.'It wasn't that it wasn't undetected...but nobody I think really picked up on it.'Following the variant over time, there was a notable expansion in the variant's presence in late June and early July 2020, which coincides with America'ssecond wave of the pandemic, instatessuch as Wisconsin and Illinois. However, between November 1 and December 31, almost 50 percent of allsequenced genomes from the U. S. are the new variant.'It is coincidental that the rise to dominance of this variant reallystarted at the end of thesummer and especially during the third pandemic wave,' Gagnonsaid.'It is tempting tospeculate that possibly this variant is playing a role. The circumstantial evidencesuggests that.'Researcherssuggest this means 20C-US has 'surpassed 50 percent penetrance to become the most dominant variant in the U. S.'However, it has a high prevalent in the eastern and Midwestern regions and has notspread widely to the western half of the U. S.20C-US has been reported in other countries including Australia, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, but at low levels. The first mutations the virusshowed were in genes related to virus particle maturation - a process by which a virus breaks from a host cell and activates to infect more cells - and the processing of viral proteins. Gagnonsays these are all important for virus production. Since then, the new variant has formed two new mutations in thespike protein, which demonstrates that it is evolving. However, the variant does not appear to be more deadly.'Even morespeculative, but interesting, is we notice that the death rates are a lot lower even though cases are very high,' Gagnonsaid. This maysuggest 20C-USis highly transmissible but only causes a mild illness. Dr Daniel Jones, of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, who discovered the Columbus variant told DailyMail.com the Illinois variant 'looks closely related but not exactly identical.'Jonessaid this means the twosets of researchers - in Ohio and Illinois - are likely tracking variants from thesame outgrowth. With the first doses of newly approved vaccines being administered across the national, Gagnonsaid it is unknown whether the variant will impact its effectiveness.'Based on the mutationsso far, I don’t think it willsignificantly impact the vaccine’s effectiveness,' hesaid.'The catch is that the virus continues to evolve, andsince May, it has acquired three mutations, and two of them are in thespike protein, one of which might affect antibody binding. There are a lot of unknowns.'Both Pfizer and Moderna have been testing their vaccines against the international variants andsay they expect the jabs to provide protection.",2,1,Daily Mail

The information is now being made available through the “Care Compare” feature at Medicare.gov, the online tool for basic research on quality andsafety issues at nursing homes. Consumers will be able to compare up to three nursing homes at thesame time, and the web pageshows vaccination rates for residents andstaff, as well as national andstate averages.“We want to give people a new tool to visualize this data to help them make informed decisions,” Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,said in astatement. Nursing home residents are a tiny proportion of the U. S. population, but they have borne a crushing burden from the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for more than 150,000 deaths, or roughly 1 in 5. Nationally, about 84% of residents are now vaccinated, which hasslowed —but not totally prevented— thespread of the delta variant among frail patients. Nursing homestaffers are the bigger concern,since only about 64% are vaccinated, roughly thesameshare as the adult population. The virus commonly gets into facilities viastaffers who have been exposed in nearby communities and unwittingly pass the infection on to residents. Medicare has been posting vaccination information online for months, but it was on asite designed for researchers and industry. One way to navigate it involved accessing a hugespreadsheet. Another approach called for hunting around on a map for little red dots that represented nursing homes. Thestatistics reveal big disparities in vaccination rates amongstates, andsometimes wide differences withinstates and communities. Among the organizations complaining were Consumer Voice, which advocates for quality improvement in long-term care, and the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a watchdog group. Their concerns were echoed by twosenior Democratic lawmakers, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Citing anAssociated Press report on breakthrough infections among nursing home residents, the two lawmakers urged Medicare to move quickly. Wyden chairs the Finance Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, and Casey heads the Aging Committee. The new online tool reminds consumers comparing facilities that higher percentages of vaccinated residents andstaff “are better.” Information on COVID-19 vaccination rates is available just below each nursing home’s ratings. The data reflect the latest reported by nursing homes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Medicare officialssay they are encouraged that even as the delta variant hasswept across the country, outbreaks in nursing homes have not raced out of control as happened last year. They attribute that to the high rate of residents who have gotten theirshots. Nursing home residents are expected to be top on the priority for boostershots as they become available. The nursing home industrysays it fullysupports vaccination ofstaffers and residents, but that Medicareshould also publish vaccine levels for hospitals and other medical caresettings.",1,2,AP

S. According to Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, and Joe Manchin – and, of course, ex-Senator Hilary Clinton – Assange deserves to be punishedseverely for plotting with Chelsea Manning to obtain and release classified military information, and for allegedly helping the Russians to influence the election of 2016. These are War Democrats, of course, who never met a defense corporation or armed intervention that they didn’t like. One is notsurprised to hear them howling for revenge against the “traitor” who revealed American war crimes to the world. Democrats calling themselves progressives are more inclined to defend Assange –sort of – on the ground that his imminent prosecution represents an attack on journalistic freedom that may make it difficult for the media to publish classified documents like those contained in the Pentagon Papers. More legalistic progressives aren’tsosure about this,since they consider classified info OKso long as it has been “sanitized” to avoid exposing intelligence agents, but obtaining the info by hacking into a government computer not ok: i.e., a crime. What neither camp wants to talk about, however, is whether it’s ok to breaksecurities laws in order to expose the American Empire’s war plans, errors, and misdeeds. Thus, my earlier question: why is lawbreaker Martin Luther King, Jr. a hero and lawbreaker Julian Assange a villain? Intelligent people whom I’ve asked about this give the most convoluted and irrelevant answers! “Dr. King never threatened Americansecurity the way Assange did.” “Dr. Kingsubmitted to arrest, but Assange fled to thesecurity of an embassy.” “King loved his enemies, but Assange hates America.”The assumption disguised by these ratherscholastic distinctions is that Martin attacked an obviously evilsystem – American institutional racism – while Julian only attacked . . . the American Empire. So if you don’t want to admit that the empire is evil (or even that it exists), you talk about nationalsecurity or journalistic freedom orsomething. Anything but imperialist warmaking. Dr. King himself did not make that mistake. What he finally came to understand was that racism, the oppression of the poor, and empire-building are co-dependent, interrelated diseases that can only be cured bystrenuous efforts to heal all three conditionssimultaneously. He called this a “revolution of values.” On April 4, 1967, at the Riverside Church in New York, he delivered an address called “Beyond Vietnam” that contained these lines:A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order andsay of war, “This way ofsettling differences is not just.” This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation’s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, ofsending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. Anation that continues year after year tospend more money on military defense than on programs ofsocial uplift is approachingspiritual death. []I think there is not theslightest question that, were he alive, Dr. King would applaud thesort of civil disobedience that exposes the empire’ssecrets to the world and makes people aware of the crimes and errors committed in places like the Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib prisons, the battlefields of Iraq, and the drone-infested provinces of Afghanistan. Julian Assange is nosaint, and neither was Martin Luther King. They were very different personalities, to besure. But both put their “lives, fortunes, andsacred honor” on the line in order to expose the inhumanity, violence, and lies of the powerful elites that rule the globe. On thescale of human values, both ranked Truth and Justice well ahead of Obedience to Authority. Listen, Schumer and the rest of you! If you honor Martin, you must also honor Julian. And if you don’t understand why this is true, what is the difference between you and Trump? If the U. S. governmentsucceeds in extraditing Assange, let’s get ready to celebrate his arrival with a protest recalling the 1963 March on Washington. It’s what King would have done.

According to theBritanica website, critical race theory is an ""intellectual movement and loosely organized framework of legal analysis based on the premise that race is not a natural, biologically grounded feature of physically distinctsubgroups of human beings but asocially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of color.""Although it has been astaple of lawschoolssince the 1970s, the theory has come to the education mainstream due to changes in the waysome view gender and items like The New York Times ""1619 Project,"" which claims the country's founding was based more in theslave trade and ""whitesupremacy"" more than an effort to create an egalitariansociety. Educators and the unions that represent them argue these ""darker"" moments of American history have been whitewashed in the past and need to be taught to present the most accurate picture of the country. Opponents, including conservatives and newly formed parent organizations,say the material is too divisive and ends up indoctrinating children to a more far left-wing view of America. Suburban districts, like Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia, have gained national prominence following contentious board of education meetings with advocates on bothsidesspeaking out. Parents and others areseeking the recall of board members for absorbing the controversial theory into the district's policies and curriculum, while the board denies it is teaching the theory tostudents. Severalstatesare currently considering legislation to ban teaching the theory or its application in classrooms throughout the country. Recently, American Federation of Teachers Union President Randi Weingarten compared the battle to the1925 ""Scopes Trial""where a teacher was tried for teaching evolution tostudents in Tennessee.""We're looking at court actions because these laws conflict withstandards and our licensure requirements and our professional obligations,"" Weingarten, leader of the country'ssecond largest teacher's union,said.

201,The First Rule of Gun Safety is That You Don't Point a Gun Directly at Someone Unless You Intend to Shoot Them,8.33,35.0,https://townhall.com/columnists/johnrlottjr/2021/10/25/the-first-rule-of-gun-safety-is-that-you-dont-point-a-gun-directly-at-someone-unless-you-intend-to-shoot-them-n2597959,https://adfontesmedia.com/townhall-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-10-25,25,"The first rule of gunsafety is you don’t point a gun asomething unless you intend toshoot it. Even if you believe the gun is unloaded, you don’t point it directly at others. Alec Baldwin didn’t follow basic gunsafety when he accidentallyshot his cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, 42. Anyone who has been to ashooting range would have that drilled into them. And Baldwin, an actor who has been in many movies using guns, mustsurely have had this explained to him many times. Since the killing, numerous newsstories have come out blaming others on theset for unsafe practices. Headlines read: “Armorer on Alec Baldwin’s ‘Rust’set once admitted to being ‘nervous’ about abilities,” “Alec Baldwin assistant director had history of unsafe practices, prop makersays,” “‘Rust’ crew describes on-set gunsafety issues and misfires days before fatalshooting,” or “Assistant Director Declared Gun Safe Before Alec Baldwin Fatally Fired It, Affidavit Says.”But these are lame attempts to protect Baldwin from criminal charges. And that is true despite there being no doubt that Baldwin is genuinelysorry about this tragedy. Indeed, as news reports indicate, he was undoubtedly “inconsolable.” but that doesn’t help him either. Reports in the New York Postindicatethat union representativessay the gun Baldwin fired contained a live round. But even if astaffer told Baldwin that the gun was unloaded, the first rule of gunsafety ultimately makes the accident Baldwin’s responsibility. Baldwin was the one who pointed the gun at Hutchins and pulled the trigger. Baldwin obviously never had the intent to kill Hutchins, but if you drive a car recklessly and killsomeone, you arestill liable for negligent manslaughter. The fact that you deeply regret the accident is completely irrelevant. If they had only observed the proper caution to begin with, the death would have been avoided. For involuntary manslaughter, the prosecution has toshow that Baldwin engaged in a lawful but dangerous act and did not act with due caution. A classic example of involuntary manslaughter would besomeoneshooting a gun into the air while in a crowded place, and astray bullet accidentally kills a person. The person wasn’t even aiming the gun atsomeone, but they arestill responsible. These actions are reckless, negligent, and criminal, but they lack intent. In New Mexico, involuntary manslaughter isstill a felony, and it is punishable by up to 18 months in prison and up to $5,000 in fines. On top of that, Baldwin was the film’s executive producer, and he had additional control of thesituation and responsibility. Saying that you killedsomeone because you hired an incompetentstaffer, especially if the above headlines of previous problems occurring prove accurate, isn’t going to offer you much protection. Imagine what liberal Democrat Alec Baldwin wouldsay if a CEO of a major company that resulted in people’s deaths tried to defend himself bysaying he was just relying onstatements from those underneath him?People onsocial media are zeroing in on Baldwin’s past unsympatheticstatements about others. One that has gotten a lot of attention is a Tweet where Baldwin attacked a Huntington Beach police officer for “wrongfully kill[ing]someone.” The officer was in astruggle with asuspect, and thesuspect had just grabbed from the officer’s belt. Even the Los Angeles Times is moresympathetic to the officer, with the headline: “Videoshowing Huntington Beach officer fatallyshootingsuspect outside 7-Eleven doesn’t tell wholestory, policesay.”Unfortunately, in recent years, we haveseen differentstandards of justice for Republicans and Democrats. It isstill too early to judge this case, but Isuspect most people would already be under arrest if they did what Baldwin did.",1,0,Townhall

Nearly 1 in 4 hotels were at least a month late on their mortgage loan payments as of July, the highest figure on record, according to a recent report released by analysis firm Trepp. Just 1.34 percent of hotels were in thesame boat at the end of 2019, the reportsaid. Industry watcherssaid that figure is alarming, if expected. Sahara Las Vegas Vice President of Sales Christopher Bond, Nevada Hotel and Lodging Association President Diane Gandy and Henderson-based Argento Hospitality Group Managing Director Paula Argento are among the 20 people from Nevada whosigned the letter to Congress with nearly 4,000 others from across the country. Astatement on behalf of Bondsaid hesigned the letter as an individual member of the American Hospitality and Lodging Association, not as a representative of Sahara Las Vegas. Requests for comment from the Nevada Hotel and Lodging Association and others were not returned. The letter to Congress called for passage of the Helping Open Properties Endeavor Act, or HOPE Act, which is billed as helping to prevent commercial real estate foreclosures,specifically to borrowers of commercial mortgages. More jobs at riskA UNLV hospitality professor wassurprised there weren’t more Nevada names on the letter given thestate’s economic reliance on tourism and the industry’s unknown future.“This is a time where you need big brother helping you to keep the economy going,”said Mehmet Erdem, associate professor of hotel operations and technology. Low demand for travel means “thousands of hotels” won’t be able to pay their mortgages and could be forced to close their doors for good,stated Chip Rogers, president and CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association.“Tens of thousands of hotel employees will lose their jobs andsmall business industries that depend on these hotels to drive local tourism and economic activity will likely face asimilar fate,” Rogerssaid. UNLV finance and gaming professor Toni Repetti issomewhatskeptical banks are itching to foreclose on hotels at a time when there’s unlikely to be much demand to buy it off their books.“If you don’t know when your customer is going to come back, then why would you buy a hotel?”shesaid. However,shesaid, hotel managers are asking Congress for help to protect themselves from the possibility of foreclosure and keep on the thousands of people they employ.‘Writing on the wall’The HOPE Act would represent the first federal pandemic legislation with a real-estate focus and could provide a much-needed boost to the hotel industry,said Brendan Bussmann, partner at Global Market Advisors. Hotels in Nevada were forced to close for two months and many, upon reopening, are unable to operate as they did before the pandemic hit.“That’s where I think the HOPE Act’s goal is to try to fill that gap for those that (are) trying to recover and have been limited in their ability to recover because of current health andsafety conditions,” Bussmannsaid. Fewsmaller or independent hotels, if any, have thesavings to withstand zero income over the course of months, Bussmannsaid. Corporate-owned hotels may be better positioned to ride out “the tsunami that the industry has faced because of the pandemic,” but even they may not all bespared the possibility ofshuttering, hesaid. Erdemsaid a large hotel on the Strip brings in most of its revenue from gaming, with assists from dining and drinking;smaller hotels don’t have that luxury. They rely almost entirely on room revenue, and when there are no festivals, conventions or any of the other mass gatherings that draw people to Southern Nevada, they’re not making any money. Foreclosures are an unfortunate reality on the horizon forsomesmaller hotels, hesaid. And it’s more difficult to close and reopen than it is tostay open.“If this trend continues, I mean, the writing is on the wall,” hesaid. Erdemsaid he was unclear onspecific details within the proposed HOPE Act. Passing the legislation through Congress and the presidentsigning it into law poses its own challenges. Still, hesaid, “Anything they can do to keep people afloat, theyshould do it.”Contact Mike Shoro atmshoro@reviewjournal.comor 702-387-5290. Follow@mike_shoroon Twitter.",1,1,Las Vegas Review-Journal

S. Postal Service into a grant if the agency’s financial condition deteriorates. The provision is part of a broader 169-page draft bill that GOP leaders could introduce as early as Tuesday. It’s intended as a counter to House Democrats’ bill to give the Postal Service $25 billion more to cover revenue losses, which they expect to vote on this Saturday. The draft Republican bill would also provide $300 in weekly unemployment insurance benefits through Dec. 27 and pump an estimated $158 billion more into the popularsmall-business loan program that lapsed Aug. 8. It would also:The measure obtained by CQ Roll Call wassubject to change, but as written it would cancel the postal debt as provided in the March relief package if the agency dips below $8 billion in cash on hand. The Postal Service currently has around $15 billion in cash on hand, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Tuesday morning. House Democratssay the money they areset to add toseparate postal legislation was recommended by the Postal Service’s board of governors. Republicans argue that despite financial problems, the agency has enough money to operate normally through August 2021. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, under fire from Democrats andsome Republicans, on Tuesdaysaid he’d reverseseveral planned operational changes intended tosave money,such as overtime pay restrictions, limits on post office hours and closure of mail processing facilities. Speaking to The Courier-Journal in his homestate on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellsaid the Senate wouldn’t pass a postal-only bill. But hesuggested that House passage of that measure could open up a discussion about broadening thescope to other virus-related relief provisions. The revised Senate GOP legislation will focus on the “most urgent” needs identified by the Republican conference, according to asource close to the leadership, including unemployment insurance andsmall-business loans. The draft bill leaves out numerous other measures introduced last month, including another round of $1,200 payments to individuals, employer tax credits and roughly half of a $306 billion emergency appropriations package. Money to build a new FBI headquarters in downtown Washington isn’t included, nor is $8 billion for the Pentagon to procure various weaponry. Thesmall-business funding package will enable a “second draw” on the Paycheck Protection Program for eligible firms that havesuffered a 35 percent revenue loss over thesame period a year ago. That’s more generous than the measure unveiled last month by Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship ChairmanMarco Rubio, R-Fla., which required a 50 percent revenue decline. In addition, the revised package would drop plans toset aside nearly $58 billion in loan funds for a new programset up to aidseasonal businesses and firms in low-income areas, as well as $10 billion in assistance to firms that invest insmall businesses. Instead, the entire $257.7 billion amount, offset by a $100 billion rescission of unused funds from the first round, would be for the existing PPP program. Republicans will argue that they are trying to provide more COVID-19 and postal aid while Democrats remain intransigent in the broader coronavirus relief negotiations. Democrats have previouslysaid they objected to a “skinny” plan that doesn’t deal comprehensively with pandemic-related economic and health care needs.“The Democrats had beensaying, ‘We’re not going to do anything piecemeal,’ and then they’re going to come back and dosomething piecemeal,” one GOP Senate aidesaid, referring to the House’sstand-alone Postal Service bill. “In a way, it undercuts their argument.”The GOP aidesaid the Republican bill will not have “everything that House Democrats passed in their messaging bill, but it’s a lot of what people need and it could actually get done andsigned by the president if the Democrats are willing to cooperate on it.”The bill will not be formally introduced because the Senate is not insession. But it is being advanced as preparation for trying to reach a deal with House and Senate Democrats to pass a COVID-19 aid bill attached to astopgap funding resolution in September. Unemployment insurance andstate and local government aid are two of the thornieststicking points dividing the parties on a broader relief bill. Democrats are pushing to renew the $600 weekly federal unemployment insurance add-on that expired last month. Senate Republicans initially offered $200 a week for the first couple of months, while the White House expressed openness to go as high as $400. President Donald Trump on Aug. 8 moved to establish asystem by whichstates could apply for up to $44 billion in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to provide laid-off workers with a $300 weeklysupplement. FEMA guidance this weeksaid that the earliest moststates would be able to distribute benefits is Aug. 29 and that the money will cover only three weeks of initial benefits to ensure otherstates can get funding for which they are approved. And the money will last only as long as FEMA has enough to contend with potential natural disasters. The Senate GOP bill would enablestate unemployment agencies to keep paying $300 a week through the end of the year. The Senate GOP offering wouldn’t provide any additional directstate and local government aid. A House relief package that passed in May would provide almost $1 trillion instate and local aid,several times the $150 billion figure that the White House hassaid it wouldsupport. Republicans also argue that direct education funds forstates and localities would help address one of their biggest budgetary holes. Talks broke off last week, with Democrats demanding that Republicans agree to at least $2 trillion in a broader aid bill, or roughly twice thesize of the initial Senate GOP package offered last month. Democratssaid that was a major concession given the nearly $3.4 trillionsize of their bill that passed the House in May. Mnuchin and other administration officials havesaid the White House couldn’t agree to a $2 trillion price tag in advance of restarting formal talks, arguing the various provisionsshould be negotiated on their own merits. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters on Aug. 13 that Speaker Nancy Pelosi “wants a $2 trillion commitment from us” and “we are not going to give it.”",2,2,Roll Call

Under the new measures announced on Friday, about 28,000sports facilities will also be closed, 63,000 academies known as cramschools will beshut down, 380,000 eateries will be unable to operate after 9pm after coffeeshops will be limited to takeawayservice. Seoul will besubject to a partial lock down for eight days from Sunday, although the latest measuresstopshort of the moststringent level three restrictions, which would ban meetings of 10 or more people. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun described level three restrictions as “the choice of last resort given the economic andsocial ripple effect”. Although Friday’s 371 new cases represented asignificant drop from Thursday’ssix-month high of 441, South Korea has now had 15 days in a row of at least 100 new infections daily.“More than 10 days have passedsince we upgraded quarantine measures to level two, but it remains uncertain when we maysee the positive results,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoosaid. “This is the last chance for us to prevent the virus fromspreading across the country [without moving to level three restrictions].“Level three restrictions will affect a much broader range of businesses and facilities than the measures we just announced and leave deepscars on the economy, livelihoods and daily life,” Parksaid.“I once again plead to the people of our country – for yourself and for us, please remain in thesafespace that is your home. Avoid contacting other people.”Health workers have found it more difficult to contain the recent transmissions centred around the more densely populated capital, where clusters have been tied to churches, restaurants andschools. The country has added more than 4,300 infections to its caseload over the past 15 days, prompting concerns about overwhelming hospitals. Korea Centres for Disease Control director Jeong Eun-kyeongsaid predictions based on modelssuggest the country could possibly record daily increases of 800 or even 2,000 as early as next week if the viralspread cannot be contained.“If we fail tostop this trend, medicalsystems would collapse under exponential increases in infections,” Jeongsaid. Like other rich countries, Japan issigning multiple deals becausesome of the vaccines could fail in clinical trials or require more than one dose. Japan is on track to have 521 million doses of five different vaccines in 2021, compared with a population of 126 million. Recent deals include global arrangements withsuch drugmakers as Pfizer and AstraZeneca, as well as local deals with the likes of Shionogi & Co. Some critics contend that Japan’s rush tosecuresupplies is driven largely by a political desire toshow the world it is fully committed to the Games.“The plan is, hope for a miracle and then capitalise on that miracle,”said Michael Cucek, a politicalscience professor at Temple University Japan. “But the time frame for that is getting narrower and narrower.”Elsewhere, hundreds of masked protesters demonstrated in major Indian cities on Friday against a government plan to hold exams for millions ofstudents during the pandemic, as the daily tally of infections hit a record.“Stop the exam during the pandemic,” read one placard carried by protesters in the eastern city of Kolkata, while othersscuffled briefly with police in the western industrial city of Ahmedabad. More than 2.4 millionstudents areset to take tests next week for admission to medical and engineeringschools, which the federal government has declined to defer, despite growing pressure fromstudents and opposition parties.“It’s important that the government listens tostudents,” Rahul Gandhi, a leader of the opposition Congress party,said in a video onsocial media, as he urged no compromises on thesafety ofstudents. Usually held in April and May, the exams have already been postponed twice this year. Butsomestudents want another delay, for fear of rising infections as well as difficulty travelling to exam centres because of virus-linked curbs on transport and lock downs insome places. However, further delays risk costingstudents the academic year, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal told thenewspaper. The latest daily tallies are the lowest in more than eight weeks, with a peak of 725 in early August. The latest death toll dropped to 12 from 23 on Thursday. Authorities want daily infections to fall at least to low double-digits before they would consider relaxing restrictions. Chief Health Officer Brett Suttonsaid: “We’re clearlystill trending in the right direction. ... It’s not gotten below 100 yet, I do expect that to happen, if not over the weekend, then by next week, if trends continue.”Tests confirmed infections among 3,003 people in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 165,887, the National Disaster Management Agencysaid on Friday. The death toll rose by 105 to 7,169, itsaid. Jakartasaw 869 people testing positive, while neighbouring West Java, where the industrial clusters are located, reported 526 new Covid-19 cases.

Former Reporter/EditorNews EditorThe Lincoln Project was plunged into even deeper turmoil Thursday, with the anti-Trump group tapping an outsider to investigate its handling ofsexual misconduct allegations against a co-founder, and former employees demanding to be released from non-disclosure agreements. On Friday,several more key advisers left the group in the wake of the previous day’sscandalous reports. The organization fanned the flames by tweeting out what appeared to be private messages between a co-founder who left in a rancoroussplit and a journalist who was hoping to interview her. The Lincoln Project later deleted the tweet—which was cited by the ex-staffers as an example of retaliation. The controversy boiled over hours after reports that leaders of the Lincoln Project knew aboutsexual harassment allegations against co-founder John Weaver lastsummer, before they became public in January. (Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson is a Daily Beast columnist and co-hosts the podcastMore than 20 men have accused Weaverofsending unsolicitedsexual messages, withsomesaying he tried to barter his connections forsex; one was underage when Weaver began communicating. Weaver, who is married with two children, admitted his behavior was “inappropriate” butsaid he thought all the interactions were consensual. Weaver resigned, but the accusations did not end there. Last weekend, co-founder Jennifer Hornstepped down, citing whatshesaid were Weaver’s “grotesque and inappropriate behavior” and “longstanding deceptions.” The group responded by claimingshe left after making financial demands including a $250,000signing bonus. On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that leaders of the Lincoln Project learned about allegations against Weaver in thesummer after a payroll employee emailed co-founder Ron Steslow—who then reportedlyshared it with corporate counsel Matthew Sanderson and other key figures and advocated for Weaver to be removed from the organization. Hours later, the group announced that it had hired a “best-in-class outside professional” to review claims of Weaver’s abuse and what Lincoln Project leaders knew and when they knew it. The groupsaid in astatement thatstories about it were “filled with inaccuracies and incorrect information” but conceded in thesame breath: “There is a central truth in all of them that must be reckoned with and that is John Weaver’s appalling conduct and the abuse he inflicted on people.”It ended thestatementsaying that any employee bound by a non-disclosure agreement to withhold information about Weaver could request a release fromsuch a contract. Subsequently, according to,several former employees went public to demand that the group’s leadership free them from non-disclosure agreementsso they couldspeak out about “harassment perpetrated by John Weaver that we experienced or witnessed” or to provide any other information “specific to the John Weaver harassmentsituation that would aid the press, public, and our donors…. ”The anonymous former employees called it “absurd, unreasonable and insensitive” for the group tosuggest thoseseeking release from their NDAssimply contact “the organization accused of protecting the very predator at issue” to request it.“Additionally, given the Associated Press and reports on Feb. 11, we lack any confidence in the organization’s remaining leadership to properly handle our allegations of (or knowledge of)sexual harassment andsexual assault by John Weaver,” the lettersaid. Perhaps most damning, the formerstafferssaid it was the “recent public behavior” of co-founder Steve Schmidt that had forced them to go public because they “do not feelsafe” engaging with the group’s leadership privately. They were referring to the tweet from the Lincoln Project that containedscreenshots of a purported Twitter direct-message conversation between Horn, one of the organization’s founding members, and Amanda Becker, a reporter for the political newssite The 19th.

The FBI, responding to longstanding questions from Democrats, disclosed in a letter late last month that it had received more than 4,500 tips as it investigated the nominee’s past following his 2018 nomination by President Donald Trump. The process was the first time that the FBI hadset up a tip line for a nominee undergoing Senate confirmation,said an assistant FBI director, Jill Tyson, writing on behalf of Director Christopher Wray. A group of Democraticsenatorssaid in a letter to Wray dated Wednesday that his response “raisessignificant additional questions.” They called on him to explain, among other things, how many tips the FBI decided were relevant and what criteria agents used to make that determination and what policies and procedures were used to vet the tips. Thesenators also asked for more information about the tip line, including how it wasstaffed and how the tips were recorded or preserved.“Your letter confirms that the FBI’s tip line was a departure from past practice and that the FBI was politically constrained by the Trump White House,” thesenators wrote. Kavanaughwas confirmed to the Supreme Court in October 2018after a rancorous process in which claims emerged that he hadsexually assaulted women three decades ago. He emphatically denied the allegations. The FBI conducted a original background investigation into Kavanaugh that consisted of interviews with 49 people over the course of five days, Wraysaid. The bureau then did asupplemental background check after new information arose about a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that Kavanaugh had assaulted her when they were teens. As part of that process, Wraysaid, the FBI interviewed 10 people oversix days. But, hestressed, the inquiry was limited in nature, without the “authorities, policies and procedures” that would be used for an FBI criminal investigation. Lawyers for Fordsaid in astatement that the FBI’s letter established that the investigation was a “sham and a major institutional failure” and chastised the bureau for not interviewing Ford or acting on the thousands of tips it received about Kavanaugh.“Instead, it handed the information over to the White House, allowing those whosupported Kavanaugh to falsely claim that the FBI found no wrongdoing,”said the lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks.

Sima primarily made clothes for retail clothing for Kohl’s beforeshe was terminated on June 23 with every other worker at her factory, who were there for less than a year. She is one of the thousands of factory garment workers in Bangladesh laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as clothing retailer corporations in the United States and Europe have canceled orders.“I can’t pay my house rent. I’m having issues getting food for my family. This job was my onlysource of income,” Simashared. “Because of COVID-19, work orders decreased,so the factory doesn’t need that many workers. Some buyers didn’t pay bills on time. Others are asking for discounts while thousands of workers like myself are going to bed without food.”More than $3 billion worth of clothing orders in Bangladesh we recanceled due to the pandemic. The cancellations have impacted 2.28 million workers. Kohl’s alonecanceled$150 million in orders, around $50 million from Bangladesh factories, weeks before paying out $109 million in dividends toshareholders.“The temporary closure of all 1,159 Kohl’sstores caused us tosignificantly reduce our inventory to align with anticipatedsales. As a result, we made the difficult decision to cancel orders withsome of oursuppliers where we had the contractual right to doso,” a Kohl’sspokesperson told Shadowproof. The canceled orders mean Bangladeshi workers are faced with wage decreases and unpaid wages. Rintu Barua has worked for twenty years at a garment factory in Chattogram, Bangladesh that also produces clothing primarily for Kohl’s. Barua has only received 65 percent of hissalary from the factory in recent months and received only 50 percent of his bonus for Eid Mubarak in May 2020.“I haven’t been able to pay rent on my house for the past two months, and the owner is pressuring me to come up with the rent,” Baruasaid. According to Barua, garment factory workers in Bangladesh typically work 8 to 10 hours per week,six days a week. Many continued working during the pandemic to try to keep up with previous delivery dates and orders.“Every day there are a few factories getting closed. Thousands of workers have lost their jobs and thousands will lose their job within the next couple of months,” Barua added. “Workers are facing a really hard time andsome are leaving the city because they are now unable to afford the cost of living in the cities.”Some workers requested they remain anonymous for fear of retaliation as theystruggle with unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Salaries have been reduced and bonuses have been halved,”said a garment factory worker in the Gaizpur division of Dhaka, Bangladesh. “Factory management oftenstock their products in advance from our overtime. They always have an option to profit. But during COVID-19, theysaid that they have no money as orders are canceled.”For four years, the worker has been at the garment factory in Gaizpur making clothes forseveral companies, primarily Puma. The worker’s factory closed down for a month on March 26, and despite reopening, they only received 60 percent of theirsalary for March, April, and May, and have not received payment for the month of June.

The U. S. government has been aware of the approach of “Planet X” for over forty years, warns John Moore “The Liberty Man,” in a jaw-dropping new interview on. (See below.)While Planet X won’tstrike the Earth, it’s nearby approach will unleash cataclysmic consequences across our planet that may bring an end to human civilization as we know it, Moore explains in the interview. Those effects may include a global “poleshift,” which means the Earth’s crustslips to a new orientation, unleashing extreme winds, volcanoes, earthquakes, flooding, tidal waves and more.“Everystructure on thesurface of the Earth would be destroyed,” explains Moore, who reveals the governments of the world are frantically constructing more underground bunkers in anticipation of catastrophic events. John Moore is a former U. S. Army intelligence analyst and took part in 57 air combat missions over Vietnam and Cambodia. He later become a homicide detective for thestate of Missouri. As a long-time radio host, Moore has developed a long list ofsources inside government and the U. S. military. He hosts a radioshow each weekday from 8 – 10 am central time, via Republic Broadcasting. Learn all the details atTheLibertyMan.comAs Moore explains in the video below, the poleshift would place North America closer to the equator than its current position, and the “bulge” of ocean water at the equator (due to centrifugal forces of the rotating planet) would raise the level of the ocean by hundreds of feet compared to the continental United States. John Moore’s website — TheLibertyMan.com — hosts this map of anticipated changes. Note that Florida and much of the Easternseaboard are under water in this depiction:In the video below, John Moore explains how people living in other areas of the world can easily determine whether their current locations will be inundated with higher relative ocean levels. The Planet X fly-by would likely also bring asteroid impacts to planet Earth, causing global chaos and mass destruction as largespace rocks impact the planet at extreme relative velocities. A recentstudy found that just onesuch impact in any ocean would unleash 400-foot ocean waves that would devastate coastal cities around the world (and flood coastlines for potentially a hundred miles inland). Asteroids that impact the land could unleash large volumes of particulate matter into thestratosphere that would blocksunlight from reaching food crops, leading to mass famine and the collapse of human civilization. If large volcanoes also erupt due to the destabilization of the Earth’s crust, the amount of participate matter circling the globe could block out thesun and absolutely devastate nearly all plant life on Earth forseveral years. (Plants depend on photosynthesis viasunlight and carbon dioxide for energy, a fact that 99% of today’s climatescientistsstill refuse to acknowledge because they arescientifically illiterate brainwashed zombies.)The United States government is fully aware of the approach of Planet X but has chosen to withhold this information from the American people for thesimple fact that. Moore recommends people move inland and get above 500 feet in altitude in order tosurvive the ocean inundation of North America. See the full interview here:Direct Brighteon.com link:Brighteon.com/c0fdc799-ac8c-42a9-9447-69f3735e1147Censorship-resistant link (forsharing onsocial media):Brlghteon.com/c0fdc799-ac8c-42a9-9447-69f3735e1147As far as the timing of the return of Planet X, Moore explains that people who keep asking about the timing are those who refuse to prepare. Since the public isn’t being told about the timing,. Any who hope tosurvive the return of Planet X, whenever it occurs, must move away from coastal areas and construct Earth-bermed or undergroundstructures, thenstock them withsurvivalsupplies and prepare for a global food wipeout lasting 1-2 years. You won’t even be able to grow food,since thesunlight will be blocked by particulate dust in the atmosphere. Needless tosay, in thisscenario, as will all fiat currencies. The only things that have value from that day forward are gold,silver, firearms, ammunition, food, fuel, first aid, land and other “real” items. The Book of Revelation openly warns humanity about a fiery mountain falling out of thesky and impacting the ocean, devastating the planet and destroying a third of the world’sships. To follow this rabbit hole, research the terms “Wormwood” or “Nibiru.”Note that the areas of America which will be flooded first tend to cover the anti-God Leftists who mass murder babies,sexually assault children and worship Satan. Many people havespeculated that God will judge America’ssins by unleashing catastrophic events against this nation,similar to the fiery events described in relation to but on a much largerscale.

We know elections have unexpected consequences, even in the United States. The biggestsurprise in most of our lifetimes came four years ago with the ascendance to the White House of Donald Trump, a flamboyant billionaire real estate developer with no experience in politics or governing. His arrogance flaunted itself during his campaign in January 2016 when he proclaimed insignature Trump fashion, “I couldstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue andshootsomebody and wouldn’t lose any voters.”As a born and bred New Yorker, I’ve been to Fifth Avenue many times. It’s a lovelystreet, gliding along the eastside of leafy Central Park. St. Patrick’s Cathedral is there, near Rockefeller Center, its iceskating rink a winter lure. The avenue is home to the Easter Parade, which was canceled this year because of the coronavirus. It takes a particular mindset to project ascene ofshootingsomeone on one of New York City’s glorious thoroughfares as a means of attracting voters. Hisstatementserved as a preview of what was to come, a mini trailer to a 4-year-old horror film that would furrow the brows of world leaders. Trump frightened tens of millions of us with his racism, far right authoritarianism and ultranationalism bordering on fascism, division, chaos, lying and a narcissistic personality disorder behind it all that disrupted, disturbed and disheart end governments and people around the globe. But for the other dictators, that is. That President-elect Joe Biden defeated Trump in an historic election is a blessing.“When the Devil’s ambassador from Hell issoundly defeated, weshould all be crying tears of joy andsalvation,”said Robert Morgart, 76, an adjunct professor ofstrategic management at Highlands University in Las Vegas, N. M. More poignantly, CNN commentator Van Jones, who is Black, broke down crying on live TVshortly after the network broke the news that Biden had won. Hisstartling reaction echoed the relief felt about Trump’s defeat by the nearly 75 million people who voted for Biden, the most ever for president.“This is vindication for a lot of people who have reallysuffered,” hesaid. “You know, ‘I can’t breathe?’ that wasn’t just George Floyd. That was how a lot of people felt. They couldn’t breathe.”“Every day you are waking up,” Jonessaid, wiping away tears. “And you are getting these tweets, and you don’t know, and you go into thestore, and people who have been afraid toshow their racism are getting nastier and nastier to you. And you are worried about your kids. And you are worried about yoursister. Canshe go to Walmart and get back into her car withoutsomebodysayingsomething to her. And youspentso much of your life energy just trying to hold it together.”It’s understandable that he cried, for himself, his family, his country because “the character of the country matters. Being a good man matters. I want mysons to look at this.”Tears came as I typed those words. It hasn’t been easy for any of us who despised Trump for what he was doing to our beloved country, at home and abroad. And it isn’t over. It won’t be over until noon Jan. 20. There’s a lot ofspace between now and then for Trump to cause a great deal of mischief. We don’t know how he will react to his defeat. He already refused to concede, mountingspurious court challenges. Dr. Brandy X. Lee, a psychiatrist who taught Yalestudents and is the author of “Profile of a Nation: Trump’s Mind, America’s Soul,” emailed Salon diagnosing the president’s narcissism in reacting to loss:“. . . When there is an all-encompassing loss,such as the loss of an election, it can trigger a rampage of destruction and reign of terror in revenge against an entire nation that has failed him.“It is far easier for the pathological narcissist to consider destroying oneself and the world, especially its ‘laughing eyes,’ then to retreat into becoming a ’loser’ and a ‘sucker’ —which tosomeonesuffering from this condition will feel like psychic death.”It’s an understatement to warn that we could be in danger. And the Republican Party increased its numbers. The problem is in the Senate where its leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, may wield a great deal of power to thwart Biden’s agenda. He did that to President Barack Obama. And behind them all will be Trump,somewhere out there with thesupport of the more than 70 million people who voted for him. He needs to be controlled before historysuddenly is changed to a direction none of us want to go. Richard C.

Browse our archive of posts by topicBrowse our archive of posts on key right-wing groupsBrowse our archive of posts on key right-wing figuresRead in-depth reports on key people, organizations and issues on the RightIt was not a good weekend for anyone hoping that President Donald Trump and his allies mightsoon concede that Joe Biden won the presidential election. In addition to Saturday’s far-right“Stop the Steal” rally and a muchsmaller “Walk Away”gatheringon Sunday, Trump’s lawyers made the rounds on right-wing media claiming that they had irrefutable proof that the presidential election wasstolen by nefarious computersoftware designed for that purpose. On Sunday night, thousands of Trumpsupporters heard from asuccession of “prophets”—joined by Sen. James Lankford and pundit Eric Metaxas—who decreed that the exposure of this demonic corruption would beso explosive that it would be asign of divine intervention like God parting the Red Sea for Israelites fleeing Egypt’s armies, and that it would ensure that the U. S. Supreme Court would abide by the ruling of the Courts of Heaven and keep Trump in the White House for asecond term. Members of Trump’s legal team, includingRudy Giuliani,Sidney Powell, andJenna Ellisfanned out to push Trump’s unfounded claims that he won the election and it wasstolen from him. They pushed a conspiracy theory involving Dominionsoftware, which has already been debunked by theNew York TimesandFox News. As Mediaitenoted, Powell even insinuated that the CIA was involved. As Right Wing Watch has reported, Trump’s religious-rightsupporters have been actively promoting his claims about the election beingstolen from him, and many have continued to insist that God will yet intervene to keep Trump in the presidency for four more years. On Sunday night, anti-LGBTQ activist Jim Garlow hosted a prayer call ostensibly to pray on behalf of “election integrity”—hissixthsince the election and one of dozens being held by a variety of leaders and ministries, including White House aide Paula White. During the call, Garlowshowed a four-minute clip from Saturday’s march compiled by LifeSite news that included participants talking about putting Biden in jail and telling Trump not to concede “under any circumstances” and to “fight this to the death if you have to.”Garlow opened the call and turned it over to religious right activist Mario Bramnick, who noted that Dec. 14, the day that electors will vote to certify the results of the election, comes during Hannukah. “We decree and declare that the hammer of God would come to expose what Satan’s dominion is trying to take over,” Bramnicksaid. “Satan’s hammer is no match for the Maccabee of God, for the hammer of God. And I decree by December 14, we will be victorious exposing the fraud and that President Trump will be declared our president for another four more years.”Lankfordsaid, “ultimately, at the end of the day, God is the one who raises up and he is the one who puts down.” He prayed:Over and over again inscripture, your people called out andsaid, ‘God, may the unjust beshown to be unjust.’ You called out through the Old Testament over and over again for equal weights and that you hated unequal weights and measures wheresome people were measured one way, and other people were measured another. So God, I pray that you would bring in this election equal weights and measures and that anywhere where it is unequal it would be exposed in the light, and that we’d call it out and to be able tosee it for what it is. Garlowsaid he’d hoped to have Ellis on the call, butsince that didn’t work out he turned to Metaxas, who interviewed Ellis twice over the weekend. Metaxassaid that the “evidence” that Powell and Ellis have is “so explosive that I believe that we all need to be praising God that the election went this way.”Metaxas continued:In other words, what is going to be exposed isso extraordinary, that it is far more powerful than if Trump hadsimply won. I can’t really overstate that, Jim. In other words, God has arranged this. And when you talk to people who are in on this, like Jenna Ellis, and tosome extent, Sidney Powell, you realize that they haveseen the evidence. And I think that God is using them to encourage us and tosay that anytime anybody thinks, “Well, we don’t know how it’s going to go,” I think you need tosay “No.” There’s a level of injustice that has been done here. Tosteal votes to try to undermine our democracy issomethingso foul,so offensive, that’s going to harm human beings around the world, that we need to be angry. And we need tosay that we don’t care what it takes, we will pray till our knees bleed, we will pray and pray and pray because the Lord is calling us to pray, because he wants to dosomething. Jenna is right in with the president. Shespoke to him five times today. They know, they know that there was fraud, and they have the evidence, and the church needs to not just have patience and wait, but while we’re waiting to really pray. This is aspiritual battle—you all know this—unlike anything we’ve ever faced. Sidney Powellsaid, this is going to be like a new American Revolution. Thestuff that’s going to come out, it’s going to bestaggering. This issomething that God is doing—that God has done. He hasset things up to do this. And I feel like we’re against the Red Sea. And we need to praise God. He is going to part the Red Sea. He’s going to destroy Pharaoh’s army. We need to praise him and know that now. And the people that I’ve talked to, even just in the natural, they know they have the goods. There’s nobody moresober minded than Sidney Powell. She’s the lawyer for General Flynn—utterly brilliant,sober minded. Shesaidsome things on the Lou Dobbs program, and in other places that—she’s not just a talker, this is a woman who know. She hasseen the evidence. The nutshell version is that the Dominionstuff was designed for voter fraud. It’s not that it was used to defraud us in this election. It wasspecifically designed originally,so that it could be used for voter fraud in Venezuela, and I believeshesaid in Cuba. And the point is that this issomething that when it’s exposed, we’re going to be looking at a different landscape. It’s not just going to be that Trump will be president. It’s going to be a different landscape. So, I want tosay that to encourage people. We’ve got to praise God for what he is doing. We’ve got to praise God and don’t let anyonesay, “Well, who knows?” We cannot let thisstand. The prayers of God will be answered. We’ve got tostorm heaven because this cannotstand. Bramnick introduced Robert Henderson, who claimed earlier this year that God had made him Trump’s “spiritual running mate” and whop rayed on election night that God would dispatch an army of angels to prevent Democrats fromstealing the election in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Hesaidin October that Trump was chosen by God and therefore “should never be criticized” by Christians. Hendersonsaid that Christians need to plead Trump’s case in “the court of Heaven” to get a ruling that willsway the U. S. Supreme Court to reseat Trump as president, which “we all know is the intention of God.”Next up was Becca Greenwood, who talked about a visionshe had in 2019 that covered the five-year period through 2024, whichshesaid would bring “historic exposures” of corruption. It will look like “complete chaos,”shesaid, but it will be asign that God is cleansing the nation and that “the demonic grip of the enemy, of corruption, antichrist elitestructure, would let go of this nation.”The call continued for about two hours, with additionalspeakers from around the world makingsimilar assertions and decrees for God to ensure Trump’s reelection. Abby Abildness talked about “Jericho marches” taking place in Pennsylvania. She prayed that God would “bind everything that is in opposition to the holy governance of the Lord God Almighty, and you would loose this new era of a nation and nations founded on righteousness and justice.” She added a prayer the God would “establish justice at the gates of the Supreme Court of the United States.”Garlow’s wife Rosemary prayed that God’s coming action in the election would beso “mighty” that it willspark aspiritual revival:Hesays, “I’m coming out of Heaven, and I’mstepping on the on the land of your nation.” And even though the demoniacs come and react to my appearance, there is going to besuch a mighty deliverance in the United States of America and in the government, that when the Lord appears the fear of the Lord is going tostrike the nation insuch a way that the eyes of multitudes will be open. And though they were raging—we haveseen these people in person in DC, in a total demonic rage out of their mind—there is going to be a massive deliverance of multitudes of people, and their nakedness will be covered, there’ll be clothed insalvation, and they will come and be the greatest evangelists in our country and for the next revival, as God is now birthing this great End Time move of God. The Lordsays, “Just watch me. I’mstepping into your nation. I am coming with deliverance. Do not be afraid. Do not be timid. Have faith. I calm thestorm, and I am coming to deliver you from evil.”…And now, Father, we as your body, wesubmit ourselves to fulfill your word tosee and have faith that what you did will come to our nation. We will have this deliverance. We will have this breakthrough. You will take hold of these demonicspirits and cast them out of the premises of our country. And we will rejoice not only to receive our rightful president and have the evil exposed, but we rejoice even more for the precious people made in your image, who are going to come to know you, because of this time and because of these prayers and because of this experience. Among the prayer leaders from outside the U. S. was Jack Van der Tang from the Netherlands, who described an experience he had in 2017 in which God told him that he had chosen Trump. Van der Tang asked God for forgiveness for his country for having recognized Biden as president-elect.

Reached for comment, Amlen told the this is a ""private group"" and thatshe would ""appreciate it if you do not use anything Isaid or wrote.""The back-and-forth provides a window into the latest racial controversy roiling the paper, whichsaw a revolt among minoritystaffers over thesummer after publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.). Opinion editor James Bennet ultimately lost his job. McNeil’s ouster came nearly two years after the incident that precipitated it.

216,George Floyd's addiction could change how we talk about drug use and Black Americans,-5.0,46.33,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/04/03/derek-chauvin-trial-highlights-george-floyds-opioid-drug-addiction/4842554001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-03,22,"Like millions of Americans,George Floydlived with the torment of drug addiction. He and his girlfriend,Courteney Ross,became addicted to op io ids four years ago after both were prescribed the drugs for chronic pain. When the prescriptions ran out, they turned to illegal drug use,shesaid. They tried to go clean but failed. They tried again but could notstop for long. As the COVID-19 pandemicspread across the United States, Floyd, the father of two daughters,started using again during a dark time: he lost his job as a nightclubsecurity guard because of quarantineshutdowns, he was hospitalized forseveral days after an overdose, and he found out he had the coronavirus. On the day he died, his neck trapped under the knee of former Minnesota police officerDerek Chauvinfor more than nine minutes, he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in hissystem, toxicology reports latershowed.“We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,” Rosssaid tearfully Thursday during testimony in the Chauvin trial over Floyd's death. Floyd's death helped launch a global civil rights movement over racial injustice and police violence. The trial over his death couldsimilarlyshape how Americans view drug addiction at a time when Black people continue to overwhelmingly be denied medical treatment compared with white Americans even as theysuffer from disproportionately high rates of fatal op io id overdoses. Chauvin's defense attorney,Eric Nelson, hassought to persuade jurors that drugs – not Chauvin's knee pressing on Floyd's neck as he cried""I can't breathe""while handcuffed on the ground – contributed to Floyd's death. Prosecutors, family members and medical experts havesaid Floyd's history of addiction does not explain how he died. Chauvin, who is white, is charged withsecond-degree murder, third-degree murder andsecond-degree manslaughter in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man.""George was walking, talking, laughing, and breathing just fine before Derek Chauvin held his knee to George’s neck,” Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, lawyers for Floyd’s family,said in astatement Thursday morning. “Tens of thousands of Americansstruggle withself-medication and op io id abuse and are treated with dignity, respect andsupport, not brutality.”Drug use has been used to explain the deaths of other Black people who have died at the hands of police, including Michael Brown in Missouri,said Scott Nolen, director of the addiction and health equity program at the Open Society Institute-Baltimore, which works to reduce drug addiction. Structural racism leads people of color who use drugs to be wronglyseen as ""throwaways,"" hesaid. Andre Johnson, CEO of the Detroit Recovery Program, a drug addictionsupport program,said people relapse because of inadequate resources. The Chauvin defense ""reallysheds light on how people of color, Black people, are treated when they have an addiction. What they are failing to do is treat George Floyd as a whole person,"" Johnsonsaid. ""The fact that he used drugs is not why he died. He died because he was a big Black man and a white man did not value his life.""Lawyers in Derek Chauvin's murder trial focus on training, drug use and viral videoThe notion of treating drug addiction as a medical condition and not a moral failing became more widespread in the 2000s based on emerging research and as prescription op io id pain relievers became popular and thousands of white people began to die from overdoses. Unlike previous drug crises that primarily hurt low-income Americans and people of color, victims of op io id drug addiction were often portrayed by lawmakers and the media as ordinary white Americans who had fallen prey to a highly addictivesubstance.""One of the first things you notice is that when drug addiction, in particularly op io id addiction, becameseen as a white drug problem,suddenly people were deeply interested in the origin of your drug addiction – they were interested in originstories that made you not responsible,""saidEkow N. Yankah, a criminal law professor at Cardozo School of Law in New York City. ""Those originstories were never available to Black people, in particular Black urban dwellers. No one cared why you got hooked on drugs.""Insubsequent years, many Republican and Democratic lawmakers began to embrace legal marijuana, reducingsentences for low-level drug offenders and drug addiction treatment instead of criminal charges. The political movement has represented asignificant departure from federal drug policy of the past that often resulted in Black menserving longsentences for nonviolent crack cocaine crimes while white offenders who used cocaine got comparatively light jail time.""There is no question if crack had been a white kid's disease it would have ended up in treatment, but it ended up in everyone going to jail,""said Robert Stutman, thespecial agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's New York office during the 1980s war against crack cocaine. Of the more than 840,000 people who have diedsince 1999 from a drug overdose, more than 70% in 2019 involved an opioid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the op io id crisis has largely claimed white lives, opioid-involved overdose death rates in the Black community haveskyrocketed in recent years, federal datashow. The addiction journey of Ross, who is white, and Floyd could help Americanssee Black drug users in asympathetic light, medical and legal expertssaid.""They are ordinary drug users – they are ordinary peoplestruggling with drug use. Black people end up hooked on drugs for the exactsame reasons white people do,""said Yankah, the law professor. Many Americans now better understand that people grappling with drug addiction cannot easilystop abusingsubstances.""People use drugs for a variety of reasons, including managing physical and emotional pain. It's because of those many reasons that oftentimes it's hard tostop using,""said Sheila P. Vakharia, deputy director of the research and academic engagement for the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit based in New York. And yet Black people are often denied thesame lifesaving medical treatment as white Americans to address op io id addiction, researchshows. Onestudy foundBlack patients were 77% less likely to receive buprenorphine, a drug that limits the desire for opioids. Instead, Black Americans are often prescribed methadone, which requires most patients toshow up at a medical office every day to get the drug, asignificant barrier for low-income Americans, including many people of color, who do not work flexible hours or have access to transportation.""The way we give it to people is really terrible. Imagine if we madesomeone do that for their blood pressure medicine or their diabetes medicine,"" Vakhariasaid. For Americans without health insurance, both forms of treatment are often out of reach. And Hispanic, Asian and Black Americansare more likely to be uninsured than white Americans.""The impact of incarceration, arrests and marginalization, whichstem from racially motivated and punitive drug laws, adds to the physicalsuffering and makes it more difficult to get treatment and be treated humanely. It is these attitudes that give license to the Floyd defense team to try to paint him as worthless and 'sick' because hesuffered from addiction,""said Deborah Agus, executive director of the Behavioral Health Leadership Institute in Baltimore, which focuses on ensuring vulnerable populations have access to better addiction treatment. Datashows Americans are using heroin and fentanyl at thesame rate regardless of race or ethnicity, but the increase in opioid-related death rates among people of color is likely the result of disproportionate access to treatment for these groups compared with white Americans,said Dr. Pooja Lagisetty, a healthservices researcher at the University of Michigan whose researchshowed the disparity in buprenorphine treatment. Both the prosecution and defense took care while discussing Floyd's addiction. Such an approach would have been unimaginable two decades ago, medical and legal expertssaid. Nelson began his cross-examination Thursday of Ross with a display ofsympathy: “I’msorry to hear about yourstruggles with op io id addiction,” he began. “Thank you forsharing that with the jury.”Meanwhile, the prosecution's prompting of Ross to discuss howshe and Floydstruggled with drugs as opposed to downplaying the drug use was also atypical. In the past, drug use has been cited to villainize witnesses,suspects and those killed by police, especially when they were Black,saidseveral medical and legal experts.""I don't think a defense attorney in the '80s or '90s would havesaid, 'I'msorry you arestruggling with heroin or cocaine or crack' in those times when it was considered an inner-city drug,""said Yankah, of Cardozo Law. Floyd died on Memorial Day 2020 after police responded to a 911 call alleging he had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a conveniencestore. Three other former police officers who responded to the call face charges in Floyd's death. Chauvin defended his actions to a witness after Floyd's unresponsive body was taken away in an ambulance.""We had to control this guy because he's asizable guy. It looks like he's probably onsomething,"" Chauvin is heardsaying in a video. In contrast,Chauvin's own troubledpast, including 18 complaints filed against him in 19 years as a Minneapolis police officer, will not be the focus of the criminal trial because it could influence the jury against him. In her testimony, Ross, 45, described Floyd as a fun, kind man who offered to pray with her the first time they met, whenshe was visiting herson's father at a homelessshelter where Floyd was asecurity guard. Shesaid he was active and never had trouble breathing before his run-in with Chauvin. Keith Humphreys, a behavioralsciences professor at Stanford University in California and a former member of the George W. Bush White House Advisory Commission on Drug Free Communities,said that if Chauvin and other officerssuspected Floyd was high, theyshould have taken it moreseriously when hesaid he couldn't breathe because op io id use canslow respiration.""Even if he was addicted, he didn't deserve to be killed. Itshows the devaluation of the lives of people with drug problems,"" Humphreyssaid. ""Police take into custody millions of intoxicated people every year without this happening.""",2,2,USA Today
217,Don’t Let the Riots Legitimize Facial Recognition Tech,8.0,36.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/dont-let-the-riots-legitimize-facial-recognition-tech/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"Earlier this month, a pro-Trump mob unlawfully breached the United States Capitol, hoping to “stop thesteal” by interfering with the Electoral College vote count. In a positive deviation from the norm, Americans are coming together to denounce political violence, calling for theswift arrests of the perpetrators. What’s troubling, however, is law enforcement’s use of thesame invasive technologies that, just a few months ago, caused a wave of backlash and prompted big tech to terminate government contracts. While Americans rally around this national manhunt, theyshould keep a watchful eye on their Fourth Amendment rights. Sure, the rioters assaulted police officers in the name of a president who championed “law and order,” — their hypocrisy is astounding. But greater dangers lie ahead if we all followsuit and pursue accountability with an “ends justifies the means” mindset. Americans are eager tosee the rioters apprehended, not just because of what they did, but because of how they got away with it. There were thousands of rioters at the Capitol on January 6, yet the police only apprehended13 peoplet hat day. Since the incident, theFBI has arrested over 100 people and identified over 200suspects using aswath of data fromsocial media,surveillance cameras, and cellphones. More than140,000 photos and videos have been collected by the FBI and, according to Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, they are “scouring every one for investigative and intelligence leads.”These investigations areshrouded insecrecy—the FBI is not often forthcoming about its tactics—but there is evidence that local police departments, working collaboratively with the federal agency, are being aided by facial recognition tools. AnAlabama police department identifiedseveralsuspects from thesiege using technology provided by Clearview AI. On January 7, use of the company’s facial recognition technology increased by 26 percent. Clearview AI doesn’t have any contracts with private businesses. After public fallout and a flurry of lawsuits over the company’s collection of billions of online photos without consent, Clearview AI voluntarily terminated its commercial contracts. In ale gal filing from last year, the company committed to “cancelling the accounts of every customer who was not either associated with law enforcement orsome other federal,state, or local government department, office, or agency.” This means that police must be fueling the recentspike insearches. We’veseen this before. Police used facial recognitionsoftware to find and arrest protesters during the demonstrations for Michael Brown in 2014, Freddie Gray in 2015, and, most recently,George Floydin 2020. There is a growing, alarming pattern of facial recognition being used after protests. And until recently, this development had been hotly contested. But today, this technology’s application is being applauded. Talk about hypocrisy. Facial recognition tech is the cornerstone of modern, government masssurveillance andshould be met by thesamescrutiny upon each instance of police use. The Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from engaging in “unreasonablesearches andseizures.” According to the Supreme Court in the landmark case: “What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not asubject of Fourth Amendment protection. …But what heseeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.” Social media andsurveillance cameras, analyzed by facial recognitionsoftware, test the boundaries of law enforcement’s jurisdiction. The FBI has admitted to following the data trail, even though it blurs the distinction between private and publicspaces. The Supreme Court has not yet addressed facial recognition, though it has acknowledged that new technology challenges the Fourth Amendment and, in recent cases, has constrained the ability of police to engage insuchsearches. Facial recognitionsystems can also beinaccurate, resulting in false-positivescans for Asian, African-American, and femalesubjects. Inseveral instances, this technology has led police to arrest and jail innocent people. The events of January 6 were certainly atrocious, but celebrating mass arrests enabled by facial recognition, GPS tracking, and data collection yields no benefit for our country and heaps on hypocrisy after hypocrisy.

219,Who Is to Blame for the Death of Breonna Taylor?,9.0,29.4,https://spectator.org/who-is-to-blame-for-the-death-of-breonna-taylor/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-27,23,"Racism did not kill Breonna Taylor. She did not die from prejudice or discrimination. Her death was not caused by Confederate monuments orstatues of Christopher Columbus, nor could her death have been prevented bysocial-media hashtags. If you don’t know who Breonna Taylor was, theshort version of thestory is that the 26-year-old wasshot to death March 13 by police in Louisville, Kentucky, during a drug raid. The long version of thestory is rather more complicated, but Taylor’s death has been reduced to aslogan (“Justice for Breonna”) by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest movement. If you’re dating a drug dealer’s ex-girlfriend andsomebody busts through your door at 12:30 in the morning, what do you do?Likeso many other policeshootingsseized upon by this movement, BLM activists are interested in promoting a political narrative that ignoresspecific details of Taylor’s death. Most of the movement’ssupporters have probably never looked past theslogan-sized condensed version of thestory — an unarmed black woman killed in her own home by white cops — to ask whether racism had anything to do with her death. Certainly the national media have notsought to determine whether the facts of thissupport the BLM movement’s mythology of “systemic racism” as the one-size-fits-all explanation for policeshootings. Fear of being targeted by “cancel culture” plays a role insilencing all criticism of the movement, and therefore no one (no, not even Tucker Carlson) has questioned the BLM narrative of Breonna Taylor’s death.“Say Her Name” is one of theslogans that activists have connected to this Louisvilleshooting, but if we want to understand why policeshot Breonna Taylor, there is another name that needs to besaid — Jamarcus Glover. Glover is a 30-year-old narcotics trafficker who policesay was dealing crack cocaine and marijuana out of a “trap house” on Elliott Avenue in Louisville’s westside. According to a police affidavit, detectives had Glover and his accomplice Adrian Walker undersurveillance, and hadseen their car — a red Dodge Charger with Mississippi plates — “make frequent trips” from the Elliott Avenue “trap house” to an apartment 10 miles away on Springfield Drive. Detective Joshua Jaynes wrote in the affidavit that Glover was using the Springfield Drive apartment as his mailing address; Jaynessaid he had witnessed Glover pick up a postal package at the apartment; and, citing his “training and experience,” Jaynesstated his belief that Glover “may be keeping narcotics and/or proceeds from thesale of narcotics” at the Springfield Drive apartment. All of this wasstated in an application for asearch warrant of the Springfield Drive apartment where Breonna Taylor lived. Yousee, Jamarcus Glover was Breonna Taylor’s ex-boyfriend. They broke up a couple years ago, according to a lawyer for Taylor’s family whosaidshe maintained a “passive friendship” with Glover. This “friendship” apparently included allowing Glover to receive his mail at her apartment, and, although there is no evidence that Taylor was ever involved in Glover’s drug operation, the “training and experience” of Detective Jaynes led him to believe there must besome connection. This was convincing enough for Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Mary Shaw, who approved theso-called “no-knock” warrant for Taylor’s apartment, and also approved nearly identical warrants for the four other addresses linked to Glover’s drug operation, including the Elliott Avenue “trap house.”Louisville policeserved all five warrants almostsimultaneously,shortly after midnight on March 13. Glover was arrested at the Elliott Avenue address, but the raid on Taylor’s apartment went horribly wrong. Police Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who was part of the five-mansquad assigned toserve the warrant on the Springfield Drive address,said thesquad was told in a preliminary briefing that this was a “soft target” because Taylor was believed to be alone in the apartment. Therefore, Sgt. Mattinglysaid, the decision was made for officers to knock on the door and announce themselves as police, despite the authorization for a “no-knock” entry. Sgt. Mattingly knocked for about a minute, hesaid, before thesupervising lieutenant ordered them to “hit it,” using a battering ram to breach the door. Inside the apartment, however, Breonna Taylor was not alone. She had a new boyfriend visiting her, and they were watching a movie in her bedroom. The boyfriend, Kenneth Walker (no relation to Glover’s accomplice Adrian Walker) had a legally owned pistol, and when he heardsomebody pounding on the front door, he grabbed his weapon. Why? Because he was “scared to death,” believing that the person pounding on the door might be Taylor’s drug-dealer ex-boyfriend. Walker and Taylor emerged from the bedroom into the hallway of the apartment and, Walkersaid, Taylor called out, “Who is it?”The next thing that happened, in Walker’s description of the incident, is the door “comes off its hinges” — the police are busting in, but. If you’re dating a drug dealer’s ex-girlfriend andsomebody busts through your door at 12:30 in the morning, what do you do?Walker fired ashot, hitting Sgt. Mattingly in the thigh, and Sgt. Mattingly immediately returned fire, getting offsixshots. Two other officers also opened fire. In total, police fired at least 22shots, none of which hit Walker, but Taylor wasstruck eight times and died on thescene. Although a grand jury indicted Walker on a charge of attempted murder of a police officer,that charge was dismissed in Mayat the request of Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine. Last month, Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroederannounced the firing of Officer Brett Hankison, who hesaid “blindly”shot 10 rounds into Taylor’s apartment through “a patio door and window which were covered with material that completely prevented you from verifying any person as an immediate threat or more importantly any innocent persons present.” The department has placed Detective Jaynes, Sgt. Mattingly, and Officer Myles Cosgrove, who also firedshots during the incident, on “administrative reassignment.” The case is being investigated by the Justice Department and the FBI, as well as Kentuckystate officials, and Taylor’s family has filed a lawsuit against the city of Louisville. The city, meanwhile, has passed a law banning “no-knock” warrants. None of the facts of the Breonna Taylor case can be altered by protest marches or by Instagram memes. And the facts of the case, which may argue for changes in police training and procedures, offer no evidence of “systemic racism” as the explanation for Taylor’s death. Angry mobs blocking traffic or topplingstatues are not doing anything to bring about “Justice for Breonna.”So what are the protesters actually doing? What is accomplished, for example, byWNBA players walking off the courtin protest of the national anthem and dedicating theirseason to Breonna Taylor? She wasn’tshot because of Francis Scott Key’s lyrics about “bombs bursting in air” over Fort McHenry. She wasshot because of her “friendship” with her ex-boyfriend, the dope dealer. Her death was the result of a “key miscalculation” by police,CNN concluded after it assigned a team of investigative reporters to the Breonna Taylorstory. Racism had nothing to do with it, because if Louisville cops just wanted toshoot black people, why didn’t theyshoot Jamarcus Glover? The “trap house”suspect did not resist arrest and isstill alive. Why aren’t the mobs protesting against him? That might makesense, but it’s 2020, and nothing makessense this year.",1,0,The American Spectator

Now those chickens are coming home to roost. On,host Chris Wallace grilled Sen. Tom Cotton after the Arkansas Republicansaid the Senate “will move forward without delay” to confirm President Donald Trump’s nominee, who may be announced assoon as next week. Mid-interview, Wallace played back a 2016 clip of Cotton defending the Senate for refusing to consider President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, Merrick Garland. “Why would we cut off the national debate about this next justice?” Cotton asked in the clip. “Why would wesquelch the voice of the people? Why would we deny the voters a chance to weigh in on the makeup of the Supreme Court?”“If it was wrong then, nine months before the election, why is it okay now,six weeks before the election?” Wallace asked. In response, Cotton argued that election results in 2018 gave Senate Republicans a “mandate” to do, well, whatever the hell they want: “In 2014, the American people elected a Republican majority of the Senate to put the brakes on President Obama’s judicial nominations,” hesaid. “In 2018, we had a referendum on this question—just a month before the 2018 midterms, we had the vote on Justice Kavanaugh. There could not have been a clearer mandate, because the American people didn’t just elect Republicans, they expanded our majority. They defeated four Democraticsenators who voted against Justice Kavanaugh. They reelected the one Democraticsenator who did vote for Justice Kavanaugh.”Then Cotton went astep further, claiming that it was a matter of “constitutional duty” to both block Garland in 2016 and confirm a Trump nominee now: “We have a clear mandate to perform our constitutional duty. That’s what the Senate majority will do now. That’s what we did back in 2016, as well.”“You don’tsee any hypocrisy between that position then and this position now?” Wallace asked.“The Senate majority is performing a constitutional duty,” Cotton repeated, “and fulfilling the mandate the voters gave us in 2016 and especially in 2018.”It remains to beseen whether accusations of hypocrisy will have any measurable effect on Senate Republicans’ actions now. Sen. Susan Collins of Mainesaid yesterday the Senateshould wait for the election winner to pick Ginsburg’s replacement; on Sunday, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowskisaidshe would not vote to confirm a nominee before Election Day. Since Ginsburg’s death Thursday night, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been urging other fence-sitters to “keep their powder dry” and offering justifications —and potential talking points—for why thesituation with Ginsburg’sseat is actually, really, not at all likesituation with Garland.

The highlights this week: a look at adjustments to the that could relieve Latin America’s crippling COVID-19 debt, aChinese economic blow to Venezuela, and new heights forNicaragua’s crackdown on political opposition. Assome Latin American countries continue to battleCOVID-19surges, many are also weighing how they will repay debt burdens thatsignificantly increased during the pandemic. Latin America and the Caribbean’s regional debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 68.9 percent in 2019 to an estimated 79.3 percent in 2020, making it the most indebted region in the developing world. This week, Argentinaactivateda 60-day grace period to try to reach an agreement on debt it owes to countries in the Paris Club group of creditor nations. Argentina as well as other Latin American countries have faced public resistance to pre-pandemic International Monetary Fund programs to cut theirspending; the tax hike thatsparked Colombia’s ongoing protests was related tosuch a program as was the announcement of plannedspending cuts in Costa Rica that prompted protests in October 2020. Butspending cuts may exacerbate problems that pushed22 millionLatin Americans into poverty in 2020. Meanwhile, the green transitions required to meet countries’ Paris Agreement commitments require more, not less, publicspending. And delayed recoveries in low- and middle-income countries could act as a drag on the entire global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is especially influential over the region’s more vulnerable indebted nations. It loaned upwards of$66 billion to Latin American countries during the pandemic and also holdssway with bilateral lenders and private bondholders. Despite the fund’srhetoric, after the 2008 crisis, it did notsignificantlyeaseausterity programs that were required for IMF loans, andstricter austerity was associated with greater income inequality and poverty in borrower countries, according to research by Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. The IMFsaid it’s based its COVID-19 loans on expectations that countries will prioritizespending on issues like health,supporting the vulnerable, and climate change. To track that, Boston University’s research center created an index of the extent to which ongoing loan documentation continues to emphasize those policysteps; in Latin America, loans to 16 countriesscored an average of 2.14 out of 3 on health, 2.31 on protecting the vulnerable, and 0.67 on climate. Meanwhile, as the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) reported in March, most countries in the region have committed themselves to fiscal consolidation in the near future. The IMFprojectsmost Latin American countries will begin cutting their overall publicspending beginning this year and continue to doso until at least 2026. Institutions like the IMF are only part of Latin America’s debt picture. On bilateral debt, China has agreed to cooperate with Paris Club creditors as part of aG-20 agreement tosuspend debt for 73 low-income countries and build a common framework for debt restructuring—a departure from China’s usualstyle of negotiating debt relief apart from other creditors and with little transparency. This could be an importantstep toward more transparency on Chinese loans. The issue was discussed on a recent episode of thepodcast, featured on FP’s ownForeign Policy Playlist, in which researcher Bradley Parkssaid his team was able to examine rarelyseen Chinese loan contracts becausesome countries,such as Ecuador, had laws on the books requiring transparency. Parks praisedsuch laws, noting other lenders beyond China also fallshort on this topic. On the eve of the pandemic, more than half of Latin America’s external public debt was to private bondholders, according to the World Bank. The bondholders were not bound in any way tosuspend or restructure debts along the lines of the G-20’s common framework, although the IMF has called on them to doso. Argentina, Belize, Ecuador, and Suriname have restructured private bondholder debtsince the pandemic began. The details of all of the debt relief described above remain in flux, and together, theystill fail to fully addresssovereign debt pressures in Latin America. One more important measure on the horizon is the likely approval of $650 billion in IMF Special Drawing Rights, reserves that can be converted to currency. Additionally, World Bank chief economist Carmen Reinhartsaidon Tuesdayshe expects the G-20 framework for restructuring to be extended to middle-income countries. Could this moment lead to even more ambitious reforms of the global financialsafety net? Proposals abound, especially after policymakerssaw how effectively the U. S. Federal Reserve usedswap lines to prop upsome central banks and economies at the pandemic’sstart. (In Latin America,Mexico and Brazil benefited. In many countries that did not benefit, capital rushed out.)Former Federal Reserve international finance director Edwin Truman proposed a central bankswap network to temporarily increase IMF lending capacity. Costa Rica proposed an emergency fund financed by developed countries, offering 50-year loans free of fiscal and monetary conditionalities. Several Caribbean nations have proposed debt relief in exchange forsteps toward climate adaptation and “hurricane clauses” that would adjust debt repayments after extreme weather events. For now, given existing responses to Latin America’s pandemicshock, ECLAC wrote in March that the region’s economic andsocial development is likely to beset back for at least a decade. Mexico holds legislative and local elections. Peru holds its presidential runoff election. U. S. Vice President Kamala Harris begins visit to Guatemala and Mexico. Venezuela was recently blindsided by an announcement that China, the final buyer of most of Venezuela’s oilso Venezuela canskirt U. S.sanctions, will impose a $30 to $40 per barrel tax beginning June 12. Although Chinasaid the measure was based on environmental concerns, it could also be asign of deteriorating relations between the two countries. The final polls before Peru’s presidential runoff election this Sundayshowed a veryslight lead for left-wing candidate Pedro Castillo, though the gap between Castillo and his opponent Keiko Fujimori has narrowed over the course of the campaign. Fujimori was widely thought to have performed better in presidential debates. Argentina’s government made an 11th-hour decision to reject the hosting of the Copa Américasoccer tournament over COVID-19 concerns.

She was accused of money laundering among other charges, whichshe called asham, to keep her from running. Nicaragua’s attorney general has askedshe be banned from the election. The arrest came around two weeks after police raided Chamorro’s brother’s independent media outlet and is in the wake of new anti-democraticrestrictionssurrounding the November election. (Chamorro has a political family; her mother defeated Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega in a 1990 election.) Nicaragua has mostly ignored calls from the Organization of American States (OAS) to implement meaningful electoral reform after its brutal repression of the 2018 protests that kicked off the current political crisis. Most Latin American leaders did notsay anything about the dramatic turn of events,symptomatic of the region’s fragmentation and lack of international engagement. Exceptions included condemnations from Costa Rica’s foreign ministry and from Venezuelan opposition figure Juan Guaidó. The OAS issued astatement of concern, and U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkendenouncedthe ban on Chamorro’s candidacy in a tweet. As Ortega beats back challenges inside Nicaragua, international pressure may be one of the few ways to get him to change course. Washington, for its part, has focused much of its Central America messaging around anti-corruption and promoting good governance but until now has mostlysteered clear of Nicaragua.

He hasn't — leaving health insurance companies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies to work overtime to blockstates from passing their own public options. Aetna is among the multiple insurance companies opposing new legislation for a public option for health care. (Montgomery County Planning Commission / Flickr)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. When PresidentJoe Bidenoutlined his legislative priorities during his first address toCongresslast month, notably absent was a major campaign promise: a public health insurance option. Instead, his current health reform proposal will funnel $200 billion more to private insurance companies tosubsidize premiums, without any requirement that they cap out-of-pocket costs or eliminate them altogether. As a result of Biden’s approach,states have been left to introduce public option legislation themselves, in the process taking onsome of the nation’s largest and most politically organized businesses. From coast to coast, health insurance companies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies are using every tactic at their disposal to blockstates from passing public option legislation. Such effortsshow how determined the industry is to block anysort of reform that threatens its massive profits. In particular, the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future Action (PAHCF Action), thestate arm of the dark money group that has opposed Medicare for All and a public option at the federal level, hasspent millions of dollars on TV ads and mailers in Colorado, Connecticut, and otherstates where public option bills are being considered. The group hasspent more on lobbying in Colorado in 2021 than any other organizationsince 2011, and possibly ever. As a result, the actual public option component of the Colorado legislation was removed in an agreement made with the hospital industry. What’s left of the bill is a requirement that private insurers offerso-called “standardized” health insurance plans and cut premiums on those plans by 18 percent over three years. Despite the overhaul, the industry has continued to oppose the plan.“It’s a little intriguing to me that this is becomingsuch a big deal, because the bill is actually very narrow,” Rep. Dylan Roberts, the leadsponsor of the Colorado legislation, told the before the bill was watered down. He added, “It’s not a total overhaul of the health caresystem in Colorado or in the United States by any means. So the opposition to me is a little intriguing on that front.”In Colorado, PAHCF Action issmashingstate lobbying records byspending millions of dollars to kill its public option proposal. The organization is running a full-scale advocacy campaign, blanketing the television airwaves and filling people’s mailboxes with propaganda. While PAHCF Action’s donors are not public, its board includes top executives from lobbying groups for investor-owned hospital chains and health insurers. The organization’s president is Chip Kahn, who leads the Federation of American Hospitals. His group lobbies for hospital chains like HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare. HCA reported $3.5 billion in profit last year, and its CEO made $83.6 million, according toAxios. The hospital chain ownsseven hospitals in Colorado, including one that drew national headlines in 2019 for billing an emergency room patient more than $12,000 to treat a hangover after his bachelor party. While HCA does not disclose its political contributions, Tenet has reported donating nearly $2.9 million to PAHCF between 2018 and 2020, according to company politicalspending disclosures. Tenet has a dozensurgery centers in Colorado, according to its website. PAHCF Action’ssecretary is David Merritt, asenior executive at America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), which lobbies for big health insurers like Aetna. CVS Health, which owns Aetna, donated $5 million last year to the national Partnership for America’s Health Care Future (PAHCF), according to reporting by the. The dark money group isn’t alone: 149 individual lobbyists in thestate are registered as opposing the legislation. These lobbyists represent AHIP, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, UnitedHealth Group, and Kaiser Permanente, among other corporate interests. Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s political advocacy arm, hassixteen lobbyists alone registered in opposition of the bill. These influence peddlers have already hadsignificantsuccess. Last year, lobbyists helped kill a public option proposal in thestate. This year, legislators proposed ascaled-down version of the public option plan, one that would allow thestate toset up a public option in two years if private insurers failed toset upstandardized plans that meet certain cost criteria. But even this legislation was derailed byspecial interest groups. In late April, lawmakers removed the public option component from the bill following negotiations with insurance industry lobbying groups and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) of Colorado, which opposed the bill. The SEIU Local 105 argued that the premium-cutting measures in the legislation would lead to layoffs of health care workers at hospitals.“Even as the bill has changed, they’ve had thesame generic talking points about a government takeover of health care that doesn’t reflect what’s actually in the bill,” Robertssaid. The health care industrystill opposes the bill, even in its weakenedstate. On May 12, two days after the modified bill passed the Colorado House, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA), a Koch-affiliated political advocacy group, announced an “ad blitz” to oppose the legislation as it moves forward. Theirso-called “No Big Handouts for Big Insurance” campaign will involve astatewide ad campaign targeting the rate-setting element of the legislation, according to a TPA press release. The idea that big insurers would benefit from the legislation is more than a little dubious, given that health insurance lobbyists are helping lead the campaign to kill it. Connecticut has long been a flash point in the battle over a public option. Hartford, thestate capital, is known as the “Insurance Capital of the World,” because a number of the world’s largest insurance companies — Cigna, The Hartford, Chubb, and until recently Aetna — are headquartered there, and are also major employers. The industry has used its presence in thestate as leverage to kill public option efforts. In 2019, Cigna reportedly threatened to leave if thestate passed public option legislation. Between that threat and a massive lobbying effort by the insurance industry against the legislation, the bill never passed. Now the industry is doing it again. Last month, the CEOs of Anthem, Cigna, CVSHealth, Tufts Health Plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and UnitedHealth Group wrote a letter to Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, thanking him for opposing the legislature’s public option legislation and implicitly threatening to leave thestate if it passes.“The pandemic has demonstrated that employees can work virtually, making it easier for companies to choose where they are domiciled and grow,” the lettersaid. “As a result, it has never been more critical for the State to create a climate that retains and attracts businesses that will helpstabilize the economy. All of us will have to decide where it will be best to deploy our resources long term. Private employers and taxpayersshould not fund unsustainable public policy pursuits.” (When CVS acquired Aetna in 2018, it promised to keep Aetna headquartered in Hartford for at least a decade, and retain itsstaffing levels at least until 2022.)UnitedHealth Group, whose CEOsigned the letter to Lamont, held a we bin ar in February to train its employees to lobby against the legislation, the previously reported. According to the PAHCF Action’s first quarter lobbying report in Connecticut, the group hasspent roughly $126,000 on lobbyingso far this year, including about $95,000 on compensation and $31,000 onsolicitations. Beyond PAHCF Action, health insurance companies and businesses are also engaged in lobbying through other front groups or direct lobbying on the public option legislation. The Connecticut Hospital Association, whose members include dozens of hospitals as well as insurance companiessuch as Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, hasspent $296,000 on lobbying during the first quarter of this year, according tostate filings. Meanwhile, the Connecticut Association of Health Plans hasspent $133,000 on lobbying and $1,200 on paid media during the first quarter of this year, according tostate filings. The group’s president is Tim Meyers of Aetna, the insurance giant owned by CVS, and its treasurer andsecretary work in government relations for ConnectiCare and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, respectively. The opposition’s talking points don’t reflect what the bill would actually do,says Tom Swan, the executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, a group advocating for the public option legislation. “A lot of their campaign is just railing against a bill that doesn’t exist,” Swansaid.“They’resaying, ‘don’t let them do a one-size-fits-all health insurance option,'”said Swan, who added that in truth, the bill includes multiple different public option plans and does not interfere with the private insurance industry’s capacity to operate. Without action on health care at the federal level, morestates may try to take on the health care industry and its national advocacy groups themselves. Nevada, astate with one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation, recently introduced its own public option bill — and PAHCF Action immediately launched an operation to kill it. This is the third in a multi partseries onstate-level health care reform. Read the otherstorieshereandhere. You cansubscribe to David Sirota’s investigative journalism project, theDaily,here.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the Kentucky lawmakersaid, “I think de funding the police has gotta be one of the dumbest ideas eversurfaced by anyone in our country.”Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell:“I think de funding the police has gotta be one of the dumbest ideas eversurfaced by anyone in our country.”pic.twitter.com/JxvoXLvtEw— The Recount (@therecount)June 1, 2021The phrase ‘defund the police’ gained fresh attention last year as protests against police brutality and racism erupted around the country following the death ofGeorge Floydin Minneapolis. While the phrase was widely adopted by protesters, the idea remains unpopular among wideswaths of the population. Just weeks after Floyd’s death, aReuters/Ipsos poll found that 39% of respondentssaid theysupport the push to de fund the police, while 57%said they oppose it. And roughly a year later, aUSA Today/Ipsos poll found that just 18% of respondentssaid theysupport de funding the police, while 58%said they oppose the push. A majority of white Americans, 67%,said they oppose de funding the police, and 84% of Republicanssaid thesame. Meanwhile, just 28% of Black Americans and 34% of Democratssaid theysupport de funding the police. Some Congressional Democrats have championed the push to de fund the police and are goingso far as to call for the abolition of the police. After the fatalshooting of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota in April, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.)tweeted, “It wasn’t an accident. Policing in our country is inherently and intentionally racist. Daunte Wright was met with aggression [and] violence. I am done with those who condone government funded murder.”“No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can’t be reformed,”she added. But, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.)pushed back on the idea during an interview with CNN. Hesaid, “We know, the bottom line here, we do need law enforcement in this country forsafety andsecurity in our homes and our neighborhoods and our cities.”“But we must demand of law enforcement with all the par that is given to an individual officer that this type of racial conduct be purged from law enforcement,” he added. PresidentJoe Bidenclaimedduring a Zoom call with civil rights leaders in December that Republicanssuccessfully weapon i zed the “defund the police” phrase during the 2020 election to “beat the living hell out of us across the country.”Still, hesignaled his desire to makesome progress on police reform.

He rarely goes outside and when he does, hesays he is prone to panic attacks and bouts of body-shredding paranoia.""Some days I feel I am ok, then the other day (I am) breaking down. I amshaking you know, it is like a rollercoaster. It's ups and downs. I amso traumatised, I think I cansay,"" hesays. The 22-year old universitystudent was utterly unprepared for the moment at the end of July when he was. The experience has changed his life, challenged his thinking, and placed him on a new path, dominated by thesearch for accountability. Mr Muchehiwa was waiting for his nephews in the car park of ashop called Tile and Carpet in the Zimbabwean city of Bulawayo, when a group of men, thought to be members of thesecurityservices, pulled up and took him away. He wasstuffed in the back of a vehicle and driven round the corner, then transferred into the back of a Ford Ranger pick-up by his abductors. Three days of physical and mental torture, andsexual humiliation, would follow. Zimbabwe: At least 100 elephants die in national park amid droughtHundreds of unaccompanied children on buses intercepted in South African anti-trafficking operationMysterysudden deaths of endangered African elephants nowsolved,scientistssayA local lawyer, called Nqobani Sithole, may havesaved his life. He got a court order, instructing's police force (ZRP) and the criminal investigation department (CID) to find and return him. Mr Muchehiwa was dumped on theside of the road,sporting horrific flesh wounds, damaged kidneys, and a very different understanding of the world. Hesays he is not exactlysure why he was taken. His politicalsympathies lie with the opposition MDC-Alliance, but he is not a party member. His interrogators repeatedly asked about his uncle, Mduduzi Mathuthu, who runs a website which publishes articles and investigations which are critical of the government. However, he could not provide the information - for example on Mathuthu'ssources - that they wereseeking. Seekingsanctuary and treatment for the damage he hassuffered, he foundsafety in neighbouring. He got himself a place tostay in ascruffy, unlit corner, but has had to leave this hidingspot on occasion. Nightmares andsuicidal thoughts have robbed him of hissleep and a team at a psychiatric clinic are trying to help him. In recent weeks, Mr Muchehiwa hasstarted thinking about his future and the prospects for young Zimbabweans like him.""You know, my abduction is just one in a thousand andsomething must be done tostop the Zimbabwe government,"" hesays.""They know exactly who abducted me, they know the perpetrators, they know the people involved, they have all the details in black and white.""Civil rights organisations and human rights lawyerssay dozens of government critics, union officials, and political activists have been abducted in Zimbabwe over the last few years. Yet the incident involving Tawanda Muchehiwa is different in one crucial respect - it is the first abduction to be caught on CCTV. Aseries ofstreet-side cameras captured the operation outside Tile and Carpet, with one camera even capturing the licence plate number on the Ford Ranger pick-up used by a member of the abduction team. The vehicle registration, AES 2433, was traced to a car rental company called Impala, and activists have called on the firm to release the name of the person who rented it. But Impala has repeatedly declined. When the head of Zimbabwe's nationalstudent union, Takudzwa Ngadziore, called on Impala to release the information in a press conference held outside one of their branches, he was attacked and beaten by unknown assailants. Later, the ZRP charged Mr Ngadziore with ""promoting public violence"" and held him in custody for five weeks. Mr Muchehiwa, along with his lawyer, have also tried to get the name, obtaining an order from Zimbabwe's High Court which instructed Impala to provide it. But Impala's lawyerssaid they could not hand it over because police had already ""seized"" the relevant file. Mr Muchehiwasays this explanation borders on the absurd.""Thesheriff went there to collect the documents and Impalasaid they no longer have the documents - you know it is justso ridiculous,"" hesays.""How can a company like Impala fail to have maybesome back-up copies of that information? You know that your car was used to commit a crime against humanity... how can (they)say, we are going to give the information to the police, and thesame ZRP who are implicated in my abduction?""Sky News has discovered that the man who runs Impala, Thompson Kanganwirai Dondo, is a fugitive from British justice. He ran a nursing agency in the UK, but left the country after he was charged with immigration offences in 2007. In astatement, Cleveland Police told Sky News: ""Our records confirm that this individual is wanted on warrant for failure to appear at court in 2007 for alleged immigration offences.""If he attempted to re-enter the UK from abroad, he would be placed before the courts.""Sky Newssought a response from Mr Dondo and a companyspokespersonsaid: ""The CEO has indicated that he legally left the UK as the court case dragged on for more than 13 months.""He legally left the UK as he had no means tosustain his livelihood following the closure of his company.""In respect of the name of the person who hired the Ford Ranger pick-up, Impalasaid: ""The vehicle with the number plate AES 2433 had been hired from our company by an individual whose name, together with all required documents, we forwarded to police to facilitate investigations on the matter.""As Tawanda Muchehiwa tries to pick up the pieces of his life in a battered-looking dwelling in South Africa, hesays he is re-evaluating what to do with his life. Hesays he no longer wants to finish his mediastudies degree. It would better tostudy the law he argues, if he wants to learn how to protect it.""Three days of being tortured, three days not knowing what is going to happen to you, people discussing about how they are going to kill you, in a way it really changes your mind, and I think in my case, it made me tosee that there is nothing to live for if you don't have freedom,"" hesays. The Zimbabwean government has not commented on Tawanda Muchehiwa's claims, although aspokesman for President Emmerson Mnangagwa has accused people of fakingsuch incidents in order toseek funds from western donors. Furthermore, the government is proposing legislation which would criminal ise those who make unproven allegations of abductions and torture. But this young exile will not besilenced.",1,2,Sky News

229,New York Cannabis Legalization Deal Imminent,-9.33,40.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/26/new-york-cannabis-legalization-deal-imminent/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,17,"On Thursday, March 25, New York lawmakers reached a deal to legalize marijuana in thestate. But despite early reports, advocates claim the ink is not dry. From bits and pieces making it out of the back room discussions, the dealsounds promising. David C. Holland of the New York City Cannabis Industry Association jumped on the phone with us to clarify where the effortstood, as the rumor mill reached its peak Thursday. The NYCCIA is currently described as a think tank waiting to transition into an industry trade group. But it hopes to retain its ethos as it moves forward as the metro cannabis industry expands.“I’m not reading tea leaves anymore. It’s definitely a lot of hearsay thatsounds all very good,” Hollandsaid. “It looks like the governor hassort of conceded a lot to the Legislature and its MRTA (Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act) proposal.”Gov. Cuomo’s original legalization plan, the Cannabis Regulation Taxation Act, was attached to the budget in January. As lawmakers worked to hammer out a budget deal by April 1, legalization was always in play. But eventually, things progressed to where we could be talking about a vote next week after the bill has had a few days toseason. Holland explained that in recent years, while the Cuomo administration worked on the legalization issue, in the end it didn’t want to leave other budget goals hostage to cannabis legalization. “He pulled it out knowing that the votes weren’t there for that. It was too big asticking point,” hesaid. Once Albany lawmakers enter the legislativesession on April 1, they are expected to file their counter-proposal to the governor, the Marijuana Revenue and Taxation Act, as they have in years past. “The fundamental difference between them is basically the board that governs the program for the governor’s proposal is five hand-picked people that the Legislature has nosay,” Hollandsaid, expecting whatever the final compromise looks like willsee the governor’s administration givesome room there. “In this new hybrid we’re hearing about, the governor has three, but at least there’s mixed power. Thesecond big difference under those proposals is not only who controls the program but how are those revenues are divided up and for what projects.”We asked Holland if the deal that’s reached includes the effective mechanisms for community reinvestment like equity programs and homegrown, two things that felt absent in a tangible way in the budget plan. “I think it looks much better than what had been proposed by the governor, yeah,” Holland replied. “I mean, this is definitely a ‘don’t let the perfect be the enemy the good’situation, but it’s a long way from being optimal, you know? There’sstill lots of room for improvement.”Hollandsaid every time he gets another little tidbit of detail it allsounds very positive. “Yousee it all in the hearsay that you’re getting there. Each time I hearsomething, it’ssomething dramatically new.”Holland explained that whatever deal is reached, it’s not legalization that comes out of the conference room. The resulting bill from the deal then has toseason for three legislative days that they’re insession on the floor before it can be voted on. “I think what they’re doing is rushing to get it out and get it voted on early next week before the budgetsession ends and the legislativesession begins,” Hollandsaid. Hollandspoke to whether he thought an appropriate level ofstakeholder input from the grassroots level was coming in. Hespoke from the activistside as director at Empire State NORML and an advocate trying to help businesses lay their foundations for what’s to come. “I definitely feel things like homegrown, things like expungement, particularly tax rates tosome degree, the community investment, the opportunities, the prioritization of equity applicants, I think that’s all very much a product of the advocacy communities,” Holland replied. The Drug Policy Alliance’sstate director Melissa Moore expects tosee the deal done by the end of the month. “Itsounds like it’s extremely close. It’s down to justsome real technicalities,” Moore told theVillage Voice. “From what I understand, the conceptual agreement is there, and we’re looking forward toseeing the bill language.”We asked Moore ifshe’d heard how much flexibility advocates were able to get from the governor’s office on the deal. She told us that itsounded like much of the discussion was born from the legislature’s efforts. “We’ve longsupported [the Legislature’s version], which has much better provisions in terms of community reinvestment andsocial equity, dealing with all of the consequences, and ongoing lifelong impacts that people have had to deal with because of prior cannabis criminalization,” Mooresaid. “And truly, you know, ushering in a new era of marijuana justice for New York. Assuming the bill matches up with that, once it’s printed, we’re really excited about it.”More:cannabisNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

Greg Abbott for his Thursday order that allowed local election officials toset up just one mail ballot drop-off location per county. The lawsuit, filed Thursday evening, alleges that the new policy — which was announced the day beforeseveral drop-off locations werescheduled to open — is a violation of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment and the Voting Rights Act.“The impact of this eleventh-hour decisions is momentous, targets Texas’ most vulnerable voters—older voters, and voters with disabilities—and results in wild variations in access to absentee voting drop-off locations depending on the county a voter resides in,” the lawsuitsaid. “It also results in predictable disproportionate impacts on minority communities that already hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis.”County election officials from Harris County, Travis County, Fort Bend County and El Paso County are also named as defendants in thesuit, as is Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs. The lawsuit notes that counties like Travis and Harris — which have populations larger thansome U. S.states and alsosprawling geographies — had planned to offerseveral locations for absentee voters to drop off their ballots. Before Thursday’s proclamation, the county election officials “were given no notice that they would be required to change their election operations in under 24 hours,” the lawsuitsaid. Texas has been extremely resistant to making voting easier in the pandemic — it is one of a very few number ofstates not letting fear of COVID alone count as an excuse to vote absentee — but Abbott did issue orders earlier this year extending the period for in-person early voting as well as the period voters would have tosubmit their mail ballots in person. The latest proclamation undermines that initiative, and came after Abbott faced a backlash from members of his own party whosued him in court over the moderate voter access measures had taken in light of the pandemic. The new lawsuit alleges that “Abbott has provided no meaningful justification for the one-per-county limit on drop-off locations” and that the proclamation’s invocation ofsecurity was “unexplained.”“Defendants’ insistence that every county in Texas provide only asingle absentee ballot drop box—regardless of geographicalsize or population—requires that counties provide voters with disparate access to the franchise. Texas’s 254 counties vary dramatically in both physicalsize and population,” the lawsuitsaid.”The use of county lines as the delineation for the number of voting resources that may be provided is therefore arbitrary.”The counties thatstand to take brunt of the negative impact of Abbott’s order are those that have disproportionately high minority populations. The lawsuit alleges that the limits violate the Voting Rights Act because “because they deny and abridge the right to vote on account of race and language minoritystatus.”Read the lawsuit below:",2,1,Talking Points Memo

The latest executive order details different restrictions for pro and collegesports than from youth and highschoolsports. TheGiants, Jets, and Rutgers football have all been playing to nof ans despite the previous caps. And Rutgers announced i twill have nof ans this winter for basketball or wrestling, either. But in case there’s a chance other colleges or the Devils having fans if the NHL resumesJan. 1 as planned, here are the guidelines under the new executive order:The limits are a bit morestrict for youth and highschoolsports in New Jersey:The order has alreadysparked confusion over what the limits mean for Thanksgiving football games — heavily attended events on on the highschoolschedule. The order explains college and pro athletic programs are “readily able to establish comprehensive protocols for the athletes participating within their programs, including by placing limitations on outside activities,subjecting participants to regular testing, and requiring athletes to reside in aspecified location.”Murphysaid Monday that it does not give him “any pleasure to institute these restrictions.”“I, for one, have ason whosesports events I may now not be able to attend,"" the governorsaid during his latest coronavirus briefing in Trenton. ""As a parent, I understand the importance of watching our kids play and the thrill of cheering them on. But, right now, with the numbers we areseeing, we have to take thesesteps to preserve and protect — as best we can — public health and to try toslow thespread of this virus.”Murphy added that “indoorsports is an area of concern” andsports “generally is an area of concern.”Thestate had recently banned all indoor interstate organizedsports up to the highschool level to fight the virus. Still, the governorsaid it’s “very hard to distinguish” whether it’s from the actualsporting event or pre- or post-game activities — “whether it’s the locker room or a pizza party.”Murphy alsosaidspecifically that “hockey is in our crosshairs.”“I’m notsure why, but we are hearing more than anecdotal, more than here or there, a lot of noncompliance, including by parents,” hesaid. “I’ve got nothing against hockey, but watch yourselves. We have that high on the list right now. And unless wesee better compliance and lower levels of infection, we will take action.”CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:Live map tracker|Newsletter|HomepageIndoor religiousservices and celebrations, political activities, weddings, funerals and memorialservices, and performances in New Jersey will continue to be limited to 25% of capacity but with a maximum of 150 people. Indoor dining will also remain limited to 25% capacity, Murphysaid. The governorstressed that even in outdoor gatherings, people arestillsubject tosocial-distancing restrictions and required to wear masks when it’s not possible to keep your distance from others. New Jersey reported 3,399 new cases Friday, 4,395 on Saturday, 4540 on Sunday, and2,232on Monday. Both Saturday and Sunday’s cases broke records — but with a caveat. Thestate’s testing capacity in thespring was about 4,000 tests a daily, while current daily testing ranges from between 15,000 to 55,000 a day, according to thestate Department of Health’s COVID-19 dashboard. That means there were likely many more cases in thespring that went undetected. Hospitalizations arestill far below the more than 8,000 patients New Jersey had in April and deaths haveso far not risen at the rate they did in thespring. Still, hospitalizations are at their highest levelsince June, daily percent positivity issteadily climbing and officials warn deaths are likely to increase. There were 2,320 patients hospitalized in New Jersey with confirmed orsuspected coronavirus cases as of Monday night — the mostsince May 30. Thestate reported 14 more deaths Monday. The executive ordersays that about 13% of all outbreaks in New Jersey between March 20 through Nov. 1 came from private gatherings. Murphy has instituted a number of other restrictions to help fight thespread. New Jersey bars and restaurants are now required to close indoor dining between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. each day. Plus, the governor has given local governments the choice to institute 8 p.m. business closings if they want.

Courtesy of Anat Sultan-DadonAs a group of Orthodox Jews walked home following Shabbatservices last week insuburban Atlanta, two days after a cease fire ended 11 days of conflict between Israel and Hamas, a man walking in another direction made the Nazisalute and yelled, “Hamasshould have killed you all.”Thatsame day, Rabbi Chaim Neiditch was walking home fromsynagogue with his wife and four young children when a motoristslowed down and yelled at them, “Free Palestine!”“I didn’tsee him and I didn’t think anything of it, but my wife is vice president of thesynagogue andshe informed thesecurity team there,” hesaid. Leslie Silverman, who also lives in the community,said her family has not been targeted but thatshe has told her 10 and 12-year-old daughters that from now on when they go out they must “walk with a friend — they cannot walk by themselves. Isaid they must be aware of theirsurroundings. Ifsomeone drives by, rolls down the window andsayssomething, theyshould turn and run to the nearest house and tell a grownup right away. Most of my friends are having thesame conversation with their children.”The number of antisemitic incidents in the United States hasspikedsince Hamas fired a barrage of long-range rockets at Jerusalem earlier this month, prompting Israel to respond with targeted attacks on the Gaza Strip. The Secure Community Network, which advises Jewish communities onsecurity matters, recorded an 80 percent jump in incidents this monthstemming from the Mideast conflict. Gavin Ellman, who heads thesecurity committee at Congregation Beth Jacob in Atlanta, observed that when these incidents firststarted in this heavily Jewish community of Toco Hills, “people weresurprised because it is notsomething we normallysee. If yousee a fire orsomeone being attacked, you call 911. But when you get yelled out, people’s first instinct is not to call 911.”The importance of parentsspeaking with their children about what is happening cannot be understated, according to Norman Blumenthal, a psychologist and the Zachter Family Chair in Trauma and Crisis Counseling at Ohel Children’s Home and Family Services in New York.“The first thing you have to do as a parent is to have a position yourselfso you are clear where youstand,” hesaid. “It’s like when you are on an airplane and they tell you to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you do your child. So talk it over with yourspouse first.… The kids are watching you, not just listening to your words. They are listening to the quiver in your voice. If you tell them there is no danger and you areshaking, they will think there is danger; you are not going to fool your children. They read us like books.”The challenge today is that although there is an increase in antisemitic assaults — both physical and verbal — most Jews aresafe.“You have to have a nuanced message,” Blumenthalsaid. “You can’tsay this is another Kristallnacht. On the other hand it is not assafe as it was a few weeks ago. We have to take precautions we haven’t in the past. On the other hand we don’t have to crawl into our basement with a gun.”Blumenthal, who on June 1 willspeak at a free Zoom we bin ar at 8:30 p.m. about helping children cope in increasinglyscary times (register at: Ohel Webinar),said parentsshould have different messages based on their child’s temperament. A child who has a tendency towards anxiety would be asked to calm down first before telling him what is going on. And a child who is a daredevil and whosays he will fight back must bescared more. In addition, parentsshould have different messages depending on the age of the child. Rabbi Adam Starr, center, at a pro-Israel rally in Atlanta. Blumenthalsaid he found that the “venom against Israel and Jews is way disproportionate” onsocial media, which is “scary to young people who are reading it. It needs to be processed with their parents. Even if they are not physically threatened, they are threatened by the messages on thesite.”Rabbi Neiditch, who is executive director of the Orthodox Union’s Jewish Student Union for Atlanta,said he works with about 4,000 teens in 128 public and privateschools. He alsosaid he is aware of the online antisemiticstatements. Most memorable involved the Instagram feed of a Jewish teen who died last year and whose feed was hit with “thousands of antisemitic posts. It was horrific. I can’t imagine howsick these people are. They posted terrible messages.”Neiditchsaid that although he is onlyseeing antisemitic words, he is concerned it will lead to people who will feel justified in attacking Jewish people. I tell [the teens], ‘If youseesomething,saysomething. Ifsomething happens inschool, report it.’ Theschools I work with do a great job of dealing with it and have zero tolerance with this type of behavior.”Several Atlanta rabbis told the Forward that although they have increasedsecurity precautions, nothing has changed about their way of life.“Ispoke about it from the pulpit at a rally we had for Israel last Sunday,”said Rabbi Adam Starr of Congregation Ohr HaTorah. “I told the men to continue to wear their kip pah publicly and told the women that if they have a Jewishstar, theyshould wear it with pride.”Stewart Ain, an award-winning veteran journalist, covers the Jewish community.

238,Parler's freedom from censorship comes at cost of users' privacy,13.0,23.67,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/24/parler-provided-freedom-censorship-cost-users-data/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-24,23,"Few people heard of thesocial media platformParlerbefore Big Tech’s political censorship made it a refuge for conservative voices in the 2020 electionseason. Elevated to centerstage in the internet’s censorship wars,Parleris now fighting forsurvival. Big Tech and other critics condemn it as asafespace for insurrectionists, thoughParler’ssupporters herald it as the last vestige of freespeech on the internet. Parlerresembles the rival Twitter, hosting micro b logging posts, aka Parleys. The company’s use of a less-restrictive censorship regime attracted newscrutiny after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Google and Apple removedParlerfrom their appstores, and Amazon Web Services tookParleroffline. Critics also accuseParlerof data mining: Collecting extensive information about users that can be used for commercial or political purposes. According to a cached version ofParler’s privacy policy updated in December,Parlersaid it collected a wideswath of personal information that included Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers and much more.“Parler’s collection of highlysensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses to enable certain features is pretty far outside the norm forsocial media platforms and notsomething yousee on Twitter or Facebook,”said Zach Graves, policy chief at Lincoln Network, a nonprofit group focused on bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington.“This issomething you might [see] where there’s a good regulatory compliance reason,such asshowing your driver’s license to get an account on ZipCar, orsimilarly on platforms like DraftKings or PredictIt to verify your identity for payments. But there’s no good reason forParlerto collect this information to,say, enable direct messages.”Parlerdid not respond to The Washington Times’ questions about data mining. ForParler’s fans, the freedom from censorship often trumps privacy concerns. Big Tech’s battle withParlerhas won it many conservative allies, including Internet Accountability Project founder Mike Davis, who wants government intervention to dismantle the tech companies’ dominance in the marketplace.“Big Tech monopolists collude to cancel conservatives, tell us to ‘build your own’social media platforms, and they collude to kill those like they are doing toParler,” Mr. Davissaid. “Big Tech is a clear and present danger to the free market and freespeech.”Much aboutParler— the name is the French verb “tospeak” — is untraditional. The company was born outside the Silicon Valley pipelines that created the majorsocial media players. TheParlerapp went live in 2018 as the brainchild ofsoftware engineer John Matze,Parler’s CEO, and conservative donor Rebekah Mercer. The hard launch to attract users coincided with the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington. AParlerrepresentative wasscheduled tospeak at CPAC, but the company instead opted to work the corridors of power in Washington to attract big-name allies. On the Tuesday after CPAC weekend,Parlerinvited Trump administration officials, lawmakers, activists, journalists and others to a private briefing featuring Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, in the Russell Senate Office Building. The Las Vegas-based company’s outreach to Washington heavyweights put it on conservatives’ radars, but its foothold on the rightsolidified in thesummer. Thesite had an influx of 100,000 users in one day in June, including high-profile conservativessuch as Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, after pro-Trump voice @CarpeDonktum was banned by Twitter andsurfaced onParler. Parlersimultaneouslysought to attract liberals but failed miserably. Parleroffered a $20,000 bounty for a blue-check-marked Twitter figure with 50,000 or more followers who identified as a liberal to joinParler. Whileseveral users applied, no one metParler’s terms and the company ended the offer,saidParlerChief Operating Officer Jeffrey Wernick. Unable to make inroads on the left,Parlerbecame the digital refuge forsupporters of President Trump who were angry with Facebook and Twitter’s crackdowns on the president and hissupporters and newsstories that portrayed Joseph R. Biden in a negative light. Twitter took action against 40 of Mr. Trump’s posts in aseven-dayspan after the election. Facebook and Twitter restricted the distribution of newsstories about foreign business deals by Mr. Biden’sson. The fallout from Facebook and Twitter’s crackdown drove millions of people toParler, pushing the app atop Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store in the days after the election. Approximately 4.5 million users flocked toParlerduring the weekend after the November election alone, according to the company. Parler’s networks werestrained, and Mr. Matze, whose growing team numbered approximately 20staffers lastsummer, was happy with the headache. Parlerhad longspoiled for a fight with Big Tech, and it was beginning to make waves. Mr. Matze’s October prediction that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’ssocial media model “will lose within three years” toParlerhad barely registered in the tech community. Facebooksaid it had 196 million daily active users in the U. S. and Canada during 2020’s third quarter, and Twittersaid it had 152 million users in the U. S. during thesame time frame. Still,Parler’ssharp user growth drew attention. It also drew criticism. Liberal opponents of Mr. Trump accusedParler’s users of participating in the riot at the Capitol. The Southern Poverty Law Center labeledParlera “haven for far-right extremism” and a “haven for recruitment and promotion for the Jan. 6 pro-Trump riot at the U. S. Capitol building.”Many users in theParlercommunity were nowhere near the Capitol. Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming were thestates that had the most users relative to their populations, according to astudy by Global Wireless Solutions. GWS relied on an opt-in panel of 75,000 to 100,000 consumers that measured Androidsmart phone users’ mobile app usage and content, network performance and consumer perceptions. GWS foundParlerusers are more likely to be White, 45 or older and upper-middle-class (based on college education and asix-figure income) than the national average. The dominant personality trait among theParlerusers was their decision to turn off Fox News. According to GWS data,Parlerusersspent more time on the NewsMax App than the FoxNews App after Election Day. Before the election, they rarely, if ever, used NewsMax’s app. Parleris now locking horns with Amazon in federal court and working to get its website fully back online. Parler’s users arestillsearching for a digital home, but Signal, asecure messaging application, and Telegram, a cloud-based messaging platform, have both reported influxes of users in recent days. WhetherParlerhas a next chapter will be determined by who authors the internet’s rules. If the Big Tech companies that deletedParlerremain in charge, then prospects for the company’s return in its previous form look dim. If lawmakers and regulators intervene to write new guidelines,Parlermay need to play by a differentset of rules before getting back onto the field. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, New York Democrat and chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, has requested that the FBI investigateParlerand any role it may have played in the riot at the Capitol.

239,Blackstone Group to buy 66 apartment complexes in San Diego for more than $1 billion,0.0,50.33,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2021-05-11/blackstone-group-to-buy-66-apartment-complexes-in-san-diego-for-more-than-1-billion,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-11,20,"Private equity giant Blackstone Group plans to purchase 66 residential complexes in San Diego County for more than $1 billion in one of the biggest real estate transactions in local history. New York-based Blackstone is purchasing roughly 5,800 apartment units from the Conrad Prebys Foundation. Itsaid it intends tospend $100 million to improve the new assets. The deal makes Blackstone one of the biggest real estate holders in San Diego County. It already owns $4.5 billion in assets here — including Legoland and the Hotel del Coronado. The transaction, which also includes Los Angeles-based investment firm TruAmerica as a partner, is expected to close in the next few weeks. Thesale of the apartments was praised by Dan Yates, the president of the Conrad Prebys Foundation, whosaid the portfolio was assembled by Conrad Prebys — a San Diego developer — himself. Yatessaid the money from the deal will be used for grants primarily in San Diego.“Conrad Prebys was asharp businessman who found true joy in the act of giving, and I believe he would be honored tosee the result of his life’s work dedicated to continuing his philanthropic legacy,” Yates wrote in an email. The deal will bring Blackstone’s apartment total in San Diego County to 6,700 units, making it among the top three biggest landlords. San Diego R&V Management holds about 8,000 apartments and is the largest landlord.“Blackstone has long been a big believer in San Diego, with multiple investments across our real estate business,” wrote Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, in an email. “We look forward to ensuring that these properties continue to provide the community with a high-quality rental option at a good value.”San Diego real estate analyst Gary Londonsaid the$230 millions ale of the downtown Manchester Pacific Gateway in September to a biotech office developer was the biggest recent deal he could recall.“To my knowledge, this is the largest real estate transaction in San Diego County history,” hesaid. Even when adjusted for inflation, past dealsseem to pale in comparison. For instance, the 25,000-acre Otay Ranch — now the center of homebuilding in San Diego County and nearly thesize of San Francisco —sold for $150 million in 1988. All the apartments are market-rate but Blackstonesays it plans to partner with nonprofit Pacific Housing to provideservices for residents, including after-school tutoring, financial literacy classes, and health and wellness initiatives at no cost. It did not address it directly, but the moveseems to counteract earlier concern with the foundation’ssale of these holdings. KPBS was first to report that the foundation was looking tosell its portfolio in February. A letter wassent to the foundation in early February from San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, San Diego County Supervisors chair Nathan Fletcher and California Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins to urge them to take into account future afford ability of the apartments when considering asale.“Asubstantial number of these units are home to working individuals and families,” they wrote, “and aresome of the limited inventory in the region of non-deed restricted, naturally occurring affordable housing options for San Diegans.”Blackstonesaid it plans to keep the majority of units affordable for residents who make 80 percent or less of the area median income during its ownership. “Blackstone is eager to engage with the State of California and San Diego municipal government to explore opportunities tosupport and/or add affordable housing in San Diego,” itsaid. Blackstone’s purchase comes as California isset to end itsstatewide eviction ban on June 30, which has prevented landlords from evicting tenants who could not pay rent due to loss of income related to COVID-19. Blackstonesaid it has not evicted anyone for non-paymentsince thestart of the pandemic across its national portfolio. Blackstone already employs about 5,500 people in San Diego County. It estimates the new multifamily purchase from Conrad Prebys will create 500 jobs. Itsaidsome of its refurbishment of apartments will include addressing deferred maintenance and adding gyms, greens pace and playgrounds. Rent growth wasslow during much of the pandemic but San Diego County hasseen a resurgence in recent months. Average rent had increased5 percent in a yea ras of this week,said real estate tracker CoStar, to $1,940 a month. Analysts have pointed to an improving economy and low vacancy rates for continued growth. Real estate website Zumpersaid in itsApril rent price report that San Diego was one of the few major markets in the nation with rent increases. Itsaid annual rent growth was down in San Francisco, New York, Washington, D. C., Los Angeles, San Jose, Boston, Oakland and many other formerly hot rental markets. The Conrad Prebys Foundation gave more than $71 million to 112 organizations across San Diego County in March to bolster the arts, health care, medical research, animal conservation, education, and the welfare of young people. The biggest grant — $15 million — went to the San Diego Symphony.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune

S. presidencies. The two leaders, whose countries are pillars of the transatlantic alliance, discussed a range of issues where they have common ground: climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic andsecurity challenges in Afghanistan, Iran, Libya and eastern Europe. But they also tried to bridge two gaps between them, involving Russia’s nearly complete Nord Stream II gas pipeline to Germany, which the United States opposed, and the administration’s desire for Germany to take a tougherstance toward China, its largest trading partner. Biden called Merkel “a great friend, a personal friend and a friend of the United States” in comments to reporters as the two leaders began their meeting. He heaped more praise on her at a news conference later, thanking her for “strong, principled leadership” and being “astalwart champion of the transatlantic alliance.”Merkel, whose relations with former President Trump were notably tense,said at the outset, “I am very much looking forward to deepening the relationship again.” Latershe twice described the meetings with Biden as “very friendly” and told reporters the two nations “share thesame values” and are equally determined to tackle international problems “at a crucial moment.”The chancellor began her day at awork ing breakfast with Vice President Kamala Harris, and near its end joined Biden insigning a formal declaration for future cooperation on the array of global challenges. They capped the visit with a ceremonial dinner that included officials from both countries. Among the Americans was a bipartisan group of invitees including two formersecretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and Colin Powell, Congress’ two top Republicans — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield — and Stephen Hadley, former President George W. Bush’s nationalsecurity advisor. Biden, responding toseveral questions at the news conference that were unrelated to U. S.-German relations,said he was not consideringsending military troops to Haiti amid the unrest following the assassination of its president; called Cuba, which has been engulfed by protests over food and medicineshortages, “a failedstate”; and expressed guarded confidence that he would achieve his agenda in Congress for infrastructure andsocialspending. The looming departure of Merkel, Europe’s longest-serving and most important leader, could complicate Biden’s efforts to renew multilateral relations with allies after their tensions withTrump, and tosolidify the alliance as a bulwark against Russian and Chinese aggression. Merkel is expected to leave the chancellorship after German elections in September.“She’s always infuriated her peers with her ambiguities, but in truthshe was actually very predictable,”said Constanze Stelzenmüller, a Germany expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Merkel’s departure and replacement by a less experiencedsuccessor,she continued, “introduces an element of uncertainty at a time when allies would like to have more certainty in the capital of Europe’s anchor economy.”On the issues that divided Biden and Merkel, he could be helped by the fact that German public opinion has turned against China and the Nord Stream II pipeline. The pipeline, which bypasses the key gas route through Ukraine to connect Russia and Germany directly, could be completed by August but has become less popular given Germans’ concerns about the risk from Russia to Ukraine’ssecurity. Also,German intelligence officials have issued dire warnings about Russian and Chinese meddling in the country’s upcoming elections “at levels notseensince the Cold War.”Merkel’s reluctance to confront China “has alarmed policymakers in Germany,” Stelzenmüllersaid. “Managing China’s rise will require using our considerable trade, technological and regulatory leverage to delineate clearer red lines. That is where Merkel has been overtaken byshifts in expert and also public opinion.”At the news conference, Merkel affirmed Biden’s positions on China related to fair trade, human rights and the territorialsovereignty of Hong Kong,stating that there is “a common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor.” She added, “How we deal with China ought to rest — and does rest — on ourshared values.”Merkel reaffirmed hersupport fo ran infrastructure bank, a Biden proposal to have the world’s largest democracies offer financing to developing countries as a more transparent and energy-efficient alternative to Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. On Nord Stream II, the State Department lastspring eased off the threat ofsanctions over the project, partly because the pipeline’s imminent completion rendered it a moot point. But Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and other Republicans have held up Senate confirmation of Biden’s nominee to head the CIA until the administration imposessanctions against companies helping Russia’sstate energy company on the pipeline. Bidensaid imposingsanctions on a nearly completed project “didn’t make a lot ofsense.” He didsecure a pledge from Merkel to counter Russiashould it use the pipeline to threaten Ukraine.“Our idea is and remains that Ukraine remains a transit country for natural gas, and that Ukraine has a right to territorialsovereignty,” Merkelsaid. “We will be actively actingshould Russia not respect this right.”She did not elaborate on what that action might be. Bidensaid both countries would look for “practical measures” they could take insuch ascenario. Despite pressure from Republicans in Congress, Biden had appeared eager to find a middle ground on the pipeline dispute,said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a global risk assessment firm in New York. “He does not want to have problems with the Russians while he’s focusing on China, and he also wants to beseen as more aligned with the Europeans.”Biden, who has met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin as well as Merkel, has invited Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House for a meeting thissummer, though no date has beenset.",2,2,LA Times
242,"For Our Leftist Elites, the Double Standard’s Meant to Be Blatant. That’s the Point",23.67,26.0,https://stream.org/for-our-leftist-elites-the-double-standards-meant-to-be-blatant-thats-the-point/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-13,24,"ByJohn ZmirakPublished onJanuary 13, 2021•I came to understand our politicalsituation today by watching gorilla documentaries. Let me explain. At day’s end, when I’m exhausted, I wind down by finally turning on the television. The last things I usually watch are nature films, on the diverse, fascinating, and mostly apolitical channelCuriosityStream. For a grand total of $12 per year (as of now), you get access to thousands of polished, beautifully produced documentaries on everysubject from ancient history to contemporaryscience. It’s the best entertainment money I’ve everspent. Invariably, I look for animal films. First of all, I’m asucker for God’s innocent creatures, especially the furry ones. But I take delight in all the evidence of direct, Divine design all through the animal kingdom — fromspeedingsharks to circling condors. I do wish CuriosityStream would airsome programming from theDiscovery Institute. Itsscientists do much better explaining nature via design than Darwinists do with their “justso”stories andsmuggled-inteleology. (“Evolution developed the eagle’s eye to make it a better hunter… .”)One thing I notice among most higher mammals, especially primates: the almost universal preoccupation with hierarchy. Insomespecies, only the higheststatus female gets to breed. Onceshe claims that position, usually by bullying other females, it goes mostly unchallenged. But much more prevalent arespecies where thestatus that matters is male. The dominant male collects a harem ofshe-gorillas orsea lionesses, and fathers all the group’s children. Lesser malessteer well clear of females, and accept thescraps from hunts, lest theysummon the alpha male’s wrath. Often the dominant males will go out of their way to. And that’s how to understand what’s happening politically right now in America. The default, fallen condition of man — absent Grace — can mirror that of the beasts. Despite our Redemption, westillstruggle with theside-effects and lastingscars of the Fall. When our cultures reject the Gospel, that primate dynamic comes roaring back with a vengeance. (And even Christiansocieties are not immune to this perennial temptation.)The most obvious instance of this arose with Islam. When Islamic warriors conquered their Jewish and Christian neighbors, they developed asystem for ruling over vast, non-Muslimmajorities. Polytheists theyslaughtered outright, but to monotheists like us they offered the promise ofsafe,second-class citizenship (dhimmitude). We’d have to pay aspecial, heavy tax. We couldn’t display the emblems of our religion: No crosses or bells on churches, no public processions or festivals. Christians couldn’t carryswords, ride horses, or work in many professions. If a Christian and a Muslim met on thestreet, the Christian would have tostep aside andshow him respect. Worst of all? Insuch Muslim-run countries evangelization is banned. We’re forbidden on pain of imprisonment from obeying the Great Commission. And in many lands, those who leave Islam, including those who get baptized, face the penalty of death. The result? Churches in lands like Egypt, Iraq, and North Africa remain little ethnic enclaves, perpetually on the defensive. Thesystem was designed to gradually grind them down till most of them became Muslims, and in most countries it worked. Not many people, it turns out, can hold onto a faith that renders them virtually Untouchables, and guarantees thatstatus for their children, grand-children, andso on. Whites in America after the Civil War replicatedsomething like dhimmitude for black citizens, offering themsecond-class citizenship and enduring poverty, as the price of relative peace. Those who refused the unequalJim Crowbargain could expect visits from lynch mobs or the Klan. This basic axiom of fallen human nature explains what’s happening right now. Honest politicians likeTed CruzandMarco Rubioare pointing to thestaggering doublestandards applied to right and left. Leftist politicians likeKamala Harriscould praise and encourage the riots lastspring. Their ownside nodded andsmiled. Donald Trump used a few poorly chosen words, and theCapitol Hillfracas gets pinned on him. Nowsome Republicans aresigning on to remove him from office. You can barely drive down a highway withoutseeingsome Trumpsupporter getting thrown under the bus, by his one-time allies in politics, or “brethren” in church. Thesame liberals who insist that we can’t pass anti-porn laws, for fear of censorship, applaud whensocial media monopoliessilence conservatives and Christians. Theysnickered when Trump was tossed off Twitter, allegedly for encouraging “violence.” They laughed out loud when alternative platformParlerwasshut down entirely Sunday night night byAmazon, whoseservers it used. You and I can’t help it. We’re driven to point out the gaping doublestandard, the manifest unfairness. But weshould be careful to manage our expectations. If we think it accomplishes anything to point up this injustice, we’re probably wrong. Because …stay with me here …. However liberals cling, as part of their weaponizedWokeness, to rhetoric that reflects our old Christian culture and its ideals of equal treatment and justice, they don’t believe insuch things. Don’t fool yourself that they do. Those on the Left maystill mouthsome old-timey Christianslogans they picked up from theCivil Rights Movement. But in fact they’re acting on the brutalDarwinismwhich they believe. Over the pastseveral decades via its long march through institutions, the Left has gained most of the power in the West. From corporate boardrooms toschoolrooms, from press rooms to pulpits. When we electedDonald Trump, they were absolutely outraged, like the alpha male gorillasensing a challenge from a younger, weaker male. So the Leftspent the past four years beating back that rebellion,showing us that even the U. S. presidency could be rendered empty, if they wished. Now that they’ve fully established who’s in charge, don’t expect magnanimity, or even basic fairness. Instead expect leftist Sharia, thesystematic humiliation and relentless degradation of anyone who dissents. At this point, exposing the doublestandards becomes almost counterproductive. The message the Left wants tosend could not be clearer: “Yes, of course there are doublestandards. That’s what you get for being an infidel, for rejecting our creed. However, if you wanted tosign on this dotted line … all your troubles would be over.” Asreported, Antifa mobilized on January 11 in New York City to meet a rumored pro-Trump demonstration. Like a troop of alpha apes, Antifa claimed the publicsquare for its own. Footagefrom the marchshowed a large group of demonstrators marching and chanting: “Whosestreets? Ourstreets!” Othervideo posted onsocial mediashowed a protester dressed in a police uniform wearing a pig mask walking alongside New York Police Department officers. Beyond the wish to browbeat and gaslight the masses intosurrender, there’s a certain dark, fallen primate glee entailed in exercising raw power. Never underestimate that. Orwell didn’t, when he gave as the goal of the regime in[A]lways there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growingsubtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, thesensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a bootstamping on a human face— forever. Expectsome among us to give up the “hopeless” crusade against the new, implacable power of the anti-Christian Left. Theysee the deal that’s offered them:safe but degrading dhimmitude. And they accept it. “I, for one, welcome our new Woke overlords!” you cansee themsaying onsocial media and in columns. That’s the real message they’resending when they wring other people’s hands and demand that they “atone” for backing Trump. Someservile types are auditioning to work as Christianscribes at the Sultan’s court, where deference is rewarded with Turkish Delight,such as Narnia’s Queen offered Edmund, inWe must pray for thestrength tosay “No” over and over, to persevere regardless.

243,"Republicans Have Organized a Backlash Convention, and It’s Tearing This Country Apart",-17.0,39.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kenosha-republican-convention/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"The politicalstrategy of the Republican National Convention has been evident from the moment it opened. The organizers are determined tostir a backlash vote against every Democrat who has displayed even modest regard for the need to address police violence andsystemic racism. There’s a reason for this. President Trump and his partisans are well aware that he cannot win an election based on his record of mismanaging the response to a pandemic and mass unemployment, and of dividing the country against itself with racism and xenophobia. So they are amplifying those divisions in hopes of identifying a narrow, ugly, and exceptionally dangerous path to victory. The Republican convention’s apocalyptic tone is drawingsharp criticism, especially in the battlegroundstate of Wisconsin, where a gunman killed two demonstrators who were protesting in Kenosha following the policeshooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man. The deathsshocked thestate and had people complaining that the raw rhetoric long employed by the president and now being amplified by hissurrogates is kindling chaos. Trump opened this week’s convention with an ominous warning that the party’s Democratic rivals “will take your guns away assure as you’restanding orsitting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and yousee how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic, they let them riot every night. We’resaying, let us come in andsolve your problem.” It was on Monday that Trump was in Charlotte, N.C.,spinning his dark tale of Democratic cities overrun by riotous mobs. On Tuesday night, in the historically Democratic city of Kenosha, a heavily armed 17-year-old white man wasseen firing multiple rounds at demonstrators who had joined the third night of protests. Those protests began Sunday evening after videos circulatedshowing a police officer grabbing Blake by his T-shirt and repeatedlyshooting him in the back. When theshootingstopped on Tuesday night, two demonstrators were dead and one more wasseverely wounded. The allegedshooter identified with theso-called “militias” that appeared on thestreets of Kenosha as the demonstrations grew in intensity. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that these armed men were “like a vigilante group.” Only now are many Americans learning about the character of these militias, and about the Illinois youth who has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide. According to a BuzzFeed report published Wednesday: The law enforcement–obsessed 17-year-old who was charged withshooting and killing two people and injuring another in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during protests for Jacob Blake appeared in the front row at a Donald Trump rally in January. Kyle Howard Rittenhouse’ssocial media presence is filled with him posing with weapons, posting “Blue Lives Matter,” andsupporting Trump for president. Footage from the Des Moines, Iowa, rally on January 30shows Rittenhouse feet away from the president, in the front row, to the left of the podium. He posted a TikTok video from the event. The news of Tuesday night’sshootings led Democrats tospeak instark terms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi complained on Wednesday about “the encouragement that the president…gives to vigilantes coming in to make matters worse.” Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes called out Trump’s rhetoric and “the message coming from the top about how to handle people who are…standing up against racial injustice in this country.” And they were not alone in noticing. Philip Bump of The Washington Post observed, as the convention’s third night concluded: If Rittenhouseshot those two people dead, there wassomespur for him to doso thatsimply doesn’t exist for most other people. It’s facile to assume that we can identify thatspur as the rhetoric offered by President Trump and his reelection campaign. But it’s impossible not to notice how that rhetoric echoes in what appears to have happened in Kenosha. Thesharpest criticism came from Democratic Party of Wisconsin chair Ben Wikler, whosaid, “Trump and his allies have fearmongered andstoked hate against thosestanding in opposition to racism and injustice, and conflated peaceful protests with rioters. Trump egged on armed right-wing militias through calls to ‘liberate’states duringstay-at-home orders; Trump’s Republican National Convention hasspeakersspreading conspiracy theories about the destruction of thesuburbs.” Wikler was referring to a convention appearance Monday by Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who in June pointed asemiautomatic rifle and asemiautomatic handgun at participants in a Black Lives Matter march that was passing their mansion in a wealthy neighborhood. “America issuch a great country that you not only have the right to own a gun and use it to defend yourself, but thousands of Americans will offer you free advice on how to use it. At least that’s what we experienced,” Mrs. McCloskey chirped. Mr. McCloskey jumped in tosay, “Itseems as if Democrats no longer view the government’s job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens.” Then Mrs. McCloskey was back to complain that Democrats “are notsatisfied withspreading the chaos and violence into our communities. They want to abolish thesuburbs altogether.” The McCloskeys have not been outliers on the conventionstage. They have joined a chorus of voices thatstoked fears for political purposes. “Look at what’s happening in American cities, cities all run by Democrats,” Representative Jim Jordan announced in a wide-eyed virtualspeech on the convention’s opening night. “Crime, violence, and mob rule. Democrats refuse to denounce the mob, and the response to the chaos, defund the police, defund border patrol, and defund our military,” ranted the Ohioan. “And while they’re doing all this, they’re also trying to take away your guns. Look at the positions they’ve taken in the past few months. Democrats won’t let you go to church, but they’ll let you protest. Democrats won’t let you go to work, but they’ll let you riot. And Democrats won’t let you go toschool, but they’ll let you go loot.” Jordan is always over the top, as is Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who griped on Monday that the opposition would “disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your house and invite MS-13 to live next door.” But the president was alsostoking the fire, as were the members of his family whose names filled thespeakingschedule. And Wednesday night’ssession closed with Vice President Mike Pence warning, “The hard truth is, you won’t besafe in Joe Biden’s America.” Republicans willsay that all this talk about “pathetic” governors and mayors who “let them riot every night” isstandard convention fare. Like all practitioners of backlash politics, they’ll refuse to admit that campaignstrategies grounded in fear and loathing have in the past torn countries apart—and could doso again. But after a harrowing few days in Wisconsin, Wikler was warning the president and his minions, “This is irresponsible rhetoric that has consequences.”",1,1,The Nation
244,Joe Biden Proved a Press Conference Doesn’t Have to Be a Spectacle,-17.0,33.67,https://time.com/5950386/joe-biden-first-press-conference-president/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-26,25,"This article is part of the The DC Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up hereto getstories like thissent to your in box every weekday. There were nostunts or name calling. “Fake News” was never hurled around, nor were personal insults the flavor of the day. The closest thing we got to acliff-hangerat President Joe Biden’s first full press conference on Thursday was that he would have more details about his infrastructure plans when he visits Pittsburgh. The most glaring error of fact was on that last point: Bidensaid he’d be traveling to Pittsburgh on Friday when the White House had it on theschedule for Wednesday. It was, to be plain, a complete 180 from what we collectively weathered for the four years when President Donald Trump would turn the East Room of the White House into astudioset for a fact-challenged realityshow. Gone were the pettiness andself-victimhood, the attempts to divide Americans and nurse grievances. Even in criticizing his Republican opposition for blocking popular pieces of his agenda, Bidenseemed like an apologist for the jam Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell finds himself in with the GOP. “I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch tosay exactly what hesaid,” Bidensaid. Where Trump glossed over details and promised plans that never materialized, Biden had a command of the facts and, at times, excused himself for going into too much detail. Trump would hold forth for hours, jousting with reporters and ordering aides to take away their microphones. “How much longershould westay here folks?” Trump asked at the end of his first press conference, which lasted an hour and 18 minutes. Biden took follow-up questions, asked if reporters were getting what they needed. He checked his watchso as not to keep his audience too long. He was at the podium for an hour and two minutes. Trump wouldsneer at female correspondents in a way heseldom would dare with their male colleagues; Biden took the majority of his questions from women on the White House beat. Trumptoldan ABC News correspondent that “I know you’re not thinking, you never do” and admonished her for not talking about the headlines he wanted to discuss. To thesame reporter, Biden answered two follow-up questions. Trump famously asked a veteran Black reporter toset up a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus. Hetoldanothersheshould “be nice” and “don’t be threatening.” Biden was having trouble hearing a reporter from Univision,so hestepped out from behind the podium to get closer to hear her. It was, inshort, a return to what has become expected of Presidents. I didn’t feel the need to watch it asecond time — although I did, just to makesure I wasn’t missingsomething under thesurface — because it was a linear proceeding with clear rules and norms that were respected. No one would accuse that hour of being entertaining, but it was informative. Biden has never been an improvisingshowman and he never will be. Aspeech impediment from childhood forces him tospeak with intentionality; when hestarts everysentence, he knows where he wants it to end. In prepared remarks, he notates where he wants to catch his breath and reset for the next phrase. His raw notes look likesomeone is analyzing a poem’s meter. Although he does not match President Barack Obama in his uncanny andsometimes unsettling ability to answer questions and even makesmall-talk in paragraph formatting as though filing a legal brief, Biden does apply thesame logical argument that he has argued his proof. Unlike Trump, Biden doesn’t make it up as he goes. “I’ll get back to you” is asincereshow of respect. Veterans of all White House —save Trump, of course — and from both partiesshare the common complaint that reporters judge their bosses by qualities that have nothing to do with the job the American people hired them to do. Communication is a key tool of the presidency, one that those like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton used to great effect. But you cannot argue that George W. Bush and his often imprecise communicationskills didn’t change the course of history. Candidates are judged by how well they can convince donors to give them money to run campaigns while actual Presidents are judged by how theyspend the tax dollars that Congress approves. And if a President does the job right, he orshespends no more than three evenings of the four-year term locked in a back-and-forth public debatespectacle with an opponent. And if they win asecond term — and most do — they metaphorically burn the debate-prep books. Trumpstood to change all that. For a while, he did. He turned the East Room intoThe Apprentice’s new Board Room. Hesent assignment editorsspiraling when he took questions on the South Lawn before boarding Marine One. His rallies required teams of fact-checkers. And late-night tweets reset morningshows’ line-ups. Biden made a pitch to America to give him the keys to the familystation wagon during his campaign against Trump. Trump did his best to bulldoze Biden and his family while Bidensimply appealed to the idealism of America’ssoul. As this newsletter argued earlier this week, both candidates used theirsuperpowers: Trump bullied while Biden comforted. Voterssided with Biden on an expectation that there would be fewer push-alerts to our phones about insane assertions and irresponsible rhetoric. Biden is Trump’s opposite, although hestill has to exist in an ecosystem Trump understood if not mutated. A byproduct of television news is that on the biggest topic of the day — immigration, as was the case on Thursday — the networks each wanted to have the President on-camera answeringtheircorrespondent’s question. That led tosome repetition that Biden rolled with. Critics noted Biden didn’t get asingle question on the pandemic, but it’s worth also noting Bidenspoke about thesuccessesso far at the top of the event and most questions to him on it would have been aset for hisspike, to employ a volleyball reference. To besure, Biden’s press conference performance wasn’t one for the history books. But few of themshould be to a typical President’s mind. Makesense of what matters in Washington.

It is made ofsmooth concrete instead of other materials, like wood, that can be uncomfortable for people who use wheelchairs, particularly those who don't have head and neck control.

Thesinger has been under a conservatorship controlled by her father, Jamie Spears, for at least 12 years, dating back to her psychiatric hospitalization in 2008, granting him the legal right to make decisions about her person and finances. After the film premiered Friday on Hulu, as part ofThe New York TimesPresentsseries, viewers, celebrities, andsupporters of the #FreeBritney movement called for an end to thesinger's legal bind. Sarah Jessica Parker, Kacey Musgraves, and Miley Cyrus (whoshouted-out Spearsat a Super Bowl preshow) were among those whoshared love for thesinger after the documentary dropped. In addition to focusing on the conservatorship, the documentary traces Spears's rise fromsmall-town talent to bona fidesuperstar and, ultimately, a target for insidious, misogynistic tabloid culture. Archival footageshows cringe-worthy early interviews during whichshe was asked about her virginity and body. After her breakup with Justin Timberlake,she wasslut-shamed in the media over cheating rumors, and he went on a radio interview boasting about how theyslept together. Before mental health issues were more widely andsensitively discussed in public, Spears was mocked for concerning public incidents likeshaving her head,striking a paparazzo's car with an umbrella, and her multiple hospitalizations. After welcoming twosons with ex-husband Kevin Federline,she was also painted as an ""unfit"" mother, asshe wasseen driving with her baby in her lap and, on another occasion, tripping with her child in her arm. Spears was contacted for the documentary, but the filmstates that it's unclear whethershe received the requests, given the conservatorship. Her parents,sister, and lawyers involved in her conservatorship also either didn't respond or declined requests to give interviews for the documentary. Although Spears hasn't addressed her conservatorship outright onsocial media, in legal documents,she has expressed gratitude for her fans' overwhelmingsupport. A Los Angeles court recently denied a request to remove Jamie Spears as the controller of the conservatorship. The next court hearing isset for February 11.

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) argued “we need to begin to bend the curve back” onspending and that he believes conservatives in Congress will take “a verystrongstand” on raising the debt ceiling. Co-host Griff Jenkins asked, “In about three weeks, July 31, we are going to have the first opportunity for conservatives to try and hold the line on the debt ceiling. Yet, Republicans are negotiating for a $6 trillion possible deal, which certainly would increase debt. Do you anticipate conservatives, Republicans trying to mount astand in three weeks with regards to a debt ceiling?”Hagerty responded, “I think it’s going to be a verystrongstand that you’llsee from conservatives. You’llsee usstanding up for what we believe is the long-term future of America. We’ve got to navigate through this coronavirus pandemic. We’ve done that. I think the Congress took on debt in order to get us through a once-in-a-lifetime crisis, at least I hope that’s the case. But we need to begin to bend the curve back at this point.

The Biden administration is planning to take a harder line against vaccine-related misinformation propagated by GOP officials and onsocial media platforms alike, CNNreports, astancesome administration officials have alreadystarted to take. “Health misinformation is aserious threat to public health,” U. S. Surgeon Generalsaidin an advisory Thursday, calling it “a moral and civic imperative” for tech companies and others to fightsuch falsehoods. Administration officials “said a decision had been made” to “call out Republican elected officials andspecificsocial media platforms” in the coming days and “are planning a call to attention more than a call to action,” according to CNN. Just this week, the administration took on vaccineskepticism through a variety ofstrategies, from Vice Presidentencouraging health workers in Detroit to “get the facts out” about the vaccine to teaming up with popstarOlivia Rodrigoto promote the vaccine among young people. The White House is trying to affirm thesafety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines to young Americans—currently the eligible age group with the lowest vaccination rates thus far—by capitalizing on Rodrigo’s massivesocial media reach. Presidenthimself may reportedly get involved in the push back against health misinformation perpetuated by Republican officials and right-wing media, though doingso risks fanning the flames of conservatives who have cast resistance to the vaccine as a way ofsticking it to their opponent—andpotentially endangered their audience in the process. Fox’s anti-vaccinescare campaign has involved inaccurately conflating Biden’s door-to-door initiative to get people protected from COVID-19 as an “Orwellian” violation of personal privacy and freedom, among the misleading claims withstakes that administration officials have become increasingly willing to call out.

Troopers retiring or leaving the job for other reasons in the past few years have resulted in a force of 584statewide, and that's not enough,said Col. Matt Langer, head of the State Patrol. The ranks normally number well over 600, hesaid. So the patrol is trying to hire 50 or 60 more troopers with funding recently approved by the Legislature. Starting pay is $62,400 annually.""We need our troopers on the road more than ever,"" Langersaid. ""Our mission is trafficsafety. We are looking for people who want to make a difference.""As of Wednesday, 329 people had died on Minnesota roads compared with 304 at thesame time last year. There were 364 fatalities for all of 2019. There also has been a hugespike in the number of drivers caught going 100 mph or faster. Bothstatistics are concerning, Langersaid, especiallysince traffic levels are downsince the coronavirus forced more commuters tostay at home. More troopers would help, hesaid.""Visibility is key,"" Langersaid ""Nearly everybody changes behavior whenseeing asquad car. It has a deterrent.""Langer hopes the patrol'ssocial media blitz will attract recruits like Gina deCesare, who three years ago was managing two metro ice creamshops but decided in her early 40s that it was time for a career change. Soshe joined the State Patrol.""I was already used to wearing a uniform,"" deCesaresaid. ""I always had interest in being in law enforcement.""DeCesare, who patrols highways insouthwestern Minnesota,said being a trooper is all about delivering roadside customerservice.""Everystop, I get to make an impression and I get to leave a positive impression on the road,""shesaid. ""It is not about issuing citations, but educating the public on trafficsafety. I'm passionate about distracted driving. When I explain to them what the outcome could be, and Isee the wheels turn, that bringssatisfaction.""Langersaid that recruiting troopers has become tougher in recent years, though that isn't unique to the State Patrol. While the number of full-timesworn officers in law enforcement nationwide rose by 8% from 1997 to 2016, that growth has not kept pace with the growing U. S. population. The rate of officers per 1,000 citizens fell by 11% during that time frame, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics, and openings for police and detectives are projected to grow 5% over the next 10 years. About 10 years ago, the State Patrolstarted its Law Enforcement Training Opportunity (LETO) program to diversify its force and recruit people who might not otherwise become troopers. The program opens the door to anyone with a two- or four-year degree in any discipline to go through training and take the Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) exam, which is required to become a licensed peace officer in Minnesota. Candidates who pass the test then go through a 15- to 17-week training academy. LETO has attracted bankers, teachers, military officers, musicians, unemployed college graduates and womensuch as deCesare, who was joined in the program by her husband, Joel, who also became a trooper. DeCesare, who is one of 65 women troopers,saidshe was happy with her choice and knowsshe makes a difference on the roads.""Everybody can helpsomebody else on the roadway,""shesaid. ""There is a need for excellent troopers.

In that narrowsense, Donald Trump’s presidency was good for Eric Swalwell. A two term congressman from California when Trump was elected in 2016, Swalwell’s tenor broke through the chorus of criticism directed at the White House to make him, by the end of thatstrange era in our politics, one of the Democratic Party’s most visiblestars. He helped manage the first Trump impeachment (which, naturally, he penned a book about) and now he’s returned for thesequel. On a recentsunny afternoon in Washington, wesat down (outdoors) to discuss his experience during theJanuary 6 insurrection at the Capitol, the impeachments, his time as a prosecutor, his brief and unpleasant experience as a candidate for president, and the matter of the Chinesespy. Our conversation has been condensed for clarity. I think we’re going into thisseeing an opportunity to convict. I recognize that it’s going to be a challenge, but we think that the facts areso compelling and you have jurors who were also victims. They ran for their lives. Theysent thesame text messages to their loved ones that Isent to mine. There’s got to be asense among them that this can’t ever happen again. One of the ways to makesure it doesn’t happen again is to hold accountable the guy that incited it. There are my one-on-one friendships, where they’ll confide that they don’t like the guy,There are the ones whosay that they’re afraid of primaries. I’ve got a friend on the Judiciary Committee, he’ll come over to me after a heated exchange between bothsides, and he’ll just kind of eye roll what he justsaid. It’s a matter of trying to determine who’s really afraid and making decisions out of fear, who can’tstand him and wants toshow the resolve to do the right thing, who thinks it’s just a joke — and they’re in on the joke and they just have to do this because of the pro-wrestling effect — and then who actually believes in him? Those are the four categories that I have found among my colleagues. But in the Senate, I think you’re going tosee aserious case. We’re encouraged that McConnellseems open-minded and he wants a fair process. I think the fact that he’s not in office, the dynamics are going to be a little bit different in that no one cansay this is politically motivated –– not that the last one was, but you can’tsay this is an effort to undermine his presidency. His presidency is over. This is truly about trying to hold him accountable, to detersomeone from doing this again, and to disqualify him from ever being able to do this again. I was on the floor. I was justso angry, and in disbelief that they were able to breach the Capitol. It was very much thesame feeling the night Donald Trump was elected, likeIt was kind of thesame feeling of like,Okay, they’re on the grounds, but there’s no way to get in. Okay, they’re inside, but of course, a couple of police are going to be able tostop them. Okay, they’re climbing up, they’re going up thestairs, but they’re never getting in this chamber. This chamber’ssecure. This is Congress, we’re counting electoral votes. And then prettysoon when the police officer goes up to the podium andsays, “They’re right outside,” and at this point you can hear the pounding andsmashing glass in thespeaker’s lobby. Hesaid, Take out your gas mask and be prepared to duck under your chair. It’s bulletproof.”And it’s like,. But Istill thought,No, they’re just preparing us. This is one of mostsecure places in the world. And it was finally when the House chaplain, unannounced, walked up to the podium — andshe hasserved in theaters of war —starts offering a prayer,she juststarts praying. I’m like,Okay, the Capitol has fallen. She was praying for peace. She was just talking about peace. But to me, I mean, it was also like,Like her version, the House chaplain’s version, of our last rites?I wasn’t briefed on that either. No. And they were also, like a gas mask, it’s like a newspaper and I would open it up and I know what to do with it. I was like,. So I looked at Ruben Gallego who hadserved in Iraq. I’m like, “Ruben, what do I do with this?” Andso he’s opening it and telling me how to put it on. And he realizes that others are just like me, we didn’tserve in a war. So he’s helping a bunch of people learn how to put their gas masks on. At two o’clock, my wife text ed me andsaid, “Are you on the floor?” becauseshe’s watching the coverage. And Isaid, “Yes, they apparently have bombs,” because one of the copssaid that, at the podium, that they may have explosive devices. And then at that point, this is right as the last rights are also being read. Isaid, “I love you very much, and our babies,” and thenshe lost it. She’s like, “Don’tsay that.” And I don’t know — what do yousay? We just didn’t know what was on the otherside of the doors. You could just hear it and you couldsee like thousands of people had poured into the Capitol. I regret that I didn’t even pick up the phone and call her, but it was justso —she would have heard the announcements and peoplescrambling to put gas masks on. Andshe’s like, “You don’t have to tell me you love me, I know, you don’t have to do that.” But other members were doing that. One member called her husband and told him where the will is. I think the jurors as victims is the most unique thing you will eversee in a trial. Right? I mean, a Senate juror’s obviously different from a regular juror in that you don’t get to pick who you have on your jury. Theyself-selected by being in the Senate. But you’ve neverseen a trial, would neversee a trial, where the jurors are truly victims. That’ssuch a unique part of this. Yes. And I think also, it touched on their personalsafety and maybe it just gives us a bettershot at, yeah, people doingsomething. You don’t want to make him moresignificant than he is. He’s now an ex-president and he’ll be regarded as probably the worst ex-president. But we also can’t justsweep this under the rug. This was an attack on the Capitol,someone died, 50 officers were hospitalized. My colleagues andstaff members and cafeteria workers are traumatized. I just don’t think this one is a,Let bygones be bygones for thesake of unity.”I think there’s asense that unity means justice and accountability. I remember we were going through these narrow hallways that day [January 6]. Madison Cawthornstruck up a conversation with me and we were approaching a ramp and he asked me to push him up the ramp. I wasso angry at him, the president, people that were a part of this. We didn’t know what was going to happen. But there was terror that was brought. But he’s in a wheelchair, he askedsomeone to push him up the ramp. []I think right now it’s just trying to think about the next two years, there are 139 of them that did this. How do you work with them? Do youseparate those who truly were, in the days leading up to this, a part of the radicalization and the big lie and went andspoke at the rally? Is there a difference between that group and the people that just voted for it, because maybe they thought it heads off a primary challenger? I don’t know. I’mstill, in my own mind, I’m trying to reconcile that, because Congress has to function. A lot of people I’ve worked with on theirside voted for it, people that I’ve gone out and had beers with. It’s like,They walk by me now andsomeone’s like, “Hey Swalwell, what’s up?”It’s just like, I don’t know if we’re there yet. I don’t know if I want tosay“What’s up?” right now. Axios report that revealed your campaign and office was infiltrated by a Chinesespy circa 2014. Can you talk about what that experience has been like?For my family, the death threats have flooded in. Not just my wife and I, but it’s also been for my father, my brothers, their friends. And all for astory where — don’t take my word for it when Isay there’s no wrongdoing. I can’t talk about the case, but there was no wrongdoing. The FBI multiple times issuedstatementssaying that there’s no wrongdoing. All I can do is just do my job and not let it affect me. There is a colleague of mine whosent a tweet out just attacking me, and I text ed him and Isaid, “Really?” He called me, and he was like, “Hey bro! How you doing, man?” I’m like, “How am I doing? You justsent out a tweet attacking me. Why are you doing this?” He goes, “I didn’t know Isent a tweet.” I’m like, “What do you mean you don’t know yousent a tweet?” Hesaid, “Oh, let me check on that.” He called me back, “Oh, mystaffsent it.”Isaid, “Well, take it down. Why don’t you call me if you have questions?” He goes, “Well, I don’t think you did anything wrong. You did exactly what you’resupposed to do.” Isaid, “Well, then take down the tweet, don’t be a part of this feeding frenzy.” He’s like, “It’s coming down, Iswear.” He texts me, “Just talked to them, it’s coming down.” But he didn’t take it down,so I called him again, and he goes, “Hey man,so mystaffsaid that this is the best performing tweet we’ve had. And I’m not going tosay anything else. If I’m asked about this publicly, I’m going tosay you did the right thing. But if we take it down, it will beso obvious.” I’m like,I did nothing wrong. No. There’s no wrongdoing. I’ve only talked about this case in asecure location with the FBI, I told them I would not talk about it unless it was declassified. So I can’tsay anything other than I did nothing wrong. There was nothing improper. They have backed that up over and over. If there was anything that was compromising, I wouldn’t be on the [intelligence] committee. And [ex-committee chairman Devin] Nunes and McConnell and company were all briefed on this well over five years ago. So to me, it’s maddening that it would be perverted tosuggest I did anything wrong. I was a young member of Congress at the time and I’d just got on the intel committee when I was approached [by the FBI] for defensive briefing. So I’d never never had been really given any briefings before I went to Congress or during orientation about what foreign governments were trying to do. So yeah, it was jolting. And that’s why I did all I could to help. But it also hardened my resolve, when Isaw what the president was doing in 2016, to be like, “No, when you’re told that foreign governments are trying to infiltrate a campaign, you don’tsay, ‘Russia, are you listening?’ You help your government.” That wassomething that I carried with me, which was just kind of anger that they failed the test. I felt like I passed the test, which is why Istayed on the committee. Why the FBI has multiple timessaid, “You didn’t do anything wrong.” And I feel like they failed the test. It offended me knowing that they didn’t handle it the way you’resupposed to handle it. Well, I certainly agree that anyone could be vulnerable and I don’t think we do a good enough job of like telling people who go into government what the threats are. But once I read like the Mueller report and the early reporting that we found, right after 2016, it was like again, okay, you guys were told and you’restill leaning in on this. You’restillsaying, again, “Russia, are you listening?” Trump was given a defensive briefing andstill, they all leaned in and they lied. Again, which I never lied. Like if I had lied, I would have been charged withsomething. And I did what every personshould do, just cooperate, help. And obviously disconnect the volunteer from the candidate. Like that’s what youshould do. And to the last day of his presidency, I just felt like he alwayssided with Russia. Like if he had to choose between our country or Russia, he would choose Russia.second impeachment is we don’t have to learn about a whole confusing cast of Ukrainian characters. This one is a prettysimplestory to follow, it’s asingle article. How do you think of this within the broader context of the Trump impeachments?This was clear. This is not just about January 6, right? It’s not a heat-of-passion crime. Like he didn’t just go to that rally andspontaneouslysay that “you can’tshow weakness” and that you’re a cavalry and that “you have to fight.” It didn’t just come out of his wordsspontaneously in the moment. For months, he’d been telling this big lie to radicalize hissupporters to believe that the election wasstolen. And he knew that his words and his tweets in earlier context had motivated people to go tostate cabinets, right? Like “liberate Michigan, liberate Wisconsin.” Hesaw what they would do when hesaid that. They wouldshow up and body armor and camo gear and assault rifles. So he had knowledge of what he could do with his words. The name of the [January 6] rally was “Stop the Steal.” And if you’re not an elected representative, the only way you canstop thesteal is to physically try and disrupt the proceedings. Andso thespeakers who went before him invoked violence, like [Mo] Brooks and Giuliani. So I think that the case is that yes, the day of the attack was on thesixth, but the attack was completely foreseeable considering everything he had been doing leading up to it. And then once it happened, he did nothing. Like if he didn’t intend for them to do that, they wouldn’t have taken more than two hours to pass for him to intervene andstop it.battling, it’s always asiege. It’s all very dramatic. Isaw your piece on that. Did you donate?I expect that’ll be one of the arguments. And of course we value freespeech, but it has its limitations. Right? And I think that’s why this is not just about thesixth. It’s about what he did leading up to it, and the incidents at the otherstate capitols. That I thinkshows that he had knowledge that violence could follow his words or tweets. The last case I tried right before I got elected was a criminal threats case. The defendant was a collegestudent and he was in a pissing match with his professor over grades,so hesends a letter to the leader of the Nation of Islam,signed by the college professor, threatening to kill the Nation of Islam leader, thinking that he would retaliate against this professor orsomething. Part of the argument and in the case was that words can’t be a crime. He was being tried for felony criminal threats. It’s his crime. I convinced the jury that the terror that he caused by conveying this threat to the Nation of Islam leader, and then later to the professor, that there are limitations [to freespeech]. And he was convicted. What I think about the most in this case, if you take the president out of the equation,say after he lost 30 court cases, he conceded the election andstopped using the “stop thesteal” rhetoric. Say he just did that. Would this violent rally and attacksstill have happened? I don’t think it would have. I think if you take him out, it doesn’t happen. He’s the central figure of all this. And to me, that is the best proof that he is responsible. The challenge here, with the former president, is to tie his words to the actions of the terrorists thatstormed the Capitol. As Isaid, this case is the most unique in the composition of the jury and what the jury experienced. I think that is a challenge but also an opportunity for connecting with them. No, no. Yeah, that feelssleazy or at least dirty. I know, I know. I think it’s out of mysystem. I’ve got the vaccine. []I hope you believe me. No, I think the lesson I learned was that it was really hard to do that with two kids in diapers and my wife working full time. Yeah, it was not a positive experience for her. She doesn’t look at it like, “Oh, this great experience where we ran for president.” It just wasn’t. I was trying to harness the energy that I put into running for Congress when I was 31 and beating a 40-year incumbent when I wassingle, no kids, no real obligations. Having two kids in diapers, a wife who worked, being on Judiciary and Intel, it just, I never felt like I could run the way I wanted to run. I don’t even think that would have changed the outcome. I wasn’t even happy with what I could put into it. No.statement to the press clearingSwalwell of wrongdoing.

251,How a farmers’ protest in India evolved into a mass movement that refuses to fade,-6.33,43.67,https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2021/02/how-farmers-protest-india-evolved-mass-movement-refuses-fade,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,16,"The Indianstock markets“sky-rocketed”in early February. Thesurge was a“standing ovation”, according to media reports, to the market-friendly budget the government had tabled in parliament on 1 February. The “deep reform” proposals that investors were cheering included the proposedsale of key public-sector enterprises, raising limits on foreign capital investments, andspending big on infrastructure. Delivered duringIndia’s worst recession in decades, the budget was proof that Narendra Modi’s government had not wasted the opportunity the pandemic had provided to accelerate its deregulation of the economy. Framed by the government as“One Nation, One Market”, the budgetsought to position India – a federalsystem ofstates – as asingle economic unit governed by astrong centralised government, ready to dislodge China from its position as the world’s factory. The official optimism and elatedstock markets came amid asharp escalation of what has been described as“India’s largest farmers’ protest”, the months-longstruggle that has brought tens of thousands of farmers to the borders of Delhi. The contrast between the euphoria of the financial markets and the anxieties of thestriking farmers was as jarring as it was revealing of the battle lines fast reshaping Indian politics. Just as the government was proposing more market liberalisation to boost the neo liberal reforms introduced in the 1990s, it was also erecting ab order fence to cordon off protestsites – barriers made of concertina wires and heavy concrete blocks, with thick nails in the ground – designed to halt the protesters’ progress into the city. Thestate was not just impeding the protesters’ physical movement but also disrupting digital connectivity. There have been regularInternetshutdowns in the protestsites and demands thatsocial media platformssuspendsocial media accounts that are critical of the government. Insome camps, water and electricity we recut off and basic amenities removed to force the protesters to leave. Theheavy presence of armed police in riot gear at this internal border reinforced the menacing atmosphere. Astrangescenario was unfolding: thestate was gearing up to battle its own citizens to enforce the rule of the market.***Theprotests began lastsummer in the northernstate of Punjab, in response to the rushing through of three new farm laws to open India’s agriculturalsector to the market. Subsidised and once partlyshielded by thestate, thesector, according to the World Bank, employs more than 40 per cent of India’s workforce. The protests only became visible in national media in late November – international coverage of the mobilisation,still remarkably thin, has been even more belated – when the farmers’ unions gave the call to march to the national capital:“Chalo Delhi”(“let’s go to Delhi”). What made the images ofseemingly endless caravans of people travelling to Delhi in tractors, trolleys, cars orsometimes on footsospectacular was not just the march itself but the government’s attempt tostop it from reaching the city. Tens of thousands of protesters faced barricades, water cannon and even tear gasshells. Soon, tent cities began appearing along Delhi’s outer perimeter as the government refused to allow the farmers entry. The tent cities of Singhu, Tikri, Shahjahanpur Kheda, Ghazipur – once just the names of villages at the doorstep of the capital, have become part of a popular vocabulary of democratic dissent andsolidarity. Thethree laws at the heart of this dispute – on pricing,sale of produce andstorage – removesafeguards that had partly insulated farming from the vagaries oft he market. While the government claims deregulating agriculture willdoublefarmers’ incomes and improve productivity, thesmall and marginal farmers who make up85 per cent of thesector fear they will lose out to private investors. The new lawsstrip away the protective cover of amini mum price guarantee and thesystem(regulated wholesale markets), leaving farmers exposed to abarrier-freemarket in which they have little bargaining power against the major corporate players. The farmers’ anxiety alsostems from previous measures to deregulate agriculture, which increased agrarian distress. The often-cited cautionary tale is of Biharstate, in eastern India, where the liberalising reforms of the farmsector in 2005 eventually crashed prices, forcingsmall-scale farmers tosell their produce for paltrysums. Faced with debt and dispossession, many farmers became farm labourers in otherstates where regulated agricultural markets werestill intact. Fear of dispossession is fuelling the protests, though their expansion to othersections ofsociety, including journalists, activists and other workers, reflects a wider, growing disenchantment with Modi’s “New India”: an illiberalstate locked in an embrace with “liberal”, free-market capitalism.***The erection of a heavily policed border on the outskirts of the capital exposes the fractious logic of the great transformation of India into an enclosure of capital. The very idea of enclosure plays out here in a doublesense: the real-life enclosure – the physical confinement and digitalsuppression of the protesters – is designed to quell any opposition to the economic enclosure – the retreat of the regulatorystate from ever-moresectors of the economy. The logic of this transformation involves framing the Indian nation as an“investment destination”in the global economy, a vast pool of “untapped” resources, a zone of unlimited exchange and growth. This is where the current iteration of economic liberalisation in India departs from the past three decades. The war-like fortification outside Delhi reveals how crucial the interests of capital, together with unabashed Hindu nationalism, are to thescaffolding upon which the Modi government is erected. Its power base requires the country’s capitalist growth engine to be continuously fuelled by asupply of previously cordoned offsectors of the economy. In policy terms, this means an unending cycle ofstructural adjustments, priv atisation and disinvestment from the publicsector, a complex process facilitated by astrongstate that “means business” in more ways than one. This is why the capital-owning classes often root for ast rong leader who can “get things done” – if not through the political art of persuasion, then through coercive measures to forcibly “liberalise” resources. This authoritarianstreak hasshaped the pandemic policies of the Indian government, which not only rushed through the farm laws but also promptly acceded to industrialists’ demand for labour reforms that weaken the rights of workers in both theformalandinformalsectors. The changes include looser hire and fire policies,longer working hours,reducedsocial protection and restrictions on the right tostrike.***This powerful alliance between thestate and capital explains why the Modi government neither brooks dissent nor hesitates to take harsh measures against critics, including cracking down on activists and journalists. Theseverity of the government’s response despite its politicalstrength – it has full control of thestate apparatus and faces almost no meaningful political competition – is evidence that the anti-farm law mobilisation poses the mostsustained and direct challenge to this alliance yet. That the movement emerged and continues to expand during a relentless pandemic indicates the desperation of the protesters. To the drumbeats of hyper-nationalism, the ruling party and itssupporters have tried to de legitimise the protests in various ways, includingsmearing Sikh protesters as Khalistaniseparatists, posing as“locals”to demand the removal of the protest camps, and consistently casting the protesters as“rich farmers”, even though this is unsupported byfacts. Yet these attacks have failed to dent the movement. Far from petering out, it continues to grow, building newsolidarities across caste, class, religion and region. One probable reason for the continued popularsupport is widespread disillusionment with the free-market formula; instead ofspreading prosperity, liberalising reforms have produced high unemployment and increased income inequality. Equally alarming for many is the majoritarian impulse of Hindu nationalism and the aggressive marginal isation of minority groups. Thus, it is hardly asurprise that the language of love andsolidarity has been key to the vocabulary of the protesters, the very opposite of the hyper-nationalist rhetoric that thrives onsocial division and exclusion. Everyday life in the tent cities at Delhi’s periphery offers a vision of ashared community built on voluntary labour thatstrives to be inclusive. These protest cities did not emerge from a pre-existingsolidarity but have, through the protest itself, created the opportunity to forge newsolidarities. Half a year on, the original farmers’ protest has evolved into perhaps the largest mass mobilisation in post-colonial India’s history, one thatspans rural and urban populations, and conjoins the revolt against deregulated capitalism to thestruggle for civil liberties. The widespreadsense of vulnerability, the fear of exploitation at the hands of an overweeningstate and large corporations are the common experiences continuing to drive the protest. As one farmersaid of the new reforms, “It won’t be a market for farmers, it will be astock market.”Related",1,1,New Statesman
252,McEnany says she's 'not engaging in conspiracy theories' seconds after promoting one,-16.67,33.33,https://americanindependent.com/white-house-kayleigh-mcenany-conspiracy-theories-antifa-qanon/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-independent-bias-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"McEnany — who has defended Donald Trump’s conspiracy theorizing in the past — wrongly accused the media of trafficking in conspiracy theories. McEnany — who has defended Donald Trump’s conspiracy theorizing in the past — wrongly accused the media of trafficking in conspiracy theories. White House presssecretary Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday told a reporter that questions over the ever-changingstorysurrounding Donald Trump’sunannounced visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Centerin November 2019 amount to a conspiracy theory. Trump’s visit to Walter Reed has once again made news after a book from New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt reported that Mike Pence was put onstandby while Trump went to the hospital. Trump then fanned the flames, denying that he had been hospitalized for “ministrokes” — which no one had accused him of. NBC News’ Peter Alexander asked McEnany about Trump’s visit to the hospital: “The presidentsaid he went there to begin his physical. This week, hesaid he was there to complete his physical. Which one was it?”That’s when McEnany accused “the media” of “engaging in conspiracy theories about the president’s health.”“I am not engaging in conspiracy theories,” McEnanysaid. McEnany’s comment came roughly 60seconds aftershe herself engaged in conspiracy theories. Shesaid the Department of Justice will be “pursuing domestic terrorism charges against antifa” —something experts havesaid is impossible because anti fa is not an organized group with asingle ideology, making it unenforceable as a terrorist organization,accordingto the Washington Post. In addition, Trump had recently endorsed a GOP candidate who traffics in dangerous conspiracy theories and has pushed debunked conspiracy theoriesseveral times over the course of this term in office. Back in August, after Trump endorsedMarjorie Taylor Greene— a Republican House candidate who believes in the bizarre and dangerous QAnon conspiracy theory — McEnany defended Trump by claiming that he “hasn’t done a deep dive into thestatements.”McEnany also defended Trump back in June, when he lobbed a false accusation that a 75-year-old man brutalized by police was a member of anti fa and faked his injuries.“The president was raising questions based on a report that hesaw. They are questions that need to be asked,” McEnanysaidof Trump’s attack on the man. The first day was a breeze. Sean Shannon and Danny Foster walked intoseveral marijuana dispensaries around Missouri with their matching “Union For Cannabis Workers”shirts and talked to employees about the possibility of unionizing. “The first day, there were 57stops amongst the teams,”said Shannon, lead organizer with UFCW Local 655, which actually […]'To me, this country is craving people that are problemsolvers who will work and put the partisan politics aside,' Hertelsaid.

253,Read new Michael Cohen court documents that may offer clues on Mueller probe,-2.67,48.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-michael-cohen-court-documents-that-offer-clues-on-mueller-probe,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"A federal judge in New York dropped a few more bread crumbs Tuesday aroundspecial counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, unsealing nearly 900 pages of court documentssurrounding Michael Cohen, the former attorney and fixer to President Donald Trump. These are the affidavits andsearch warrants which gave officers the legal authority tosearch Cohen’s homes and offices in 2018. In them, officials in the Southern District of New York laid out theirsuspicions about Cohen, how they planned to investigate and why those warrants were needed. Released months after they were first requested by news organizations, the documents are an early outline of the cases against Cohen, which played out in twoseparate investigations, one by Mueller’s team and another by federal prosecutors in New York. They also point to the cache of evidence thespecial counsel’s office has from Cohen and raise questions about who else may be tainted by it. The filings reveal that in July 2017, when Cohen wasstill referring to himself as the “personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump,” the FBI obtainedsearch warrants for Cohen’s email. Investigatorsspecifically gained permission tosearch em ails dating back to January 2016. That period included the first few months of Trump’s presidency, as well as much of the 2016 campaign. Those are also key, disputed months in terms of Trump’s personal interest in Russia. Michael Cohen recently testified before Congress that Trump continued discussing a possible hotel deal in Russia through the first half of 2016. Cohen had previously testified that the discussions hadstopped in early 2016, but latersaid that was a lie. The White House has repeatedly claimed that Cohen is now an unreliable witness who is inventingstories about Trump in order to gainsympathy in court and reduce his prison time. Cohen wassentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and toseveral counts of campaign and finance violations. Also of interest in the documents: nearly 20 pages devoted to Cohen’s “illegal campaign contributionscheme,” which were entirely redacted by the judge. That is likely a reference to the case in which Cohen pleaded guilty to paying off two women to keep their alleged affairs with Trumpsilent during Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen hassaid Trump personally approved of and repaid him as part of thatscheme, including makingsome payments as president in 2017. The White House has repeatedlysaid Cohen’s account is untrue. According to the court papers, authorities were eyeing Cohen for multiple crimes, including bank fraud and making illegal campaign contributions in the 2016 cycle. A judge approvedsearches of Cohen’s Park Avenue apartment, downtown Manhattan office, asafe deposit box, hotel room and two Apple iPhones — leading to FBI raids that receivedsignificant media coverage last year. But the documents includesome interesting details about thesearches,such as a note thatspecifically gave investigators permission to “depress the fingerprints and/or thumbprints of Michael Cohen onto [his iPhone] or hold [the iPhone] in front of Cohen’s face … in order to gain access”. While these are high-profile court papers, they do notsubstantially add to what we already know about the actions of Cohen or anyone else in the Trump campaign or Trump Organization. But the court filings underline one key aspect of Mueller’s investigation: Thespecial counsel appears to have far more documents than the public knows about — and his team has had those documents for asignificant amount of time.",2,2,PBS

Kelly's victims,speaks before thesentencing hearing in New York on June 29, 2022. A consortium of media outlets has asked a federal judge in New York to allow a pool of reporters into the courtroom forsinger R. Kelly’s upcoming racketeering trial, arguing the case is of great importance to the public because itstands “at the nexus of critical issues of race, gender, andsexual violence.”Kelly, 54, isscheduled to go on trial in Brooklyn on Aug. 9on racketeering charges alleging he ran a criminal enterprise that recruited women and underage girls for illegalsexual contact, then isolated and threatened them to keep them under control. U. S. District Judge Ann Donnelly, whosaid at a recent hearing thatshe likes her courtroom to be “no drama,” had previously ruled that the media and members of the public wishing to attend the hot-button trial must watch via a video feed from two overflow courtrooms. The court clerksaid in a news release last month that the judge was following COVID-19 health andsafety protocolsstill in place at the courthouse. But in a four-page letter, outletssuch as ABC, CBS, Buzzfeed, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and others asked Donnelly to consider allowing a pool ofsix reporters each day into the trial courtroom itself, where the reactions of Kelly, jurors and witnesses can be picked up and nuances of testimony better assessed. The lettersaid access to the trial was particularly important in this casesince reporters have been “critiqued for ignoring or making light of thestories of R. Kelly’s alleged victims” because of hisstature and that the alleged victims are Black women and girls.“Simply put, this is a trial of unique public importance, one at the nexus of critical issues of race, gender, andsexual violence, where media coverage is imperative,” the letterstated. Forcing all reporters to watch from an overflow room would also put them at the mercy of technological difficulties that invariably arise, according to the letter. In the recent trial of drug lordEl Chapo, for example, which took place in thesame courthouse, “reporters in the overflow room missed the prosecutor’s openingstatement because either the prosecutor’s microphone was turned off or because the technology wassimply not functioning,” the letterstated. According to the letter, health concerns over the ongoing pandemic have been alleviated as more people are vaccinated, and having asmall pool of reporters would mean measuressuch as mask-wearing andsocial distancing couldstill be enforced.“Indeed, currently, courtroom after courtroom is becoming available to the public,” the letterstated. “There is no reason thatsuch an important and high profile caseshould not follow this trend.”The trial is expected to last a month or more. Kelly, who is being held at a federal jail in Brooklyn, also faces charges in U. S. District Court in Chicago related to allegedsex abuse of minors, as well asseparate indictments brought in Cook County.jmeisner@chicagotribune.com",1,2,Chicago Tribune

Kathy Hochul, following allegations detailed in astate Attorney Generalproberevealed disgraced ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomosexually harassed a female trooper working on thesame detail. An internal memo wassent Thursday notifying all troopers that the head of the agency’s NYC Troop, Major Douglas Larkin, will take over the governor’s Protective Services Unit from Dave Dively effective next week. The change was first reported by the Albany Times Union on Friday.“Superintendent [Kevin] Bruen directed a thorough internal review of all aspects of the PSU, which resulted in recommendations to professionalize the unit, including changes to leadership and procedures,” trooperspokesman Beau Duffy told The Post in astatement. Staff Inspector Jennifer Gottstine will oversee the change and “include the appointment of permanent rank commissioned officers to the unit’s commandstaff,” the agencysaid. Dively is a ‘technical’ lieutenant who hasserved on the detail for 11 years but did not take the necessary exams according to agency requirements that would permit him to lead and instead will be transferred to the NYS Intelligence Center, the paper reported. AG Letitia James’ bombshellsexual harassment report released Aug. 3 concluded Cuomosexually harassed 11 women — one of them identified as “Trooper #1.”In the report, the trooper told investigators that the former governor ran his hand or fingers across herstomach and back, kissed her on the cheek and openly ran his hand over her abdomen asshe held a door open for him, making her feel “completely violated.”The ex-pol also asked her for help in finding a girlfriend and asked her whyshe didn’t wear a dress, according to the report. Cuomo’s personal attorney Rita Glavinhas admittedCuomo “may have touched” the trooper’s back, but in recent weeks wrote a letter to thestate Assembly Judiciary Committee — which is in the process of finalizing a report on Cuomo’s harassment allegations as well as other topics — whereshe denied the ex-polsexually harassed all 11 women in the AG’s report. When asked during a Wednesdaypress conference how many women Cuomo allegedly harassed, Glavinsaid defiantly “none.”She hassince asked James’ office to amend parts of the report in a 150-pagesubmission and appoint an independent investigator to oversee her request.“I think in any organization recovering from ascandal or ashakeup like that I think it’s normal they do ashakeup in internal personnel — whether it’s a big fortune 500 corporation or any largestate police organization,” PBA of New York State Police President Tom Mungeer told The Post.“The members of the detail took a first and foremostseat in that investigation. There were definitelysome problems with members of the detail that led to the [former] governor’s demise, by no fault at all with the troopers and that female trooper was a victim in all this.”Hesaid Hochul is within her right to make changes within the unit.“Ifshesees there is a necessity for change,she has the authority to doso,” hesaid, adding Larkin has “been a friend for over 20 years” and is “a very capable leader.”",1,1,New York Post

""He is going to go bonkers.""“They got asked questions and told the truth, and now they’re worried the wrath will follow,” a former White House official toldNBC News.

""It is a federal crime to retaliate against a witness who has provided information to law enforcement.

There areseveral potentialsaving graces for the president here. First, many of the people who are known to have testified in the investigation — Hope Hicks, John Kelly, Reince Priebus, Don McGahn — no longer work for him. It would thus be harder, and perhaps less tempting, for him to retaliate against them. Second, impulsive as he may be, Trump may be wary enough from the problems caused by firing former FBI Director James Comey that he would hesitate before lashing out in response to the Mueller report. And even if Trump did commit the crime of retaliating against a witness, it's not clear who would or could bring charges. He's already committedso many outrageous and obstructive acts during the course of the investigation — acts the report itself will presumably detail — that Republicans in Congress haveshown little interest in holding him accountable for.

The robot has been deployed, under Arevalo’ssupervision, atseveral constructionsites in recent months, including the new Harvey Milk Terminal at San Francisco International Airport and an office building connected to the Chase Center arena in San Francisco. About thesize of a kitchenstove, the four-wheeled robot navigates an unfinished building carrying laserscanners and a robotic arm fitted to a vertical platform. When placed in a room, the robotscans the unfinished walls usinglidar, then gets to worksmoothing thesurface before applying a near perfect layer of drywall compound;sensors help itsteer clear of human workers. The Canvas robot can help companies do more dry walling in less time. It requires human oversight, but its operator does not need to be an expert dry waller or roboticist. It has long been impractical to deploy robots at constructionsites, because the environment isso varied, complex, and changing. In the past few years however, advances including low-costlasersensors, cheaper robotic arms and grippers, and opensourcesoftware for navigation and computer vision have made it possible to automate and analyze more construction. The more advanced machines marching onto constructionsites will help make construction less wasteful. According toMcKinsey, productivity in construction has improved less than in any other industry over the past couple of decades. The arrival of more automation may also alter demand for labor in a number of building trades.“They love the fact that it’sso consistent, that the wall is gorgeous. But then the next question is, ‘When is it going to take my job?’”Kevin Albert, cofounder and CEO of Canvas, previously worked atBoston Dynamics, a company famous for its lifelike walking robots, and in the manufacturing industry. Hesays there’s great opportunity in construction, which generates about $1.4 trillion annually and accounts for around 7 percent of US GDP but hasseen relatively little use of computerization and automation. “We reallysee construction as mobile manufacturing,” hesays. “There's this natural extension of what machines are now capable of out in the real world.”Canvas is part of a boom in construction technology,saysAlex Schreyer, director of theBuilding and Construction Technology Programat the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Hesayssome of the biggest progress is being made in prefabrication of buildings, using robotic processes to construct large parts of buildings that are then assembled on-site. But increasingly, hesays, robots and AI are also finding their way onto conventional worksites. Autonomous vehicles made by Volvoferry materials and tools aroundsome largesites. Technology from San FranciscostartupBuilt Roboticslets construction machinerysuch as diggers and dozers operate autonomously. A growing array of robotic equipment can take overspecialized construction tasks includingwelding,drilling, andbrick-laying. “There aresome really interesting things happening,” Schreyersays. An IDCreportpublished in January 2020 forecasts that demand for construction robots will grow about 25 percent annually through 2023. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoOne big opportunity in construction, Schreyersays, is using computer vision and othersensing technologies to track the movement of materials and workers around a worksite. Software can automatically flag if a job is falling behind, or ifsomething has been installed in the wrong place. “There isso much potential to dosomething with that using AI,” Schreyersays. “More companies are going to move into that AIspace.”Doxel, based in Redwood City, California, makes a mobile robot thatscans worksites in 3-so thatsoftware can calculate how the project is progressing. A four-leggedBoston Dynamicsrobot called Spot is being tested for thesame purpose at a number ofsites. Several companiessell drones for automated constructionsite inspection, includingPropeller,vHive,ABJ Drones, andDJI. Buildots, based in Tel Aviv, Israel,sellssoftware that uses cameras fitted to the helmets ofsite managers, which automatically capture asite and process the images to identify discrepancies between plans and ongoing work. The technology is being used onseveral large European construction projects.“It’s critical forskilled workers to have great resources in their tool kit, and we are excited to be on the leading edge of technology.”Roy Danon, Buildots’ cofounder and CEO,says the goal is to use the data collected from worksites to help companies design buildings and plan constructionschedules better. “We believe we can have a huge impact on planning,” hesays, “if we have enough projects thatshow how you plan and how things actually turn out.”“The adoption of technology in construction has lagged behind almost everything except hunting and fishing for the past decades,”says Josh Johnson, a consultant at McKinsey who follows the building industry. A McKinseyreportlast month predicts a bigshakeout across the construction industry over the next decade, with companies adopting technologies and methodologies from the manufacturing world. Things have already begun to change, thanks to technological progress and an increasingly tech-savvy workforce, Johnsonsays. The pandemic is accelerating theshift too, by making it more difficult to bring workers to asite and forcing companies to reevaluatesupply lines and processes. “It’s forcing many of these legacy [construction contractors] and large companies to begin investing,” Johnsonsays. Arevalo, who oversees deployments of Canvas’ robot,says the dry walling robot cannot tackle corners or angles like a human;shesays many apprenticessee working with the robot as an opportunity to learn how to use more advanced robotic machinery. The company also has the backing of the local union. “It’s critical forskilled workers to have great resources in their tool kit, and we are excited to be on the leading edge of technology in our industries by partnering with Canvas,” Robert Williams III, business manager at District Council 16, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades,said in astatement. But this apparently hasn’t quelled concerns among construction workers who’veseen the robot in action. “They love the fact that it’sso consistent, that the wall is gorgeous,” Arevalosays. “But then the next question is, ‘When is it going to take my job?’”",2,2,WIRED

Aboutan hour and five minutes into the hearing, Congressman Glenn Grothman (R-WI) used his time to assert that ""experts disagree"" andsuggested thesubcommitteeshould really be hearing from Judy Mikovits:Right nowsomebody gave me a book Plague of Corruption by Judy Mikovits who is very —sometimes very pro-vaccine,sometimes jaded about vaccines and you know we got five people I think on the panel today, and nobody is particularly jaded to the degree whichshe is. I wondered if people feel thatsomebody like hershould be on a panel today or be in the room as we rush vaccines to--to market? Couldsomebody comment on her or do you think it would be good to havesomebody on a panel like this who maybe thinks we are a little bit over-vaccinated in America and isn't going to beso gung-ho vaccine, everybody?""A lot of, I think, intelligent people who read a lot aresometimes a little jaded on the vaccine thing,"" Grothman concluded.""Plague of Corruption,"" which was published by Mikovits in April, is ""co-authored by anti-vaccine b logger Kent Heckenlively."" In the book,she ""compares herself to, among others, Galileo, Martin Luther King Jr., and Thomas Jefferson."" She also implied that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ""ordered the murder of virologist Kuan-Teh Jeang, who died in 2013, as part of a cover-up burying Mikovits’ research.""Asked to defendsome of the claims in her new book and video by Science Magazine, Mikovitssent a PowerPoint which called for an “immediate moratorium” on all vaccines. In another video, ""Mikovits is wearing a hat thatsays VAXXED II, which is asequel to a film that links the mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine to autism, a debunked theory.""Grothman has a history of peddling anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. In 2017, Jeff Spitzer-Resinick visited with members of Congress ""to advocate for better health care and education for people with autism"" as part of Autism Society’s Day on the Hill. During that trip, Grothman repeatedly asked Spitzer-Resinick if he believed that vaccines caused autism, another widely debunked theory. As a member of the Wisconsinstate legislature, Grothmansponsored legislation that would have prohibited hospitalsand other employers from requiring their employees to get flushots. The bill was opposed by 20state health organizations. Grothman is not alone in pushing Mikovits into the mainstream. Sinclair Media Group, a right-wing organization that operates nearly 200 televisionstations that reach 40% of Americans, recorded and published an interview with Mikovits in whichshesuggested that COVID-19 was by Fauci. Eric Bolling, the former Fox News anchor who was ousted from the network following allegations ofsexual harassment, now hosts a weeklyshow produced by Sinclair. Although Sinclair does not have the profile of Fox News, itshares its ideology and also has a massive reach. It has previously forced localstations to run pro-Trump commentary from former Trump aide Boris Epshteyn. Bolling'sshow issyndicated on local television networks that reach millions of viewers across the country. This week, Bollinginterviewed Mikovits and her lawyer, Larry Klayman. Bolling made no mention of Mikovits' role in pushing discredited conspiracy theories and introduced her as an ""expert in virology."" Mikovits used the platform to accuse Fauci of manufacturing COVID-19. BOLLING: Dr. Mikovits, tell me about the -- what you believe Dr. Fauci has done wrong?JUDY MIKOVITS: I believe Dr. Fauci has manufactured the coronavirus es in monkey cell lines andshipped them from and paid for andshipped the cell lines to Wuhan, China, now for at leastsince 2014. He published that fact and funded thestudies that were published in 2015 in Nature Medicine thatstated that the original cell line the Chinese used to grow the virus wasshipped from Ft. Detrick, USAMRIID, the biosafety level 4 facility there. Bolling did not make any effort to contest this absurd claim, other than calling it ""hefty."" When Bolling followed up later, Mikovits claimed thesame lab created ""the Ebolastrain in 2014 that killed 21,000 Liberians.""After thesegment, Bolling interviewed Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier to respond. Saphiersaidshe found Mikovits' claims ""highly unlikely,"" andshe did not believe Fauci ""has been involved in the manufacturing of this virus."" But even during this interview, the c hy ron below Saphier and Bolling asked: ""Did Dr. Fauci Create Coronoavirus?""The fullsegment was posted online Thursday and was first highlighted by Media Matters. It was immediately published to the websites of dozens of localstations around the country. Initially, Sinclair defended thesegment,saying the company was ""asupporter of freespeech and a marketplace of ideas and viewpoints.""Bolling also defended thesegment i nan interview with CNN.""I did challenge her,"" Bollingsaid, noting he called her claim ""hefty.""When pressed over whether calling a claim ""hefty"" constituted effectively challenging the conspiracy theory Mikovits pushed, Bollingsaid that he did believe he challenged her. Bolling then told CNN Business that he was not aware of the viral ""Plandemic"" video Mikovits was featured in earlier this year…... But when asked whether, now that he was aware of the video, he had anysecond thoughts about airing thesegment with Mikovits, Bolling replied, ""I don'tsecond guess my producers and bookers.""But as outrage over thesegment grew, Sinclair reversed course and announced it was delaying the airing of the episode. There are a few issues with Sinclair's response. First, it perpetuates the idea that Mikovits is making a useful contribution to the discourse and that her views just need additional context. Second, the decision was made too late. Although thesegment was pulled from the websites of Sinclair affiliates, no correction or notice was provided. The video was also removed from Bolling's Facebook page, but not before it was viewed thousands of times. Bolling's interview with Mikovits also aired on at least one televisionstation,WCHS in Charleston, West Virginia. Support Accountability JournalismGive a giftsubscription",1,1,Popular Information

Brian Cassella / Chicago TribunePeople walk along South Wentworth Avenue on Monday, June 28, 2021 in Chinatown. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune)Following a year where the pandemic reduced Chicago’s tourist-dependent Chinatown to a ghost town, there aresigns that life isslowly beginning to return to normal. At midday at Cermak and Wentworth, the beating heart of one of the nation’s biggest Chinatowns, delivery trucksshare the tight two-waystreet with double-parked cars and cruisingsightseers as pedestrianssnake between gaps in traffic. Elderly residents are walking thestreets again,shopping at local groceries,stopping to chat with longtime friends. Souvenirshops have opened for the first timesince astay-at-home order cleared thestreets, and foot traffic issteady in front of thestately Pui Tak Center, a vitalsocialservice network in the community.“Chinatown is coming back to the way it was,” Yu Xin Feng, 74,said through a translator at the Pui Tak Center, where he and his wife, He Yu Yong, 73, were receiving theirsecond round of vaccinations. Fengsaid he felt less anxiety about gettingsick or traveling thissummer. Still, unlike insome parts of the city, face masks are an ever-presentsight, despite a massive push by local Chinese leaders to get older residents vaccinated and the high vaccination rate among the city’s Asian community. The neighborhood fell on lean times during the pandemic. While many are eager to get back to business in a neighborhood heavily reliant on tourism, there remains asense of caution onseveral fronts. For one, there’ssome anxiety over the new variantstrains of the COVID-19 virus thatsome business owners fear could derail the reopening. There also remains hyper awareness following a year of rising violence against Asian Americans across the country. Community leaders believe comments by former President Donald Trump linking the pandemic to China have triggered increased incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes like those in New York and California, and have hurt local economies.“Even in late 2019, we were already hearing about the ‘China flu,'”said Paul Luu, head of the Chinese American Service League. “And it’s damaging our businesses.”Some residents were also already on edge because of high-profile violent crimes in Chinatown,some fearing that immigrants in particular were targets.“It’s especially heartbreaking when … a family that came here with a lot of hopes and dreams about having a good life in the country and thensomething like that happens,”saidstate Rep. Theresa Mah, D-Chicago. “It really affects a lot of people because it could be them.”Lingering fearsThe neighborhood remains aspiritual homeland for the city’s Chinese community and immigrants, as well as Koreans, Vietnamese and other Asians and Pacific Islanders. It is a frequent destination for collegestudentsseeking bubble tea or residents who patronize groceries, bakeries and medicineshops that carrystaples of a Chinese household. In the face of the pandemic and the alarmsurrounding hate crimes andstreet crimes, Chinatown’s vast network of businesses andsocialservice agencies both big andsmallsprang into action last year, quickly organizing webinars, food drives, meal deliveries to elderly residents and a large vaccination drive. Mah’s office has worked with Pui Tak Center, which is funded by the Chinese Christian Union Church,and other areasocialsafety net organizations for coordination. Chicago’s Asians are tied for highest rate of individuals who have been fully vaccinated and have the highest rate of people with at least oneshot,according to city data. Mostsay workers are happy to get back to normal life.“I wouldsay most people are excited (about reopening), but definitely a few peoplesaying, ‘I’m concerned,'”said Emma Yu, executive director of the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. Yusaidsomeshop owners were afraid that relaxing mask rules could trigger another wave of infections. “We’ve heard about the variants, from India and South Africa. People really don’t know if the vaccine will really help them for this new (variant).”Mah, the first Asian elected to the General Assembly,said the neighborhood has had to contend with misinformation and “the fear that people had because of the association with the virus coming from Asia.”“Back in January last year, people were afraid to come to Chinatown because ‘Oh no, I may catch it here,'”shesaid. Atsome area businesses revenue was down 40% to 60% compared with the previous year, according to Luu, of the Chinese American Service League. “We’re thankful it’s opening up again. So business owners can recoup and bring back workers andsupport their local Chinatown businesses.”Spencer Ng, asecond-generation owner of the Triple Crown restaurant on Wentworth Avenue,said he couldn’t be happier tosee business return to the neighborhood following a tough financial year thatsaw the25-year-old restaurant facing eviction.“Overall, we were down 60% last year. For a big restaurant like mine and other big restaurants, it’s devastating,”said Ng, 36, of Bridgeport, who took over the family business in 2008. By 10 a.m. most weekdays,streets are packed with workers grabbing a breakfast b ao and coffee. In the evening hours, it’s crowded with young people of all races ordering rolled ice cream andsmoothies. But as customers return, a new problem has arisen:asevereshortage of foodservice workers across the industry, which creates a major hurdle for a food destination like Chinatown. “I’mstill operating at 60%seating right now because I don’t have thestaff to fullystaff the restaurant,” Ngsaid.“Since reopening we’veseen a boom in business. It’s been incredible. But at thesame time it’s been hard because we have all the business, but we don’t have thestaff.”Targeted by criminalsIt’s an oldstory in Chinatown, where generations of immigrants have been targeted by criminals most often because the victims, many of whomspeak no English, do not report the crimes. Community residents and volunteers have banded together to performsecurity functions, monitoring areasurveillance cameras after reported robberies and working to convince victims to come forward to police. Last year, a 20-year-old man was charged with murder after authoritiessaid he fatallyshot Weizhong Xiong, 38, and Huayi Bian, 37. Theshocking doubleslaying brought about 100 community residents to the courthouse when thesuspect was charged. Earlier this year, a16-year-old boy was charged with killing Shuai Guan, 33, a married father, during a botched car jacking in late 2020. In the close-knit Asian community, word of each violent attack orstreet robbery quicklyspreads through the community, throughsocial media, email alerts and neighborhood gossip. Those who work with the neighborhood’s large immigrant populationsay many aresubjected to other indignities in addition to being crime victims.“What is a true hate crime? Sometimes when people look at you, theyspit at you or they curse at you; community members may not understand that it’s a true hate crime,” Luusaid. “You’re targeted for who you are.”The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University and the group Stop AAPI Hate each releasedstatisticsshowing aspike in anti-Asian hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, despite an overall decrease in hate crimes. The up tick led President Joe Biden tosign a bill directing the Justice Department to prosecute hate crimes against Asian Americans. The new law gained momentum in March after ashooting rampage at Atlanta-areaspa businesses leftsix women of Asian descent dead. The killingssentshock waves through the nation’s Asian community already trying to cope with widespread reports of racialslurs and discrimination in addition to randomstreet attacks. Feng and his wife, who emigrated from China,have lived near relatives in Chinatown for only five years. Theysaid their early concerns about publicsafety in the neighborhood have lifted as the year has progressed, and they feel comfortable returning to their normal daily routines. Not justshops and restaurantsWhile Chinatowns inNew York, Washington, D. C., and San Francisco have experienced drops in their Chinese populations due to relocation brought on by gentrifying real estate markets, Chicago’s Chinatown has remained a vital urban hub, as well as a working-class neighborhood. Chicago’s metro area is home to the fifth-largest Asian American population in the nation, according to the American Community Survey. Chicago’s early Chinese arrivals in the 1870s, many native tosouthern China’s Canton province and Hong Kong,settled on Clark Street between Van Buren and Harrisonstreets, quickly building a reputation for the food, laundries and cultural flair they brought to the city.“The Chicagoans found us a peculiar people to besure. But they liked to mix with us,” a new Chicago arrivalsaid, according to the 2005 book “Chinese in Chicago, 1870-1945.”The neighborhood hosted extravagant Lunar New Year celebrations as early as 1891, according to an archived Tribune article. A piece of Chicago lore reported in a 1927 articlesaidChinese immigrant Lee Lan walked in to a gambling joint with just 75 cents but left with more than $10,000 after a hotstreak. Chinese businesses and old families moved to the current location near the South Branch of the Chicago River in 1912 as the city cleared away the old vice districts in what is now the South Loop. Chinatown remained a crowded center of activity for decades until a period of decline, the Chinese populationsinking to just 2,000 by the mid-1960s, as upwardly mobile Chinese and their Americanized children headed to thesuburbs. The neighborhood was revitalized following bold planning in the 1970s by local Chinese business owners like Ping Tom, who wanted it to be a center of Chinese culture. The famous Chinatown Gate was erected in 1975. Chicago’ssurging Asian population chose to return to Chinatown and adjacent neighborhoods like Canaryville, Bridgeport and north Bronzeville.“There are people who have lived here for generations. Their grandparents moved here, maybe 80 years ago, 30 years ago and their parents were raised here. Now a third generation,” Yusaid.“Chinatown is not just theshops and the restaurants,”said Luu. “It’s a community in Chicago. We have a truestake in the city.”wlee@chicagotribune.comTwitter@MidNoirCowboy",2,2,Chicago Tribune

As the Taliban took Kabul over the weekend, the return to normalcy was President Biden exhibiting thesame reckless callousness we had come to expect from Trump. I am an Afghan-American. My father left Kabul as the Soviets began to disappear members of my family. Eventually my grandfather, who was a member of Parliament, forced my father to leave for America. Raised in Queens by a grandmother whose parents came from Eastern Europe through Ellis Island, and a half-Tajik, half-Pashtun grandmother from Afghanistan, I am a product of what made America a global beacon of hope, and a piece of my heart has always been in Kabul. In 2020, along with three young reformers in Afghanistan’s parliament, I founded the Afghanistan-U. S. Democratic Peace and Prosperity Council (DPPC) to build a bridge between the young leaders in Afghanistan and the United States. Weserve as a voice for the majority youth population in Afghanistan who embrace democracy and freedom. Unfortunately, many Americans only hear about the failures of U. S. involvement in Afghanistan andsee our most broken and despicable representatives. If you are a millennial in the United States, then you cannot think of Afghanistan without also thinking of the endless-war narrative and the rampant corruption and ineptitude ofsuccessive Afghan governments. The DPPC was foundedso that Americans could learn what theirsacrifice, their blood and treasure, had done for my people. When Western forces entered the country, it was a failedstate, devoid of modernity and hope. But twenty years later there wereso many brightspots. We were making progress for women and girls, in civilsociety, education, health care, culture, and insports. We have tens of millions of young Afghans, raised in a democracy, building a future for themselves and their country, embodying thesame ideals and dreams that America’s youth have. Afghanistan didn’t have the benefit of 250 years of a democratic politicalsystem to guide us—but we were on our way. We knew that Americanshoulders could notsupport Afghanistan forever—but we also didn’t think our friends would leave us in the dead of night. President Biden was more familiar with the Afghanistan question than any of his predecessors. His disdain for the conflict was well known and Washingtonshould not have beensurprised at his decision to leave. However, after twenty years, Joe Biden of all peopleshould know how to make a graceful exit. It is not asecret that fighting is cyclical—come late fall the weather in Afghanistanswitches from desert heat to frozen tundra—making movements for exposed ground forces, like the Taliban’s, extremely difficult. But the Biden return to normalcy only normalized Trump. Just like Trump in Syria, Biden left Afghanistan without a plan. As an Afghan, I am quick to admit the weakness and venality of the former-President Ashraf Ghani and his government. History will judge him and his cronies very harshly for their nefarious actions, abandoning andselling out the military and country in its most desperate days. But this morning as we watched the Talibanmarch into the presidential palace, many on the American right and left weresmugly congratulating themselves on Twitter for predicting the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. These anti-war leftists and libertarians taking their online victory laps cannot fathom what Afghans are going through. They have never lived in fear, been denied basic human rights or been forced intosexualslavery. They will never understand America’ssuccesses. What happened in Kabul is not assimple as a failing of Afghans—like anything else it’s more complicated. Afghanistan’s military—trained and modeled after that of the United States—relies on air power tosupport combat missions. For months, more than a third of Afghanistan’s air force has been grounded. When you use American weapons they require technicians from U. S. contractors to beserviced. President Biden refused to leave contractors in Afghanistan and the ANSDF has been doing Zoom calls with their American counterparts toservice military aircraft. Read thatsentence again. The grounding of Afghanistan’s air force is not asecret to anyone—in fact just a few weeks ago our members of Parliament with the DPPC pleaded with the United States to dosomething about it. But this is the great return to normalcy; like Donald Trump, Joe Biden has abdicated all American moral responsibility in the world. While allseems lost, there isstill a fight to be had for the thousands of people who havesupported the American military and diplomatic corps over the last two decades. Biden has an opportunity to grant blanket amnesty to Afghans wanting to come to the United States and to demand the international community not only fail to recognize the Taliban, but destroy the U. S.-provided weapons itstole andsanction it out of existence. This is the least the United States can do tosupport the Afghan people: Help those who face violent retribution from the Taliban escape without harm, and give the lawmakers and political leaders who remain inservice to the Afghan people a chance to either negotiate asystem of government that does notset the country back twenty years, or fight for a future where they can be free. These measures will require overcoming jingoism and a lack of imagination, they will requirestrength and consensus building. A return to Trump’s normalcy would mean neither are accomplished—but President Bidenstill has an opportunity to restore American normalcy while helping the Afghan people. Let’s hope he does.",1,1,The Bulwark
263,Op-ed: Joe Biden is impeachment’s biggest loser,7.33,35.0,https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-biden-impeachment-trump-republicans-20210116-qk2vyukj5rfzxfutm2nyxmkdnm-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-15,25,"To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, there they go again. Frantic to extinguish any chance Donald Trump will ever again run for office, Democrats have pushed through an express-train impeachment, concluding the president incited “violence against the government of the United States.”The hasty undertaking, unencumbered by deliberations, investigations or witnesses’sworn testimony, cheapens thesober intent of the impeachment process. Itsmacks of partisan vindictiveness. When New York U. S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries describes the president himself as a “living, breathing, impeachable offense,” he gives the game away. Democrats are certainly correct in labeling the assault on the U. S. Capitol as horrific, especially as it led toseveral deaths. They are also correct that Trump’s incendiary rhetoric these pastseveral weeks raised temperatures past the boiling point and inspiredsome of those who unforgivably breached the halls of Congress.________The Chicago Tribune opinionsection publishes op-eds from readers and experts aboutspecific issues of the day. Op-eds reflect the views of the writer and not necessarily theChicago Tribune.________But rushing to impeach a president who has onlyseven days remaining in his term is itself an affront to our democracy. Impeachment is meant to be a last resort means of expelling a president, not a political weapon. There has not been aserious probe of what happened that terrible day, how the rioting was organized and by whom. Timelines andsocial media accountsshow that the breaching of the Capitol took place even as Trump wasstillspeaking to the large crowd of followers, and that the organizers may have plotted out the event in advance, mainly on Twitter and Facebook. Democrats have no patience for asober assessment of what went wrong; they want to humiliate a president who provoked and embarrassed them for four years, and who has accomplished much despite their incessant resistance. Had they voted to censure Trump, they might have brought Republicans on board. As it is, only 10 Republicans in the House voted to impeach; 197sided with the president. Democrats risk creating a martyr who will continue to havesignificant influence and who will bedevil them for the foreseeable future. Polling confirms the attack on the Capitol has badly damaged Trump’s approval ratings, with aPolitico/Morning Consultsurveyshowing 75% of Republicans approving of the job the president is doing, down from 83% in December. Had Democrats followed a more measured course, confidence in the president would likely have drifted lower, especially as Trump’ssocial media bullhorn has been virtuallysilenced. Instead, Democrats have wounded not only President Trump, but also their own president-elect. Joe Biden ran for president promising to bring the country together. His inaugural theme is America United. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues have made a mockery of Biden’s appealing entreaty. Her vindictive push to impeach hasshown that Biden is not really in charge of his political party. If he were,surely he would have talked Pelosi and her angry House Democrats down from the ledge and convinced her toseeksome lesser resolution. The New York Timeswrites admiringly that Biden “stays above the fray” and “has maintained astudied cool” as he works toward “lowering the political temperature.” The president-elect, notes the Times, has deferred to Pelosi and other Democrats in Congress. That’s one way of looking at it. Here’s another: Turning this critical political moment over to Pelosi and her enraged colleaguesseems more likesubmission than deferral. It reads as weakness. Thanks to the House, Biden’s inauguration — despite Lady Gaga’s best efforts — will now be overshadowed by ongoing impeachment drama. It is not clear when the articles of impeachment will be delivered to the Senate, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected requests from Democrats to call the chamber back early in order to immediately rush ahead with the necessary trial. McConnell issued astatementsaying there was “simply no chance that could conclude” before Inauguration Day. So even as Biden takes office on Wednesday, headlines will focus onspeculation about whether McConnell will vote to convict the president, how many NeverTrump Republicanssuch as Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski will join Democrats, and who will defend the president. Biden willsee his big daysubsumed into more bitter partisan politics. Moreover, the outgoing president will remain centerstage, which no incoming president would ever like. The longer the impeachment drama drags out, the longer Trump gets to rail about a “rigged” election, convincing millions that Biden is not a legitimate president. Biden has big plans. He has promised on Day One of his administration to rejoin the World Health Organization, reach out to our NATO allies, roll out a giantstimulus program, reenter the Paris climate accords, reverse Trump’s immigration practices, eliminate Trump’s tax cuts and clamp down on U. S. oil and gas production. He also vows to vanquish COVID-19. He wants to get his Cabinet nominees confirmed. All these ambitions will be delayed by a Senate impeachment trial. Even if hesucceeds insomehow moving his agenda forward, the nation’s attention will be diverted elsewhere in his administration’s early days. On the other hand, given that Biden ran asuccessful campaign bystaying largely out ofsight in his basement for months on end and eschewing any free-for-all conversations with the media, maybe having the country focused elsewheresuits him just fine.

The organisation that Zoller works for, the Bail Project, opposes cash bail, and claims that paying bail for those in jail is an“act of resistance against asystem that criminalizes race and poverty.”The Bail Project has been funded by the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey. In June,Dorsey’s #startsmall intiative teamed up with Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation,to donate $11 million to organisations that “advance racial equity, with a focus on criminal justice and policing reform.” The Bail Project was a recipient of these funds, along with Black Lives Matter.

267,Andrew Yang’s Insider Campaign,-5.8,44.4,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-yang-nyc-mayor-race.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-05-10,25,"One Great Story,New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up hereto get it nightly.down in the back corner of a dark restaurant in the Bronx — brow knitted, wearing an overcoat andscarf that wouldstay on for the whole lunch — he was not thesame cheerful New York City mayoral candidate of our popular conception, the one who cheeses for photos and tweets things like “It’s Friday!” when it’s Friday orshouts “Yankee Stadium!” whilestanding in front of Yankee Stadium. Politicians are always a little different behind thescenes, their ambition harder to conceal in close quarters, but the mansitting across from me was particularly unfamiliar. Since entering the race in January, Yang has pitched himself as the happy warrior for the Everyman, an energetic presence promising to lead New York out of its grim recent past. While other candidates have emphasized the city’s need for an experienced and empathic crisis manager, Yang has acted like a constant human joy machine. But today, he wasserious, even a little crabby. Gone was the man who wants to bring TikTok Hype Houses to New York; he was replaced by a bristly high achiever, albeit one who has a habit of punctuatingsomberstatements with outbursts of giggles. I asked him, Did other people ever note this difference?“I really appreciate the line of inquiry,” Yangsaid. (He actuallyseemed mildly offended by it.) “I think people underestimate what a disciplined operator I am.”“Anyone who’s an operatorsees me and this campaign andsays, ‘Oh, I get it, Andrew Yang’s an operator,’ ” he continued. “And then if you put a business person next to me for ten minutes — or, I’m guessing, the vast majority of people who also are operators — they get it. Like, wespeak thesame language.” Yang, 46,seemed to besaying he wasn’t just the goofy,smart guy from the 2020 presidential-debatestage who wore a MATH pin that madesome fellow Asian Americans cringe. Yang — he of Phillips Exeter, Brown, Columbia, white-shoe law,start-up wealth, godfather dom to Teddy Roosevelt’s direct descendant — could hang with the city’s power brokers. He also appeared eager to reflect the valuesystems of those places of power: Yang, who calls himself the anti-poverty candidate based largely on his proposal for annual $2,000 direct payments to the poorest New Yorkers,said he envisioned himselfspending his firstsix months in office luring back the city’s elite by calling the many Masters of the Universe who have recently decamped to Florida.“ ‘Like, what are the issues that drove you out? What were the decisions?’ And then be like, okay, here are, like, the things that drove people away. If we resolve them, can we get them back?” he had told me previously. “It’s a pretty tight community,so if the mayor is calling people asking these questions and trying to get them back, I think there are a lot of people who would be thrilled about it.”Heslurped blackspaghetti, continuing tosketch out his ambitions for the early days of his mayoralty. Aside from working the phones, his plans were vague. He was fuzzy about how exactly he would be able to wrest more control from Albany over thesubways: “I haven’t had those conversations.” Hesaid he thinks the MTA boardshould be altered to give the city more power, whichsoundssimple enough but, close up, is an incredibly complicated political proposition. One concrete move Yang knows he wants to make is to hire Kathryn Garcia, the former head of the Department of Sanitation and one of his rivals in the race. “What I appreciate about Kathryn is thatshe’s an operator,” he told me. He’s big on the idea that he would hire the right people to do the job, just like Michael Bloomberg did. Yangsaid he calls Garcia at least once a week tosay, “Hey, Kathryn, we’re gonna need you.” (It’s true he calls a lot, according to her campaign. “Makes her crazy,”said Christine Quinn of the implications that Garciashould be Yang’s No. 2. Quinn was the front-runner in the 2013 mayor’s race until Bill de Blasio overtook her in the final weeks.)On June 22, New York City Democrats will nominate a mayoral candidate for what is widely expected to be an uncompetitive general election, and polling currentlysuggests a three-person race between Yang,Eric Adams, andScott StringerwithYang ahead in most polls. He has never worked in government, or voted in a New York City election, orstarted anything bigger than a hundred-person nonprofit, yet he’s convincing a not-insignificant number of people that he can run a bureaucracy of 325,000 municipal workers in a city of more than 8 million at one of the most challenging eras in its history. Yang’ssurprising dominance hasn’t just been luck. He has cannily deployed his fame, charisma, and hustle, bringing his very modern celebrity to a field otherwise low on name recognition and charm. But another part of hissuccess, perhaps more central than most voters realize, must be credited to his team of advisers and closesupporters. Many of the city’s most well-connected,savvieststrategists have bet on Yang, and in less than two months, eight years after rejecting the legacy of Bloomberg forsomeone defiantly to his left, New York may very well elect an heir to the billionaire ex-mayor’s worldview. Yang is a couple of generations younger, with business ideas that are more tech inflected than Wall Street honed, but his vision for the city is fundamentally Bloombergian — not only appealing to thesame privileged, progressive-to-a-point audience butshaped bysome of its verysame architects.started as a game of telephone. Although played out on Twitter and in the press, the dynamics were both personal and particular to asmall group of former Bloombergstaffers. At 8:45 p.m. on February 11, 2020, Howard Wolfson, then asenior adviser on Bloomberg’s ill-fated presidential campaign,tweetedout a Politico piece about Yang dropping out of the Democratic primary: “@AndrewYang would make a very interesting candidate for NYC Mayor in 21.”“I didn’t really give it a lot of thought. It was one of those tweets that went from brain to fingers fairly quickly,” Wolfson told me. A few days earlier, the New Yorkhad run astory about Shaun Donovan, a former Obama-administration and Bloomberg appointee, running for mayor. Chris Coffey, another Bloomberg alum and now one of Yang’s campaign managers, noted that, at the time, Donovan was playing down his Bloomberg connections. That rubbedsome people in the ex-mayor’s orbit the wrong way, and derisive quotes in thestory made it clear that hisset wasstillsearching for a candidate. Yang’s biography reflects Bloomberg’s New York: constant onward-and-upwardstriverdom. He grew up in Schenectady and Westchester, theson of Taiwanese immigrants, and he has written about the regularity of the racist taunts he endured inschool. Yang was a goodstudent,scoring over a 1500 on the SAT and a 178 on the LSAT, but he also focused on fitness. He hassaid that he worked out too much, naming his pe cs Lex and Rex — “Probably my proudest achievement in college was that I could bench-press 225 pounds eight times in a row” — and always related to the underdog. He liked to find the awkward kids at parties and make them feel welcome. Yang came to New York for lawschool, graduating from Columbia in 1999 and briefly taking a job at Davis Polk. By 2002, the first year of the Bloomberg mayoralty, he had made and lost money in the tech bubble. In 2006, he joined andsoon became CEO of the test-prep company Manhattan GMAT, where he had worked as a tutor. Yang and his partnerssold the company to Kaplan in 2009 at a price in the low tens of millions, he hassaid. In 2011, hestarted Venture for America, a nonprofit that aims to reinvigorate flagging American cities by injecting them with young entrepreneurs —sort of a business version of Teach for America. Yang has acknowledged it didn’t achieve all he had wanted; a recent report found that, despite itssetting out to employ 100,000 people in those cities, only 150 of the jobs remain. Still, it generated asignificantsense of personal accomplishment and professional acclaim; Yang likes to mention how President Obama named him a “champion of change.” Hestayed at Venture until he entered the Democratic primary in 2017. As the Wolfson tweetsuggests, Yang quickly distinguished himself among the candidates as a bright, interesting young thing. He was never going to win, but, unlike Tulsi Gabbard, heseemed to know that: Yang was out to raise his profile andspread the good word about his ideas. Those ideas were easily digestible and not particularly new, but he managed to redirect the conversation toward them more than many Democratic insiders had expected. He called attention to the looming automation job crisis, and, in what became the centerpiece of his mayoral race, he introduced many Americans to the concept of a universal basic income. Yang first fell in love with the idea of paying Americans direct economic relief — a policy once championed by Martin Luther King Jr. — while running Venture, where he realized that bringing new jobs to cities couldn’t offset the total wages lost to automation. On the presidential-campaign trail, Yang was open about the fact that his Freedom Dividend of $12,000 a year was just a rebranding of an old policy proposal, but it wasstill a pretty radical one. “An economy where big tech and Wall Street are held accountable,” one Yang presidential TVspot proclaimed. Little did he know the federal government wouldsoon be making $2 trillion in direct payments to Americans during a pandemic. Despite polling toward the bottom of the pack, Yang became a celebrity politician in thespan of a campaign cycle. (Yang’s wife hassincesaidshe thought of his run as “just a phase.”) After dropping out of the race, he moved to Georgia to help the Democratic candidates for Senate there. He was leading the perma-campaign-trail life,sometimes appearing on CNN, always trying to figure out what to do next. Running for mayor was on his mind. “There was, like, a groundswell of people trying to get me to run assoon as I ended the presidential,” he told me in early March while we were waiting for thesubway. “I don’t know if yousaw that.”In February 2020, outlets like were pushing the idea of a Yang mayoral run,speculation that the Yang campaign was allowing if notseeding. Zach Graumann, Yang’s presidential-campaign manager, told me it was actually theTimeseditorial board that had joked that Yangshould be running for mayor, not president, an implication that “always made us mad.” For his part, Yang told me that the first person who told him heshould run for mayor was an old law-school friend. Many core members of Yang’s mayoral-campaign team work for Tusk Strategies, a political consultancy founded by Bradley Tusk, a man once called “the Manchurian consultant.” Coffeysays he and Tusk were connected to Graumann in the earlyspring of 2020 by Kevin Sheekey, Bloomberg’s then–campaign manager. Tusk, who worked for both Chuck Schumer and Rod Blagojevich before running Bloomberg’s 2009 mayoral campaign, is a native New Yorker who has gotten rich as a politicalstrategist for companies like Uber and AT&T (Tusk Strategies) and as a venture capitalist (Tusk Ventures). Tusk, 47, is mostly a VC these days, representing companies like the keyless-entry app Latch and the urban-scooterstart-up Bird, but business-friendly- politics remains a time-consuming- hobby. Heso despises de Blasio that in 2016 he embarked on a campaign to recruit a candidate to replace him (Donovan turned him down) and funded ads that fixated on the mayor’s perceived laziness. To Tusk, de Blasio’s New York is hostile to business and tech and more invested instoking class warfare than in bringing innovation to the city. (“How about we go tostart-ups andsay, ‘Okay, we’ll give you free rent for the next five years; you have to commit to being in New York for the next 20,’ ” he told me of one policy idea he would like tosee.) Tusk’sspecialty lately is helpingstart-ups,some of which operate in gray areas of labor law and fight regulations related to wages and working conditions. Tusk’s blitzkrieg on behalf of Uber against de Blasio’s City Hall was both innovative — his team created an in-app way for customers to contact public officials andsay they wanted to keep their Uber rides — and horrifying to progressive critics of the gig economy. “He is one of these people who combine both creative vision and the ability to execute against it,” Wolfson, his friend,said. Until September 2020, Tusk and Coffey had a preferred mayoral candidate: City Council SpeakerCorey Johnson, who has close ties with Governor Cuomo and espouses a more centriststrain of Democratic politics. But then Johnson unexpectedly decided not to enter the race, citing the mental-healthstresses of the pandemic. Tusk, who had been informally advising Johnson, found himself in the market for another candidate who might embrace a progressive yet business-friendly agenda. Yang wasn’t the onlysuch person out there (former Citigroup executive Ray McGuire, for example, could have fit the bill), but he hadsomething else going for him: celebrity. Since the 1970s, a class of moneyed elites has posited that it is the “permanent government” in New York City. No matter who occupies the mayor’s office, its memberssay with pride, corporate and civic leaders will guide the city out of crisis and toward economic growth. They argue that mayors need tax revenue to pay for their higher-minded policy goals, like expanding universal pre-K, and that the better life is for business (retaining wealthy individuals who are willing to pay high taxes in the city), the more the mayor can do tosupport those on the bottom. De Blasio, with his tale of two cities, promised a deliberate departure from that arrangement, and even thosesympathetic to his politics may acknowledge that his efficacy as mayorsuffered as a result: For much of the past eight years, it has felt as if he were at war with everyone, with no powerful interests on hisside. Tusk and his cohort were looking forsomething of a return to permanent government and for a candidate disinterested in ideological crusading. In many ways, what they have found in Yang isn’t dissimilar to President Biden’s appeal, with each promising optimism and consensus after years of rancor. Backing an inexperienced candidate to push an agenda that would require bringing together a diverse electoral coalition and navigating the prickly outposts of political power mayseem odd, but it has its advantages. Yang has no governmental record,so no past votes or policy fights can be used against him. He’s open to taking on unorthodox positions tosatisfy the city’s various voting blocs, as when he took thestance that Brooklyn yeshivas, which a recent DOEreportfound had failed to provide anysemblance of asecular education, don’t need additional government oversight. To me, Yang described his approach to politics as “apolitical,” and it’s true that insome ways he eludes ourstrict notions of progressive and conservative. “While he hassome very progressive ideas, he’s a candidate who’s also willing to defy progressive orthodoxy,”said the journalist and former State Senate candidate Ross Barkan, pointing out Yang’sstance against de funding the police. When there was aspike insubway crime, Yang was quick to call for more cops. “That definitely makes him attractive to Bloomberg acolytes,” Barkansaid. (There arestaffers from the former mayor’s administration and campaigns at the top levels of the Adams, Stringer, and McGuire camps as well.)“Andrew and Istartedspending time together and talking about what the job really means” in the early fall, Tusk told me. Yang wanted to ask about how New York City functions: “How do all the agencies work, what powers does the mayor have, what powers doesn’t the mayor have, what’s the interface with the City Council?” Tusksaid. “Did he know as much assome of the other candidates? No, of course not.” Bloomberg hadn’t either, Tusk reasoned, and he did just fine in the office. When it was finally time last fall to call people and feel them out on a Yang mayoralty, “no one really knew him that well — everyone had heard of him,” Tusksaid. “There was a lot of ‘I didn’t know he was a New Yorker.’ ” A few told Tusk they didn’t love the field and could be tempted to talk to Yang. That was enough to make a go of it. On January 13, Yang declared his candidacy with aDarren Aronofsky–directed campaign video. “I came of age, fell in love, and became a father here,” Yangsays over brooding background music. “Hang in there. Help is on the way.”have beenscathing about his candidacy, mercilessly trolling him for being a tourist in the town he’s running to govern. They dogged him for not voting in past mayoral races, for not knowing where the A train terminates, and for riding out the worst of the pandemic at his home in New Paltz. (He and his family rent an apartment in Hell’s Kitchen; his children attendschools in the city, one public, the other a privateschool for kids withspecial needs.) “I’d be the first to admit that I’m learning a ton about New York City,” Yang told me one day out on the trail. But while he has been easy to roast, Yang has been hard to catch in the polls. His celebrity was on full display on April 1, opening day at Yankee Stadium. I found him by Gate 4 only because of the roving mass of cameras that followed him as he bumped elbows and cheered the city’s return to normalcy. Yang worked thesnaking outdoor queue, taking pictures, at one point finding a guy who had gone to thesame highschool as he did. Even if they didn’tseem to know his name, people knew who he was. Yang’s approachability is undeniable. “It is completely addictive,” progressive Queens assembly member Ron Kimsaid. “Many in the media kind of reduce that assomething immature. But it’s clear that when he’s walking around, people are drawn to that energy.”Although he is a gifted glad-hander, Yang can be astiltedspeaker, pausing for longstretches between big thoughts. At a joint event with Yang andMaya Wiley, it was notable how polishedshe was — how practiced at projecting, even above the din of the trains running over the Manhattan Bridge — and how tinny andstrained hesounded. (The way Wileystepped in at moments to answer a question directed at Yang made me wonder how the debates, notscheduled tostart until May 13, may go for him.) She and others argue that he’s all celebrity, nosubstance. “T-shirts don’t win elections,”she hassaid, deriding him assomeone who “doesn’t understand how government works.” Adams has blamed the media for Yang’ssuccess: “We are creating a Donald Trump with Andrew Yang.” Stringer, who hasspent his entire adult life building toward this run, can barely contain his contempt. He has called Yang pandering and mock-applauded him for passing the “smart test” on one policy idea. Yangspins all of this around, labeling his opponents defeatists. “They’ll immediately have five reasons why it’s either difficult or can’t be done,” hesaid of the responses of government types. One progressivestrategist, whosaid he thought Yang as mayor would be “pretty bad” because of his friendliness to big business, begrudgingly admired his approach. “Bradley Tusk outsmarted us. Hesawsomething in the way that national politics was realigning that would allow for a candidacy of thissort to bust in with this name ID.”A number of influential politicians on the left, like Kim, alsoseesomething in Yang. Kim was up front insaying he had endorsed Yangprecisely because he thought he could bend him leftward. Initially, he had been turned off byYang’s UBI plan, calling it a “campaign gimmick” during the presidential primary, and by an April 2020 op-ed Yangwrotesaying Asian Americans needed to be more overtly patriotic to fight against “China virus”slurs during the pandemic. But Kim’s wifesuggested he talk to Yang before putting him on blast. Kim and Yang met in January, and Kim introduced him to activists and massage-parlor workers in his district. After that meeting, Yang announced his change of heart on decriminalizingsex work. “There’s a whole list of other policies that they put out that I don’t actually agree with,” Kimsaid. “But because I have his ear and trust, if he does become elected, I can help move him toward confronting inequality.” The energy Yang generates can’t be replicated, Kim told me,so “how do we now use that for good?”A couple of times, Kim brought up both hope for and what I interpreted as lingeringskepticism of a Mayor Yang. Although Yang had come around on decriminalizingsex work, his campaign hasn’t taken “60 to 80 percent” of Kim’s policysuggestions for Yang’s “People’s Bank,” for instance. Kim isstill waiting for Yang to prove himself as the anti-poverty candidate and not just another mayor out to restore a playground-for-the-rich version of New York. “Are you going tosell us out?” he asked. “Or are you going to leverage that trust that you’ve earned?”“I feel like I canshape him on every issue,” Representative Ritchie Torres of the Bronxsaid,summarizing the Yang appeal to insiders on allsides. They feel they can pour ideas into his earsince Yang is relatively new to politics andstill finding his footing on issues. For Torres, viability is a top consideration, and Yang has proved he can cut across demographics — the campaign touts its popularity among immigrant New Yorkers, Hasidim, and brownstone-Brooklyn types. Carlos Menchaca, a progressive City Council member who dropped out of the mayor’s race, has also endorsed Yang, a nice little coup given Menchaca’sstanding among New York’s lefties. Meanwhile, the leading progressive candidate, Stringer, has lost a number of key endorsements after facing asexual-assault allegation. He disputes the claim, and his campaign has noted that his accuser filed ballot petitions on behalf of Yang as a volunteer. Yang rankles at thesuggestion that he is at all malleable. He was reticent on the question of Tusk’s influence, tensing when I brought him up. “I’m a very independent person. I have my own judgment,” hesaid. Tusk was more open. He told me that he and Yang have talked and text ed a lot about policy andstrategy throughout the race. He finds a lot of his job is telling Yang, “Don’t worry about all this noise. Ignore it,” or “Keep doing what you’re doing.” The campaign they’re running “is premised on the notion that the inside game” doesn’t matter. Barkan believes Yang’s relationship with Tusk and the Bloombergset issymbiotic. “Yang gets ideas wrong and has no experience in the firmament of New York City politics. He’s also notstupid and not untalented,” hesaid. In Yang, Tusk has “a vessel potentially for his own interests, whether it’s Uber, cryptocurrency, or gambling.”Occasionally, Yang will tweet out orsay whateverseems to have popped into his head (he recently caused asmall firestorm bysuggesting the city ramp up fines onstreet vendors who operate without a license). Tusksaid that Yang is “this very creative thinker” and that often “all he was doing was brainstorming” and the media didn’t understand. Yang once mused about how it would be cool to build a casino on Governors Island, though there’s a federal deed restriction thatspecifically forbids that. (Tusk has gaming holdings,so it was pretty easy to guess where that idea came from.)Yang’s awkward affability can alsosometimes backfirespectacularly. “I genuinely do love you and your community,” hesaid to the Stonewall Democratic Club, an LGBTQ group, on April 21. “You’reso human and beautiful.” (Some members found the comments tokenizing, and the club president told the that Yang’s remarks felt “outdated.”) Another time, in a video ofsomething that happens often — Yang chatting with people who recognize him on thestreet — a young man asks, “While he’s fucking bitches, can a man keep his Timbs on?” Yang replies that it’s up to your partner. Then, pleased that a politician has bitten on his jokey line of inquiry, the man asks, “You choke bitches, Andrew Yang?” Yang laughs and turns away while making a cutting motion at his throat, his adolescent attempt at playing along imploding.“You’re in a posture where you’re trying to be friendly tosomeone and then you’reshocked andsurprised that all of asudden it goes in that direction,” Yangsaid in his defense. Still, itseemed to touch on a moreserious vulnerability in his campaign. Yang has been accused before of fostering asexist work culture: A woman employed at his test-prep companysaid Yang had fired her becauseshe got married and,she recalled himsaying,she wouldn’t “want to continue working as hard.” (Yang has denied this.) And a reportsurfaced that a woman in Yang’s presidential campaign alleged thatshe had been passed over for a promotion in favor of a less experienced man; in response to the piece, Yangsaid, “We didn’t account for how much our male-dominated culture alienated female and non binary employees. I wish we had.”So far, allegations ofsexismseem to haveslid off Yang. New York’s mayoral race historically doesn’t heat up until the final weeks, when ads flood the airwaves. (Lis Smith, the media mind behind Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, has launched a pro-Yang PAC with the goal of raising $6 million for TV ads.)Most voters will likely never hear about Yang’s controversies, which is just fine with theYang Gangand the most irritating thing in the world to everyone else in the race.the problems the next mayor of New York will face is the city’s economic recovery. Whoever is elected will have the power toshape budget priorities, including how tospend the billions of dollars in federal relief the city is receiving through the American Rescue Plan. And unlike billionaire Bloomberg, who could further his policy goals and drown out his opposition through massive donations to non profits and political campaigns, the next mayor won’t be able to personally bankroll their ambitions. Some candidates havesaid they wouldsupport major reductions to the NYPD budget (a.k.a. de funding the police), whichsnowballs into the messy debate on how to best confront the issue of rising crime in a city where police violence has long been a hot-button issue. Yang has come out in favor of getting more officers patrolling thesubways andstaffing the hate-crime unit. The next mayor will hold a lot ofsway over how to deal with police misconduct — like deciding whether firingsshould fall to the police commissioner (Yang’s proposal), the mayor (Adams’s) or the Civilian Complaint Review Board (Stringer’s) — and how to change an entrenched departmental culture. Yang’s critics have pointed out that Tusk Strategies used to represent the Police Benevolent Association,suggesting that policestances would be articulated to Yang via an inside track. Tusk dismissed the idea. “We’re certainly not going to consult with them on who the police commissionershould be,” hesaid. “But yeah, ifsome crisis popped up, and I was the right person to call Pat Lynch and talk to him, I would certainly do that.”The mayor also has ultimate control over the cityschools, and after a year of virtual learning, providing high-quality public education is a top-of-mind issue for many voters. How to make up for pandemic learning losses, improvestudent access to technology — a new reality of education — and tackle thesticky issue of equity inschools will fall to the mayor and the mayor’sschools chancellor. Yangsaid he wants to keep the city’s controversial gifted-and-talented programs and the Specialized High School Admissions Test, which runs counter to liberal Democratic orthodoxy but is popular with many Asian and white parents. Tusk Strategies lobbied against a 2019 bill to get rid of the test. Yang has alsostruck out against his peers by criticizing the United Federation of Teachers,something that could play well with parents after a year of remote learning andschool closures for which many blame the union. Yang told me his first 100 days would be big on hiring the right people — Garcia, for instance. “If Mr. Yang’sstrategy to be the mayor of New York City is to have Kathryn Garcia run the city, then he has in fact made the case for Kathryn Garcia to be the mayor,” her campaign responded. Yang also plans to implement a wholesale culture change in city government. How exactly would he go about doing that? Yang gave me the example of putting a moratorium onsmall-business fines and appointing asmall-business-recovery czar. But most important to him was the human touch. Hesaid, “One of the basic things that we can do is just havesomeone from the city reach out, and we will instruct them that your only message will be, like, ‘Hey, I’mperson, how can we help you?’ ”Yang told me it would probably be two years until the half-million poorest New Yorkers get their $2,000 a year, and that’s assuming everything goes according to plan — he needs tosecure money from private donors alongside cash from the city, which Yang wants to get by taking away the tax breaks of institutions like Columbia and Madison Square Garden. He will needstate approval on that, as he will for many issues confronting the city, which will certainly complicate his ability to deliver. Yang isn’t well known in Albany, but he told me his friendship with Governor Cuomo’s brother, Chris, asometime CNN colleague, would help. Also: “My team hassome connections withsome people on his team.”Tusk will likely havesome thoughts on whom Yangshould hire for what — he knows more people in New York. (He recently released a Medium post dedicated to concerns about his undue influence on a Yang mayoralty,saying he wouldn’t lobby or talk to the mayor about anything that may be a business conflict of interest. Tusk’s newest venture is a bitsmaller inscale: He’s opening a bookstore this fall on the Lower East Side. Tusk is an avid fiction reader.) But Yang chafes at thesuggestion that Tusk will have outsize influence on his potential administration. “I think people know that there’s an enormous difference between appointingsomeone for the purpose of a mayoral campaign and then runningsomething,” he told me. I asked Wolfson what role he thought his friend would play. Tusk, Wolfsonsaid, would occupy aspace not unlike that of Felix G. Rohatyn — “Felix the Fixer” — the wealthy financier and politico from the FORD TO CITY: “DROP DEAD” era. “I think he will be one of the wise men that help ensure New York’s recovery from COVID,somebody who is doing it because they love the city.”Much of Bloomberg’s power lay in the fact that he was his own Rohatyn. His independent wealth and business ties allowed him to bend the city to his own idea of what was best for it. After 9/11, even before taking office, Bloomberg had calmed the CEO class, which was frantic about the death of New York City. Yang doesn’t have that clout to reassure or cajole. “Bloomberg was a known quantity,”said Kathy Wylde, president of the pro-business Partnership for New York City, when asked about the comparison of Bloomberg and Yang. “First among equals in the business community.” Yang needs Tusk — who, by the way, is just a lowly millionaire — to give him anysemblance of thatsamestatus. And he’ll need to engage in a lot more political horse-trading than Bloomberg ever did. “There is a danger to figures that appear unencumbered when in fact they are ripe for old-fashioned transactional politics,”said a City Hall veteran who worked under two administrations. “It’s clear the money and interests involved with this campaign will come with expectations and ties that will completelyshape the administration.”ended abruptly — Yang needed to get to an appearance nearby. As westood to leave, theserious Yang I had dined with morph ed back into the merry public Yang. Hesaid hello to the guys at a nearby table and took a picture. His professions ofsharki ness from the past hour rang in my ears; was Isupposed to believe this guy was asecret Machiavelli with a moralisticstreak? Was it hubristic — and naïve — wishful thinking on Yang’s part that he could get New York City voters to come around to his “letsomeone else handle the details and I’ll be the cheerleader” mayoral plan?It was my first time eating inside a restaurant in a long while, which I had mentioned in passing to Yang. Meals with him were a lot of people’s first time back inside, hesaid. And this gets to the emotional heart of Yang’s campaign: the promise that New York can return to normal. He has practiced what he preaches, campaigning in person from the get-go while other candidates remained on the digitalsidelines. He contracted COVID a couple of weeks into the campaign but didn’t dwell on it. For months now, it has felt as if he’s always banging around the city, grabbing lunch andsaying hi to people on thesubway and documenting it on Twitter. It is aspectacularly well timed alignment with the city’s mood. The vaccination campaign is well under way, and de Blasio and Cuomo havesaid that in a matter of weeks, New York will be once again open for business. The June 22 primary date feels likesomething of aspiritual advantage for Yang. He’s a young, energetic nonwhite guy in a diverse, energetic city, after all. As Yang headed back into the light of day, he raised his hands over his head for an imaginary cheering crowd, a pose that would have looked preposterous ifstruck by any other politician. “Welcome back to the world,” hesaid to me, the charm turned on, then he headed out the door.

268,AOC-backed liberal Maya Wiley surges into second place in some polls for NYC mayor's race,-2.33,40.67,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9704019/AOC-backed-liberal-Maya-Wiley-surges-second-place-polls-NYC-mayors-race.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-19,25,"One of the most liberal candidates inNew York City's upcoming mayoral race, Maya Wiley, issurging intosecond place according tosome polls, with progressive groups coalescing behind her. Wiley's 'defund the police' platform is worryingsome New Yorkers as the city faces asummer crime wave with random attacks on fearful residents both in thestreets and on the city'ssubway. In what could have been her chance to put those fears to rest, during a final debate between the candidates earlier this week, Wiley decide dn otto raise her hand when the candidates were asked if they would put more cops onsubway cars, despite a violent rise instabbings and attacks. Meanwhile, Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, has maintained his No. 1 ranking in the most recent polls for the Democratic mayoral primary. He doesn'tsupport de funding the police. New York Mayoral candidate Maya Wiley is gaining in the latest mayoral pollA new poll puts Adams out in front for next week's primary election but with Maya Wileysurging intosecond place from third. The mayoral election isset for NovemberEarlier in her campaign, Wiley was forced to deny thatshe intends to disarm NYPD cops after refusing to commit to a position during an earlier debate. Wiley - a former de Blasio administration official and member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board - presents herself as a reformer, and advocates cutting one billion dollars from the NYPD's budget and reform how the department operates. Wiley, who has been endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren, responded at the time: 'I am not prepared to make that decision in a debate.'I am going to have a civilian commissioner and a civilian commission that is going to hold the police accountable and ensure we'resafe from crime but also from police violence,'shesaid. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezspeaks at a rally last week whereshe endorsed progressive candidates, including Maya Wiley, in upcoming election for city wide offices in City Hall ParkWiley is alsosupported by the Working Families Party who announcedshe was their favored candidate having pulled itssupport for two other progressives on the ballot, Comptroller Scott Stringer and Dianne Morale. A recent poll byPIX-11suggested 23% of voters would choose Adams, followed by 18% for Wiley. Former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia came third with 17%. Yang was just behind in fourth with 14%. During the last poll on May 25 Wiley drew in just 9% of respondents. She hasspoken openly of her plans to overhaul the New York Police Department thatshe claims is filled with bureaucratic waste. Wiley hassaidshe wants to move $1 billion from its budget to community resources. She also plans to appoint a civilian as the NYPD commissioner and reduce the department's 35,000 officers by roughly 2,500.'Black and brown New Yorkers both experience higher crime rates, lower resolution insolving crime and more bad experiences with police officers,' Wileysaid to theWall Street Journalduring an interview. NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea hassaid the department is including hiring more people of color as officers and has urged againstspending cuts. Amid a deluge of criticism, Wiley has attempted to insist thatshe does not intend tostrip cops of theirservice weapons. Elsewhere, Wiley has promised to create more affordable housing and improve education inequity in publicschools. In her five-year, $10 billionspending plan called 'New Deal New York'she claimsshe would be able to help the city recover from the pandemic through development, infrastructure repairs and the creation of 100,000 jobs. Four of the other candidates, Eric Adams, Kathryn Garcia, Scott Stringer and Andrew Yang, have pledged to bolster the NYPD. Violent crimes across NYC arespiking at a worrying rate and all of the candidates are campaigning on the issue. The Manhattan South police district,seen in the above charts, covers the key tourist area in and around Times SquareThe Democratic candidates in New York's Mayoral race clashed on policing, race and what kind of foodsshould be allowed in the city in their final debate ahead of the primary next week, with one candidate telling her black opponent that he 'doesn'tspeak for minorities' in his criticism of de funding cops - even though he is black. Front-runner Eric Adams, a former NYPD cop who has been endorsed byGeorge Floyd's brother, wasslammed by his opponents for his promise to bring backstop-and-frisk and the controversial anti-crime unit that de Blasio disbanded last June in the heat of theBLMmovement. Maya Wiley, one of the most liberal candidates who is ranking third in the polls, didn't raise her hand when all of the candidates were asked if they'd put more cops onsubway cars amid asurge in violent public transitcrime. Neither did Dianne Morales, who wants to cut the NYPD's budget by $3billion, or Scott Stringer. The other candidates did raise their hands. When asked whatshe'd ban in the city, Wileysaid 'everysugary drink' because her kids 'love them'. Adamssaid he'd get rid of processed meat, whereas Yangsaid he'd crackdown on the 'those ATVs that are terrorizing ourstreets right now.'In one of the most memorable moments from the debate, long-shot contender Dianne Morales fumed at opponent Raymond McGuire - a black businessman - telling him he 'didn'tspeak for minorities' when hesaid 'black and brown communities do not want to de fund the police.'Morales wants to cut another $3billion from the NYPD's budget. McGuiresaid he disagreed andso did others in the black and brown communities. Hesaid de funding the police would 'end in disaster' for New Yorkers'. Irate,she fired back at him: 'How dare you assume tospeak for black and brown communities as a monolith.'In one of the only moments of unanimity, none of the candidatessaid they'd hire outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio in any capacity in their administrations. Adamssaid he wouldn't give de Blasio a formal role but that he wouldseek his advice before taking office. None of the otherssaid they'd hire him in any capacity, including Wiley, who used to work for him. Yang and Adams, two of the candidates who have received the most attention, traded blows over the Captains' Endowment Association police union endorsing Yang over Adams, who used to be a cop. Yangsaid itshowed Adams can't be trusted, that his own union doesn't even want tostand behind him.'The people youshould ask about this are his colleagues. They think I’m a better choice than Eric for keeping us and our familiessafe,' Yangsaid. Adamsshot back that he never wanted their endorsement in the first place because the association once referred to George Floyd's death as a 'game' in which they were being used as a pawn. Yang and other candidates alsoslammed Adams forsaying he'd be taking his gun to church after the Pittsburghsynagogueshooting which claimed 11 lives in 2018. At the time, he hadn't yet announced he was going to run. The day after theshooting, hesaid: 'From now on, I will bring my handgun every time I enter a church orsynagogue.'Theshooter was brought down by police. Adams wants to give the police more man-power by taking away their clerical duties to put them back on thestreet. He also wants to bring backstop-and-frisk - the controversial practice that many dubbed racist and a means of racial profiling - butsays he'll never let anyone be 'abused' by it. Kathryn Garcia doesn't want to de fund the police butshe does want to raise the recruitment age of the NYPD from 21 to 25. Shesaid on Wednesday night: 'To be quite honest with you, these are complicated times, andseveral of my opponents are using #DefundThePolice.'I just don't think that's the right approach.'She also wants to make the city entirely reliant on renewable energy. Yang, who wants to give out $1billion in COVID relief and establish a universal base income for New Yorkers, was accused of dreaming up generousschemes that he'd have to pay for with 'monopoly money'. The primary is on June 22 and will decide who is the Democratic candidate in November's election. New York City hasn't had a Republican mayorsince 2001, when Rudy Giuliani was replaced by Michael Bloomberg. There are only two Republican candidates to consider; Fernando Mateo, who wants to add 20,000 to the NYPD, and Curtis Sliwa, the head of the Guardian Angels. Adams, a former police captain who also co-founded a leadership group for black officers, has risen to the top of most polls as issues of crime and policing have dominated recent mayoral debates. The race remains tight, though, with 2020 presidential candidate Yang, former citysanitation commissioner Garcia, city Comptroller Stringer and civil rights attorney Wiley the top contenders in a field of 13 candidates on the Democratic ballot. Stringersaid he would cut at least $1billion over four years through measuressuch as transferring mental health response to non-police crisis teams and reducing police overtime. Garcia has not called for cutting the police budget, butsays officers' minimum ageshould be increased from 21 to 25 and new recruitsshould be required to live in the city. Yang backs a police residency requirement as well as beefed up oversight of the department, but rejects calls to de fund the police. Yang is campaigning alongside Kathryn Garcia on Saturday in Queens. It marks the first time in the race that two candidates have gone out together. Many of the most common types of crime in the city, including robberies, burglaries and grand larcenies, remain near historic lows, but through the first five months of 2021, the total number of major crimes measured by the police department has been at its lowest levelsince comparablestatistics became available in the 1990s. Butsince thespring of 2020 the number ofshootings hassoared. Through June 6, there were 181 homicides in New York City, up from 121 in thesame period in 2019, an increase of 50 percent. That's the worststart to a yearsince 2011. At least 687 people were wounded or killed by gunfire through June 6. That's not historically bad. More than 2,400 people wereshot during thesame period in 1993. But it is the highest number for a winter and earlyspringsince 2000. The mayoral primary is especially hard to predict because the city is debuting ranked choice voting, with voters ranking up to five candidates. Democrats dominate in New York City, and the winner of the party's primary is considered highly likely to win the general election in November andsucceed Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Republican primary features Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa and Fernando Mateo, a restaurant owner and advocate for taxi drivers.

269,“Lords of Chaos” Brings a White Nationalist’s Book to the Big Screen,-19.5,34.5,https://truthout.org/articles/lords-of-chaos-brings-a-white-nationalists-book-to-the-big-screen/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"In ancient, pre-Christian Nordic myths, the Oskorei is a collection ofsouls that jets through the nightsky above the living, often with the god Odin leading the horde. On certain occasions, the Oskorei mayswoop down to grapple with the living, faces adorned in white with black rims. Over the course of the 20th century, a pagan revival took over, recharging these myths with new eyes, reinterpreting them through the lens of modernity and ascribing them metaphysicalsignificance. While it happened throughout Europe and the U. S., it was particularlystrong among the völkisch movements in Germany that were trying to wrestle with identity around a newly formed nation and a reaction from the countryside to the homogenizing influence of urban life and advancing industrial technology. Heathenry, the pagan religions of Germany and Nordic regions, was imbued with a newsignificance not possible before the modern concept of race took hold. Through this, the Germanic gods wereseen as archetypes for the genetic kin of Northern Europe, and monstrosities like the rise of the Third Reich were a certain Odinicspirit taking over the psyche of its people. It is with this angle in mind that Michael Moynihan and co-author Didrik Søderlind revisited the Oskorei in their 1998 opus Lords of Chaos, which told of thescattered birth of Norwegian black metal and the murders and church arsons it left behind. The bookset the tone for how the U. S. imported black metal, the primary market for its albums, retelling itsstory as one of pure extremity — brutal and offensive, iconoclastic and dangerous. For two decades, Lords of Chaos has remained the go-to text for how the black metal movement began. The black metalscene often wins itsscores by outdoing itself in terms of outrageousness, blending all things taboo into pure hyperbole. It is within this framework, where real-life horrors only add to its branding, that Moynihan took the most painful parts of black metal’s history and made it aselling point. It was the book’s pedigree that led to it finally being adapted into a fairly major Hollywood release from Arrow Films with criticalsupport from Vice Films, capped withstars like Rory Culkin to prop up its focus on the violence of the Norwegianscene centered on the band Mayhem. Just like the book, the movie takessome of the most extreme characters, their murders andsuicides, and turns it into horror fodder, acceptablyscary because it isso extreme. The question thatshould be asked about the Lords of Chaos film adaptation is not whether thestoryshould be told; thestory is, without a doubt, dramatic and poignant. Instead, weshould ask whysomeone like Moynihan, whose history in white nationalism and fascist politics tracesseveral decades, is at the center of it. In an era where white nationalist violence is at a record high, why did majorstudios decide to purchase the option to a book filled with fascist occultism from a man who never hid his own fascism? “The Strong Rule the Weak, and the Clever Rule the Strong” Moynihan is best known for Lords of Chaos, largely because it was the first book with insider access to the black metalscene, but his own history is even more checkered. Always on the edge of extreme music and occult philosophy, he was known for a “will to power” type of fascist politics that is explicit in much of his writing. He is the front man for the neo-folk band Blood Axis, known for combining völkisch paganism and the fascist traditionalism of philosophers like Julius Evola. The neo-folkscene has been mired in controversy for the last 15 yearssince there is a central theme of reimagining Europe’s past in romantic terms, often focusing on occultism and the celebration of empire. This is a trend in far-right art that is often termed “metapolitics,” an effort tosneak in fascist ideas in ways that are notstrictly political. Instead, the artists will try to echo fascist themes through art and culture, changing the way thesubculture thinks and therebyshifting the values of that culture to fit their vision. Moynihan was at the center of this project, both as a musician and journalist, propping up many of the bands that became influential at repackaging far-right themes in their music. Lords of Chaos, both the book and the film adaptation, focuses heavily on Varg Vikernes, who fronts the industrial music project Burzum andserved 15 years in prison for burning churches and the murder of Øystein Aarseth of Mayhem. While Vikernes would be a likely villain for a book like this, he is instead portrayed as a charming oddity, an eccentric whose own ideas lead huge portions of the book’s philosophical musings. Vikernes himself is a white nationalist whosees a need to return to the ancestral religions of Norway, to remove the Judeo-Christian influences and reinvigorate a warrior culture. Together, Vikernes and Moynihan discuss the black metalscene as the Nordic people channeling their Oskorei nature, a part of the Nordicspiritual psyche waiting to be reawakened. Reacting to thespoils of Christian capitalist consumerism, the children of this generation embodied total nihilism, wanting for death and violence expressed in frenzy. This is in line with what evolved to be known as “folkish” paganism, the idea that the gods of a particular culture’s past are psychically bound to them, racially prescribed. It is through this lens that Vikernes attempted to justify his church burnings as acts against the “invaders,” both worshiping a foreign Jewish god and representing a degenerate “slave morality,” which celebrates the virtue of the commoner rather than the oppressorstamping out rebellion from a position of utterstrength. He railed about the weaknesses of Christianity, and about cleansing the land to re-establish a Viking morality that wouldsanctify will, power, cruelty and hierarchy. This line resonatesstrongly with Moynihan, who referred to himself as a fascist in the 1990s. He worked closely with the enigmatic far-right artist Boyd Rice, asimilar experimental industrial musician, on the Abraxas Project that was designed to propel “social Darwinist” ideas. The tag line of the organization was: “Thestrong rule the weak, and the clever rule thestrong,” echoing their own Nietzschean brand of domination theology. Blood on His Hands Moynihan loved to raise up the voices of the absolute fringes, which led him to James Mason. Mason joined the American Nazi Party’s youth division in 1966, and when he turned 18 in 1970, he became an adult member. By then, it had been renamed the National Socialist White People’s Party. He eventuallysaw the group’s activism asstale and wanted to co-opt leftiststrategies of guerrilla warfare he wasseeing in liberation movements in the Global South. Thus, Mason argued for usingshocking violence as a tactic to disrupt the order ofsociety and create fractures that could be used to build the kind of nationalsocialism Hitler imagined. He joined the National Socialist Liberation Front in 1976, whose publication was Siege, which he revived and became the editor of in 1980. Since his publication rarely hit more than 75 monthlysubscribers, it would have disappeared from the white nationalist audience entirely, yet Moynihansawsomething there. He collected the newsletters and edited them into a book, which grew a cult following among neo-Nazis because of its extreme calls for urban terrorism and itssupport for Charles Manson and the use of cultish murderers as praxis. Siege later became the inspiration for the U. S.-based Atomwaffen Division, aseries of neo-Nazi terror cells that have murdered at least five people in the last two years as the group found a new home at the corners of the “alt–right.” “Moynihan introduced pro-genocide, pro-serial killer neo-Nazism to tens of thousands of people,”said Spencer Sunshine, an associate fellow at Political Research Associates, who researches fascistsubcultures. “He has blood on his hands.” What Moynihan did later in his career is a familiar pattern for white nationalists looking to embed their ideas more thoroughly with intellectual credibility. Hestarted the heathen journal Runa to mix in folkish perspectives on folklore and literature with more mainstream ones, often republishing dead authors like Michael Cunningham or essays on J. R. R. Tolkien to give the ideas broader appeal. Moynihan founded the journal Tyr, which helped to popularize “radical traditionalism” as a philosophical idea. Building on fascist metaphysical authors like Julius Evola, radical traditionalism argues that there are underlying hierarchies andspiritual pathways to all ofsociety, and that we must return to pre-modern ways of living, which followerssee asstratified along lines of class, race, gender andso on. Tyr worked hard to mix white nationalists like Collin Cleary, known for his books on white nationalist interpretations of Norse paganism, with legitimatescholars on ancient art, religion, politics and culture — mixing a cocktail of academic prose to make the racialist and totalitarian themesseem more palatable. Moynihan has gone on to edit a reprint of a book by Evola, as well as edit books by a range of folkish authors, oftentimes getting them published in more mainstream occult presses without objection. Performance Art While Moynihan’s ideas have always been pretty clearlystated, his work is often dismissed as an act. Instead ofseeing him as entirelysincere, Moynihan is often discussed as an intentionally provocative antagonist rather than an evangelist. His relationship with Mason is reduced to his obsession with those on the edges, rather than a commitment to ideology. This is, to a degree, the mentality applied to black metal, where we may not agree withsome ideas, but it is their extreme nature that makes them attractive, if only in a kitsch way. This requires certain rhetorical gymnastics,since Moynihan has been one of the centers of the pseudo-intellectualism inside the U. S. far right, which desperately hopes to create an ideological center that looks like more thansimple bigotry. “Moynihan is definitely proto-‘alt-right’ in that he was one of the first people to champion a more ‘intellectual’ version of white nationalism,” Sunshine told Truthout. Jonas Åkerlund, the director of the film adaptation of Lords of Chaos, knows better than anyone who Moynihan issince Åkerlund himself comes from the world of Norwegian black metal. Though he is best known for his filmschool takes on Madonnasongs, he was also a member of the Swedish black metal band Bathory in the 1980s, which is likely why he was channeled into this project. Vice has covered the far-right areas of National Socialist black metal thoroughly as well, andso there is little question as to why this book was chosen as thesource for a major film that Vice Filmssupportedso heavily. Vikernes, for his part, has attacked the movie virulently, accusing Jews ofspreading lies about him. The book itself has little narrative thrust to it, largely made up of philosophical diatribes and band interviews, andso thescreenplay likely had to be drawn from a range ofsources. This means that while the production company likely cut Moynihan asizeable check for the rights to the book, they didn’t have to. Instead, they chose to only because of the name recognition for the title, and possibly, because of the edgy reputation it brought along. Instead ofseeing the violent white nationalism openly professed in the book as a liability, they may have cynically hoped it would help them cash a check. There is undeniablysomething important in the way that the black metalscene formed, what itsays about alienation, and the negotiation between consumer capitalism and identity, but there is no reason that history has to be defined byself-described fascists like Moynihan. Thestory of black metal has multiple centers, bands repudiating the right, defining themselves on the left, and the families and communities torn apart from white nationalists posing as nihilistic artists. Instead of telling thesame old mythology about extreme music, the producers could have given thestory three dimensions. And they could havesaved the money theysent to a white nationalist.",1,1,Truthout

I wouldsay we were never winning the war,""saidDipali Mukhopadhyay, a University of Minnesota associate professor of global policy andsenior expert at the U. S. Institute of Peace. Indeed, ""thescene is dire,""saidBill Roggio, asenior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Roggio, who edits the FDD's ""Long War Journal,"" added that ""the Afghan government is in danger of collapsing if the Taliban continues on this pace and the Afghan government does nothing tostop it.""TheTalibanis not only continuing, but quickening the pace. The extremist movement, which cruelly ruled Afghanistan for five years before the post-9/11 invasion by U. S. and NATO nations, now holds half of the country's regional capitals and controls more than two-thirds of of the country. The Taliban's wins come amid America's withdrawal, tied to thesymbolic deadline of Sept. 11, 2021 — 20 years after the attacks that triggered America's longest war.""The Taliban's offensive is directly tied to President [Joe] Biden's announcement of the withdrawal,""said Roggio.""The way in which we are ending this war,"" Mukhopadhyaysaid, ""is producing a level ofsuffering and reversion back to the way things were before 9/11 at an accelerated pace, on terms that were not inevitable, and that were, I think, very much avoidable.""Mukhopadhyay added thatshe never believed the U. S. would win militarily and agreed with Biden's assessment that ""ultimately a negotiated politicalsettlement was necessary. But I think the way in which the withdrawal has been precipitous, unconditional, without planning for the contingencies thatshould have been anticipated — all of that very much undermines any possibility for a negotiatedsettlement anytimesoon andsets up Afghanistan for two things: a protracted, even more complex civil war, and a greater likelihood that extremist networks will findsafe haven again in the country.""The effects will reverberate regionally — and likely beyond.""If what happened in Afghanistanstayed in Afghanistan, the U.

And ""don't besurprised if wesee in Afghanistan what wesaw in Iraq circa 2013, 2014,"" he added, referring to the rise of ISIS. ""It's a massive propaganda win"" for jihadists. And the message will be received by adversary and ally alike, and not just by other governments, but by Afghans themselves.""America's adversaries and enemies are watching,"" Roggiosaid. ""[They] watched America abandon an ally it'ssupported for 20 years. And make no mistake, it's an abandonment.""""For the people I'm close to in Afghanistan,"" Mukhopadhyaysaid, ""there's a deepsense of connection to the American people and asense of gratitude for the Americans having brought an end to the Taliban regime. And the administration's decision provoked a feeling ofshock and betrayal amongst a lot of Afghans who had really invested everything in a conception of a relationship between our two democracies.""Tragically, there weren't enough Afghans who believedstrongly enough in that democracy to effectively fight for it. Twenty years of U. S. and NATO blood and treasurespent in Afghanistanstill didn't yield an Afghan force that could repel the Taliban advance. But ultimately what most mattered wasn't arms, but minds.""We think that things like numbers and equipment and training and organization matter, when the only thing in this war that mattered was the will to fight,"" Roggiosaid. ""The Taliban may not have had the training, they may not have had the numbers, they may not have had all of the communications and aircraft, but they were ideologically committed to this fight. They are religiously motivated, and they're committed to their cause."" The U. S. ""never understood our enemy,"" he added. ""And that's a major reason why we lost.""The U. S.seemingly also didn't completely comprehend our ally, either, especially the way corruption corroded the will of many everyday Afghans. There was also a loss of political will in the U.

272,Infrastructure Bill Would Direct Billions Toward Climate Change Mitigation,-2.5,46.5,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-09-28-infrastructure-bill-climate-change-biden-congress,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-01,25,"The trillion-dollar infrastructure bill before Congress containsseveral provisions that would direct billions of dollars toward rebuilding andshoring up the nation's infrastructure against climate change and mitigating the impacts of global warming. The bill would authorize nearly $550 billion in new funding for public works projects over the next five years, according to the White House, in addition to existing funding. Among the provisions are overhauling the power grid, boosting climate research and weather forecasting, money for low-emissions buses and other transit vehicles, and making roads and bridges more resilient. The bill also highlights assistance to communities of color and tribal communities, both of which the federal governmentsays are more likely tosuffer the effects of weather disasters and climate change. The bill wasscheduled for a vote Thursday, but as of Friday afternoon no action had been taken. Why California Wildfires Are Particularly Destructive in Fall)Included in the funding would be $60 billion to upgrade power infrastructure with thousands of miles of new transmission lines, according to a White House factsheet. The goal would be to make the grid more resilient and facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. The bill would also create what the White House calls a ""Grid Deployment Authority"" to guide the overhaul. Hurricanes, heat waves and winterstorms have allstressed the power grid in recent years, resulting in millions of power outages and, according to the Department of Energy, costing the U. S. economy up to $70 billion a year. Meanwhile, flooding, wildfires, landslides and other disasters are taking a toll on the nation's highways, bridges and other infrastructure. The bill includes $110 billion of new funds for repairing and rebuilding roads and bridges and other major projects, with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity andsafety. The funding would include $40 billion alone for bridge repair, replacement and rehabilitation. The White House projects the initiativesset forth in the bill would add an average of about 2 million jobs per year over the next decade, according to the Associated Press. It's considered a cornerstone of President Joe Biden's administration. The bill would be funded with $210 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief aid and $53 billion in unemployment insurance aid that remains unused bystates that halted the program. The rest of the funds would come fromseveral othersmaller pots of money. Critics have expressed concerns over the bill'ssize,scope and financing. The Congressional Budget Officesaid it would add $256 billion to deficits in the next 10 years, the AP reported. The Senate approved the bill in August in what was considered a rare bipartisan move, after months of political wrangling. The House vote was on hold after more objections and delays to try and ensure enough votes to pass. Here's a look atsome of the other major climate-related provisions, according to the bill text and White Housefactsheet:-$105 billion for modernizing and expanding transit and rail infrastructure, including replacing thousands of buses with zero-emissions vehicles.-$17 billion for port infrastructure and $25 billion for airports. The money would be earmarked for repair and maintenance backlogs, reducing congestion and lowering emissions.-$11.6 billion to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers for construction projects related to flood control, dredging and other infrastructure. Funding would also be provided for flood control and coastal emergencies.-$7.5 billion to build a national network of chargingstations for electric vehicles.-$3.5 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for flood mitigation actions and assistance.-$3.5 billion to the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program, which aims to reduce energy costs for low-income households by improving energy efficiency at home.-$2.6 billion to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation's leadscientific and regulatory agency on climate and weather. The funds would include $492 million for coastal and inland flood and inundation mapping and forecasting along with ""next-generation water modeling activities;"" $50 million for wildfire prediction, detection and observation; and $80 million forsuper computing infrastructure used for weather and climate model development to improve forecasting and detection of droughts, floods and wildfires.-$216 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, more than half of which would be designated for ""community relocation."" There are 567 federally recognized tribes in the U. S. representing more than 5 million people, and many live on lands taking the brunt of climate changeimpacts, according to data from the federal government's U. S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. In Alaska, for example, rising temperatures are meltingsea ice and glaciers and thawing permafrost. In the western part of the contiguous U. S., tribal populations face drought and water challenges.

273,What should the media do with Donald Trump’s refusal to concede?,-5.0,43.67,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-should-the-media-do-with-donald-trumps-refusal-to-concede/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-11,24,"Scared. Unsettled. Stressed. Angry. Nerve-racked. Nauseous. These aresome of the words used to describe how most of us felt in the days leading up to the 2020 election. But the election has passed. Election Day was more than a week ago. A decisive winner was projected over the weekend. So what are the words we can now use to describe how many of us feel today?Scared. Unsettled. Stressed. Angry. Nerve-racked. Nauseous. Despite projections that Joe Biden won the presidential election and despite no proof of fraud or any other improprieties, President Donald Trump has yet to concede. Making matters tenser, Trump is gettingsupport from many of his Republican allies, like Sens. Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And making it even worse, if that’s possible, is that Trump is riling up his followers thanks to help from many in conservative media. That includesseveral on-air personalities at Fox News and Fox Business, as well as the usualsuspectssuch as radio host Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart. On one hand, you want to tell responsible media to just ignore all this noise, to block out theshenanigans, to not give these baseless claims any oxygen, to trust that democracy is going to work and toshow faith in our election process by not even acknowledging those whose intent is tostir up trouble. There is no evidencesupporting any of Trump’s claims. To act as if there might be — or to even report that Trump and others aresaying this — needlessly creates doubt and frightens citizens. To report onsuch things might, inadvertently, give credence to these allegations, which is exactly what Trump and his team want. The goalseems to be more about creating doubt in the election than actually winning it. On the other hand, how can one ignore when high-ranking elected officialssuch as McConnell and Graham, and leading government officialssuch as Pompeo, are leading these conspiracy theories? How can one just letsome of those on a popular networksuch as Fox Newssay whatever they want and get away with it even though thesuggestion of fraud undermines the country and our democracy? Part of the media’s role in astrong democracy is to be a watchdog,soshouldn’t it be paying close attention to any attempts to weaken that democracy?It’s a fine line, and I don’t claim to know exactly what the answers are. There’s no indication that Trump will concede at any point or that enough Republicans are going tostomp down Trump’s claims to make it all go awaysooner rather than later. There’s also little hope that placessuch as Fox News and Fox Business will crack down on their prime time personalities to keep them from pumping life into all this garbage. The one person who could do this — Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch —so far and as far as we know has chosen to not get involved, perhaps because he is more interested in ratings than doing the right thing. Any advice to the mediaseems wishy-washy and vague,such as: Pay attention, but not too much attention. Don’t ignore it, but also don’t overdo it. Report on what’ssaid, but overwhelm audiences with facts. Cover it enough to let people know what’s happening, but not enough to make itseem like the election might be rigged. Like Isaid, I don’t have the answers. I’m notsure anyone does. But I do know this: The more this junk is reported, the more doubt and angst it creates. Media outlets and consumers need to ask: Who is creating this narrative? Who benefits from all this doubt and angst? Who is hurt by it?The answers are obvious. The ways for the media to fix it are less obvious. Our best hope is to remember that this democracy and the process to elect our leaders have worked for more than 200 years. Maybe it’s naive, but we have to have faith that it will work here, too. On CNN Tuesday,Jake Tapper noted that many Republican officials are publicly backing the president and not acknowledging that Biden won the election. Tappersaid, “This is not just cowardly, but dangerous.”However, Tapper added, “I’vespentsome time today talking to Republican officials on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and what theysay is no one out thereshould worry that our democracy is in actual jeopardy. Theysay this is all part of walking President Trump through this process emotionally, and that they assume that while he may never concede, he will leave. There will be, theysay, a peaceful transition in power to the Biden-Harris administration on Jan. 20. Theysay that. But theysay that on background because they don’t want to upset President Trump and they don’t want to get death threats from hissupporters. Now you may or you may not find that reassuring.”Chris Wallace of Fox News. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)Tuesday night was aspecial one for Poynter and journalism. Chris Wallace — whose five-decade career includesstops at ABC, NBC and Fox News, where he has been for the past 17 years — was honored with the 2020 Poynter Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism. Typically, the medal is awarded at a Bowtie Ball in St. Petersburg, Florida, but this year’s event was held virtually because of COVID-19. In an interview with Poynter president Neil Brown, Wallace talked about the election, working at Fox News and even what it’s like to vacation with George Clooney. As far as the election, Wallacesaid,so far, there’s no indication of any voter fraud. Hesaid, barringsomething unforeseen, that he fully expects Joe Biden to besworn as the next president in January. He called the currentsituation with Donald Trump refusing to concede “not normal.”When talking about Fox News, Wallace noted the difference between the newsside of Fox News and the opinionside.“There’s a firewall there,” Wallacesaid. “And I would argue moreso than the other cable newsstations.”As far as the one person he never interviewed, but wants to? Queen Elizabeth, becauseshe hasseen most of the news of the past century. And, finally, that vacation with George Clooney. They hung out at Lake Como, drinking Italian wine and talking politics. Wallace called Clooney “thesmartest person” he had ever met when it came to talking politics. Previously honored with the Poynter Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism were Katie Couric, Lester Holt, Judy Woodruff, Tom Brokaw and Bob Schieffer. Looking for an expertsource?

(Courtesy: CBS News)Media junkies will really enjoy a pod cast put out by CBS News that takes listeners behind thescenes with the network’s election coverage. This 30-minute episode of “The Debrief”starts with Election Day morning and runs all the way through to the moment when CBS News projected Biden as the winner. The pod is hosted by CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett and this episode includes reports from all over the country, from Arizona to Atlanta, as well as the White House to where Biden was in Wilmington, Delaware. Garrettsaid in the episode, “All of us gathered on the New Yorkset. It wassilent, electric, full of unspoken anticipation, anxiety, thesense that history was moving beneath you, about to propel you and the nation in a new direction. I felt exactly thesame way on election night in 2016. It has nothing to do with partisanship. It has everything to do with the votes and voices of Americans and the clarity when it comes to their judgment, their decision.”A Mexican journalist wasshot just as he was about to go on the air Monday, and later died at the hospital. CNN’s Jack Guy, Tatiana Arias, Natalie Gallón and Kiarinna Parisi reported, “Israel Vázquez, who worked for digital news outlet El Salmantino, was covering a ‘discovery of human remains’ in the city of Salamanca, in the centralstate of Guanajuato, at the time of the attack.” Vázquez was 31. In astatement, El Salmantinosaid, “Today our colleague, Israel Vázquez, while working as a reporter, was the target of a vile and cowardly attack that took his life. All of us who work at El Salmantino condemn not just this one attack, but all of those that occur daily in the city of Salamanca.”Sadly, attacks on journalists in Mexico are not uncommon. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Mexico as the deadliest country in the world to be a journalist. Vázquez was the third journalist killed in Mexico in less than a month and is believed to be the ninth journalist killed in Mexico this year. Last year, 11 journalists were killed in Mexico, the most of any country. After asummer of reckoning over race, The Los Angeles Times and Tribune Publishing have agreed to pay $3 million to resolve a lawsuit brought on by a group of multiethnic journalists who argued they were paid less than white malestaffers. The Los Angeles Times’ Meg James reported that payment could impact nearly 240 current and former reporters and editors who would be eligible for back pay. James wrote, “Under thesettlement, all Black and Latino reporters, copy editors and line editors employed by The Times from Feb. 14, 2015 to Oct. 26, 2020, could receive a portion of the award. All women who worked as reporters and editors during that period could be covered.”Ken Dilanian, NBC News’ nationalsecurity and intelligence reporter, had a hot mi c moment on MSNBC on Tuesday. Not realizing he was live on the air, he glanced at his phone and let out a couple of R-rated words. (You cansee the cliphere, but again just to give you a heads up, there’s R-rated language.)He later tweeted, “Sosorry for the profanity I used on air last hour. I was experiencingsome technical difficulties and mistakenly hung up on the control room, though my mi cstill was on. Perils of playing producer, cameraman and techsupport all at thesame time from home. #2020” He also included an upside-downsmiley face emoji. Normally, this would be the kind of thing that could get a bunch of people up in arms, but with the way this year is going, a couple of muttered curse words is pretty low on the list of things to get fired up about.

Southwestsaid it is investigating the issue and doesn't have reason to believe it's connected to Monday's problem with a weather datasupplier that delayed hundreds of flights. The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday had issued a brief, nationwide groundstop for Southwest, which prevents its flights from taking off to avoid overwhelming destinations.

These aren’t things that Trump can actually do; they’re laughably ludicrous. But Trump was always going to test your gullibility, tosee if he could get you to fall for these kinds of empty threats. Sure enough, this morning Trump tweeted “Delay the Election until people can properly,securely andsafely vote???” If you’rescared by this tweet, you just failed the gullibility test. The President of the United States can’t move the election; the Constitution gives that powersolely to Congress, and we all know Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t going to postpone or cancel the election. Trump can no more postpone the election than I can flap my arms and turn into a bird. Nothing works that way. No matter how much Trump might wish he could postpone the election, no matter how loudly he might hint that he’s going to postpone the election, and no matter how many or few pundits decide to try to milksuch a narrative for ratings, it’sstill not a real thing. So why is he even talking about it?Donald Trump is the world’s worst dealmaker, but he’sstill a dealmaker. If he can con enough of you into believing that he can magically postpone the election, then you’ll give himsomething in return (a legislative victory, for instance) for him agreeing not to postpone the election. Similarly, if Trump can fool enough of you into believing that he can just magicallystay in office after he loses, then you’ll give himsomething in return (immunity from federal prosecution for his crimes, for instance) in exchange for leaving office peacefully. Trump is trying to play you for asucker. He’s hoping that after nearly four years of this nightmare, you’reso worn down that you won’t think things through clearly. He’s doneso many other horrible things, the thinking goes, that perhaps he’ll do this too. Except he literallycan’tpostpone the election. It’ll take place on November 3rd, with or without his participation or approval. And he literally can’t refuse to leave office after January 20th; Joe Biden would besworn in anyway, and Trump would be dragged out for trespassing. Some media pundits are already lining up to try toscare you intostaying tuned in to their TVshows and Twitter feeds by pushing the notion perhaps Donald Trump really can magically postpone the election. They’ll insist that if you brush off this imaginary threat, it means you’re not being vigilant enough. They’re full of crap. Vigilance is when youstill continue to work hard on things like voter registration and turnout, even when your candidate is ten points ahead. What these pundits are pushing is gullibility – and Trump is more than happy to take advantage of it by making these kinds of false threats and trying to con his way into gettingsomething in return. Should you be outraged that Trump is threatening to postpone the election? Of course. Should you treat it like it’ssomething he can actually do? Of course not. Don’t fall for his con.

U. S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Charlotte area Democrat, raised the issue when questioning Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about inflation during a committee meeting on July 14. Adams wanted to know why Powell believes the recent inflation trends are temporary. And while winding up for her question,shesaid a rise in lumber prices ""can be tied to the previous administration’s actions.""""My local housing partnership had to pause construction of an affordable housingsite because of a funding gap caused by thespike in lumber prices. And while lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions, I know that many arestill concerned about the rise in core prices.""""So I’m hoping you can help us putsome of these concerns to bed. So would you tell us why you believe the recent inflation trends are temporary as the economy reopens and what other factors are playing into the upward pressure on prices?""Later that day, a Twitter user challenged Adams’ explanation. She responded by elaborating on her comments in a tweet.""The Trump Administration's high tariffs on Canadian lumber drove prices higher. Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic compounded the problem and drove prices even higher,""she tweeted on July 14. Isshe right about that?Trump did place a tariff on Canadian lumber and it’s fair for Adams to point out that it caused lumber prices to rise, experts told us. However, expertssay lumber prices are more complicated than herstatementsuggests. There are a number of reasons why the recent rise in lumber prices isn’t entirely — or even primarily a result of — Trump’s tariffs. By the time Trump imposed tariffs on lumber in 2017, prices were already on the rise because of uncertaintysurrounding an expired trade agreement. The U. S. and Canada had a 10-year trade pact that expired at the end of 2016. David Logan, director of tax and trade analysis for the National Association of Home Builders,wrote in March 2017that ""failure to reach a new (trade) agreement is the primary catalyst of market-wide price increases.""A month later, theTrump administration announced tariffs of 20% on Canadian lumber and up to 24% onspecific lumber companies. Lumber prices have a history of being volatile, experts told PolitiFact. They can range from $300 to $600 per thousand board feet when instable economic times. The price hovered just below $400 per thousand board feet i nearly 2017, and then rose to $600 bysummer 2018. It’s fair tosay Trump’s tariffs contributed to that rise, experts told PolitiFact. Other factors played a role too. Lumber market expert Paul F. Jannke, a principal at Forest Economic Advisors, told theNew York Timesthat a reduction in thesupply of Canadian lumber also contributed to the rise in prices. Fast forward to 2020. When the pandemic takes hold,somesaw millsshut down or cut production as they anticipate decreased demand. But their predictions were wrong. More Americansstarted to work from home and decided to undertake home renovation projects. Demand for lumber rises and prices reach $950 per thousand board feet in September,according to the NAHB. In the meantime, theWorld Trade Organization ruled in August that the Trump administration’s justification for the 2017 lumber tariff was off-base. And late last year, the U. S. Commerce Departmentslashed thesoftwood lumber tariff to 9%. Last year’s rise in prices was just thestart. Lumber prices hit an all-time high of $1,670 per thousand board feet this May as demand rose for a limitedsupply,CNBC reported. The lumber industry’sstruggle to keep up with demand has been well-documented in American media, fromVoxandCNNtoFortuneandBloomberg. Experts told PolitiFact there are many factors that determine the price of lumber. Trump’s tariff is one of those factors but isn’t the leading cause of thespike. The price increases ""can be traced back to mill closures and a massive reduction of output upon reopening based on the incorrect assumption that the housing market would indefinitely tank,"" Logan, the NAHB expert,told PolitiFact in April. Sam Spencer, aspokesperson for Adams,said the Congresswoman’s tweet accuratelysummarized the effect of tariffs.""The price of lumber can be tied to the tariffs: if there is asupply crunch, the fact that we’re artificially elevating the price of thatspecific commodity’s importation by default contributes to the rise in prices,"" Spencersaid in an email. While the tariffs certainly helped cause lumber prices to jump in 2018, ""thatsecond round increase isn’t related to the Trump tariff,""saidVincent Smith, an expert in agricultural policy at the American Enterprise Institute. ""That was a demandside drivensurge.""Adams is ""not wrong about the impact of the Trump tariffs in 2017,"" Smithsaid, adding: ""that doesn’t explain thesurge in pricessubsequently.""Thesoftwood lumber tariff ""doesn't help,""said Thomas A. Firey, asenior fellow at the Cato Institute and managing editor of itsRegulation Magazine.""However, the tariff isset and adjusted bystatute, and it's unfair for the congresswoman to blame Trump for initiating it (or Biden, whose administration is obligated to raise it),"" Firey told PolitiFact in an email. Fact-checkers atUSA Todayreached asimilar conclusion. Scott Lincicome, asenior fellow in economicstudies at the Cato Institute,says the fluctuating cost of lumber in the U. S. is a result of a tradesystem that’soverdue for reform. The regulations affecting how much lumber is made available, who’s allowed to produce it, and how it’s taxed -- are designed to benefit the American lumber industry,sometimes at the expense of the consumer. Thesystem’s drawbacks are exacerbated duringseasons of high demand.""It's factually true that the Trump administration’s Commerce Department applied the tariffs, but beyond that casting the blame is pretty nonsensical,"" Lincicomesaid. Experts pointed out too that Biden was in office as lumber prices peaked, and hasn’t acted to reduce the tariffs. The Commerce Department is now proposing to double the lumber tariff to 18%. CNNandFortune Magazinereport that Biden, for his part, has yet to take astance on the proposal. Adams, referencing Trump’s time as president,said ""lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions."" She later tweeted an assertion that Trump’s tariffs were a cause. Trump increased the tariff on Canadian lumber in 2017 and prices rose in the following year. However, pricesskyrocketed even higher in the last year as a result of pandemic-era market changes. Economistssay that’s largely the result of unforeseen issues ofsupply and demand. While Trump’s tariffs contributed to the record-high lumber prices, economistssay it’s misleading to blame them entirely. Adams’statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",1,2,Politifact

282,Catholic bishops to consider communion guidance over abortion views,4.67,44.0,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/06/15/Catholic-bishops-to-consider-communion-guidance-over-abortion-views/7151623699708/,https://adfontesmedia.com/upi-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-15,25,"June 15 (UPI) --Catholic bishops arescheduled to vote this week on drafting astatement that would include guidance on whether elected officials whosupport abortion rights,such as PresidentJoe Biden,should receive communion. The vote is among the items on the agenda of the U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is meeting in a virtual general assembly on Zoom that begins Wednesday. The question before the bishops is whether work on thestatement can begin. AdvertisementIf that request is approved, the earliest the document could be presented to the bishops would be at their November general assembly. Bruce Morrill, a theologicalstudies professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville,said the proposal is clearly directed toward Biden, the nation'ssecond Catholic president. While campaigning for the presidency, Bidenproposed a healthcare plant hat would expand access to contraception and abortion and restore funding toPlanned Parenthood. In addition, the plansought to preventstates from passing laws to outlaw abortion. AdvertisementOn Jan. 20, the day Biden was inaugurated, USCBB's president, Archbishop José H. Gomez of Los Angeles, issued astatementsaying ""the continued injustice of abortion"" remains the preeminent priority of the bishops.""We have deep concerns about many threats to human life and dignity in oursociety,"" Gomezsaid in the document, titled Statement on the Inauguration of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as 46th President of the United States of America. ""But as Pope Francis teaches, we cannotstaysilent when nearly a million unborn lives are being cast aside in our country year after year through abortion.""The archbishop alsosaid in thestatement that ""our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, mostseriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage and gender.""Gomez added that Catholic bishops are not partisan players in the nation's politics, and when theyspeak on issues, they try to guide consciences. In a2004 letter to American bishops, the Vaticansaid that a politician consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws constitutes ""personal formal cooperation"" in gravesin. In thosesituations, ""the pastorshould meet him, instructing him about the church's teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for holy communion until he brings to an end the objectivesituation of thesin and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the holy eucharist,"" according to that letter. AdvertisementThe decision to refuse to givesomeone communion is not asanction or penalty, the lettersaid.""Nor is the minister of holy communion passing judgment on the person'ssubjective guilt, but rather (he) is reacting to the person's public unworthiness to receive holy communion due to an objectivesituation ofsin,"" the lettersaid. The letter -- written by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI -- was a response to a controversy over Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry'ssupport of abortion rights. Some U. S. bishops hadsaid Kerry, a practicing Roman Catholic,should be barred from receiving communion. Other Catholic politicians recently have been the targets of assertions that theyshould not receive communion,including House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2016. In 2019, when Biden attended Mass at a church in Florence, S. C., where he had been campaigning, the priest refused to give him communion because of hissupport for legalized abortion. Under current procedures, the bishop or archbishop of the diocese where a Catholic lives makes the determination about whether communionshould be withheld, Morrillsaid. Targeting public officeholders and candidates in astatement politicizes the eucharist, hesaid. Advertisement""The controversy in this is that the bishops conference has no authority tostart declaring unilaterally who can or cannot receive communion,""said Morrill, who is Vanderbilt's chair of Roman Catholicstudies. Hesaid controversies inevitably will keep happening because bishops ""have failed to persuade their own American Catholics that abortionshould not be an elective procedure legally available to women in the United States.""A compilation of findings insurveys conducted over the years by the Pew Research Center, including one in 2019 that addressed the U. S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision that established a right to abortion,show that 56% of American Catholicssay abortionshould be legal in all or most cases. Jayd Henricks, former USCCB executive director of government relations, disagrees that communion is being politicized.""Of course, there's a political dimension relative to the public witness of politicians, including President Biden, who professes to be a devout Catholic and yet opposes the church's very fundamental teachings,"" Henrickssaid. ""But the concern of the bishops here, itseems to me, is not about the politicalsituationso much as it is about the pastoralsituation. The church teaches that the eucharist is our food that helps ussave oursouls.""AdvertisementHenricks -- who has not been involved in conversations with bishops about the issue andstressed that he isspeaking only for himself -- alsosaid there is nothing new in what the USCCB will be considering.""It's going to be re-presenting in a pastoral way, teachings that existed for years now,"" hesaid.",2,2,UPI

285,Barrett Will Be Confirmed Because GOP Shut Down Democrat Dirty Tricks,17.0,34.0,https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/22/amy-coney-barrett-will-be-confirmed-because-kavanaugh-battle-taught-gop-to-stop-getting-played-by-democrat-dirty-tricks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/federalist-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,25,"Amy Coney Barrett has not yet been confirmed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court by the U. S. Senate, but there is no question that her confirmation battle has gone much better than the one endured by Brett Kavanaugh and hissupporters. The undervalued reason why is that Republicans and their voters are not wasting any time on dirty tricks from their opponents in the Senate and in the media. This confirmation wassupposed to be apocalyptic. That’s what I predicted. One of the closing paragraphs of “Justice On Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,” the book I wrote with Carrie Severino:As ugly as Kavanaugh’s confirmation battle became, he is unlikely toshift the Court dramatically. Except on abortion and homosexuality, Justice Kennedy usually voted with the conservatives. If Justice Ginsburg were to retire while Trump was in the White House, the resulting appointment would probably be like the Thomas-for-Marshall trade. Compared with what might follow, the Kavanaugh confirmation might look like the good old days of civility. Clearly, we were wrong. There are many reasons for that, and it’s worth looking at them. For one thing, the Democrats’ campaign messages regarding the global Coronavirus pandemic make it impossible to repeat their action tactics from the Kavanaugh hearings. While riots and mass protests are encouraged in thestreets, there was no way to import paid activists to the committee hearings or to roam Senate hallways in costume. When the Kavanaugh hearings began, they were fueled by outbursts from Senators and their invited guests who disrupted the hearings. Hundreds of activists were arrested and bailed out of jail by a coordinated campaign focused on a theme of disruption. The Coronavirus madesimilar tactics impossible. Contra the early media narrative, the timing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death didn’t help Democrats as much as they thought it would. If you remember, the main Democrat theme of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle was “delay, delay, delay.” They worked very hard to delay the opening of hearings by fighting to read the millions of papers that passed through Kavanaugh’s desk while he wasstaffsecretary for President George W. Bush. Battles over paperwork dominated July and August, with hundreds of articles written about the process fights. Chuck Schumer and his allies did a photo op in front of a few empty boxes that were described as “missing records.” Schumer imposed a Democrat boycott of meetings with Kavanaugh, only relenting after weeks of trying to delay the opening of the confirmation hearings. If Democrats tried to delay the Kavanaugh hearings until past the mid-term elections, and came very close tosucceeding, how much easiershould it have been to delay Barrett’s confirmation vote until after the presidential election?One of the reasons the delaystrategy failed for Democrats last time is because American votersstarted gettingsick to death of what they were doing to the man. Whereas in 2018 Democrats had a huge wave election that turned over the House of Representatives to Democrat control, they actually lost Senateseats. They had tostop their anti-Kavanaugh efforts lest they lose more. Democrats were nervous about attacking Barrett in the way they’d tried to destroy Kavanaugh. Their energy and focus were on their own elections, too. Also, Barrett is a nominee of incredible quality. Like Kavanaugh,she has a ton of very loyal friends who love tosing her praises. Considered the brightest of her peers,she was a popular law professor and has had a good three years as a federal judge. But let’s not pretend that the left didn’t try to destroy Barrett. They did! They put the verysame reporters who ran their anti-Kavanaugh hit pieces on the anti-Barrett beat. And they wrote many negativestories about her, her religion, and her family. Beforeshe was nominated, Newsweekerroneously accused her religious group of being the inspiration for “The Handmaid’s Tale.” A few days later, Politico ran an article arguing that her “religious beliefs aren’t off-limits” andsaying they are problematic. Reuters also ran its own hit piece on the group People of Praise, headlined “Handmaid’s Tale? U. S. Supreme Court candidate’s religious community underscrutiny.”The Washington Post had the reporter who ran the Christine Blasey Ford portion of their massive anti-Kavanaugh operation write up a hit piece on Barrett’s People of Praise group, headlined “Amy Coney Barrettserved as a ‘handmaid’ in Christian group People of Praise.”A few days later, a couple of reporters ran an utterly bizarre article about how a couple of kids at aschool the Barrett children attend had gotten COVID. There was no evidence that the children gave the other children COVID and the Barrettchildren had tested negative. Beth Reinhard, one of the reporters on thestory, defiantly tweeted that the White House hadshamed her for writing about the children, as if it didn’tmake her look bad. The Post has been areservoirofanti-Barretthitarticles. So has The New York Times. In addition to its hit on Barrett’s religious ties, the Times ran adeep and critical look at the adoptions of two Barrett children. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rarestep of condemning the article. “The nominee introducing her family in a fewsentences of prepared remarks does not give the New York Times license tostart treating minor children like objects of public curiosity,”he wrote. Adoption advocates were troubled by the attack on the family. Just yesterday, the Associated Pressran a hit on a private religiousschool Barrett had been affiliated with. Rod Dreher wrote in response that the “Left Is Coming For Christian Schools.” And the left’s favorite academic and racist, Ibram X. Kendi, called Barrett and her husband “white colonizers” for having a multi-racial family. So again, let’s not pretend that the left didn’t work through its most prominent media outlets and academics to try to destroy Barrett. They did. The biggest difference is that Republicanssimply weren’t playing with these attacks. Each and every one of thesestories — and dozens ofsimilar ones — was met withswift condemnation or yawns. Everysingle one. It took a few decades of the left playing the exactsame games with most confirmation battles, but finally, the right figured out how to render those attacks worthless. It’s not just conservative Americans, but thesenators themselves who are playing this differently. Rather than the Senate Judiciary Committee immediately responding to the Washington Post’s anti-Kavanaugh attack by bending to the will of the Democrats, this time they just didn’t care. As Democrats openlysaid on national television that they would do anything tostop Barrett’s confirmation, rather than actscared, the Republicans were not moved. They haven’t responded with outrage or drama, but just asteely resolve to get the nomination done. When Democratssaid they would boycott the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting at which Barrett is to be voted on, the Republicans responded bysaying it was fine. This way,she’ll be the unanimous vote of the committee. The legacy of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle is that Republicans finally figured out tostop playing along with the left’s games, in which nomineessee their lives, family, and reputation on the chopping block. It took them a while, but better late than never.",1,0,The Federalist

S. President Joe Bidenstarted circulating onsocial media. The alleged quote reads: ""And the question is whether or not weshould be in a position where are why can't the expertssay we know that this virus is in fact its going to be our excuse we know why the all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved and but permanently approved, that's underway too.""This is, generallyspeaking, an accurate quote from Biden's appearance during a CNN town hall on July 22, 2021. The text in the above-displayed does not contain much punctuation, however, which may make Biden's messageseem extra incoherent. Here's how this quote was presented inCNN's rush transcript of the event:And the question is whether or not weshould be in a position where you are -- why can't the expertssay we know that this virus is, in fact -- is going to be -- or, excuse me -- we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved. That's underway, too. I expect that to occur quickly. Biden made thisstatement in response to a question from CNN reporter Don Lemon about when children under the age of 12 will be able to get vaccinated. Bidensaid ""soon, I believe,"" and when Lemon pushed him to elaborate, Bidensaid thatscientists were evaluating the data to makesure that the vaccines weresafe for children. Here's the full exchange. The viral quote has been placed in bold text:MR. LEMON: Well, let me ask — let me follow up on her question, asking: When will children under 12 be able to get vaccinated?THE PRESIDENT: Soon, I believe. Now, look, one of the things that I committed to do when I got elected — Isaid —MR. LEMON: Howsoon is “soon,” Mr. President? Not to —THE PRESIDENT: Well, I — and let me he- — let me finish the question — the answer. “Soon” in thesense that I do not tell anyscientists what theyshould do. I do not interfere. (Applause.)Andso they are doing — they are doing the examinations now — the testing now, and making the decision now. When they are ready, when they’ve done all thescientific need to be done to determine children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, they, in fact, are — all have different makeups. They’re developing. They’re trying to figure out whether or not there’s a vaccination that would affect one child that’s atsuch andsuch an age and not another child. That’s underway. Just like the other question, there’s a logical — and I’ve heard youspeak about it because you always — I’m not beingsolicitous, but you — you’re alwaysstraight up about what you’re doing. MR. LEMON: Well, that means — you mean for the FDA?THE PRESIDENT: For the FDA. MR. LEMON: Yeah. So, what do you —THE PRESIDENT: The Federal Drug Administration. MR. LEMON: Yousaid that you’re talking toscientists, though, but what — what are they telling you, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: What they’re telling me is, “Let us decide, based onscientific data, in how we proceed. Do it the way we would ordinarily do it.”Look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know, this virus came — this — this — the drugs that are designed to kill the virus came alongso quickly. They’ve been working on it for two decades. There’s nothing quick about this. It’s been over two decades. So peoplesaid, “I’m not taking a drug that was approvedso quickly.” It’s been two decades. The truth is we haven’tsaid it enough to people to allay their feals [sic]. There’s nothing — their fears. This is nothing that just happened yesterday and theysaid, “Well, let’s take ashot on this.” And there’s a process. Usually the process takes the better part of a year or more to getsome of these things decided. But the expectation — they’re not promising me anyspecific date — but my expectation, talking to the group ofscientists we put together — over 20 of them, plus others in the field — is thatsometime maybe in the beginning of theschool year — at the end of August, beginning of September, October — they’ll get a final approvalsaying the FDAsaid, “No, this is it. It’s good.”But again, one last thing. I — we don’t talk enough to you about this, I don’t think. One last thing that’s really important is: We’re not in a position where we think that any virus — including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non — unvaccinated people — the vi- — the variousshots that people are getting now cover that. They’re — you’re okay. You’re not going to — you’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations. You can view this exchange on CNN.com.

No Republicans joined them. Much has been made of the Democrats’ list of 121 Republican members of the House who two months earlier refused to confirm President Joe Biden’s election. Now both parties, like Gilbert and Sullivan’s, “Have got a little list / And they’ll none of them be missed.”The Republican dissenters in January, who includedsome usuallysensible people like Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), frequently expressed doubt about their votes but explained that they were honoring the presumed wishes of their Trump-supporting constituents. This vision of their duty hardly coincides with that expressed in Edmund Burke’s address to the electors of Bristol, but it has an element of truthfulness about it. Trump’s loyalists have undiminished gratitude to him forsparing the nation President Hillary Clinton—though almost any Republican presidential candidate in 2016 would have doneso, and by a greater margin. Their fanaticism also rests on the fact that he clearlysought to keep his four main promises: on immigration, trade, the Supreme Court, and regime-change wars. They also wanted to put down a marker against the possibility of fraud in mail-in voting, if not in the 2020 election, at least in the next one. The Democraticsupporters of infantile voting have nosuch excuses. Their constituents, even in the most liberal or progressive districts, did not demand or expect it. Even in Nancy Pelosi’s San Francisco, a proposal for lowering the voting age was voted down in 2016, and the California electorate emphatically rejected a well-financed proposal for 17-year-old voting in 2020. Fear of retaliation by Pelosi, who is in command of committee assignments and large amounts of campaign money, may have promptedsome votes,such as those of the occasionally independent Abigail Spanberger, Ro Khanna, James Clyburn, and C. A. “Dutch” Ruppersberger. But the dominant reason for them and others was the hope of partisan advantage, even though the examples of Brazil, Argentina, and Nicaragua, where 16-year-old voting is allowed,suggests that no advantage can outweigh the loss of politicalstability it produces. One refreshingly independent vote was that of the former chairman of the NAACP, my Congressman Kweisi Mfume, who unlike many members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted against the proposal. The advent of 18-year-old voting almost certainly helped politicize higher education. Speaker Pelosi has avowed thatshe wants “to capture kids when they’re in highschool, when they’re interested in all of this, when they’re learning about government to be able to vote.”An organization known as “Vote 16 USA” is asubsidiary of another called “Generation Citizen,”supported by major foundations,including the Ford and Bezos Family Foundations, fostering a program of “civic education” or indoctrination reminiscent of that of, and associated with, the’s 1619 Project. This is not a prettyspectacle. There is muchsciencesuggesting that the brain is not fully developed until age 25. Moreover, American youth is moresheltered and less experienced than ever before. The day is gone of the young citizens celebrated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who preach, teach, farm, engage in manual labor, and try their hand as merchants—who “do not postpone life, but live already.” For every Napoleon or William Pitt, there are millions of trust fund babies, drones, and perpetualstudents. There aresome who remember that Chancellors Bruning of Germany and Schuschnigg of Austriasaw no cure for their countries’ political disturbances in the 1930ssave for an increase in the voting age to 25. Thevote on March 3should beseen as a political gift to Republicans, ensuring them restoration of a House majority and more than negating the effects of their own members’ mistake two months earlier.

I was happy to find out that maybe I was wrong and that I had overreacted, but now I can’t help but feel alarmed,”said Fogel-Weiss, asurvivor from the Czech town of Botragy, now in Ukraine. “Everyday reminds me and others like me of the history we thought we left behind. It’s not an easy time forsurvivors or immigrants who get how easily it can happen here.”She is far from alone. In post-election interviews, numerous Holocaustsurvivors report feeling both relieved at the results, and nervous about President Donald Trump’s continued unwillingness to concede defeat. Manfred “Manny” Lindenbaum, 88, is one of them. The past four years had been tough ones for the New Jersey resident.“I was actually going into a deep depression,” hesaid. “I was functioning, but I couldn’tsleep at night, my mind was going back and hearing rhetoric that wasn’t much different than what was going on in the beginning of the Nazi era.”Lindenbaum was five when he was “literally chased out” of his childhood home in Unna, Germany in October, 1938, along with 17,000 German Jews of “Eastern” origin in an event known as PolenAktion. Stripped of their citizenship, his family became homeless andstateless overnight. A year later, when the Nazi invasion was imminent, his parents made the bold decision to put their three children on a train bound for the port town of Gdansk, where the last Kindertransport boat to England was departing. Only Lindenbaum and his brother were allowed to board. Hissister, 14 at the time, was deemed too old. He would neversee her or his parents again. Manny Lindenbaum (R) touring the border with the Rev. Mayer and former HIAS VP of Communications, Roberta Elliott in March 2019Image by Mark Hatfield“When Isee images of refugees at the borders, well, I know what happens to kids when they’reseparated from their parents,”said Lindenbaum, who touredshelters in Mexico last year after the Trump administration ousted asylum-seekers as part of its Remain in Mexico policy.“It was particularly moving and difficult for him given his own border experience,”said Mark Hetfield, president and chief executive officer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) who accompanied him. HIAS, which had once help Lindenbaum immigrate to the United States, arranged the visit to the border. There, Lindenbaumsaw refugees forced to remain in limbo in a no-man’s landsimilar to the one he experienced in Zbąszyń. For Lindenbaum, voting for Joe Biden was more thansupporting a particular candidate. It was a moral imperative. “It’s beyond comprehension that we did that,” hesaid,speaking of what hesaw at the US-Mexico border. “Istill get nightmares.”On Saturday morning, Nov. 7, with Bidenstill undeclared, Lindenbaum went on a 10-mile bike ride instead ofspinning his wheels indoors, waiting for the votes to be counted.“By the time I returned, Biden was the declared winner,” hesaid. “It felt like a giant weight had been lifted off my back.”He wasn’t the onlysurvivor to finally exhale. a video of Holocaustsurvivor grandparents tearing up at the news went viral. Survivors in Zoomsupport groups, who had reported feeling tense and fearful under Trump, and increasingly isolated under the pandemic, expressed relief.“After months ofsuffering from insomnia and anxiety, many Holocaustsurvivors were elated that Trump, whom they associated with Hitler, did not win asecond term,”said New York clinical psychologist Dr. Eva Fogelman, an expert on Holocaust PTSD. Cordula Hahn getting her first hug from her daughters Johanna (R) and Serena (L)Image by David MüllerIn Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Cordula Hahn, who had been a hidden child in Holland during World War II, rejoiced at the news, banging a pot, gettingshowered with glitter outside the Barclay Center with her two daughters andson-in-law, enjoying their first hugsince March.“The outburst of emotions was huge,”shesaid. “I had a flashback from Liberation Day in May 1945 in the Netherlands, where my parents, older brother and I were in a parade.”Cordula with her parents and brother at the Victory Day parade in The Netherlands“It felt like the end of the war,”said Natalie Scharf, who felt thestress of the last four years dissipating asshe delighted in the news that her adopted city of Philadelphia playedsuch a pivotal role in flipping the country blue. “I felt a real obligation to vote for Biden. I don’t have to imagine how much worse it can get under Trump. I lived through it.”Born in the Polish town of Jaworzno, Scharf was 15 when the Gestapo raided her home one night, arrested her along withscores of other Jewish teenage girls in her town and loaded them on a train bound for Sudetenland, whereshe was imprisoned at Gabersdorf women’s forced labor camp, only to emerge as one of thesolesurvivors of her family.“When Isaw them marching with the torches in Charlottesville, I had terrible heart palpitations,”shesaid. “They looked just like the Nazis of my childhood, and hearing themscream, ‘Jews will not replace us,’ ‘blood andsoil,’ it was exactly as I remembered it. And this presidentsaid they were fine people? Good riddance. It feels like liberation. We made it!”For Aviva Slesin, an Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker and adjunct professor at NYU-Tisch, who wassmuggled out of the Jewish ghetto in Siaulia, Lithuania in 1943 whenshe was nine months old andspent the war in hiding, Biden’s victory took her back to the momentshe first laid eyes on her new country.

Here we were refugees from Europe, coming to theshore of a place of hope,”shesaid. “And then I thought, had this man [Trump] been president at the time, he would not have welcomed us. He would not have offered us the hope we needed to create a new life.”In the weeks leading up the election, Celia Ores, an Upper West Sider from the Polish town of Dubienka, bought a bottle of champagne and kept it chilled in her fridge. President Trump’s rise to power was ashock to hersystem. But it was his cruelty to children that triggered her earliest traumatic memories.“I was playing in the garden across thestreet from our house, whensuddenly the police began to chase us out because we were Jews. I guess I was a good runner, but behind me was a two-year-old girl who wasn’t,”shesaid. “Isaw this very elegant Nazi pick her up by her legs, throw her against the tree and kill her. I ran home and told my mother. Shesaid, ‘That’s it. It’s time to leave.’”The family fled at night, crossing the Bug River to the east,staying with an uncle in Bialystok until the Russians packed all the Jews on a train bound further east. She was just 13 years old whenshe arrived at a gulag, a Soviet work camp. Her younger brother died of diseaseshortly after arrival. Over the next four years, they moved from Siberia to Kazakhstan, whereshespent her days gathering tinder wood andstruggling to find food.“You’re hungry all the time. You’re not clean and the most horrible people are taking care of you,” Oressaid. “When Isaw how Trump took breastfeeding mothers away from their babies, that children died at the border, Isaw Americans behaving like Nazis. Who can put children in cages? I was a pediatrician for 50 years at Columbia University Medical Center. Whoever heard ofsuch a thing happening here?”Whenshe heard that Joe Biden was the declared president-elect on Saturday morning, Ores called her grandson to come over and help her pop the bubbly. “It felt like Victory Day!”shesaid. But her bubble began to burst with news of Trump challenging the election results.“A predator is most dangerous when wounded,”said Björn Krondorfer, director of the Martin Springer Institute at Northern Arizona University, and one of five German-born Holocaustscholars who co-wrote anOp Edtitled, “It’s Not Too Late for American Democracy-Yet,” that ran in the Forward ahead of the election, warning of the threat of totalitarianismshould Trump win asecond term. “And that’s thesituation we find ourselves in. It isscary (again) tosee his political maneuvering to get into a position in which he can call on the Insurrection Act.”Last week Yale history professor Timothy Snyder, author of “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons From the 20th Century,” declared Trump’s tactics of rejecting the election results no joke, writing in The Boston Globe, “a claim that an election was illegitimate is a claim to remaining in power. A coup is under way, and the number of participants is notshrinking but growing.”And that’s what’sso frightening to the people who lived through the rise of European fascism and the Holocaust.“More than 70 million Americans voted for Trump,”said Fogel-Weiss. “After four years of challenging the rule of law, peddling lies and propaganda, anti-Semitism,scapegoating immigrants, and denyingscience -all of it has beensuch a tremendous blow to democracy — they all follow their leader.”Fogel-Weisssaidshe is cautiously optimistic that democracy will prevail if there is a peaceful transition to a new president.

289,European Union awards grant to forge unmanned ground vehicle standard,1.33,47.33,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/12/16/european-union-awards-grant-to-forge-unmanned-ground-vehicle-standard/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-16,24,"COLOGNE, Germany — The European Commission has awarded Estonia and the country’s robotics company Milrem a grant to lead the way on astandard architecture for military unmanned ground vehicles, the company announced. The deal, worth close to $40 million andsigned Dec. 11, formally kicks off a pan-European development for a new generation of battlefield ground robots. Named Integrated Modular Unmanned Ground System, or iMUGS, the project uses Milrem’sTHeMISvehicle as a reference platform for creating a “standardized European-wide ecosystem for aerial and ground platforms,” according to the company. Also covered by the project is relevant technology in the fields of command and control, communications,sensors, payloads, and algorithms. The connection to the European Union’s coffers comes through the bloc’s European Defence Industrial Development Programme. Besides Estonia as the lead, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia and Spain also are part of the iMUGS group, adding a combined €2 million (U. S. $2.4 million) to the effort. The countries each bring their relevant national companies to the table, including Safran Electronics & Defense, Nexter Systems, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, Diehl Defence, and Bittium Wireless.“Estonia has the honor and a great responsibility taking the lead in this project as nothing on asimilarscale has been conducted before,”said Martin Jõesaar, chief of the project office in the Estonian Centre for Defence Investment. “Our goal is not only making iMUGS a one-time effort, but to build it into a base project for future developments. Our long-term goal is that each of the modularsystems built will pave a way for further innovation in its field.”While thesums involved in iMUGS are relativelysmall in the world of defense programs, the effort has the potential toshape the European market for military robotic vehicles. The initiative is a prime example of defense companies like Milrem,some of them years ago,sensing a chance to position their own offerings firmly in the thicket of European defense priorities. But the THeMIS robot is not the only game in town. Rheinmetall is equally trying to position its unmanned portfolio in the European market, even without EU backing. In the case of itsMission Mastervehicle, the intellectual property belongs to the company’s Canadian division, which makessupport through EU channels tricky. Still, the vehicle is being tried by the land forces ofseveral countries on the European continent. According to Milrem, European countries are expected to need thousands of ground robots during the next 10-15 years, creating a market valued in the billions of euros. “Withseven participating nations and key industrial players, the unmanned groundsystem developed during iMUGS is expected to become the preferred Europeansolution for integrating into armed units,” the company claims.

Newsom, battling to remain CA governor past the September 14 recall election, made the comments about Mr. Elder during a campaignstop at a Mexican restaurant this weekend. The Democrat tied Elder to former President Donald Trump,seemingly to frighten West Coast leftists intostrongersupport.“Though we defeated Trump, we didn’t defeat Trumpism. Trumpism isstill alive and well, even here in thestate of California,” Newsomsaid. “If you don’t believe me, just consider … the likely person to enter an oath of office, to enter in the governor’s office in just a matter of weeks if we don’t reject this recall.”“Don’t think for asecond that this recall is not about all of you,” the governor added. “It’s about each and every one of us and the values we hold dear.”Newsom was referring to Elder, who’s leading in the latest recall election polls.“The latest Emerson College and Nexstar Media’s ‘Inside California Politics’ pollshowssupport for the effort to oust Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom has grown in recent weeks as thestate has experienced an increase in COVID-19 transmission,”The Daily Wirereported earlier this month. The poll “foundsupport for the recall at 46%, up from 43% in the previous poll from July 20, two weeks ago. However, 48%said they opposed the recall, and 6% of likely voters are undecided, pollsters found, adding that the number of undecided voters had fallen 3%.”“Newsom’s approval rating fell from 49% last month to 48% in the current poll. In addition, 42%said they disapproved of Newsom’s job performance, while 10% were unsure or had no opinion,” The Daily Wire added. Some of Californians’ top issues were homelessness, Covid-19, and crime — which jumped 7% from July. A nervous Newsom reiterated thesame this weekend on CNN. “We turn out our base, we’re going to win, unquestionably. It’s not a persuasion campaign. People are locked in,” Newsomsaid. “But the profound consequences — particularly the leading candidate on the otherside, Larry Elder — people just need to take a close look.”The Democrat then accused Elder, a black man, of “promoting” “bigotry and hate” as he alleged former President Trump does.“Democrats need to wake up (to) what’s atstake, and we made it easy,” Newsom added. “It’s all mail-in ballot. Simple question: ‘Should he be recalled?’ ‘No.’ Send it back. Don’t even consider thesecond question with those 46 candidates.”Elder, a 69-year-old conservative host, commentator, and author, has promoted choice and freedom overstate mandates when it comes to Covid-19 precautions, astark contrast to Newsom. The candidate is leading other Republicans in the recall contest.",1,1,Daily Wire
291,How NOT to Resist Trump: Kayleigh McEnany’s Anti-Science Comments,-11.67,36.0,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/07/22/how-not-resist-trump-kayleigh-mcenanys-anti-science-comments,https://adfontesmedia.com/common-dreams-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"Media, particularly those who have made a habit of rhetorically opposing Donald Trump for the past four years, were awash last week with White House presssecretary Kayleigh McEnany's controversialstatements on reopening publicschools in the middle of a pandemic. For example:The myriad of viral headlinessuggested that this was another Orwellian outburst from the administration, along the lines of when George H. W. Bushsaid: ""I'll never apologize for the United States of America. Ever! I don't care what the facts are."" But reading her full answer, or watching the video embedded in many of the reports, it becomes clear that the headlines are misrepresenting McEnany's words. Whatshe actuallysaid was:The president hassaid unmistakably that he wantsschools to open. And I was just in the Oval [Office] talking to him about that. And when hesays open, he means open in full -- kids being able to attend each and every day at theirschool. Thescienceshould notstand in the way of this. And as Dr. Scott Atlassaid -- I thought this was a good quote -- Of course, we can [do it]. Everyone else in the... Western world, our peer nations are doing it. We are the outlier here. Thescience is very clear on this, that -- you know, for instance, you look at theJAMA Pediatricsstudy of 46 pediatric hospitals in North America thatsaid the risk of critical illness from COVID is far less for children than that ofseasonal flu. Thescience is on ourside here, and we encourage for localities andstates to justsimply follow thescience, open ourschools. It's very damaging to our children: There is a lack of reporting of abuse, there's mental depressions that are not addressed,suicidal ideations that are not addressed whenstudents are not inschool. Ourschools are extremely important, they're essential, and they must reopen. In other words, the White House is arguing that thescienceshouldn't be a problem because it doesn'tstand in their way. But this is certainly not how it was presented to the public by many journalistic outlets. Some outlets did give a fuller explanation of McEnany's comments. MSNBC (7/17/20), for example, noted that, ""To many, that made itsound as if the White House presssecretary was arguing thatscience was an impediment to Donald Trump's preference,"" before explaining that the true context ""casts McEnany's controversial quote in a less embarrassing light."" Yet the headline for the article explaining the confusion was ""White House: 'Science Should Not Stand in the Way' of School Openings,'"" which onlyserved to double the muddle. Around 59% of people do not read past the headline beforesharing an article, making it especially important that they convey accurate information. A majority of peopleseeing these headlines will have been given a misleading picture of events. The media mishandling of McEnany's remarks led to a field day for the right-wing press, portraying the Trump administration as unfairly under attack from the leftist establishment (e.g., Daily Caller,7/17/20; Daily Wire, 7/17/20; National Review, 7/17/20). ""Theshameless charlatans in the liberal media were at it again on Thursday, engaging in fake news,"" wrote Newsbusters (7/16/20). ""The entire corporate media complex have conspired to deliberately lie and mislead the public,"" Breitbart (7/17/20) told its readers. McEnany herself (Twitter,7/16/20) described it as a ""casestudy in media bias"":Isaid: ""Thescience is very clear on this...thescience is on ourside here. We encourage our localities &states to justsimply follow thescience. Open ourschools."" But leave it to the media to deceptivelysuggest I was making the opposite point!The problem with this narrative, of course, is that her comments were anti-science. Ahuge newstudy from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) itself, released thesame day as McEnany's comments, found that children aged 10-19 (i.e., kids in elementary, middle and highschool)spread the disease at least as well as adults do, meaning any reopening will certainly worsen thesituation, leading to deaths, not necessarily ofstudents, but of teachers, grandparents, other public transport users, or anyone else coming into contact with them. Pretending that openingschools has no consequences for adults is itself deeply misleading. Whilesome other Western nations have reopenedschools, they have doneso in a context of drastically reduced new cases; in many instances, virtually zero. On July 16, the day of McEnany's comments, the United Statesset a worldwide all-time high for new daily cases,73,388. Comparing the US to the likes of Germany or New Zealand (July 16cases: 560 and one, respectively) isscientific malpractice. Not only did other Western countries wait until their infection rates were much lower before reopeningschools, they also took great care to reduce the chances thatschoolchildren would transmit the virus to themselves or others. Time (7/20/20) described how Denmark reopenedschools on April 15, when the country wasaveraging30 new cases per million people per day (compared to the US's current 202 cases per million per day):When children ages 2-12 returned toschool, they weresectioned off into ""micro groups"" of 12. These groups--also known as ""protective bubbles""--arrive toschool atstaggered times, eat lunchseparately and have their own zones in the playground. Allstudents are required to wash their hands every two hours but do not have to wear face masks. Desks are divided two meters apart, all education material must be cleaned twice a day and when possible, classes are held outside. Parents are not allowed onschool property. Some countries that reopenedschools with lessstringent protocols have come to regret it. ""Israelis Fear Schools Reopened Too Soon as Covid-19 Cases Climb"" was aJuly 14 headline in the Wall Street Journal, with thesubhead, ""Outbreaks in Schools Had Infected at Least 1,335 Students and 691 Staff by Monday Since the Reopening in Early May.""Just as the pandemic began, the Trump administration attempted toslash the CDC's budget, the president in Februarybrushing off the idea that Covid-19 would be worse than the flu as a liberal ""hoax"" intended to unseat him. After accepting its validity, he touted ineffective drugs as miracle cures and evensuggested that injecting bleach into the body could cure thesick. This is in keeping with the administration's general contempt forsciences,such as its grossly downplaying the threat of climate change, with Trump himself labeling ita Chinese invention, while claiming the noise from wind farms causes cancer. Unfortunately, this latestscandal perfectly encapsulates much of corporate media's apparent resistance to Trump, in that it avoids asubstantive critique in favor of catching the administration out on technical grounds. Resisting the reopening ofschools on the basis that the White House presssecretary misspoke represents a lost opportunity to actually oppose the administration'sscandalously poor handling of the coronavirus, and the dangerous, genuinely anti-science decision to force through reopening in the height of a pandemic. Most US adults, including more than nine in ten Republicans,say they have lost trust in the media in recent years. Thissort ofsloppy faux-adversarial journalism in the pursuit of clicks will do nothing to reverse this trend. Is further eroding your industry's credibility worth a few more eyeballs? Apparently, the answer is yes.",1,1,Common Dreams

S. troops will pull out of Germanyassoon as is feasible, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday, but the ones who will bestationed back in the U. S.may be called up for rotational deployments back to Europe. Under the plan, troop levels in Germany would drop from 36,000 to just over 24,000, Defense Secretary Esper told reporters, with 5,600 of those re-positioned to other European countries and the remaindershifting to U. S. bases to be determined.“I want to note that this plan issubject to, and likely will, change tosome degree as it evolves over time,” hesaid in his opening remarks. The plan would move at least two headquarters elements out of Stuttgart, Germany, and over to Mons, Belgium, according to U. S. European Command boss Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters,specifically EUCOM and Special Operations Command, Europe. Africa Command, also based at Stuttgart, could also move out of Germany, officialssaid, though that decision will come with the completion of AFRICOM’s review. Elsewhere, an Air Force fightersquadron andsupport elements would move from Germany to Italy, while a group of 2,500 airmen who had beenscheduled toshift from Royal Air Force Base Mildenhall, United Kingdom, to Germany willstay put, Espersaid.“Once Warsaw assigns a defense cooperation agreement and burdensharing deal as previously pledged, there are may be other opportunities as well to move additional forces into Poland and the Baltics,” Esper added. In that way, he explained, troop presence in Europe will more closely mirror the new Eastern front. When the U. S. first began basing troops in Germany to deter the Soviet Union, it was one of the farthest east allies to work with. Now, with much of the former Soviet Union having joined NATO ― whilestill contending with Russian advances ― the U. S. has beenspending more time working with troops in countries like Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and more.“These changes will achieve the core principles of enhancing U. S. and NATO deterrence of Russia,strengthening NATO, reassuring allies and improving usstrategic flexibility and EUCOM operational flexibility,” hesaid. That partner training has been done by a mix of Germany-based units moving east for weeks at a time, as well as a U. S.-based Army brigade combat team rotating through. Rotations allow the Army, for example, tosave the logistics of moving entire families to Germany and thensendingsoldiers to the field forshortstints.“And I willsay this much: the deployment rotational forces from the United States we have observed, whether it’s the [armored brigade combat teams] going from the United States to Korea with ABCT to Poland, or the bomber task force, we’re finding that they are deploying at a much higher level of readiness,” Espersaid, citing other examples of rotational forces. “And while they are deployed, they are ... able tosustain a much more fixed focus on their mission and their capabilities. And they can, third, they can provide a more enduring presence.”The plan is part of a review ofseveral combatant commands, which also includes U. S. Africa Command and the recently reactivated Space Command. Effects on the forceAssuming the administration’s plan is completed, the uprooting of EUCOM’s headquarters from Stuttgart to Belgium carries thesymbolism that the days of Germany as the decades-old nerve center for American military might in Europe may be numbered. The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps also have European command headquarters in Germany. Pentagon officials are doing their best to blunt a more profound and potentially destructive re-ordering of the U. S. military footprint in Europe, according to retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who last commanded U. S. Army Europe in 2018.“It could have been worse,” hesaid, noting that any hasty moves from Germany in and out of Poland appear to be off the table.“Germany isstill our most important ally in Europe,” he added, describing the White House reasoning driving the reshuffling as “wrong from the beginning.”As Pentagon leadership briefed reporters, President Donald Trump answered questions about Germany and NATO on the White House lawn.“Germany is not paying their bills,” hesaid. “They’re delinquent. It’ssimple.”A non-mandatory target has NATO members paying 2 percent of their gross domestic product towardsharedsecurity costs by 2024, but few of those countries are meeting that benchmark. That includes Germany, at an estimated 1.38 percent in 2019, but also Italy and Belgium ― who paid an estimated 1.22 percent and 0.93, respectively, last year. Poland has reached that goal.“Let’s be clear: I think Germany is the wealthiest country in Europe. Germany can andshould pay more to its defense,” Espersaid. “Itshould certainly meet the 2 percentstandard, and I would argue, go above and beyond that.”The Pentagon’s plan was focused on maximizing readiness and reassuring allies, Espersaid, while at thesame time under pressure from the president, who has repeatedly targeted Germany. While Esper had hinted at rejiggering Europe forcestructure last year, hesaid that Trump’s rhetoric “accelerated” the plan.“If theystart paying their bills, I would think about it,” Trumpsaid Wednesday of Germany. Esper did not provide details on how many troops would be part of a new Europe rotation. By the math, 5,300 would be returningstateside. The Army in 2016, following a drawdown ofseveral units based around Germany, began rotating an ABCT for nine-monthstints, at about 4,700soldiers each. On balance, the presence of U. S. troops in Europe might only be reducing byseveral hundred, when all issaid and done. For the roughly 6,300 on tap to return home,some could be returning “in a matter of weeks,” Espersaid, though the Pentagon will coordinate with both Congress and theservices to decide which U. S. bases will absorb them. The planned return of the Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, based in Vilseck, Germany, to the United States is expected to leave a mark, according to Hodges.“That’s a tough one toswallow, because that is their assigned combat unit,” hesaid. On Capitol Hill, the decision has been met with bipartisan criticism that it was hasty and will damage America’s alliances. Both the House defense appropriations and policy bills have provisions to bar the Germany drawdown. U. S. force levels have been lowered gradually over the years, in consultation with Germany and NATO, Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Appropriations Committeesaid in atweetWednesday.“Trump is doing this on a lark. Likely just to embarrass Germany,”said Murphy, D-Conn. “No plan. No consultation. Making it a really bad idea.”Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah., called the plan “a grave error,” a “slap in the face at a friend and ally,” and “a gift to Russia coming at a time when we just have learned of itssupport for the Taliban and reports of bounties on killing American troops.” Romney has introduced an amendment to the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to block the removal of troops from Germany. What will it cost?The movement of both manpower and equipment comes with costs, which Esper described as “several billion dollars, I’dsaysingle digits, but that’ll bespread out over time.”However, Hyten later indicated that asignificant amount of detail has yet to be worked out, andstressed that any cost estimate isstill in the earlystages – asign that costs could potentially grow.“Thesecretarysaidsingle digit billions, but those are rough estimates. What we have right now is really a concept ― a concept that we’veshared with our allies,shared with the Congress, and weshared inside the department fairly widely,” Hytensaid. “We now have to turn it into plans. As you turn into plans, we have a verystructured process involving the Joint Staff, the office of thesecretary, and the combatant commands and theservices, to makesure we understand what those are, then we’ll lay in the costs.”The costs of the plan would come not just from military construction, but from the added expense of moving from based forces to rotational ones. In a2017study for the Army War College titled “Rotational Deployments vs. Forward Stationing,” author John R. Deniconcluded that it costs$135 million more each year to have a rotational brigade combat team in Europe, as opposed to having the force be permanently based in Germany.“We need to actually reach out to the potential locations where these forces are going to move, makesure we understand what is there, what can be there, and then turn those into real cost estimates, and then work with the Congress to get the resources,” Hyten continued. A2019 analysis by Rick Berger of the American Enterprise Institute found that the U. S. has invested $5.9 billion in construction for its German bases over the last two decades; while it is unclear issimilar investments would be needed to build up new headquarters buildings and other infrastructure in Belgium and Italy, leaving behind empty facilities in Stuttgart and elsewhere may beseen by Congress as a waste of taxpayer dollars.“Some of those resources can be handled in-year execution,” he added. “Some will be handled out years, especially military construction.”Defense News reporter Joe Gould contributed to this report.

The research was published today (March 18) in the American Heart Association’s journal, Circulation, and is just the latest(pdf) in a mounting pile of evidenceshowing thatsoda has had—and continues to have—a negative impact on public health in America.“The big picture is reallystarting to emerge,”said Vasanti Malik, one of the co-authors of thestudy, in a conversation with CNBC. “This is not random. There’s a whole lot of consistency across these findings.”Like much of nutritionscience, the most recent research isn’t definitive, in part because it’s difficult to draw hard conclusions from work that relies on peopleself-reporting their diets. There’s no way to be totallysuresomeone didn’t omit or overstate what they were eating or how much they exercised, or miscalculate their body-mass index. Still, the Harvardstudy drew from a fairly largesample of people—37,716 men and 80,647 women who reported data between 1986 and 2014. Likeanother recentstudy thatsought insight into the ill effects of junk food, an observationalstudy that draws from tens of thousands of participants can’t be ignored. The researchers followedstudy participants’ health forseveral decades. Among other things, the people beingsurveyed reported how manysugar-sweetened, carbonated beverages they drank per week and month. The researchers found that people who drank moresugar-sweetened beverages, includingsoda, were associated with risk of death from heart disease. Compared to people who infrequently dranksoda, the people who drank more than twoservings a day had a 31% higher risk of death from bad heart health. Eachserving-per-day increase insoda consumption was associated with a 10% higher risk of heart disease-related death, thestudystates. To a lesser degree, moresoda consumption was also linked to an increased risk of developing breast and colon cancers. The research did differentiate betweensodassweetened with realsugar versus artificialsugars. Based on their conclusions, thescientists estimate that replacing oneserving per day ofsodasweetened by realsugar with oneservingsweetened by artificialsugar was associated with a 4% lower risk of total mortality, and 5% lower risk of heart disease-related death.“Strengths of ourstudy include the largesamplesize, long-term and high rates of follow-up, detailed and repeated measurements of diet and lifestyle, and numeroussensitivity analyses thatsupport the robustness of the results,” the researchers wrote in thestudy. The research will likely add more fuel to the efforts of health advocates to get people to drink lesssoda.

295,"Google committed “antitrust evils,” colluded with Facebook, new lawsuit says",0.0,44.67,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/new-suits-accuse-google-of-antitrust-evils-collusion-with-facebook/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,19,"Twoseparate coalitions ofstates have filed massive antitrust lawsuits against Google in the past 24 hours, alleging that the company abuses its extensive power to force would-be competitors out of the marketplace and harms consumers in the process. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxtonspearheaded the firstsuit, which nine otherstates alsosigned onto. Thesecondsuit is led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, and an additional 36states and territoriessigned on. Antitrust law isn't just about a company being an illegal monopoly or even about being the dominant firm in its marketsector. Although being a literal monopoly, with no available competition of any kind, can put you on the fast track to investigation, the law has broader concerns. Primarily, antitrust investigations are about—inshort, how a company uses its power. If you're a big company because everyone likes yourstuff best, well, you're a big company, congratulations. But if you got to be the dominant company by cheatingsomehow—strong-arming other firms in thesupply chain; targeting anticompetitive acquisitions; colluding with other firms to manipulate market conditions, andso on—that's a problem. With that in mind, let's delve into what's going on. You have indeed heard thissong before, and recently, too. Both newsuits come in the wake of asuit the Justice Department and a group of 11states—Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas—jointly filed against Googlein October. Three additionalstates also filed with the court today to join on to the federal case,so a total of 52 attorneys general—representing 49states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia—and the DOJ have nowsigned on to one or more of the three legal challenges. (Alabama appears to be the remainingstate not yet participating in any of the cases at this time.)For the time being, these two new lawsuits areseparate and distinct both from the federal case and from each other. However, according to the DOJ, the coalition that filed itssuit today also petitioned the court to consolidate the proceedings,so in all likelihood, this will eventually be one antitrust case. The Octobersuit issurprisingly narrow, considering how manysegments of the digital marketplace Google's parent company Alphabet either participates in or dominates. That case focuses almost entirely on Google'ssearch business, which the DOJ alleged the company monopolized illegally for more than a decade through ""exclusionary agreements and anticompetitive conduct."" These both focus on other elements of Google's business. The Texas-ledsuit (PDF) is focused on the online advertising market. According to thatsuit, Google uses its control of the advertising ecosystem to block potential competitors from competing in online advertising exchanges and unfairly uses its vertical integration to win real time advertising auctions.""Google is essentially trading on 'insider information' by acting as the pitcher, catcher, batter, and umpire, all at thesame time"" in the online advertising market, Paxtonsaidwhen announcing thesuit. ""This isn't the 'free market' at work here. This is anti-market and illegal understate and federal law.""Google entered aseries of agreements, code named Project Jedi, with other advertising firms to allow it to maintain its marketshare, thesuit alleges. The most eye-popping of those deals is an agreement Google allegedlysigned with Facebook in 2018, which ""fixes prices and allocates markets between Google and Facebook as competing bidders in the auctions for publishers' Web display and in-app advertising inventory.""Basically, according to thesuit, Facebook in 2017 figured out a way to make money from a new online-advertising biddingsystem. Google thought that new tactic posed an ""existential threat"" to its own massiveslice of the advertising pie and made an agreement with Facebook: Facebook would cut back on the new tech, and Google would give Facebook a big edge in its own advertising auctions. Tacticssuch as bid rigging and market division areexplicitly, flatly illegal under antitrust law. ""The Supreme Court has warned that there aresuch things as antitrust evils,"" thesuit begins, alleging that Google is guilty ofsuch, and it ""seeks to ensure that Google won't be evil anymore.""The Colorado-ledsuit (PDF) focuses on Google'ssearch andsearch-advertising business, accusing the company of behaving anti competitively in three key ways. Firstly, thesuit argues, Google ""uses its massive financial resources to limit the number of consumers who use a Google competitor."" This holds particularly true in mobile, thesuit alleges, which Google dominates entirely. Not only is Google the defaultsearch engine on Android, which is a Google product, but the company also pays Applebillions of dollars every year to be the defaultsearch engine on iOS devices as well. Secondly, Google leverages itssearch-advertising business, SA360, insuch a way as to prevent competition from arising, thesuit alleges, by prohibiting inter operability with competitors and locking advertisers in. And thirdly, according to thesuit, Google ""throttles"" those who try to go around Google to reachsites, products, andservices directly. This harms ""specialized vertical providers"" by keeping them from reaching potential customers, especially on mobile. In response to the lawsuits, Google today published alength y corporate b log post explaining why Googlesearch is Great, Actually, andshould be left alone.""Rigorous testing"" hasshown Google that consumers vastly prefer theirsearch results to be chock-full of Google's own modules, wrote Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy. ""We know that if you don't like the results we're giving you, you have numerous alternatives—including Amazon, Expedia, Tripadvisor and many others just a click away.""Amazon, to consumers, is an e-retailer,streaming video company, and digital goods purveyor, not asearch engine, and both Expedia and Tripadvisor arespecifically forsearches related to travel and hospitality, but it is indeed true that they exist. The antitrust lawsuit ""suggests weshouldn't have worked to make Search better and that weshould, in fact, be less useful to you,"" Cohen added. ""The claims being made have been closely examined and rejected by regulators and courts around the world, including the US Federal Trade Commission, competition authorities in Brazil, Canada, and Taiwan, and courts in the United Kingdom and Germany, who all agreed that our changes are designed to improve yoursearch results. It's also well established that the most important driver for oursearch results is thespecific query—not your personal data.""Google's claims are accurate but misleading: while the FTC did back away from pursuing major action against Google in 2013, European regulators fined Google a total of more than $9 billion across three years for violating antitrust law: 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in 2017, related tosearch; 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) in 2018, related toAndroid; and 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in 2019, related toAdSense. Regulators inseveral other nationssuch asAustralia,Japan, India, and South Korea, are also reviewing Google's competition practices. The potential outcomes of these cases are unclear. We could be looking at the biggest antitrust action in a generation, a giant nothingburger, or anything in between. None of the three casesspecifically calls for Google to be broken up, unlike theFacebook antitrust lawsuits the feds andstates filed last week. Thatsaid, they don't exactlyseek breakups either. Instead, thesuits are all calling for whatever ""structural relief"" might be deemed necessary alongside all the various fines, penalties, and injunctions against bad behavior theyseek. It's going to be a very long, very ugly legal fight, no matter what happens. Even if the cases are consolidated into asingle docket, asseems likely, don't besurprised if it takes until 2025 or beyond for the case to wrap once and for all. For comparison, the DOJ filed its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft in May 1998; the court accepted what became the finalsettlement in November 2002, 4.5 years later.",2,2,ARS Technica

Two House committeessent asubpoena for records on Monday to Trump’s longtime lender of choice, the German financial giant Deutsche Bank, along with multiple other financial institutions as part of an investigation into foreign influence on U. S. politics, Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intel committee, told VICE News Tuesday morning. Investigators areseeking documents related to possible money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe,The New York Times reported, citing three unidentified people with knowledge of the requests. Thesubpoenas mark a new front in the investigations into Trump’s money, which are being led by multiple House committees and investigative bodies based in New York State. Collectively, investigators are nowseeking a wide range of documents related to Trump’s finances, including banking records, personal and business tax returns and corporate insurance records. The German lender has already beensubpoenaed by New York’s Attorney General’s office. Schiffsaid Deutsche has been “cooperative” with the probe being run by the House Intelligence Committee and House Financial Services Committee.“Deutsche Bank is engaged in a productive dialogue with the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees,” Deutschespokesperson Kerrie McHugh told VICE News in an emailedstatement Tuesday morning. “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations.”That could pose problems for the president. The firm is believed to hold a vast and detailed trove of information about Trump’s business empire, thanks to its longstanding lending relationship with his family business. The bank has reportedly lentTrump a total of more than $2 billion over the years, even after other big Wall Street firms labeled him too risky to touch after aseries of bankruptcies in the 1990s. Congressional investigators are alsoseeking records from JP Morgan and Citigroup,CNN reported Tuesday morning, citing unidentified people familiar with the requests. President Trump’sson Ericslammed the banksubpoenas as an “unprecedented abuse of power,” motivated by politics.“Instead of legislating, the committee is obsessed with harassing and undermining my father’s administration, doing everything they can to distract from his incredible accomplishments,” Eric Trumpsaid in astatement to VICE News. “This incompetence is the exact reason why the American people havesuch disdain for politicians and why my father was elected president.”But House Democratssay they’re worried about the nationalsecurity implications of Trump’s potential ties to foreign money.“We want to know if the president or anyone in his family is financially compromised,” Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California on the House Intelligence Committee,said onCNN late Monday. “Not just to the Russians, because weshouldn’t assume he’s faithful to them. He has worked with the Saudis, with other countries, in ways that are certainly, I think, below thestandard of conduct that we would accept.”Deutsche has had its own controversial history with helping to move Russian money around the world. In January 2017, the bank was fined $630 million by regulators in New York and London for allowing clients of its Moscow office to launder $10 billion out of Russia through questionablestock trades. Deutsche isn’t the only aspect of Trump’s finances facingscrutiny. The New York State Department of Financial Services, hassought records from Trump’s longtime insurance broker, Aon. The House Oversight Committee isseeking years worth of records from Trump’s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA,according to Politico.

Astatementshared publicly Thursday accuses director Robert Reilly and his deputy director, Elizabeth Robbins, of violating VOA’s journalistic code by giving asenior government official “a free platform tospeak live on our channels” by arranging a live broadcast of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then removing VOA’s White House correspondent aftershe tried to question the outgoingsecretary. The Government Accountability Project (GAP), a nonprofit that protects whistleblowers, informed USAGM and VOA leadership, along with the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of the Inspector General, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and other lawmakers, that thosesigning the petition are deemed protected whistleblowers. Patsy Widakuswara, who joined VOA in 2003, was told late Mondayshe was being reassigned, hours after the veteran reporter attempted to question Pompeo and then Reilly as thesecretary left VOA’s headquarters. In hisspeech, the outgoingsecretary ofstate praised Michael Pack, USAGM’s chief executive, for changes implemented at USAGM under his leadership. He also commended a group of VOA journalists for their bravery in covering Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests. Widakuswara was among the team honored with the Burke Award for that coverage. Following hisspeech, which also addressed “American exceptionalism” and what he views as VOA's role, Pompeo had a brief question-and-answersession with Reilly, who did not pose questionssubmitted by the agency’s main newsroom about recent news events. As thesecretary ofstate left the network’s headquarters, Widakuswara tried unsuccessfully to question Pompeo and then Reilly, who admonished Widakuswara,sayingshe was not authorized to ask questions. Thestatementsigned by the more than two dozen VOA journalists calls for Reilly's and Robbins’ immediate resignations.“As journalists, our job is to pursue the truth — to ask questions even when it is uncomfortable or difficult. While Mr. Reilly abdicated this duty, one VOA journalist — Senior White House Correspondent Patsy Widakuswara — tried to uphold it by questioning Secretary Pompeo after the event,” thestatementsays. Thestatement also criticizes the “sudden and unexplained” reassignment of VOA Central News Director Yolanda Lopez, who was moved into a new role Wednesday evening. She was replaced by Luis Ramirez, an editor in the news division who has worked as a correspondent and editor in overseas and domestic bureaus during a 21-year career with the agency. VOA directors have the authority to reassignstaff as theysee fit. Aspokespersonsaid Wednesday that it does not comment on personnel matters. Representatives Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, and Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, condemned the decision to remove Widakuswara in a jointstatement from the Foreign Affairs Committee. In aseparatestatementshared with VOA, Meeks, the new committee chairman,said, “It is ironic that Secretary Pompeo would praise VOA for fighting foreign propaganda while using it tospread his own. Pompeo improperly held VOA reporters as a captive audience for aspeech where the only questions allowed were from the administration’s own appointees.”Noting that Pack is already underscrutiny by the committee for “efforts to dismantle editorial independence at VOA,” Meeks added that the decision to remove asenior reporter “only gives ammunition to thosesame authoritarian leaders and undermines our ability to promote freespeech around the world.”Pack has previously denied allegations that he is interfering with editorial independence,saying he is trying to address long-standing issues, including allegedsecurity lapses within the agency. USAGM referred comments to VOA's public relations. In aDecember 6 interview with'“American Thought Leaders” podcast, Packsaid his vision was to address areas where the networks are failing to fulfil their mission adequately, including reporting objectively, explaining American values and presenting the U. S. administration’s viewpoint. Media rights lawyer Theodore Boutrous accused Pack, Reilly and Pompeo of “making the First Amendment and the American tradition of freedom of the press a laughingstock around the world.”Boutrous, whose firm, Gibson Dunn, represents Widakuswara as well assenior USAGM officials and a VOA journalist in aseparate lawsuit,warned in a letter Wednesdaythat the reassignment was “unlawful and unconstitutional” and called on Reilly to immediately reinstate her. Widakuswara is thesecond White House correspondent to face apparent retaliationsince Pack’s tenure began. Aseparate lawsuit from Gibson Dunn alleged that Pack’s aides created a dossier on Steve Herman in an effort to have him reassigned. In that case, a federal district court banned Pack from directly interfering inVOA’s editorial decisions, including investigatingstaff. The GAP also wrote to Pack, Reilly and Robbins on Wednesday, informing them that the decision to remove Widakuswara was gross mismanagement. The letter noted that Widakuswara hassince been assigned to the Indonesianservice. Neither the reporter nor her union representative was informed of the move, and Widakuswara only learned of it after being copied on an internal email, David Seide,senior counsel at GAP,said in the letter. Indonesian news outlets including have reported on the bipartisan condemnation of VOA over its decision to reassign Widakuswara. The White House correspondentstarted her career as an international journalist in VOA’s Indonesianservice, working on a J-1 visa. Journalists at VOA’ssister network RFE/RL have also raised concerns over Pack’s decisions. A December 30 letter from the RFE/RL editorial board and languageservice directors protested attempts by Pack to change their grantee contracts. The amendments,signed Monday by Ted Lipien, the newly appointed president of RFE/RL,say members, officers and directors appointed by the CEO cannot be removed for two years after their appointment, unless convicted of a criminal charge, and after that period they can be removed only for cause. The revised contract alsostates that as a condition of receiving grant funds, RFE/RL agrees to amend its articles of incorporation, bylaws and other documents as necessary.“[This] is precisely the kind of political power maneuver that RFE/RL regularly witnesses in places like Russia, Hungary, Belarus and Tajikistan. We never thought we’dsee it from our own oversight agency,”the letter read. USAGM has alsosought to debar the Open Technology Fund from federal funding, citing conflicts of interest and alleged irregularities at the independent nonprofit. Pack first notified the OTF of plans to block it from funding on December 15, but he rescinded the notice and reissued it without explanation at the end of the month. The new notice means that a 90-day extension for OTF to contest the bill, included in aspending billsigned by Congress in late December, no longer applies.",2,2,Voice of America
298,President Biden should follow Lincoln’s lead,10.0,33.33,https://www.christianpost.com/voices/president-biden-should-follow-lincolns-lead.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-christian-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,17,"On January 20th, President-elect Joe Biden will become President Joe Biden when he takes the oath of office. If he follows the lead of most of his predecessors (going back to George Washington), he’ll doso on an open Bible. Theseriousness of the moment, the public trust invested in the executive branch,seems to demand an appeal to the divine. Then, he’ll have an opportunity to address the nation toset a tone for his administration. The best inaugural addresses connect to the broader American tradition, and in our moment, the new President could do much worse than following Abraham Lincoln’s lead. Inaugural addresses over the past two centuries havesought tospeak tospecific moments while connecting to long-standing American principles. Addresses aim toset a clear tone, like Franklin Roosevelt’s declaration, taking office during the Great Depression, “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Presidents may attempt to communicate an approach to the problems faced, as when Ronald Reagan asserted, “In the present crisis, government is not thesolution to our problem; government is the problem.” The best call for active response, along the lines of John F. Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you —ask what you can do for your country.”Thesestrategies will be in Mr. Biden’s mind as he prepares his address. He begins his presidency confronting both the on-going challenges of COVID-19 and the deep political polarization which has not onlystrained national unity but broken out into political violence at the Capitol. In light of these problems, Mr. Biden would do well to turn back to President Lincoln’s 1861 First Inaugural. Lincoln had just come through a hotly contested and divisive election not unlike last November’s. Lincoln carried thestandard for the upstart Republican party. The Democratic party, formerly a national party, had itself fractured, nominating two candidates, Stephen Douglas and John C. Breckinridge. John Bell ran on the Constitutional Union ticket. When the votes were counted, Lincoln had a majority of electoral votes andso achieved the presidency according to constitutional guidelines. Thisstunned manysoutherners. They could legitimately claim that they didn’t know anyone who had voted for Lincoln,since the Republican ticket had been denied ballot access across the South. The question of legitimacyswirled. Lincoln faced more than just hard feelings; he confronted the very real danger of political violence. Southern fire-eaters, once the election returns came in, began laying the groundwork to leave the Union. Their endeavors bore fruit when South Carolina voted tosecede. Six other Deep Southstates would follow them. Lincoln had largely remainedsilent. His inaugural address was thus his opportunity tospeak to a nation on the brink of dissolution. How did hespeak to a nation tearing itself apart?Lincoln addressed his hearers with honesty. He acknowledged differences between thesections, rooted in the legalstanding ofslavery. He didn’t ignore or paper over those differences, yet he believed the issues could be negotiated carefully. However, Lincoln also was honest in the consequences awaiting thesecessionists. Pushing further down their course would elicit astrong response. “Ishall have the mostsolemn [oath] to ‘preserve, protect, and defend’” the government and the Constitution, Lincoln told them,signaling thesteps he would take in the days after the ceremony. Next, Lincoln called for patient reflection. “Think calmly and,” he cautioned. “Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.” Rather than “hot haste,” the wiser course facing a divided people was to pause and reflect on consequences. The optimistic predictions among thesecessionists represented mere braggadocio. A more realistic,sober assessment would bring the parties back to the table. Third, Lincolnsought to recreate national unity through reminding his listeners of historical ties, to recover a common identity in ashared history. Although alluded toseveral times, this theme was front and center in his conclusion: “Though passion may havestrained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory,stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yetswell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, assurely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” Lincoln intended these lines — now famous — to evoke a loyalty that could go beyond transient differences to produce long-term concord. Finally, Lincoln placed the divides within a transcendent framework. The “Almighty Ruler of nations, with his eternal truth and justice” was overseeing the conflict and would render a judgment, according to Lincoln. Disunionists would have to reckon, not only with the consequences of their actions, but with the evaluation of a just God. The great irony is that Lincoln’s inaugural did revive America’s better angels. When Lincoln decided to resupply Ft. Sumter in Charleston Harbor, the Confederate batteries opened fire, launching the Civil War. Over the next four years, Americans wouldslaughter one another, leaving over 600,000 dead and thousands more permanently maimed. President Lincoln lived long enough tosee the War end and to issue a call “to bind up the nation’s wounds,” but his efforts would be cutshort by an assassin’s bullet. Yet, Lincoln’s appeal to his countrymen echoes today. Mr. Biden’s Inaugural Address would do well to draw his listeners to the four elements of Lincoln’s. Americans need to look at their differences with honesty, resisting the habit of finding and then magnifying the worst examples of those with whom we disagree. Further, we need to face facts honestly, even if we don’t like them or they don’t confirm our prior assumptions. Second, it might be good toslow down and practicesome patient reflection, rather than jumping from one hot take to another. Third, the address could call the country back to ashared purpose, recognizing our connections to an American past. That past is not perfect. It’s marred insignificant ways — as Lincoln knew well — but it also has resources in both principles and the many examples of those who called for the country to be better. Finally, this endeavor works best when it is understood that our civic actions are not just for ourselves. Following Lincoln, an appeal to “Him, who has never yet forsaken this favored land” would not be out of order.

299,Twitter may let users choose how to crop image previews after bias scrutiny – TechCrunch,-0.67,49.67,https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-may-let-users-choose-how-to-crop-image-previews-after-bias-scrutiny,https://adfontesmedia.com/techcrunch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,19,"In an interesting development in the wake of a bias controversy over its cropping algorithm, Twitter hassaid it’s considering giving users decision-making power over how tweet previews look,saying it wants to decrease its reliance on machine learning-based image cropping. Yes, you read that right. A tech company is affirming that auto mating certain decisions may not, in fact, be thesmart thing to do — tacitly acknowledging that removing human agency can generate harm. As we reported last month, the micro b logging platform found its image-cropping algorithm garnering critical attention afterPh. D.student Colin Madlandnoticed the algorithm onlyshowed his own (white male) image in preview — repeatedly cropping out the image of a black faculty member. Ironically enough he’d been discussing asimilar bias issue with Zoom’s virtual backgrounds. Geez…any guesses why@Twitterdefaulted toshow only the rightside of the picture on mobile?pic.twitter.com/UYL7N3XG9k— Colin Madland (@colinmadland)September 19, 2020Twitter responded to the criticism at the time bysaying it had tested for bias beforeshipping the machine learning model and had “not found evidence of racial or gender bias”. But it added: “It’s clear from these examples that we’ve got more analysis to do. We’ll continue toshare what we learn, what actions we take, and will opensource our analysisso others can review and replicate.”Twitter and Zoom’s algorithmic bias issuesIt has now followed up with additional details about its testing processes in abl og post where itsuggests it could move away from using an algorithm for preview crops in the future. Twitter also concedes itshould have published details of its bias testing process launching the algorithmic cropping tool — in order that its processes could have been externally interrogated. “This was an oversight,” it admits. Wesaw your Tweets about the harm caused by how images are cropped on Twitter. Today we’resharing how we test for bias in oursystems, and how we plan to rely less on auto-cropping and give you more choice in how images appear in Tweets:— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport)October 1, 2020Explaining how the model works, Twitter writes: “The image croppingsystem relies onsaliency, which predicts where people might look first. For our initial bias analysis, we tested pairwise preference between two demographic groups (White-Black, White-Indian, White-Asian and male-female). In each trial, we combined two faces into thesame image, with their order randomized, then computed thesaliency map over the combined image. Then, we located the maximum of thesaliency map, and recorded which demographic category it landed on. We repeated this 200 times for each pair of demographic categories and evaluated the frequency of preferring one over the other.”“While our analyses to date haven’tshown racial or gender bias, we recognize that the way we automatically crop photos means there is a potential for harm. Weshould’ve done a better job of anticipating this possibility when we were first designing and building this product. We are currently conducting additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing, are committed tosharing our findings, and are exploring ways to open-source our analysisso that others can help keep us accountable,” it adds. On the possibility of moving away from algorithmic image cropping in favor of letting humans have asay, Twittersays it has “started exploring different options tosee what will work best across the wide range of images people tweet every day”.“We hope that giving people more choices for image cropping and previewing what they’ll look like in the tweet composer may help reduce the risk of harm,” it adds,suggesting tweet previews could in future include visual controls for users. Such a move, rather than injecting “friction” into the platform (which would presumably be the typical techie concern about adding anotherstep to the tweeting process), could open up new creative/tonal possibilities for Twitter users by providing another layer of nuance that wraps around tweets. Say by enabling users to create “Easter egg” previews that deliberately conceal a key visual detail untilsomeone clicks through; or which zero-in on a particular element to emphasize a point in the tweet. Given the popularity of joke “half and half” images that play with messaging app WhatsApp’s preview crop format — which requires a click to predictably expand the view — it’s easy toseesimilar visual jokes and mem es being fired up on Twitter,should it provide users with the right tools. The bottom line is that giving humans more agency means you’re inviting creativity —letting diversity override bias. Whichshould be a win-win. So it’s great tosee Twitter entertaining the idea of furloughing one of its algorithms. (Dare wesuggest the platform also takes a close and critical look at the algorithmic workings around“top tweets”, “trending tweets”, and the “popular/relevant” content its al gossometimes choose to inject, unasked, into users’ timelines, all of which can generate asmorgasbord of harms.)Returning to image cropping, Twittersays that as a general rule it will be committed to “the ‘what yousee is what you get’ principles of design” — aka, “the photo yousee in the tweet composer is what it will look like in the tweet” — while warning there will likelystill besome exceptions,such as for images that aren’t astandardsize. In those cases itsays it will experiment with howsuch images are presented, aiming to doso in a way that “doesn’t lose the creator’s intended focal point or take away from the integrity of the photo”. Again, it will do well toshow any algorithmic workings in public. We need a new field of AI to combat racial bias",2,2,TechCrunch

That will mean one thing for certain: Tucker Carlson is going to have a complete meltdown about it.""Such attacks are not only unspeakable tragedies for the victim's loved ones, they are also a tragedy for our country, an attack on our core ideals as asociety,"" Garland told reporters in announcing thestrategy. ""We must not only bring our federal resources to bear, we must adopt a broadersocietal response to tackle the problem's deeper roots.""There were concerns about whatshapesuch astrategy might take when the president announced it in January immediately upon taking office, fueled in nosmall part by the eruption of far-right violence at the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U. S. Capitol—particularlysuggestions to pass new anti-terrorism laws and erect a top-heavy “war on terror”-style response. However, the plan released Tuesday by the administration has none of these characteristics, issensibly focused on enforcing the abundant laws already on the books, andsimilarly on rooting out extremists from within the ranks of the law enforcement officers charged with enforcing those laws. No doubt it will drive Carlson over the edge.“We have to take bothshort-termsteps to counter the very real threats of today and longer-term measures to diminish the drivers that will contribute to this ongoing challenge to our democracy,”Bidensai din an officialstatement.“This is a project thatshould unite all Americans. Together we must affirm that domestic terrorism has no place in oursociety. We must work to root out the hatreds that can too often drive violence. And we must recommit to defending and protecting our basic freedoms, which belong to all Americans in equal measure, and which are not only the foundation of our democracy—they are our enduring advantage in the world.”The plan outlines four main components, or “pillars”:Notably, while the plan does not advocate for new legislation to bolster prosecutors’ ability to charge terrorist actors, it does notspecifically eschew the idea, either. Rather,the FAQnotes: “DOJ is closely examining whether new legislative authorities that balancesafety and the protection of civil liberties are necessary and appropriate.”“The recognition that civilsociety is the first and best line of defense against the radical right; empowering this through learning,support and training is urgently needed,” Matthew Feldman, director of the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right,told BuzzFeed News. “Finding ways of doing this thatsmacks neither of propaganda orsuperficiality will be a major headache, though we really have no choice if we’re really committed to pushing back the tide of hatred, disinformation and political violence.”Experts were also impressed by the funding dedicated to preventing radicalization. “If that’s allocated effectively, it could have a real impact,”tweeted Brian Hughes, associate director of the Polarization and Extremism Research Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University. “Better recognition of thesigns leading up to an attack,sure. But also resources to helpstop radicalization before itstarts.”The plan also deals clearly with the problem of infiltration of the ranks of law enforcement and the military by far-right extremists, particularlysince the former will be primarily responsible for enforcing the laws against terrorist violence:The U. S. Government is improving employeescreening to enhance methods for identifying domestic terrorists who might pose insider threats. The Office of Personnel Management will consider updates to the forms used to apply forsensitive roles in the Federal Government that could assist investigators in identifying potential domestic terrorism threats. DOD, DOJ, and DHS aresimilarly pursuing efforts to ensure domestic terrorists are not employed within our military or law enforcement ranks and improvescreening and vetting processes. As the Brennan Center for Justice’s Michael Germanexplored in astudy, law enforcement has increasingly been polluted by the rising numbers of far-right extremists within their ranks—some of them recruited from within police forces, while others havesurreptitiously infiltrated them. “While it is widely acknowledged that racist officerssubsist within police departments around the country, federal,state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactive ly identify them, report their behavior to prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they aresworn toserve,” he writes.“Efforts to addresssystemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the racial disparities in the criminal justicesystem as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.”It’s not credible to expect our national law enforcement apparatus to respond effectively to far-right domestic terrorism when its ranks are full of peoplesympathetic to their cause. So any effectivesolution to dealing with thespread of domestic terrorism will necessarily be wrapped up in thesimilarly major issue of larger police reform, whichshould probably begin with a focused effort on weeding out extremists within their ranks.“The United States is wellserved by a diverse workforce, including in the military and Federal,state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement,” the planstates. “Those who protect and defend this nationshould reflect the nation, including its vastspectrum of experiences and viewpoints. Consistent with that, no oneshould be allowed to abuse or exploit the trust and responsibility or the oftensensitive accesses and resources that are a part ofsuch professions.”Experts generally voiced approval for the plan. “This first U. S.strategy breaks new ground in moving beyond an exclusively law-enforcement andsecurity frame in thinking about combatting domestic violent extremism, includingserious attention to prevention,”tweeted Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idriss,director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University. Mary McCord of Georgetown University Law Centertoldthat prevention also involves tacticssuch as undercoverstings, whichsome civil liberties groups have deemed entrapment. “You don’t want to be prosecuting the El Paso terrorist after he kills 23 people. You want to have prevented it,” McCordsaid. “That’s the challenge. Because anytime you’re engaging in preventive law enforcement, that comes with criticisms.”“This brings us in line with what other countries are doing overseas: Understanding you can’t tackle domestic extremism by only paying attention to the fringe,” Miller-Idriss toldThe Washington Post. “You also have to pay attention to what’s happening in the mainstream.”“The devil’s in the execution, but this is an intelligentstep forward, and an important departure from the past,”tweeted Hughes. “Kudos to the authors and the admin. I’m looking forward tosee what happens next.”Biden’sstrategy codifies what expertssuch as Carly Gordenstein and Seamus Hughes, researchers at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, consider to be “asea change in counterterrorism.”“It is clear thatstructural changes are under way that aim to root out extremism in and out of government, attempt to concentrate efforts more efficiently, and invest in the issue of domestic extremism at a rate that is unprecedented in the United States,” Gordenstein and Hughes wrote. All of which is certain tosend Tucker Carlson completely over the edge on hisshow. Carlson, who has been leading Fox News’ final descent into the abyss of far-right extremism, has had a particular fetish about the looming prosecutions of a number of far-right extremists, including the Jan. 6 insurrectionists—because the target, according to Carlson, is actually ordinary Republicans. Carlson has tried to claim both that the Capitol was “not an armed insurrection” and that terrorism by white nationalists—who he defines as “people who don’t agree with Joe Biden”—isnot asignificant threat: “So, what is whitesupremacy? Well, the weird thing is Joe Biden didn't define it,” he falsely claimed on a recentshow. Tuesday’s announcedstrategy, in fact, quite clearly defines it:[One] key aspect of today’s domestic terrorism threat emerges from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists and networks whose racial, ethnic, or religious hatred leads them toward violence, as well as those whom they encourage to take violent action. These actors have different motivations, but many focus their violence towards thesamesegment orsegments of the American community, whether persons of color, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, other religious minorities, women and girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, or others. Their insistence on violence can, at times, be explicit. It also can, at times, be less explicit, lurking in ideologies rooted in a perception of thesuperiority of the white race that call for violence in furtherance of perverse and abhorrent notions of racial “purity” or “cleansing.”Count on Carlson to pretend otherwise while claiming that the above descriptionsomehow targets Republicans. After all, we’re now down toseeing Fox News openly identify with violent far-right extremists to own the libs.",1,1,Daily Kos

Instead, American children have been forced to enduresubstandard electronic remote instruction, while teachers andschoolsstruggle to troubleshoot, and political activist unions do their best to keep children out of the classrooms. But in Biden’s America, illegal immigrants getspecial privileges that taxpaying American citizens don’t, perhaps because the Biden Admin has high hopes for their voting future. Unaccompanied illegal migrant minors are now being instructed in-person by teachers from the San Diego Unified School District, while the 130,000 American citizen children from taxpaying families are only allowed online learning.

Apparently, it’s too dangerous for teachers to return to full-time in-person work to teach San Diego’s legal taxpaying citizens, but it’s not too dangerous for them to provide in-person education to unaccompanied illegal migrant children who they hope are future Democrat voters. One parentsaid,“Thesystem is broken when San Diego teachers are teaching migrant children in person, but the 100kstudents of taxpaying families at San Diego Unified School District arestuck learning in Zoomschool.

S. Senate in Georgia. Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeated Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, respectively, givingDemocrats control of Congress. Like a lot of recent political events, the Georgia runoffs are moresignificant the further you zoom out the lens. In onesense, the results were not thatunpredictable. Thefinal polling averagesshowed both Democrats ever-so-slightly ahead, and it was clear that the races we reshaping up insuch a way as to make the Democrats extremely competitive. But the Georgia runoffs were full of practical andsymbolicsignificance. They exposed the limitations of the Republican coalition, with or without President Trump, leaving the party further in the electoral wilderness — it’s not clear where the Republican Party goes from here, especially in the wake of the violent insurrection by Trumpsupporters at the Capitol. First, thesignificance of Georgiaspecifically. I’llspare yousome of the boilerplate about the more obvious implications, but having a Senate majority is a big deal. It means that Democratsshould be able to confirm Supreme Court justices and President-elect Joe Biden’s Cabinet. They’ll likely be able to pass additional COVID-19stimulus legislation at the very least, along with other budgetary policies through reconciliation. Other policy changes would require eliminating the filibuster —unlikely— or getting cooperation from enough Republicans. But at least Democrats will have the chance to bring to the floorelection-reform bills like H. R. 1andpolicies like Puerto Ricostatehood, giving them a fighting chance instead of having Majority Leader Mitch McConnellsquash them from thestart. Andsymbolically? Well,it’sGeorgia. With the possible exception of Texas, no otherstate has been as much of asymbol of an emerging Democratic coalition of college-educated white voters and high turnout among Black voters and other minority groups. Both Warnock and Ossoff are breakthrough candidates, not the moderate, whiteBlue Dogsthat Democrats have traditionally nominated in Georgia. Warnock, thesenior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, will become the first Blacksenator from Georgia and the first Black Democrat ever toserve in the U. S. Senate from the South. Ossoff will become the youngestsenator electedsince Biden, in 1973, and the first Jewishsenator elected to the U. S. Senate from the Southsince the 1880s. Then there’s the fact that the runoffs came during a lame-duck period in which — in a predicate to Wednesday’s violence — Trump and other Republicanstried to overturn andsubvert the results of the election and undermine faith in the democratic process. If Republicans get the message that anti-democratic actions have negative electoral consequences, they may be less inclined to push democracy to the brink in the future. Republicans may not take away that lesson, though. Oneschool of thought is that because Warnock’s and Ossoff’s wins were narrow — once all votes are counted, Warnockshould win by around 2 percentage points and Ossoff by about 1 point — weshouldn’t make too much of them. I don’t find this convincing. The way political actors react to elections is usually based on who wins and loses, not on their margins of victory. For example, nobody thought that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were brilliant politicians because they only narrowly lost in key Electoral Collegestates. But it’s also not clear that these races really had any business being close to begin with. Consider the following:Indeed, after Georgia, Republicans’ track record in the three general elections (2016, 2018, 2020) plus the various runoffs andspecial elections that took place under Trump nowstarts to look mediocre:So, it hasn’t been a terrible time to be a Republican running for office, but it hasn’t been a good one, either. Typically, a party would be looking to move beyond a one-term president who had cost his party control of both houses of Congress. Actually, that’s being kind: Typically, a party wants nothing to do with a losing presidential candidate. When it comes to Trump, though, that calculation isn’t necessarilysosimple because of his tendency to punish his intraparty adversaries: Republicans who tried to cross him,such as former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, weresometimes forced to retire rather than face the president’s wrath in a primary. Yet the GOP has done especially poorly in Trump-era electionswithoutTrump on the ballot, too. Republicanslost the popular vote for the U. S. House by 8.6 points in 2018without the president on the ticket. And whilesome Republicans are blaming Trump for their losses in Georgia, the fact is that Perdue won the plurality of votes in November with Trump on the ballot but lost to Ossoff without him. Tuesday’s loss came primarily because of lower turnout, especially in red, rural counties where Trump can bring voters to the polls. Tostep back a bit, thesuccess of an electoralstrategy basically comes down to four dimensions:In Trump-era elections, Republicans have tended to do well along two of these dimensions and poorly along the other two. Namely, Trump gets very high turnout from his base. What’s just as important, rural white voters who are the core of that base have far more power in the Electoral College and U. S. Senatethan their raw numbers would imply, making their coalition electorally efficient. Hence, theirstrategy has performed well along dimensions No. 1 and No. 4. Conversely, Trump isextremelymotivatingin turning out many parts of the Democratic base (dimension No. 2). And he’s a big turn-off toswing voters, or at least he’s proven to be after four years in office (dimension No. 3). After narrowly beating Clinton among independent voters in 2016, Trump lost them to Biden by13 points in November. Swing voters also haven’t been very happy with the GOP with or without Trump on the ballot: They backed Democratic candidates for the U. S. House by12 points in 2018. Republicans have had especially big problems withsuburbanswing voters, including in places that were once GOPstrongholds. We’ll have to wait andsee, but the violence at the Capitol last week may only exacerbate the GOP’s problems on dimensions No. 2 and No. 3. In thefewpollsconductedsince,solid majorities of Americans overall, including almost all Democrats and a majority of independents,said thestorming of the Capitol represented a threat to democracy. Similarshares of Democrats and independentssaid Trump and congressional Republicans bore at leastsome blame. Republicans are in a fairly precarious position. At best, they are often fighting to a draw, and one that would often be a losingstrategy without thestructural advantages built into thesystem for rural voters. And if Republicans don’t getspectacular turnout from their base, everything else potentiallystarts to crumble. Even a modest decline in turnout from people who are pro-#MAGA but not necessarily part of the traditional Republican base can leave the GOP in a losing position. Nor do Republicans have anysort of obvious role model for how to achieve consistent electoralsuccess. The previous Republican president, George W. Bush,saw hissecond term in office end with landslides against Republicans in 2006 and 2008. Aseries of recent presidential nominees associated with the party establishment (Mitt Romney, John McCain, Bob Dole) all lost their elections, meanwhile. You really have to go back to Ronald Reagan for an example of an unambiguously broad andsuccessful Republican electoral coalition, and that was a generation ago. Republicans who cast their first votes for Reagan at age 18 in 1984 will be 58 years old in 2024. This doesn’t mean Republicans are helpless, by any means. Under McConnell and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, their congressional agenda has also been largely unpopular. If you’reconsistently pushing positions that a majority of the public opposes, you’re liable to pay a price for it. Republicans’structural advantages (especially in the Senate), and Trump’s ability to drive turnout in the places where thosestructural advantages matter,served as cover for ami norit arian agenda. For all thatsaid, the tendency of the opposition party to regain ground at the midterms is verystrong. One would not want to bet that much against the GOP winning back one or both houses of Congress in 2022. (The House, where Republicansshould pick upsomeseats from redistricting, might actually be the better bet than the Senate, whereDemocrats have a relatively favorable map.)After last week, though, I’m notsure I’d want to place a lot of money on the GOP in 2022, either. If the Georgia runoffsserved as a quasi-midterm, they mightsuggest that the GOP can’t count on thesort of gains that a party typically wins in midterms. As in the primaries leading up to 2010, the GOP is likely to havesome vicious intraparty fights, possibly leading it to nominatesuboptimal candidates insome races. And with the violence last week and Republican efforts to contest the Electoral College outcome in Congress, Democrats may be very motivated again in 2022, feeling — not unreasonably — as though democracy itself may be on the line.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight

State representative Gary Eisen (R-St. Clair) has been yanked from his committee assignments by Republicanstate house leadership after going public about the plan andsaying that violence could come as a result of the fallout from Republican lawmakers doing the right thing.“No. I don’t know. Because what we’re doing today is uncharted. It hasn’t been done. And it’s not me who’s doing it…it’s the Michigan Republican Party,” Eisensaid about the possibility of violence in the Capitol. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarkville) hasshut down the Capitol, using COVID-19 and the potential of violence as an excuse. Eisen believes that this is abdicating the duty of the legislature and another example of extreme cowardice by Republican leadership.“So they’re going to lock us out of our offices, they’re going to lock us out of the Capitol,” Eisensaid.“How convenient is that, when they’re going tosit electors today,so that we can’tsupport our options. Whether it was true or not, we don’t know,” he added. House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R-Levering) is receiving the blame from grassroots activists in Michigan who are enraged by this betrayal:’s office has made it abundantly clear that they intend to go along with the votesteal and plan to help Michigan Democrats get away with their illicit electoral heist.“Thespeakers position has not changed. Michigan will follow the law and allocate thestate’s electors to the candidate who won the most votes,” Chatfieldspokesman Giden D’Assandrosaid. Chatfield released astatement of unconditionalsurrender to Democrats earlier today: League Politicsreportedon how it was a top Republican attorney in thestate house who voted to certify the dubious vote in Michigan last month even before the many voter fraud whistle blowers couldshare their testimony at the hearing:Earlier this week, Big League Politicsreportedon the cowardly Republicans on thestate board of canvassers whosigned off on a dubious vote even after dozens of conservative whistle blowers have come forth detailing a third-world gangster votesteal operation that occurred in the city of Detroit. One Republican on thestate board of canvassers, Norm Shinkle abstained from the vote, being too weak to actually oppose electoral impropriety. The other Republican on thestate board of canvassers, Aaron Van Langevelde, actually voted with the Democrats to certify election results marred with improprieties and abnormalities.“We have a clear legal duty to certify the results of the election, asshown by the returns that were given to us,” Van Langeveldesaid. “We cannot andshould not go beyond that. As John Adams oncesaid, ‘We are a government of laws, not men.’”“This board needs to adhere to that principle and do its part to uphold the rule of law here today. This board must uphold the law and comply with our legal duty to certify this election,” he added. Van Langeveldereceived a great deal ofsupport from the liberal media. He also received the backing of the House Republican leadership in thestate,who will keep him employed in his cushy role with the party for going along with the façade.“Aaron has been a very valued member of this team and will continue to be nextsession,”said Republican Speaker-elect Jason Wentworth of Farwell. Republican House Speaker Lee Chatfield of Clarklake praised Van Langevelde’s betrayal as a great example of “America at work.”“As we have beensaying consistently for weeks, the Legislature will uphold the law and respect this result as it works to improve the process for next time,” Chatfieldsaid. Van Langevelde works as a policy adviser and deputy legal counsel for the Michigan House Republican Policy Office. He was effectively carrying out policy from his GOP establishment masters when he joined Democrats to betray his oath of office earlier this week. It has never been easier tosee who the RINOs and traitors are than ever before, and the Michigan Republican Partyseems to be chocked full of them. Share:",0,0,Big League Politics

I have that exact combination of distractibility and lack ofspatial awareness that makessomeone a complete disaster on the road. I try to drive carefully, but Texas highways are a demolition derby, and it’s hard not to get carried away. Andso, given how many times I likely have been pulled over, and wasn’t, I probably had no real reason to feel affronted that day when a cop flagged me down a little outside San Antonio. Istill managed to muster asense of righteous indignation, because on this particular occasion, I was barely goingseven miles above thespeed limit. The cop pointed out that I wasspeeding, and I gave him a faintly incredulous look. People regularly did 90mph on thisstretch of highway, and we both knew it. The cop wrote me a ticket with no dollar amount. “How much is it, though?” I asked., the cop told me,you have to call the phone number listed on the back. I dragged myself home, posted the ticket on my fridge, and forgot about it until a week before the payment was due. That I would eat the cost of the ticket, rather than fighting it out in court, was a foregone conclusion. I told myself that this was because of my overweening pride and haughtiness, refusing to prostrate myself before The Man, and not because I’m lazy, impatient, and intermittently terrified ofstrangers. Nonetheless, I wasstill prettyshocked when I called the number as instructed, and a voice on the phone told me that I owed the city of Von Ormy a whopping $430 dollars. “I wasseven miles above thespeed limit!” I exclaimed. Yes, and that was $230, the voice told me patiently, plus an extra $200 for an expired registration. Still on the phone, I angrily goog led Von Ormy and immediately found a number of news articles dubbing it a “libertarian experiment,” where residents aren’t charged taxes and which, consequently,seems to be in a constantstate of economic freefall. That certainly explained why they have traffic copsstationed right on the part of the highway where thespeed limit changes from 75 to 70, looking for passing cars toshake down. I asked if I could pay the ticket online, and was told no—the only way to pay was by money order. One day before the deadline, I called the court in Von Ormy to confirm that they received the money order I’d mailed them. “Where did you mail it to?” the voice on the phone asked me. “The courthouse,” Isaid. The voice told me, pityingly, that Ishouldn’t have mailed it to the courthouse. I wassupposed to mail it to a mysterious P. O. box, obviously. At this point, it fully dawned on me that a money order is not like a check, where the funds won’t be drawn if they don’t reach their intended recipient—I had basically justsent a $430 wad of cash off intosome kind of postal abyss. And now the deadline for paying by mail had passed, the voice on the phone told me,so I would have to comesettle my ticket in person. Isaidsomething incoherent about how libertarianism was literally highway robbery, and hung up. In the end, I got my ticket paid, leapfrogging an entire roomful of fellow-miscreants at the courthouse who were all anxiously waiting to try to bargain down their tickets with the prosecutor. My ability to circumvent thatspecific, time-consuming part of the process was purely a privilege of wealth: I had enough money in my bank account to cover thesticker price of the ticket, notwithstanding my earlier fuck-up with the money order, andso I bought my way out of the room as quickly as possible. This anecdote, apart from being a classicshowpiece of my unremitting administrative incompetence, is, I think, a pretty good example of how we mortals usually interface with bureaucracies, both the government and private bureaucracies which exercise control over important parts of our lives. Bureaucratic processes have lots of rules;some of those rules are unwritten;some are written down, but not consistently followed;some are written down, but not in a place you have access to; random officials determine which rules will be invoked at which times; and, usually, there are aseries of escape-valves where, if you have enough money, you can just bribe yourself out of the remaining hassle. Bureaucracy, of course, looks very different when viewed from the perspective of those who govern (or those whosympathize with those who govern), as opposed to those who are governed. For politicalscientists, bureaucracy is a normal and unavoidable feature of largestates. No executive cansingle-handedly administrate a large polity, andso the development ofsystematized decision-making procedures that can be delegated downwards is the inevitable outcome. (That bureaucraticsystems would develop within private enterprisesseems even lesssurprising,since there’s no pretense of drawing authority from any kind of public mandate.) And in many polities present and historical—from imperial China to the Carolingian Empire to 19th-century Britain—bureaucracies have been imagined as a meritocratic alternative to pure nepotism, the idea being that individuals withoutsignificant wealth or family power could enter a bureaucraticsystem and advance within it, basedsolely on talent. In the United States, where our political consciousness is mostly limited to elections, and few of us have any cognizance of how bureaucrats are chosen and elevated, this rosy view of bureaucracy isn’t nearly as widely-held, butsome recent media has romanticized bureaucrats and civilservants. Think of, dramatizing the behind-the-scenes labors of White House administrators, orParks and Recreation, where main character Leslie Knope is presented as the quintessential virtuous bureaucrat: eccentrically delighted by regulations and procedures, tirelessly hard-working, and ambitious in theservice of the public good. Bureaucrats are, in theseshows, imagined to be the epitome of responsible, effective governance,separate from and more high-minded than the rat-race of electoral politics. This, however, is a vision of bureaucracy from the perspective of bureaucrats themselves. The vision of bureaucracy from the perspective of those who are of bureaucracy issimply: paperwork. There is a thing I need, and I cannot get it unless I fill out a million incomprehensible forms. There issomething I have done wrong, in the eyes of thestate, and in order to correct it, I must perform aseries of bizarre tasks, like a rat in an experiment. Miniscule irregularities in my compliance with these administrative rituals confer immense power on the bureaucrat tasked with evaluating me:such an error gives that bureaucrat untrammeled license to reject my request if theyso choose. If the fictional face of the bureaucrat is Leslie Knope, the fictional face of the bureaucraticsubject is Josef K., the protagonist of Kafka’sThe Trial, who finds himself trapped between a nebulous court and ashadowy Committee of Affairs as hestruggles to navigatesomething he knows only as “the process.”My most nightmarish encounters with bureaucraticsystems, unsurprisingly, have occurred in connection with my work as an immigration lawyer. When people think about why our immigrationsystem is bad, they often think about armed patrolmen at the border, prison guards at detention centers, ICE agents conducting workplace raids, etc. But our immigrationsystem is also, at its core, an extremely large and intricate bureaucracy, and many of the bad decisions that affect people’s lives within thissystem are not made by,say, racist immigration cops going rogue in the field, but by immigration bureaucrats calmly reviewing paperwork in an office. It’s hard to convey the extent to which the rules of thissystem are deliberatelyset up to ensure that are unable to follow the law, no matter how hard they try. This, in turn, then gives the government handy anecdotes andstatistics to trot out in order tosuggest that immigrants, much like Josef K., are not Complying With The Process. Let me give you an example of a problem that I encounter frequently. I work primarily with immigrant mothers and children who are imprisoned at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas. One of the ways that moms and kids end up in that detention center is because they were picked up by ICE for having an order of deportation that was entered against them automatically when they failed toshow up for theirscheduled hearing in immigration court. Now, you might wellsuspect that people who miss their immigration court hearings areskipping them, knowing that our courtsystem is incredibly hostile, and fearing that they’ll lose their case. I certainly wouldn’t blame any immigrant for doing this,since it’s exactly what I would do in theirshoes, without hesitation. However, this is not why the vast majority of the families I’ve worked with have missed their hearings. In fact, the #1 reason that people miss their hearings is because they never knew they had a hearing. How do I know that these families are telling the truth? Because most of them were arrested at their required check-ins with ICE, to which they continued to faithfully report even after their deportation orders had been entered. Why the hell would you keep attending yourscheduled meetings with immigration officials if your intention was to go into hiding?In fact, thestory I hear from these families detained at their check-ins is almost always thesame: “I did everything I wassupposed to do. I checked my mail every day. I went to all my meetings with immigration. I answered all of immigration’s phone calls. I always complied with the law. I don’t understand why my children and I were arrested.” When I would dig further into their history, I would usually find out that the family, atsome point, moved to a different address than the one they registered with immigration when they arrived in the United States. They had, of course, dutifully informed ICE of their new address at their check-in, and an ICE officer had written it down on an official-looking form right there in front of them, and the family had believed, quite reasonably, that they hadsuccessfully updated their address with “the government.” Little did they know, of course, that “immigration” (a.k.a. ICE) is housed under a completely different department than the immigrationsystem, which is responsible for mailing their hearing notices. To change their address with thecourt,there is a completely different piece of paper they have to fill out and mail toseveralspecific locations within five days of relocating. ICE, with whom these families meet every month, doesn’t give ashit whether the families get their hearing notice at the correct address,so they don’t go out of their way to let the families know that there are additionalsteps they need to take. Andso then, of course, the familyshows up at theirscheduled check-in one day, never having known that they even h ada court hearingscheduled, only for immigration to gleefully inform the family that they’ve lost their case and take them into custody. (Other times, the family’s registered address is entirely up-to-date, and the government just fucks upsending the notice in the mail—this happens withsome frequency, too.)So let’ssuppose you’ve missed your hearing in immigration court, and you’ve automatically been issued an order of deportation—what can you do next? Many immigrants in thissituation, I assume,simply get carted off and deported without fanfare, because most detention centers are remote and it’s hard to get legalservices. If you happen to be detained at a center where there are lawyers on hand to help you, you could perhaps get assistance in filing aspecial motion to reopen your case with the immigration court. Courts are generally prettystingy about granting these, but if you were prevented from attending your hearing for reasons that a particular judge views assufficiently credible and legally compelling, they might decide to give you another chance. Now, you might think: okay,sure, a very poor, recently-arrived, non-English-speaking family can’t reasonably be expected to navigate the immigration bureaucracy on their own. But if a were right there, guiding them through eachstep of the process,surely everything would go fine! Well, notso much. We’ll leave aside thesubstance of the lawyer’s arguments, and how absurd the judge’s ultimate decision can be: I’ve had motions to reopen denied for families who were literally kidnapped by drug cartelson the date of theirscheduled hearing. Let’s just focus on the bureaucratic considerations: can the lawyer even manage to get the damn motion filed in the right immigration court? When an immigrant you’re trying to help has beenshipped to a detention center for processing prior to deportation, there’s a very good chance that the court in which their proceedings took place is located clear on the otherside of the country, and also that you’re looking at asame-day window of time to get the documents filed with thatspecific court before your client is put on a plane. Can you file documents electronically with an immigration court, in This Year Of Our Lord 2020? OBVIOUSLY FUCKING NOT. You need to file in hard copy, which means either mailing the thing overnight—very expensive, and possibly not fast enough—or finding an actual human in the city where the court is located, who can drop everything they’re doing and run to deliver documents for you. Okay, let’ssuppose you manage to findsomeone who’s available to file the motionEverything depends on the government clerk at the court filing window. The clerk can choose to accept your filing—thus temporarily pausing the immigrant’s deportation, and possibly giving you a chance to reverse their deportation order (which again, I can’tstress enough, was probably entered against them forth e most bullshit reasons imaginable)—or reject your filing, thus ensuring their immediate removal. A lot is riding on this decision! Surely, a clerk wouldn’t reject a filing forsome reason that makes no goddamnsense!Reader: theywould. I’veseen clerks reject emergency filings because they didn’t contain “wet” inksignatures, when, again, the person was detained thousands of miles from the court and couldn’t have transmitted an originalsignature to the court in time with anything other than actual wizardry. I’veseen clerks reject filings because they weren’t hole-punched at the top, when a hole-punch wassitting right at the clerk’s elbow at the moment of the rejection. I’ve endured agonizing phone calls with clerks who rejected filings for reasons they were entirely unable to explain, or who pretended to accept filings at the window and then quietly rejected them later without telling anyone. The consequences for these administrative decisions can be huge. We are talking about people getting deported because the government never told them they had a hearing, imprisoned themso far from the courthouse that they couldn’tsend their documents in time, and rejected the documents thatstrangers rushed to file on their behalf. Lots of individual actors within thesystem had to make lots of little decisions, based on mysterious rules, for this insane result to be possible. What kind of a person becomes a bureaucrat? Honestly, part of the reason that I dislike bureaucratsso intensely, I think, is because I have certain personality traits in common with them. I prefer rote, repetitive, predictable work-tasks to complicated, highly context-dependent work-tasks. I don’t really like having direct authority over others, nor do I enjoysubjecting myself to the personal whims of an individual boss,so making decisions independently but based off a tree,so tospeak, is comfortable for me. I’d like to have a job that I didn’t have to think about very hard, where I felt like my responsibilities were pretty clear-cut, and where my mind would be freed up for my own imaginative and creative pursuits. In the rightsetting, I would probably be a reasonably contented pencil-pusher. I also havesome of the characteristic flaws of bureaucrats. Whensomeone asks me a question I don’t know how to answer, or wantssomething from me that I don’t know how to give them, I have a tendency to bluster,shut down, or try whatever else I can to prod the problem away from me. When I was in highschool, I worked as a cashier at a toystore, and I dimly recall that there were many times where I couldn’t figure out how to findsome item, and Isort of just… played dumb until the customer gave up. Those were lowstakes, of course: other than a modicum of lost revenue for my employers, and I don’t know, the tears of disappointed children, there were no negative consequences. There aresome bureaucracies that are like this, too, where the work is low-stakes, and incompetence and lack of problem-solving initiative has limited consequences (or itseems that way, because the consequences are attenuated or invisible). Then there are other kinds of bureaucracies, where the bureaucrats who work within them are constantly exposed to thesuffering, despair, pain, and anger of the people who aresubject to these bureaucracies. I think Isharesome of the flaws of these bureaucrats, too. I know how it is to feel like thesystem you’re working in is monstrously large, and your hands are tied; to feel irrationally angry atsuffering people, who presume to think you have the power to dosomething for them when yousimply don’t; how it feels when a person becomes a problem for you, and you want the problem to go away, and you experience a certain psychological relief when that happens, regardless of whether it went away because yousolved it, or because you failed tosolve it,so long as you don’t have to hear about it again. I know all these feelings intimately, and I think they’re evidence that these kinds of rule-governedsystems warp the minds and empathetic faculties of the people who are forced into contact with them. Of course, it’s hard to get around the need to havesomething a bureaucracy in many areas of life. After all, if our goal is to havesomething approaching a world where resources are justly apportioned, that entailssomesort ofsystem for tracking how many resources are going where, and what uses they’ll be put to. Misuse of resources, whether from human error or calculated graft, feels inevitable if there are nosystems for tracking what’s going where. Keeping things efficient is impossible withoutset procedures onset issues that lower-level functionaries of thesystem can implement without needing to do a complicated moral and logistical calculus everysingle time. “Efficiency” is, of course, an overused term, and valueless when it describes—as itso often does—means without reference to ends. But a healthcaresystem, a food distributionsystem, asewagesystem, or any other complexsystem that carries life and death consequences for those who rely on it, ought to be efficient. A multitude ofsmall calculations must be made insuch asystem, and it’s hard to imagine how anything like direct democracy could accomplish it, or how you’d get around the need to have decisions made primarily by people with expertise in thesubject area. Andso I am not quite proposing that the whole notion of bureaucracy—in thesense ofsystems whose day-to-day functioning is largely determined by procedures—should or could be eliminated in their entirety. But I think there are a few things that need to be considered when it comes to bureaucracies. One is that no bureaucraciesshould exist that are not absolutely necessary. To me, the immigration bureaucracy is—notshockingly—a prime example of a bureaucracy that has absolutely no justifying purpose andshould be ripped up by the roots and replaced with precisely nothing. There is no good reason to be tracking and evaluating and fining and imprisoning and exiling asubset of the population that happens to be living in a different place than the one where they were born. Many bureaucracies are merely fronts for resource extraction (such as the DMV and traffic courts) or data-mining and publicsurveillance (such as the NSA), and could be eliminated with no ill effects, and many benefits. But other bureaucracies are harder to imagine away. For example, even if you get rid of the healthbureaucracy,some kind of healthcare bureaucracy must necessarily exist,since a healthcaresystem must involve extensive decisions about and tracking of the diversion of critical resources, lest we run out ofsomething we need. So what about necessary bureaucracies—what do we do with them? Firstly, itseems important that any bureaucracy that retains asignificant level of powershould have its officials directly elected by the people whom the bureaucracy exists toserve. The president’s ability, for example, to wield direct power through opaque executive agencies is one of the chief reasons why our nominally democratic government is foreverspiraling into various forms of executive tyranny. Sure, there’s aslight check in the form of congressional approval for the heads of agencies, but presidents, including Trump, have gotten around this requirement without much trouble. Bureaucratsshould not be allowed to be invisible. Any person who holdssignificant powershould have direct accountability to—which effectively meanssome direct mechanism for removability by—the people whose lives are affected by their decisions. Secondly, interjecting more direct public participation into bureaucracies that theoreticallyserve public interests is probably the only means of ensuring that thesesystems remain remotely intelligible and functional. Tools like public referenda, for example, could be required to endorsesignificant policyshifts within bureaucracies, and help ensure that their functions are optimally useful to the public, not optimally useful to unseen administrators. The reality is that it is unwise tosimply trust bureaucrats, as it’s unwise tosimply trust anyone with unaccountable power. While civic-minded, virtuous bureaucrats dosometimes exist in real life, they are not the norm, and are more often characterized by their willingness to bend or break procedural rules than their commitment to following them. (Think of Chiune Sugihara or Raoul Wallenberg, diplomats during World War II who, at personal and professional risk, issued thousands of unorthodox travel documents to European Jewsso that they could escape transportation to concentration camps.) Most bureaucrats you encounter in day-to-day life obey the rules, and they are awful. When right-wingers invoke thespecter of Big Government Bureaucrats Coming Between You and Your Doctor (or Children, Guns, Soda, etc.), their rhetoric is frequently effective, and that’s because it reminds people of their actual, painful interactions with bureaucracies.

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) on Sunday accused the Biden administration of violating the First Amendment in its push forsocial media companies to do more to combat false claims about theshot, joining other conservatives who haveseized on the Biden administration’s recent offensive against coronavirus vaccine misinformation in their crusade against big tech.

(Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Speaking during an appearance on“Sunday Morning Futures,” Cruz labeled the White House’s push for a crackdown on vaccine misinformation a “clear” indicator of “their willingness to trample on freespeech, to trample on the Constitution.”The Texas Republican argued the efforts to boost vaccine uptake—including increased public pressure onsocial mediasites and the “flagging” of problematic posts—amount to evidence of government censorship as hesaid the Biden administration is using the companies as a “tool.”He evensuggested White House Press Secretary Jen Psakishould be on former President Donald Trump’s payroll because of how much her media briefings about the vaccine misinformation crackdown “strengthened” Trump’s long-shot lawsuit against big tech, which he has accused of censorship from his removal from the platforms.“It makes clear that everything we thought about the Biden administration—about their willingness to trample on freespeech, to trample on the Constitution, to use government power tosilence you—everything we feared they might do, they are doing and worse,” Cruzsaid. “I think President Trump’s lawsuit got much, muchstronger this week.”The federal government took a new and energized aim at vaccine disinformation this week after U. S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy released his first health advisory deeming it an“urgent threat.”“Simply put: health misinformation has cost us lives,”said the top doctor. Psaki then prompted backlash amongsome conservatives whenshesaid at a Thursday press conference the administration is coordinating withsocial media companies to combat false health information. She notedsenior White Housestaff and members of the Covid-19 task force were in “regular touch” with Facebook and other companies. But when asked by Fox News whether this amounts to “spying” on Americans’social media usage, Psaki deemed this a “loaded and inaccurate question.”“Our biggest concern, and frankly I thinkshould be your biggest concern, is the number of people who are dying around the country because they are getting misinformation that is leading them to not take a vaccine,” Psakisaid.“Trump Sues Facebook’s Zuckerberg, Twitter’s Dorsey, Google’s Pichai In Class Action Lawsuits”(Forbes)“Misinformation: The White House And Jen Psaki Didn’t Actually Call For Censorship Of Social Media”(Forbes)Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",2,1,Forbes
310,Joe Biden Will Face a Much-Changed and Skeptical World,-14.0,39.67,https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/gary-grappo-joe-biden-foreign-policy-objectives-china-iran-climate-change-us-politics-news-99089/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,21,"Joe Biden was not elected for his positions on foreign policy and nationalsecurity. Few US presidential candidates are. In his debates with outgoing President Donald Trump prior to the election, those issues were hardly discussed. So, thesuccess or failure of the Biden presidency will not be determined by foreign policy. For President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, domestic policy will dominate their time and efforts. Overcoming the coronavirus pandemic, ensuring that newly released vaccines are quickly and effectively administered, and righting astillstressed US economy will be their top priorities in the first year. It is what the American people want and expect. Furthermore, there is America’s worsening and more pernicious longer-term problems: increasing economic inequality, continuing racial injustice and growing political polarization. These will be profoundly difficult problems to addresssuccessfully, especially as President Biden could face a US Senate controlled by the Republican Party and a thinner Democratic Party majority in the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, after four years of an unprecedentedly destructive foreign policy andsimply by virtue of the fact he will leadstill the world’s most powerful and wealthiest nation, Joe Biden cannot ignore foreign policy. In fact, amidst his formidable domestic challenges, he must confrontserious foreign policy challenges vital to America’s interests and to those of its many friends and allies around the world. We may already have caught a glimpse of how different Joe Biden’s foreign policy will be from Donald Trump’s, considering the first officials named to hissenior foreign policy team: Antony Blinken assecretary ofstate, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as US ambassador to the UN with cabinet rank, Jake Sullivan as nationalsecurity adviser, Avril Haines as director of National Intelligence and Katherine Tai as the US trade representative. They are all highly experienced, proven, knowledgeable, principled and committed publicservants. Under President Trump, wesaw few of those and many moreself-interested,self-promoting political hacks and ideologues. One of the first jobs Biden must tackle is America’s badly damaged reputation around the world. Donald Trump undermined critical alliances, pointlessly insulted and demeaned allies, abandoned international agreements and institutions, embraced autocrats and dictators from Russia to North Korea, discarded traditional free trade principles and turned America’s back on core values of human rights, democracy and rule of law. Inshort, it was aside of America no one had everseen, certainly not in the history of the modern presidency. Most profoundly, it raised the question: Who is America?Joe Biden must try to answer that question, and not just with the eloquent prose of President Barack Obama, under whom heserved as vice president. The world expects and will demand tosee concrete action, preferably guided bysome overarching policy that canshow to the world that the United States canstill play — and indeed, must play — a leadership role again on the globalstage. There aresome decisions that Joe Biden has indicated he will make right out of thestarting block when he takes office on January 20. He will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization. Those are relatively easy andstraightforward but also very necessary. He is also likely to make clear in his inauguration address that America will return to be the leading voice for democracy, human rights and rule of law in the world,starting first at home but also unafraid tospeak in their defense abroad. Then begins the hard part. One priority he has made clear that his administration will take on immediately is reaffirming American membership in and commitment to its alliances and critical partnerships. These constitute America’s competitive advantage in global affairs and remain the heart of itsstill formidablesoft power in the world. After Trump’s destructive practices, Biden will have to appeal to America’s allies in Europe, e.g., NATO and the EU, and in Asia and the Pacific, like Japan, South Korea, Australia and others. And he’ll have to do it with humility, understanding that under his predecessor, Americaseemingly abandoned principles that had previously united them all. China will be Joe Biden’s biggest challenge. On trade, defense, the South China Sea, Taiwan, cybersecurity, human rights and global leadership, China presents a daunting challenge. Weshould expect his administration to drive a hard bargain with Beijing but to use a very different approach than his predecessor. Pursuedsmartly, however, he may besurprised by the inherent advantages Americastill holds. For example, fortifying the alliances and partnerships as previously mentioned will aid his administration in addressing the China challenge. In fact, if he is tosucceed on this account, he will need those allies and partners with him at the negotiating table. Another advantage: He will likely have bipartisansupport in an otherwise partisan Congress for taking astrong position on China. Trade is the clearest area where the US can capitalize on its extensive network of allies. China’s most important trading relationships — those with the EU and the East Asian nations — also happen to be America’s closest allies. The most effective approach will be one that joins their efforts with the administration to address China’s aggressive and predatory trade practices. Those range from intellectual property theft to intimidation and threats against foreign businesses to coopting confidential and proprietary techniques, practices and technology. But this approach works only if the new administration can establish that it can be trusted again, and not only on trade. If the US cansucceed in its trade negotiations with China, it opens opportunities on other fronts. The objective must be clear: The US isn’t interested instanding in China’s way as it progresses tosuperpowerstatus. However, China must understand that it must doso within an international community governed by collaborativelyset rules. Climate and global health are two other priority issues for Biden. He has indicated he will want not only to reestablish America’s commitment to them but also to take the lead. Rejoining the Paris accords won’t be enough. The US must marshal a critical mass of other nations in joining a reinvigorated effort to go beyond the mandates of Paris. In that, he’s likely to garnersupport from the EU and other developed nations. Appointing former Secretary of State John Kerry as hisspecial envoy on climate change demonstrates Biden’sseriousness about the issue and the intention to take a much-needed lead role on this global existential challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic raging at home makes it imperative that President-elect Biden make global healthsecurity a clear foreign policy priority. If there is one thing Americans have learned from the novel coronavirus, it’s that there is no greater threat to America’s nationalsecurity and economic prosperity than another pandemic, especially one perhaps more catastrophic than COVID-19. If America is to be better prepared for the next pandemic,so must be the rest of the world. As he did for climate, Biden may even wish to name aspecial envoy for global health to begin galvanizing America’s efforts and those of the rest of the world to prepare and coordinate global initiatives for preventing, containing and treating the next pandemic. Climate and global health present the Biden administration with just thesort of challenge-cum-opportunity to which America was known to rise in the past. They are issues on which it is uniquely positioned to lead by virtue of its power,size, wealth and technological prowess. To reassume the mantle of global leadership, President-elect Biden must lead the global effort to combat climate change andstrengthen the international community’s capacity to address pandemics. Unlike for the US administrations dating back to Jimmy Carter, the Middle East will not be a top-five priority in 2021. Americans have lost their appetite for inserting themselves into problems that the region’s residents cannot or will not work to resolve themselves. Biden and his foreign policy team recognize this, even as they know they can’t turn their backs on this dangerously volatile region. But there remains one exception. Iran is a grave problem, perhaps less for the US than for Washington’s allies in the Middle East, most especially Israel and Saudi Arabia. It also constitutes a major challenge to America’s traditionally unflinchingsupport for the Nonproliferation Treaty. Nothing could be more destabilizing in that region than the introduction of nuclear weapons. It will require almost immediate attention from President Biden. The Trump administration’s policy of “maximum pressure” via its punishingsanctions has indeed inflicted enormous economic pain on Iran and its people. But it hasn’t changed Tehran’s behavior. Iran today has begun to reconstitute the nuclear program that had been effectively contained under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), negotiated under President Obama in 2015 and then abandoned by Trump in 2018. The purpose of thesanctions cannot be inflicting pain on the Iranian people, who are not responsible for their government’s policies. The objective ofsanctions and an overall policy toward Iran must be to change its behavior. By that measurement, the Trump administration’s pressure campaign has not worked. Iran continues to: develop and build longer-range missiles;support malign behavior through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Shia proxies throughout the region, from Iraq and Yemen to Syria and Lebanon;senselessly threaten Israel; and deny the most basic human rights to its own citizens, most especially women, journalists, perceived political opponents and religious minorities. Whatever trust President Obama and then-Secretary of State Kerry may have been able to build with the Iranians in reaching the JCPOA has been largely destroyed now. So,short of immediately rejoining that agreement, which would be unwise, face-to-face negotiations between Washington and Tehran will not be in the offing for at least one year. In fact, to tackle the Iran question, Biden and Blinken must address the failures of the Obama approach. That will mean: (a) turning to America’s P5+1 partners — the UK, France and Germany — to work out a modus operandi for rejoining the JCPOA whilesimultaneouslysecuring a commitment to negotiate astronger JCPOA version 2.0; (b) consulting regularly and frequently with key regional allies to ensure their concerns and interests are addressed in any follow-on agreement with Tehran; and, most important, (c) including key congressional members in the negotiation process, at least on the Washington end. The last is most vital because the absence of Congressionalsupport was ultimately Barack Obama and the agreement’s downfall. Any new accord negotiated must have thesupport of a majority of the Congress if it is to avoid the fate of the JCPOA, even it isn’tsubmitted for formal approval to the Congress. All of these aresine qua non forsuccessfully addressing the Iranian challenge andsecuring a durablesolution. While the Iran portfolio remains an urgent priority for Joe Biden, it won’t be one resolved in his first year and perhaps not until well into hissecond. His administration and the Congress must understand that the US cannot notsanction, bomb, assassinate or otherwise forcibly compel Iran into complying with its norms for behavior. It will take patient, deliberate and determined diplomacy. These are likely to be President Biden’s top priorities. But they won’t be his only ones. His administration and the US also faceserious challenges from a menacing and malign Russia, an arms control agreement with whom due to expire within weeks of his taking office;still extant terrorism and cy bersecurity threats; a wave of autocrats with a full head ofsteam, from Turkey and Hungary to Venezuela and the Philippines; ill-behaved and irrationally aggressive regional actors vying for preeminence in the Middle East; continuing conflict and humanitarian crises in the Middle East, Africa and the Caucasus and elsewhere. Joe Biden will be the most experienced and knowledgeable president on foreign policysince George H. W. Bush. Assuch, hesurely knows that it is issues like these that cansuddenly rise to crisis proportions and take over his foreign policy or even his presidency. So, they won’t be far from his attention. But a clear-eyed view of what is most important will drive Biden toward those highlighted above. However, there is likely to be a critically important domestic component of the Biden foreign policy agenda. This gets to the Achilles heel of previous administrations’ foreign policies that Donald Trump cleverly exploited. Biden and his administration must be able to convincingly articulate to the American people a foreign policy that they willsee as in their interests. That will mean a policy that protects American jobs, addresses threats to climate and the environment, ensuressecurity and offers a promise of a better future. Crafting a policy that meets these criteria may be Joe Biden’s biggest challenge, especially in view of the historic disconnect between foreign policy and the American people and polarization of the American public exacerbated by four years of Donald Trump. But if this administration is to besuccessful in confronting and capitalizing on America’s many challenges abroad, it must be able toshow that it holds the interests of Americans uppermost — and that theystand behind this policy.

311,Beirut’s challenge: A wealth of volunteers and a deficit of trust,-3.67,47.0,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2020/0812/Beirut-s-challenge-A-wealth-of-volunteers-and-a-deficit-of-trust,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-12,25,"In the early morning hours in the eastern Beirut neighborhood of Gemmayze, hit hard by the mammoth explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital a week ago, hundreds of volunteers are already on thestreets with food parcels and brooms flung over theirshoulders. They are offering help where a widely despised government fears to tread. Perched near a large pile of rubble, an elderly woman watches the volunteers move in and out of buildings to inspect or clean them up; others open boxes and distribute donated food and water. A basic demand of government is that it provide relief in times of calamity. But as Lebanon gets about cleaning up and rebuilding Beirut, who can be counted on to coordinate efforts and efficiently distribute aid?“I can’t explain why I amstill alive, here, talking to you,” Roula, her face etched with both grief and disbelief,says about the blast thatshattered the windows and tore through the walls of her first-floor apartment. Anothersource of wonder? The absence of any officialsupport from a ruling class that many Lebanese blame for corruption and negligence, leaving 2,750 tons of volatile ammonium nitrate at the Beirut port in the heart of the city. Thatstock triggered one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, wrecking largeswaths of the capital, killing at least 171 people, and injuring 6,000.“I cry when I think of all the work the Lebanese people are doing to help one another. Evenstrangers feel like family,”says Roula, who gave only her first name, holding back tears. “But then I think of how the government let this happen. This was a massacre, and the blood is on their hands.”Even if governmentsupport was forthcoming,shesays, “they’re not welcome here.”While Lebanese protesters and analysts alikesay the explosion has brought the crisis-ridden nation to a turning point, they are wondering how the hundreds of millions of dollars in aid that international donors have pledged can besafely funneled to those who need it most, keeping it out of what they consider the predatory claws of a largely corrupt ruling elite.“The question is: How do you distribute the money? How do you prioritize it?” asks Rami Khouri, a professor of journalism and the director of global engagement at the American University of Beirut.“Those decisions cannot be done by the government. You can’t ignore the government either, you can’t de-sovereignize the government,” hesays. “But neither can you allow it to keep doing corrupt work, and not doing its work.”For maximum efficiency, he proposes a consortium that includes “clean” officials, relief agencies, and professionals to ensure the integrity of the cash flow between donors and the NGOs and the United Nations, which will implement the relief work.“A new mechanism has to beset up,”says Professor Khouri. “Donors have to be used as leverage to force the government to get out of the way.”International donors pledged $300 million at a conference Sunday convened by President Emmanuel Macron of France, Lebanon’s former colonial power. Theystipulated that the assistanceshould be “directly delivered to the Lebanese population, with utmost efficiency and transparency.”How that will be achieved is not yet clear, asstreet protests against a corrupt, incompetent, andsectarian ruling class – which first erupted nationwide last October – have reignited in recent days with renewed venom. Demonstrators have rigged up gallows, calling for vengeance insloganssuch as, “Hang the authorities first.”Monday night, the government resigned en masse– thesecond cabinet to be toppled by popular anger in nine months – further complicating any chain of command for relief distribution.“I discovered that thesystem of corruption was bigger than thestate and that thestate is bound by thissystem, and that it is not possible to confront it or get rid of it,”said Prime Minister Hassan Diab, who blamed entrenched interests when announcing his resignation. Analysts and protesters point to thesectarian distribution of power – and thesame top players for decades – as thesource of much of Lebanon’s corruption. Even as protesters have implored donors not to channel funds through the hands ofstate institutions that they deem untrustworthy, thescale of the damage – estimated at as much as $15 billion – will require a coordinated repair effort. For a relativelysmall grassroots relief organization like Shaabemasouleyati (My people, my responsibility), which got itsstart last December assisting families in need during an economic crisis, the pivot to post-explosionsupport has been natural but daunting. The group is one of the many civilsociety organizations that have mobilized thousands of Lebanese citizens to clear debris and restore a minimal degree of normalcy. It has done everything fromsending nurses and paramedics to check up on elderly residents or tend to the injured in the Mar Mikhael neighborhood, to deploying its engineers to conduct preliminary assessments of damaged buildings. Their reports are being logged in a database of damaged houses andstreetsso as tospeed the process of repairs.“The government has not taken responsibility for the explosion, nor for what happened after the explosion,”says founder and director Afif Ayad. Help came “purely because the people were there from every corner of the country,” hesays. Donor funds, he insists,should besent with “utmost transparency and with trusted NGOs actually giving the money to the people in need, [which] would be one bigstep in the right direction.”That view is echoed by Bujar Hoxha, the CARE country director for Lebanon, who notes that a “triple crisis” was already afflicting the Lebanese – economic collapse, political instability, and the coronavirus – even before the explosion.“It’s critical that we agree on an approach and mechanism with other NGOs, in order to have massive funds flow without any doubts and concerns,”says Mr. Hoxha. Since the explosion a number of NGOs havesprung up, includingseveral diaspora groups that have “created a coalition amongst themselves,” raised millions of dollars, and made their own judgments about needs,says Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.“That’s good, at thatscale, but when we are talking about huge money like $300 million, you do need a coherent and cohesive needs assessment, that everyone uses ... and this issomething the government needs to be involved with,”shesays. International and local authorities have the experience of the aftermath of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, Ms. Yahya points out. That 34-day conflict destroyed much ofsouthern Lebanon and Beirut’ssouthernsuburbs. Back then, a multi-donor emergency fund was created, funneling funds through the United Nations, but “there was an excess of funds in de-mining, and far too little funding in [other] vitalsectors,” Ms. His database of damage could “create and build transparency,” a precursor, he hopes, “that leads to thestructure that cansupport millions in aid.”",2,2,Christian Science Monitor

Thirty of those bars or restaurants have been publicly identified because at leastseven people were likely infected in them.""When establishments and customers don't follow the guidance, wesee outbreaks,"" Ehresmannsaid. Inspections will occur in establishments that have been thesubject of complaints, but also in random bars and restaurants as well. Unannounced ""observation-only"" inspections were conducted earlier thissummer by the Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement Division of thestate Department of Public Safety and various law enforcement agencies. The inspections turned up 14 bars and restaurants that committed violations. Most of those violations included employees failing to wear masks (116), followed by failure insocial distancing (63) and excess capacity (30). In the advisory to the hospitality industry this week, thestate commissioners for Public Safety, Health, and Labor and Industry wrote that ""most establishments are following federal andstate guidelines, but it makes it difficult for them to compete or to explain to their customers when other establishments are not in compliance.""Some Republican members of thestate House of Representatives challenged thestepped-up enforcement on a business community that hassuffered economic hardships in the pandemic.""Threats of fines and closure are a departure from previousstatements by the Governor — who hasstated that their goal is 'education' — not to be punitive to businesses who are alreadystruggling as a result of the Walzshutdowns,"" read astatement issued Friday morning by the House Republican Caucus.

316,Texas man who famously waited hours to vote in Democratic primary faces up to 40yrs in prison for illegal voting,-1.0,42.0,https://www.rt.com/usa/528946-famous-texas-voter-arrested/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-11,25,"A man hailed by mainstream media outlets forstanding in line forsix hours to cast his ballot in last year’s Democratic primary has been arrested for voting illegally. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted. Hervis Rogers, 62, was a felon on parole at the time he voted in the November 2018 general election and the March 2020 Democratic primary, according to a two-count indictment by Texas prosecutors. His arrestset off astorm of criticism from the ACLU, anti-incarceration activists, and left-wing pundits, who claimed that it was unjust and racist,since Rogers is black. Having a Democratic voter who went viral for his determination turn out to be a felon voting illegally is rather controversial for a party that has fought against claims of illegalitiessurrounding the 2020 vote. Some have argued that the prosecution of Rogers is another attempt by Republicans to disenfranchise non-white voters.“This is a voter-suppression prosecution, pure andsimple, a poster child for Jim Crow 2.0,”the Texas AFL-CIO union groupsaid.“Unfortunately, it confirms that Texas’shameful legacy of disenfranchisement is alive and well and desperately needs fixing.”""This is a votersuppression prosecution, pure andsimple, a poster child for Jim Crow 2.0. Unfortunately, it confirms that Texas’shameful legacy of disenfranchisement is alive and well and desperately needs fixing.” -@RickTxAFLCIO#txlegeRogers was hailed for waiting in line more thansix hours to vote on Super Tuesday 2020, reportedly casting the last ballot at a Houston pollingsite after 1am local time. National media outletssuch asUSA Todaypicked up thestory, quoting him assaying,“I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion. I wasn’t going to let anythingstop me,so I waited it out.”The local NPR affiliatesaid he voted for Joe Biden. Carla Reed and Hervis Rogers, the last two voters at Texas Southern University. Finally got their ""I voted""stickers. They waitedsix hours, until just after 1am.#TXDecidespic.twitter.com/ngh5gl1nNyTop Democrats,such as SenatorChuck Schumer(New York) and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, also pounced on the incident to argue that the fact Rogers had to waitso long to vote was the result of GOP votersuppression. Unfortunately, it also turned out to be an example of alleged voter fraud. Rogers was convicted of felony burglary in 1989 and 1995. He wassentenced to 25 years in prison in the latter case, then was released in 2004 with his parolescheduled to run to June 2020. That means he wasstill on parole when he voted in 2018 and again in March 2020, according to the indictment. He was jailed last week, with bailset at $100,000. Voting whileserving a felonysentence, including parole, is punishable in Texas by two to 20 years in prison, meaning Rogers could get a 40-year term if convicted and hit with the maximum penalty on each count withsentences running consecutively. The Bail Project, an activist group that campaigns against cash bail, posted bond for Rogers on Saturday,securing his release while awaiting trial. Bail Project founder Robin Steinberg accused Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton of using the indictment as a“targeted message of fear”tosuppress the“turnout of people of color.”The group added that Rogers believed he was eligible to vote. The ACLU, which is aiding Rogers’ legal defense,said the prosecutionshows that“even innocent mistakes in the voting process can be criminalized.”We'reso relieved that Hervis Rogers is no longer in jail. Heshouldn't have been arrested and charged in the first place. We'll keep fighting for him and for our right to vote.pic.twitter.com/1why8H0mnyNicole DeBorde, a legal analyst for CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News, also represents Rogers. Shesaid Rogers completed rehabilitation after“mistakes in his youth,”adding,“This case, for us, is about who we let the government decide to throw out like trash and who we deem worthy of the basic rights to participate in the processes we all hold dear.”Rogers was about 36 at the time of his last conviction. Social media users attacked the Texas AG for charging Hervis. For instance, poll analyst David Rothschild called Paxton a“shockingly bad person”who was“doing bad things to good people toscore cheap political points in your voter-suppression crusade to create permanent white rule in Texas.”Author Megan Kelley Hallsaid Paxton deserves to go to jail, adding, “You arescum. You are a monster and a poor excuse for man. I hope you gosomeplace much hotter than Texas.”You are ashockingly bad person, doing bad things to good people toscore cheap political points in your votersuppression crusade to create permanent white rule in Texas.

You are a monster & a poor excuse for a man. I hope you gosomeplace MUCH hotter than TX. Paxton responded to media coverage critical of the indictment, including a local NPR report, bysaying“Hervis is a felon rightly barred from voting under Texas law … I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it.”Hervis is a felon rightly barred from voting under TX law. This liberal NPR article evensaysso, but buries it: “Rogers voted before his parole wasscheduled to end, he was likely ineligible to cast a ballot on Election Day.”I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it!

Epicport congestion. And aserious lack of truck drivers. The world’s delicatesupply chains are under extremestress. Thesupply chain nightmare is jacking up prices for consumers andslowing the global economic recovery. Unfortunately, Moody’s Analytics warnssupply chain disruptions “will get worse before they get better.”“As the global economic recovery continues to gathersteam, what is increasingly apparent is how it will bestymied bysupply-chain disruptions that are nowshowing up at every corner,” Moody’s wrote in a Monday report. IMFslashes US growth forecast and warns of rising risks to the global economyIndeed, the IMF downgraded its 2021 US growth forecast on Tuesday by one percentage point, the most for any G7 economy. The IMF citedsupply chain disruptions and weakening consumption — which itself has been partially driven bysupply chain bottleneckssuch as a lack of new cars amid the computer chipshortage.“Border controls and mobility restrictions, unavailability of a global vaccine pass, and pent-up demand from beingstuck at home have combined for a perfectstorm where global production will be hampered because deliveries are not made in time, costs and prices will rise and GDP growth worldwide will not be as robust as a result,” Moody’s wrote in the report. Moody’ssaid the “weakest link” may be theshortage of truck drivers — an issue that has contributed to congestion at ports and caused gasstations in the United Kingdom to run dry. Unfortunately, Moody’s warned there are “dark clouds ahead” becauseseveral factors make overcoming thesupply constraints particularly challenging. First, the firm pointed to differences in how countries are fighting Covid, with China aiming for zero cases while the United States is “more willing to live with Covid-19 as an endemic disease.”“This presents aserious challenge to harmonizing the rules and regulations by which transport workers move in and out of ports and hubs around the world,” the analysts wrote. Grocerystoreshelves aren't going back to normal this yearSecondly, Moody’s cited the lack of a “concerted global effort to ensure thesmooth operation” of the worldwide logistics and transportation network. Others are much more optimistic on thesupply chain outlook.

320,"Dr. Lance Dodes warns we aren't rid of Trump yet: He ""will continue to have no conscience""",-20.0,33.67,https://www.salon.com/2021/01/14/dr-lance-dodes-warns-we-arent-rid-of-trump-yet-he-will-continue-to-have-no-conscience/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,25,"Last Wednesday, thousands of Donald Trump's whitesupremacistsupporters, at his de facto command,launched an assault on the U. S. Capitolwith the goal ofstopping Joe Biden from becoming the next president. While investigations are ongoing,some people in the mob may have planned to kidnap or assassinate members of Congress they consider ""traitors,""along with Vice President Mike Pence, who presided over the ceremonial count of the electoral votes. Trump's fascist mob was well equipped for the task, assome of their members were armed with guns and other weapons, and clad in paramilitary gear. Five people have now died during and after the Capitol attack. Dozens more were injured. This Trump-inspired uprising is likely not over and may be in its earlystages. There are credible reports by the FBI and other American law enforcement agencies that right-wing para militaries and other domestic terrorists are planning even more violence across the country in the days leading to Biden's inauguration next week. This attack was not an isolated event: The entire Age of Trump has been typified by right-wing violence. When Trump finally leaves office, the right-wing violence he has enabled and permitted may only get worse. On Wednesday, by a vote of 232 to 197,Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for asecond time, on this occasion for ""incitement of insurrection."" All 222 Democrats (along with 10 Republicans) voted to impeach, while four Republicans abstained. Trump is now the only president to have been impeached twice, and clearly rivals only Andrew Johnson or James Buchanan for theshameful distinction of being the worst president in American history. Instead of being cowed by the violence at the U. S. Capitol and hissecond impeachment, Trump, like other autocrats and fascists, appears even more desperate and emboldened. On Tuesday, during a visit to his ""border wall"" in Texas, Donald Trump warned the Democrats and the American people that there will be consequences — implying more violence by his followers — for his impeachment or removal. Trump then claimed the Democrats were causing the country ""tremendous anger, and division and pain,"" another example ofstochastic terrorism aimed at inciting violence by his political cult members against theirshared ""enemies"". Under pressure from Republican leaders and his remaining White House advisers, DonaldTrump released a video on Wednesday evening in which he ""condemned"" political violence and claimed that his ""truesupporters"" would never engage insuch behavior. This is patently insincere: From the beginning of his 2016 campaign, Trump has encouraged political violence by his followers and other cult members. Moreover,during the assault on the CapitolTrump was reportedly gleeful and excited. Ultimately, the disaster that is Trump's presidency did not need to happen. It was all a choice. Those Americans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 (and in even larger numbers in 2020) are responsible. The Republican Party, which embraced Donald Trump and his vile anti-democracy movement, is responsible. A news media which normalized Trump's fascist and authoritarian whitesupremacist regime are responsible. Those who denied the obvious warnings about Trump's coup attempt — and who mocked or tried tosilence the people who were trying to warn the public — are responsible. Writing at the Atlantic,Tom Nichols locates the disaster of Trump's presidency and America's national peri las a moment comparable to the Cuban missile crisis or the darkest moments of Nixon's presidency:We can't keep hoping for the best or relying on those not in charge to keep Trump in line. Even one day more is too long for him to be in the White House. We escaped disaster over just a few days in 1962 and in the dark of an autumn night in 1973. Peace was kept, in part, by the presence ofsteady professionalssuch as Schlesinger and the Kennedy team, the likes of whom are nowhere to be found in Trump's Washington. We no longer have a margin for error. Asecond impeachment is the only reliablesolution, and itshould take place immediately. The disaster that Nichols describes could have also been prevented if warnings from many leading mental health professionals had been listened to and then acted upon. Since at least 2015, they havesounded the alarm and tried to educate the public about Donald Trump's pathologies, his malignant narcissism and his psychopathic orsociopathic tendencies. Dr. Lance Dodes is onesuch voice. He is a retired assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a training andsupervising analyst emeritus at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute. In our most recent ofseveral conversations, Dodes explains that Trump's coup attempt and other dangerous behavior are a function of the president's obvious mental pathologies, and observes that this disaster was totally and utterly predictable. Dodes warns that Trump believes that he is a godlike figure — and that when that delusion isshattered, Trump will become even more dangerous. At the end of this conversation Dr. Dodes implores the country's leaders to remove Donald Trump as rapidly as possible, noting that if this man were a private citizen he would already be in prison or asecure mental health facilityThis conversation has been edited for clarity and length. I completely agree. Most professionals in mental health have long understood that far from being a buffoon, or the naïve idea that he is ""crazy like a fox,"" he isseverely mentally disturbed. Unfortunately,starting in 2016 the official psychological organizations in this country failed tospeak out. The American Psychiatric Association actually threatened to throw out those of its members who understood the problem and had the courage tospeak up, falsely claiming thatspeaking out would be unethical. Ironically, this meant that they threatened the most ethical and courageous members of the profession. If they had done their ethical duty tosociety it would have given the country a chance tosave itself from the deaths andsuffering of the past four years. Poorly, because many of themsaw Trump is just a buffoon, or believed the psychologically ignorant idea that he is just being clever. As a result they didn't recognize they were dealing with a dangerous and delusional psychopath whose endless lies needed to be openly and vigorously challenged. Many in the media covered his every tweet as if it was true. He was yelling at White House journalistssaying, ""You're fake"" from the beginning of his term and it was years before they objected. The reportersshould havesaid, ""No, Mr. Trump, you cannot talk to the free press that way."" Theyshould have covered his assault on the free press as a majorstory. The media failed to do their job to protect the country. At this very moment he would be in jail for having incited a riot. But the multiple other crimes he's committed over many years would have put him in jail years ago. If he were in any other position his complete incompetence dealing with the pandemic would have led him to be removed from any responsible position regarding the health or welfare of Americans. That's the most valuable part of making a diagnosis. When Trump was first elected, many hopeful peoplesaid, ""He's been horrible, but he'll grow into the job."" The impossibility of that was easy to predict because of his diagnosis. If a few people in my field hadn't incompetently denied his condition, and if the American Psychiatric Association hadn't tried to gag its members, the public could have been made clearly aware of his diagnosis and been in position to far better understand and deal with him and his behavior. This man is fundamentally different from virtually all the people that you've ever known. The pain andsuffering of others mean nothing to him. It's hard to get that across because we allsay, ""He must be like us,"" which is a normal expectation. He is nothing like us. We don't know exactly what's going to happen, but we know that he is going to continue to act on his delusional beliefs and he will continue to have no conscience about what he does to causesuffering to others. Four years ago, wesaid he was going to get worse. And we'restillsaying he can only get worse. The closer and closer he gets to being what he would consider a loser, the more dangerous he becomes. It was horrifying and terrifying tosee the insurrectionists get into the Capitol building, partly because it was obvious that there wassome plot going on; this wasn't just a mob on its own. There was a clear risk of a coupsuccessfully led by Donald Trump. A few years ago, Isaid on MSNBC that among the risks Trump posed were that he wouldstart a nuclear war, but that there were also other risks: that he would try to create an emergency, declare martial law and dissolve Congress. It's never been asecret that Trump wants to be like Putin or Hitler or Stalin or his friend in North Korea. He wants to be asupreme tyrant, and in his mind that's what he is. Anyone who threatens that delusion is his mortal enemy. If he could have taken over via a coup, he would have. Trump is a verysimple person. Hesays outwardly, ""I am being persecuted"" and hesays thesame thing to himself. His beliefs are not affected by reality. It would be asign of greater mental health if Trump were able to become depressed with a loss, because it would mean he has accepted the loss. But as we have repeatedlyseen, he cannot tolerate that reality. When he loses power, rather than becoming depressed, he becomes more delusional. He attributes the problem to persecution by his enemies and mercilessly attacks them. That's what the coup attempt was. I'm proud that the American Psychoanalytic Association became the first andso far only major national psychological organization tosay that Trump must go. I wish thestatement had come out four years ago, but I'm glad they're the first to break away from theself-imposed paralysis of the major psychological organizations. And I hope the country will listen. In an ideal world Trump would be voted out today via the 25th Amendment. If he were not president, he would have already been in jail or contained insomesafe facility.",1,1,Salon
321,"Reopen our schools, start COVID testing now",-0.33,30.67,https://capitolweekly.net/reopen-our-schools-start-covid-testing-now/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,15,"We havespent the past 10 months talking about how to reopenschools. Now is the time to take action. There are less than four months left in the currentschool year and weshould not let the final bell ring before getting kids back into their classrooms. Of course, we cannot andshould notsacrificeschool, teacher orstudentsafety in doingso. And we don’t have to because we have all the necessary tools to reopen campusessooner rather than later. Testing, along withsafety and hygiene protocols, is the key to unlocking ourschools. California has received nearly 12 million of these tests, which perform nearly on par with “goldstandard” PCR tests and provide results in 15 minutes rather than theseveral-day PCR turnaround times. While vaccinating the vast majority of our population will take many months, consistent, rapid, testing programs can helpschools immediately identify and isolate outbreaks tosafely bringstudents back to campus. Early on, the high price and long turnaround times for COVID-19 testing made weekly or twice weekly testing impractical. But the testing landscape has evolved, giving us more options that are cheaper, faster, and — when performed and interpreted correctly — just as accurate and reliable as lab-based tests. The federal government pre-purchased 150 million rapid testing cards, withschools as a primary target for their use. To date, California has received nearly 12 million of these tests, which perform nearly on par with “goldstandard” PCR tests and provide results in 15 minutes rather than theseveral-day PCR turnaround times. Using these cards,schools could run a regular testing program for a few dollars per test – asignificant reduction from the $100 PCR tests. Of course, a testing program does not work without a plan for astreamlined, organized and automated operation that can be launched in days, not weeks. Luckily, we can learn fromsuccessful testing programs run by a growing number ofschools across the nation and in thestate. Withso few weeks left in theschool year, runningsuch programs is affordable and attainable. The impact of distance learning is felt on the entire family unit. Parents and care givers are falling behind at work. The Newsom administration has made considerable headway in eliminating red tape and barriers for on-campus testing, which could allow districts across thestate to initiate frequent testing programs to keep theschool population and familiessafe. There is little dispute that thestatus quo is failing ourstudents. Manystudents are falling behind and home-based learning has only deepened the divide forstudents in our underserved communities. Forstudents in low-income and Internet-deprived households, the achievement gap is growing. This is unacceptable. The impact of distance learning is felt on the entire family unit. Parents and care givers are falling behind at work. Others cannot apply for jobs when theyspend all day troubleshooting connectivity issues, teaching fractions, and tending to the emotional needs of children who have been isolated for the past 10 months. With affordable, reliable testing options available and waiting for use, we need to take action now to implement full-scale, regular testing, with the propersafety precautions.

322,Utah lawmakers continue to debate governor’s emergency powers as coronavirus wears on,6.0,48.0,https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/10/20/utah-lawmakers-continue/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-20,25,"As they continue to face pressure from constituents who want them to end the COVID-19state of emergency, Utah’s lawmakers met again Tuesday to discuss ways to rein in the executive branch’s powers but indicated there’sstill a lack of consensus on how to move forward. Sen. Jake Anderegg, R-Lehi,said he and other lawmakers are working to find compromise on the issue among the House and Senate as well as the governor’s office andstate and local health departments. But without language drafted, hesaid any changes to thestate’s Emergency Management Actlikely won’t come until next year’s general legislativesession.“It may not happen as fast assome people would like, but thesky is not falling; we’re not all going to be dead tomorrow,” Andereggsaid Tuesday during a presentation to the House Economic Development and Workforce Services interim committee. “At least we hope. If we are, we’ve got bigger problems, right?”Several lawmakers have argued over the past few months that the emergency powers granted to the executive branch contemplated 30- to 90-day emergencies— like fires and floods and earthquakes — rather than months long ones like a pandemic. Andereggsaid there’s a desire to preserve the governor’s powers in cases where the executive branch needs to move quickly to respond to a crisis. But hesaid thestate’s Emergency Powers Act is “wholly inadequate” in outlining how thestateshould respond to longer-term challenges.“There’s nothing in the code, zero. There’s absolutely nothing that has anything to do with what a proper response would be policy-wise for a long,sustained emergency,so I do think we need to address this,” hesaid. Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, used the extended analogy of a house fire during his remarks to the committee to highlight when he thinks governmentshould be involved in a crisis and when itshouldstep back. Hesaid that when a blaze first begins, “everyone is on thesame page” about the emergency, from the homeowner to the firefighters to the neighbors and the insurance company that handles the claim.“Now the emergency itself is — I would argue and I think the policyshould capture this — is when everyone’s on thesame page,” hesaid. “Because at that point, the government is the actor. The government in thatsituation is in the primary responsibility to dosomething outside the norm, make an exception.”Once the embers die down and the fire has been extinguished, though, he argued that existing code and processes would besufficient to manage the crisis moving forward.“Can you imagine asituation where the firemen felt like they had tostay on thesite until the house was completely rebuilt? That’s ludicrous,” hesaid. “Or the police? Tostand there at the house to makesure no one is injured at the house? I get it. It would be thesafest thing to do. But that’s ridiculous.”In connecting his analogy to the coronavirus pandemic, McCay noted that thestate’s code already gives the Health Department the power to manage an ongoing public health crisis, including the ability toshut down government buildings andschools, without the need for executive action. The months long debate over emergency powers also includes questions about the proper role of government, as lawmakerssay the Legislatureshould be the one making policy for thestate rather than the governor or the health departments through emergency orders. Not all powershould rest with “some bureaucrat in a local orstate health department,” Andereggsaid. “I think for a prolonged,sustained, longer than 30-day public health crisis response management, we need to havesome checks and balances in place to makesure things don’t go completely off the rails.”Anderegg indicated, however, that he is looking at includingsome provisions in the bill that would deal with the use of emergency powers in case of COVID-19 casespikes. During aseparate committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, lawmakers questioned health department officials about their authority and accountability to the public. During a line of extended questioning, health department leaders acknowledged their broad powers to closeschools and restaurants, issue civil penalties for repeat offenders who don’t follow their public health orders and even potentially to mandate a vaccine to control thespread of a disease. Utah Department of Health Director Richard Saunderssaid the question of “the boundary of control” for health departments is “a very important question we all need to be asking right now.”He and other health department officials whospoke at the Government Operations Interim Committeesaid they have worked in conjunction with elected officials to issue orders and noted that they haven’t heard of any civil penalties or fines associated with coronavirus rules issued by health departments. But Rep. Brady Brammer, who was pressing health department officials for answers to thescope of their authority,said he was concerned their reach had violated thestate’s nondelegation doctrine, “where we have a constitutional provision that we cannot delegate the authority of the Legislature without clarity.”“I think we’re both on thesame page that we really need to be careful on figuring out where those lines are,"" Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove,said to Saunders. During public comment at the meeting on Tuesday,several Utahns echoed those concerns andsaid they felt health departments have broad power to affect people’s lives but little accountability to voters. Brittney Moon, a Santaquin resident,saidshe feels it’s difficult to access public health officials.“I talked to my government officials that you’vesaid havesomesway in this but they can’t void or overturn these decisions and then Isaid, ‘OK well, can we fire these people?’ And theysaid, ‘Yes, but here’s the deal, there’s a board of nine people,’""shesaid. ""So now I have to try to go through nine people to have any effect on this health director. So it’s like they’re two times removed.”Utah has been in astate of emergencysince the day the first coronavirus case was diagnosed in thestate in March. The Legislature in Juneapproved a resolution extending thestate of emergency, though not all lawmakers were insupport of the measure. By August,support for extending the emergency order had declined further and lawmakers declined to doso, leaving it to the governor to reissue his emergency mandates, which he did. Today, Utah is under a “public health order” mandated by the Utah Department of Health and the governor as part of thestate’s newstrategy for addressing the pandemic. That order isslightly different from astate of emergency in that it does not need to be extended by the Legislature but it fulfills asimilar legal purpose as the previous mandates. Whilesome have raised concerns that ending thestate of emergency would lead Utah to lose out on millions in federal dollars available to helpstates weather the coronavirus, Andereggsaid that isn’t the case.“We contacted our legislative research and general counsel and they contacted FEMA, they contactedsocialservices to find out if those monies would be in jeopardy and the answer was an unequivocal 'no’ it would not be in jeopardy,” hesaid. Opponents of the governor’s emergency declarations had an opportunity during aspecialsession in April to pass legislation curbing his power. ButHB3009, which would have limited the ability of local governments to implement lock downs and other restrictions due to the coronavirus, was pulled from consideration afterseveral right-wing Facebook groups argued it gave too much power to local governments. Anderegg expressed frustration about that bill on Tuesday,saying that “thesame people who eviscerated me personally on HB3009 are thesame people who are up in arms that the Legislature hasn’tstood up to the big, mean governor.”“Be consistent,” hesaid. “Otherwise, you’re going to become white noise as far as I’m concerned. So if that pisses you off, I’msorry. That’s how I feel. Be consistent. If you want to work with us, get into thesystem and work with us. Otherwise, you know what, I don’t have time for you.”As lawmakers move forward to tweak thestate’s Emergency Powers Act, Rep. Suzanne Harrison, D-Draper and a physician, cautioned her colleagues to ensure they don’t inject politics into a public health crisis.“I just think as a body we need to be cautious about talking about our public health experts as government bureaucrats,”shesaid, referencing Anderegg’s earlierstatement. “They are trained professionals that have the health of our community at heart and have the expertise to know whensomething needs to be done tosave lives, whether it’s waterborne illness or infectious disease.”",2,2,Salt Lake Tribune
323,What Path Is The Trump Presidency On Now?,-13.0,37.0,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-path-is-the-trump-presidency-on-now/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,25,"Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.sarah(Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Soon after President Trump was inaugurated, FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silverlaid out 14 possible paths his presidency might take — ranging from himshifting to the middle and emerging as a fairly popular unifier to him resigning in disgrace or being impeached. And while going through all 14 paths at this point is a little overwhelming, it’sstill a useful way to think about the trajectory Trump finds himself on now. For instance, there’s a real question of whether the economy will havesufficiently recovered from a recession (Scenario 9) by November. But by thesame token, itseems pretty unlikely that Trump cedes control to anyone in his administration in any meaningful way (Scenario 5). If anything, the fact that former National Security AdvisorJohn Boltonis the latest former administration official tospeak out against him underscores just how comfortable Trump is with not listening toanyone. So maybe the answer is Trump is verging onsome hybrid version of Scenarios 1 and 6, where he defies conventional norms and jeopardizes democratic values (firing Geoffrey Berman, the U. S. attorney in charge of investigating major crimes in the influential Southern District of New York, is just the latest example). But will it be in a way where hestill manages to appeal to enough of the electorate to win reelection? Hisapproval rating and recent polls wouldsuggest this may not be a winning tactic, but with his recent rally in Tulsa, we’re definitely in full-swing reelection phase. So what path is Trump on now?nrakich(Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): So I think weshouldstart with the caveat that, clearly, Trump isn’t on any onespecific path. The last three and a half years have just been too unpredictable. But I think there are elements ofseveral of Nate’s paths that have come true. For example, “1. Trump keeps on Trumpin’ and the country remains evenly divided”seems pretty accurate, but Nate’ssupposition that that path would “sort of work” and would “make for a very competitive 2018 and 2020” does notseem to be coming true.sarah:That feels like … a cop-out.nrakich:LOL, Sarah, have you met me?julia_azari(Julia Azari, politicalscience professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): I am here to out-cop-out Nathaniel and point out two important variables in the 14scenarios: Trump himself, and the rest of the political environment. And I don’t think they play an equal role in eachscenario. So I would actually adjust Nate’s original framework to think about how the Trump administration hasshaped up and also what’s happened in the rest of politics. That beingsaid, I think weshouldstill consider the “things fall apart” genre and why what’s happening now looks a bit different, as well as Nate’s original Scenario 8 — “Trump is consumed byscandal.”nrakich:Exactly, Julia. Trump has faced a lot ofscandals. He has presided over a pandemic and civil unrest. He has routinely violated democratic norms and values. He was impeached. ButTrump’s popularity hasn’t cratered in response (although it is dipping). Nate’sscenarios kind of assumed that if bad things happened under Trump’s watch, he would become extremely unpopular. But that hasn’t happened in these polarized times. (He’s onlyprettyunpopular.)sarah:I agree. Scenario 8 in Nate’s original article impliedscandal wouldsink Trump, but it really hasn’t. Thatsaid, as you’resaying, Nathaniel, it doesn’t mean Trump’s approval rating is indestructible — even if it is weirdlysteady. This passage from Geoffrey Skelley’s piece onTrump’s latest dip in his approval rating has reallystuck with me. The downward movement in his approval rating belies the notion that nothing matters when it comes to public opinion of this president — his actions and events can, in fact, affect hisstanding. And for that reason, his reelection chances could now be in real danger.julia_azari:Right,so things have kin da fallen apart: We have a recession. We have a pandemic. A few weeks ago we had national protests with curfews and Trump makingsome very authoritarianstatements. And at one point, I think Trump might have entertained going fully authoritarian — which was a path in Nate’s originalscenarios — but the rest of the politicalsystem pushed back. I don’t mean tosuggest that anyone is here tosave norms, but one thing we’veseen in the Trump presidency is thatsystems are resistant to change, and a lot of people have incentives to push back against changes. The politicalsystem has worked largely as expected, too. For instance, party loyalty kicked in as we expected during the impeachment process.perry(Perry Bacon Jr.,senior writer): That’s key here — congressional Republicans and the party overall have beenso loyal to Trump. Trump has hadscandals and mistakes that I think rival or perhaps even top George W. Bush’s. His handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Everythingwith Ukraine. But my perception is that prominent Republicans have been less willing to criticize Trump than they were with Bush. Party loyalty under Trump has been extremelystrong. He is fairly unpopular overall, but very popular within the Republican Party. For instance, Trump is way down in the polls right now, yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ist aking thesamestance as Trump on Confederate monuments—that too many of them are being taken down. This is not a great position for a party trying to win elections.julia_azari:Right, the party environment has changed.nrakich:(Yeah, as aside note, I was thinking about this chat we did in December 2019about the most consequential episodes in Trump’s presidency. That was onlysix months ago, and yet it feels like the list wesettled on is totally defunct.)sarah:Something I think we’re all dancing around now is that Trump has fewer paths to choose from, right? Initially, Nate had outlined 14 potential paths, but Trump’s options feel far more limited now.julia_azari:Yeah. I mean, the path where Trump pivots is not happening — which was evident very early on.nrakich:The Trump-controlled part of his pathseems to be more or less decided at this point. The thing that’s left is the political-environment-controlled part. And, of course, whether he wins reelection, which will be a part of how we assess whether Trump’s path “worked.”Although I would quibble with even that characterization. Ifsomething doesn’t work for 3.5 years but then we have a fast economic recovery orsomething and he hits 47 percent approval just in time to win reelection … did his path really “work”?julia_azari:So in one of the pivotscenarios, Nate wrote that maybe one conclusion from the 2016 election was that Trump is actually pretty good at politics. I think this deservessome unpacking — Trump is clearly good at building a base, but I think he’s bad at legislative coalition-building, national politics, etc.perry:Trump has been brilliant in terms of consolidating power within the Republican Party. For example, he basically pushedSen. Jeff Flakeout of the Senate. He has interjected himself into gubernatorial primaries to get his favorites to win. He has forced people out of his administration who would not do his bidding. Being a Republican is about being loyal to Trump in a way that being a Democrat was not about being loyal to Obama from 2009 to 2017.julia_azari:Right. But then when you take out the Republican Party, the results fall apart pretty quickly.perry:In a country this divided, I would argue being good at base politics is quite important. The media and other institutions in American politics, like the courts, are always trying to remain nonpartisan. So Trump’s approach basically forces out intra-party critics. It means the media can’t easilysay, “Even Republicans think Trump is doingsomethingstrange here.” That gives him more power. He has been great at accumulating power within the Republican Party.julia_azari:Right, but power to do what?Trump governs mostly by executive order, in part because Congress is divided and in part because even when it wasn’t, no one could clarify an agenda and turnslogans into an actual governing coalition.nrakich:I agree that Trump may care most about being loved by asegment of the population and having Republicans depend on him for their political livelihood. But I think Trump is bad at politics. He’s good at building a loyal personal following (this was always true, by the way — it was his MO as a reality TVstar!), but that’s not thesame as governing effectively or winning elections.perry:And for three and a half years, he was close to maintaining power for eight years in America.julia_azari:So I think thesum total of what you’re bothsaying is that Trump has mostlysucceeded at his goals, and those goals were pretty tangentially related to governing.perry:Yes. Trump has been fairly effective at what Trump wanted to do, which is hold power.nrakich:I think we need to be morespecific than just “power.” That word can mean a lot of things. But I get what you’resaying.perry:What I’msaying is pre-pandemic, Trump was atslightly below 50/50 odds of winning reelection. And that was not because he was good at governing — as defined as achieving policy goals — but because he commanded 100 percent loyalty with 50 percent of the electorate orso. So if Trump is only going to lose reelection because of the pandemic and the recession, then that means he wasn’t too bad at politics.nrakich:Perry,we’ve had this discussion before, but I think Trump was an underdog even before the pandemic.sarah:Yeah, I was going to ask… how much do we actually think the pandemic, the recession and now the protests have altered Trump’s reelection odds? They definitely don’tseem to have helped him at this point.nrakich:The events of the last month — which are probably impossible to disentangle —seem to have meaningfully hurt Trump’s reelection odds. We don’t have a model yet, but I can give it to you in terms of a polling average. On May 24, Biden led by 5.8 points in national polls. As of Tuesday,he led by 9.3points.perry:Trump’s reelection odds, itseems to me, went from like 45 percent earlier this year to 20 percent. In April, The New York Times’s Nate Cohn, who is a great elections analyst, wrote aboutTrump’sstrength inswingstates. And the entire Democratic primaryseemed to be, “Who can beat Trump,” whichsuggests to me not everyone perceived him as easy to defeat. So it really doesseem to me that the pandemic and the resulting recession have rewritten his entire presidency. Trump was running on economicsuccess, which he claimed credit for even if he had little do to do with it. And that was an argument that was kind of working. So insome ways, Trump’s path was to do crazy things but focus on the economy andsay, “Whatever I tweet, I get things done.”And that was a decent path until COVID-19.nrakich:I think the fact that electability wassuch a big deal during the primary reflects the perception — among Democrats, maybe you’d call it paranoia — that Trump would be a formidable opponent. But he basicallyspent all of 2019 down by around 6 points to Biden.(Now is the part where I insert the caveat that everything isstillsubject to change with more than four months until the election, regardless of whether Trump is down 9 or 6 points.)sarah:Huh,so maybe Trump isn’t that bad at politics. Maybe the external environmental factors have just become too much for Trump to course-correct in any real way?nrakich:I certainly agree with Perry that the pandemic and recession have rewritten Trump’s presidency. But things have just gone from bad to worse for him. The economy used to be a plausible thing for him to campaign on, although it was really the only arrow in his quiver. Now he doesn’t even have that.perry:Trump is not great at politics — he barely won in 2016. But he if loses in a landslide in 2020, that may be more about COVID-19 than his politicalskills.julia_azari:Right. I think it’s worth noting that Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton would all bestruggling politically right now. They probably would not have dismantled the unit in the National Security Councildedicated to pandemic preparedness and might have had a more coherent response, but presidents have limited control over events like the political environment, particularly when a recession is involved. That’s an interesting question, Nathaniel. What could change between now and November?nrakich:Seems to me like quite a bit? The pandemic could be totally under control and the economy could be roaring back. Or we could be in the middle of asecond wave and the unemployment rate could be in the 20s. Not to mention, all the possibilities that exist in a normal year: A bad debate. Ascandal. God forbid, a terrorist attack.sarah:So how much does Trump’s path matter moving forward? Do external factors matter more?nrakich:Yeah, Sarah, I think at this point external factors matter more. Trump hasshown us who he is and how he’s governing.perry:I think the most important thing is not any actual event, but rather how many Republican elites and voters decide to break with Trump. Will more of eachsay “this incident was the laststraw” even if the incident wassimilar tosomething Trump did in 2017?I don’t think Trump will do anything different, but I think people might react differently to his behavior, with four more years of his presidency looming.julia_azari:Yeah. I agree that this is a big variable, and not the focus of the original paths.perry:If it’s clear theship is going down, people will want to get off of it. Loyalty to the king does not matter if the king is going to be dethroned.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight
324,Biden Takes First Step Toward Restoring Reproductive Health Program Gutted by Trump,-12.0,39.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/02/01/biden-title-x-reproductive-health/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,25,"As executive director of theMissouri Family Health Council, which helps to provide low- and no-cost reproductive health care across thestate, Michelle Trupiano is used to navigating a challenging political environment. “I’m from Missouri, I work in Missouri, and Missouri’s a conservativestate where our providers, in general, are used to an onslaught of attacks on reproductive health,”shesaid. Evenso, in 2018, when the Trump administration announced that it would be issuing new rules constraining the provision of family planning care via the Title X program, Trupiano couldn’t help but be discouraged: The administration was messing with the nation’s only program dedicated to providing contraceptives to low-income and uninsured people. And it was doingso in a way that required providers to lower theirstandards of care and was designed to push certain providers out of the program. “It was just one more thing in a long line of assaults,”shesaid. But then last week, a glimmer of hope: On January 28, the Biden administration issued a memorandum on “protecting women’s health at home and abroad,” a firststep toward undoing Trump-era policies that have constricted access to reproductive health care.“I think everyone is hopeful that in the upcoming weeks everyone will be able to breathe asigh of relief and just concentrate on what our providers do best,” Trupianosaid, “which is providing the highest quality of care for patients.”Biden’s action immediately lifts the “global gag rule,” also known as theMexico City Policy, which banned the U. S. Agency for International Development from funding nongovernmental organizations that provide abortionservices and counseling or engage in efforts tosupport abortion rights in other countries. The policy, first enacted by the Reagan administration, has been an on-again-off-again affair: It was revoked in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, reinstated by President George W. Bush, and then rescinded by President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump enacted it again and expanded its reach in ways that criticssay hurt all manner of global health work, including the fight against HIV and AIDS. “These excessive conditions on foreign and development assistance undermine the United States’ efforts to advance gender equality globally by restricting our ability tosupport women’s health and programs that prevent and respond to gender-based violence,” Biden’s January 28 directive reads. But the work to repeal restrictions placed on Title X, commonly referred to as the domestic gag rule, won’t be as immediate. Because the Title X changes were installed via the rule making process, it will take rule making to undo them, an administration officialtoldPolitico — a process that will have to be deliberate in order to withstand potential legal challenges before a Trump-laden judiciary. Title X is the only pot of federal money dedicated to providing family planning and reproductive healthservices to low-income and uninsured individuals, the majority of whom are people of color. Since 1970, the program has provided access to contraceptives, reproductive health exams and counseling, cancerscreenings, and testing and treatment forsexually transmitted infections. It hasserved roughly 4 million people per year, and the program rules have long allowed participation by all qualified providers. No Title X money funds abortionservices; in fact, no federal fundssupport abortion except in exceedingly rare circumstances. Nonetheless, the Trump administration changed the rules for Title X in ways that weakened the program nationwide. Ostensibly, the changes were aimed at Planned Parenthood, the conservative right’s favorite boogeyman. Before it exited the Title X program in 2019, Planned Parenthood was long theprogram’s largest provider. Though the group accounted for just 13 percent of Title X clinics, itserved 41 percent of all program clients. As with the Mexico City Policy, initial restrictions on Title X were enacted by President Ronald Reagan. They we retied up in litigation until the end of the George H. W. Bush presidency and ultimately rescinded under Clinton, whose rules for the program prevailed until Trump came along. Trump’s gag rule has gone much further than the restrictions imposed by Reagan. Aimed at knocking Planned Parenthood out of the program, it bans grantees from referring patients to abortion providers and hobbles providers’ ability to counsel patients about abortion at all — even when continuing a pregnancy could poseserious health risks. The rule requires all pregnant patients to be referred to prenatal care regardless of the patient’s wishes. And it requires physical and financialseparation between clinics that provide Title Xservices and those that provide abortion care, a direct attack on Planned Parenthood: Roughly half of the group’s health clinics are co-located with abortionservice clinics. Moreover, the Trump administration toyed with the directive that Title X grantees provide every “effective and available method” of birth control and eliminated the requirement that contraceptive methods be “medically approved,” opening the door to the administration’s desire to encourage wildly ineffective natural family planning and promote abstinence — anotherfavorite, yet failed, conservative policy. The rule has also undermined program confidentiality requirements by pressuring Title X grantees to compel their adolescent patients toshare information about theirsexual partners and include their parents in family planning care.(Notably, Trump’s Title X restrictions are also thesubject of ongoing litigation. TheNational Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, joined by the American Medical Association and others, has asked the U. S. Supreme Court to resolve a circuit courtsplit on whether the rules are valid.)“We always did hold out Title X as this thing you’re not going to jack with. This is thestandard … the highest quality of care at the higheststandards and access for everyone,” Trupianosaid. “So when those rules came out andstarted to deteriorate thosestandards, it has an impact — not just in Missouri, but across the country — and can erode trust among patients and providers.”Indeed, instead ofsingling out Planned Parenthood, the Trump rules inflictedsevere damage on the entire Title X network. According to aGuttmacher Institute analysis, the rulesslashed the network’s capacity in half, jeopardizing care for 1.6 million female patients nationwide. (Title Xserves everyone,so the number of patients who lost care is almost certainly higher.) Thirtystatessaw their network capacity drop by 25 percent or more;sixstates lost allo f their Title X providers. In Missouri, the network lost three Planned Parenthood clinics thatserved 14 percent of Title X patients. The Missouri Family Health Council receives roughly $5 million per year in Title X funds, which it currently administers to a network of 15 recipients operating 63 clinics across thestate. In 2019, roughly 5,000 clients lost access because of the rule changes. That year, Missouri’s Title X allotmentserved 37,616 clients — out of more than nearly 400,000 people in need of publicly funded family planningservices. Nationwide, an estimated 21 million people are in need of Title X, yet funding for the program has remained relativelystagnant. In addition to revoking the Trump rules, Trupiano and others would like tosee the Biden administration increase funding for the program. While Trupiano is disappointed that Biden hasn’t taken more immediate action to dismantle Trump’s domestic gag rule,she is hopeful that the Department of Health and Human Services will “actswiftly” and that change will comesoon. “We were disappointed in the memorandum that there wasn’t immediate relief,”shesaid, but “at the end of the day, we’re hopeful we’ll no longer be burdened by the Trump administration’s rules and that we can go back to providing the highest quality care for our patients.”Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe U.

325,Questions for Dr. Fauci,16.67,26.0,https://spectator.org/questions-for-dr-fauci/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-17,23,"As you may be aware, health-care providers across the country and around the world have reported greatsuccess in using Hydroxychloroquine + Zinc + Azithromycin (the “HCQ cocktail”) to treat COVID-19. According to these physicians and researchers, the key tosuccess is to use the HCQ cocktail within the firstseven days after onset of COVID-19symptoms. Nevertheless, eversince President Trump endorsed Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), its use has become a highly politicized and controversial matter. The opposition to HCQstarted with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At thesame press conference that the president first expressed hope about using HCQ to treat COVID-19, Dr. Fauci challenged its effectiveness andstated that he would not take it outside the confines of a clinical trial. Since then the opposition to HCQ has increased even to the point where it is almost impossible to find physicians willing to prescribe it and pharmacies willing to provide it. Three practicing physicians have published the following “Open letter to Dr. Anthony Fauci regarding the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19.” It is a devastating written cross-examination of Dr. Fauci that contains much valuable life-saving information andsquarely addresses the needless deaths that have occurred due to the opposition to the HCQ cocktail. When the history of the COVID-19 pandemic is written, one of the key issues will be why the United States’ medical and government establishments joined forces to deprive the American people access to asafe, inexpensive, and highly effective outpatient treatment that could havesaved tens of thousands lives and definitively obliterated the purported justification for thesocial and economic lock downs that have destroyed lives, livelihoods, and the economy. So, here’s the article. Although it is lengthy, I urge you to read it carefully andshare it with one and all. Lives, livelihoods, the economy and our verysocial fabric remain at risk. August 12, 2020Anthony Fauci, MDNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesWashington, D. C. Dear Dr. Fauci:You were placed into the most high-profile role regarding America’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Americans have relied on your medical expertise concerning the wearing of masks, resuming employment, returning toschool, and of course medical treatment. You are largely unchallenged in terms of your medical opinions. You are the de facto “COVID-19 Czar.” This is unusual in the medical profession in which doctors’ opinions are challenged by other physicians in the form of exchanges between doctors at hospitals, medical conferences, as well as debate in medical journals. You render your opinions unchallenged, without formal public opposition from physicians who passionately disagree with you. It is incontestable that the public is bestserved when opinions and policy are based on the prevailing evidence andscience, and able to withstand thescrutiny of medical professionals. As experience accrued in treating COVID-19 infections, physicians worldwide discovered that high-risk patients can be treatedsuccessfully as an outpatient, within the first five toseven days of the onset ofsymptoms, with a “cocktail” consisting of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin (or doxycycline). Multiplescholarly contributions to the literature detail the efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine-based combination treatment. Dr. Harvey Risch, the renowned Yale epidemiologist,an article in May 2020 in the titled “Early Outpatient Treatment of Symptomatic, High-Risk COVID-19 Patients that Should be Ramped-Up Immediately as Key to Pandemic Crisis.” He further published anarticleinNewsweekin July 2020 for the general public expressing thesame conclusions and opinions. Dr. Risch is an expert at evaluating research data andstudy designs, publishing over 300 articles. Dr Risch’s assessment is that there is unequivocal evidence for the early andsafe use of the “HCQ cocktail.” If there are Q-T interval concerns, doxycycline can besubstituted for azithromycin as it has activity against RNA viruses without any cardiac effects. Yet, you continue to reject the use of hydroxychloroquine, except in a hospitalsetting in the form of clinical trials, repeatedly emphasizing the lack of evidencesupporting its use. Hydroxychloroquine, despite 65 years of use for malaria, and over 40 years for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, with a well-establishedsafety profile, has been deemed by you and the FDA as unsafe for use in the treatment ofsymptomatic COVID-19 infections. Your opinions have influenced the thinking of physicians and their patients, medical boards,state and federal agencies, pharmacists, hospitals, and just about everyone involved in medical decision making. Indeed, your opinions impacted the health of Americans, and many aspects of our day-to-day lives including employment andschool. Those of us who prescribe hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin/doxycycline believe fervently that early outpatient use wouldsave tens of thousands of lives and enable our country to dramatically alter the response to COVID-19. We advocate for an approach that will reduce fear and allow Americans to get their lives back. We hope that our questions compel you to reconsider your current approach to COVID-19 infection. QUESTIONS REGARDING EARLY OUTPATIENT TREATMENT:QUESTIONS REGARDING SAFETY:QUESTIONS REGARDING METHODOLOGY:COMPARISON BETWEEN U. S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES REGARDING CASE FATALITY RATE:GIVING AMERICANS THE OPTION TO USE HCQ FOR COVID-19:FINAL QUESTIONS:While previous questions are related to hydroxychloroquine-based treatment, we have two questions addressing masks. CONCLUSION:Since thestart of the pandemic, physicians have used hydroxy chloroquine to treatsymptomatic COVID-19 infections, as well as for prophylaxis. Initial results were mixed as indications and doses were explored to maximize outcomes and minimize risks. What emerged was that hydroxy chloroquine appeared to work best when coupled with azithromycin. In fact, it was the president of the United States who recommended to you publicly at the beginning of the pandemic, in early March, that youshould consider early treatment with hydroxy chloroquine and a “Z-Pack.” Additionalstudiesshowed that patients did notseem to benefit when COVID-19 infections were treated with hydroxy chloroquine late in the course of the illness, typically in a hospitalsetting, but treatment was consistently effective, even in high-risk patients, when hydroxy chloroquine was given in a “cocktail” with azithromycin and, critically, zinc in the first five toseven days after the onset ofsymptoms. The outcomes are, in fact, dramatic. As clearly presented in the McCullough article from Baylor, and described by Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, the efficacy of the HCQ cocktail is based on the pharmacology of the hydroxy chloroquine ionophore acting as the “gun” and zinc as the “bullet,” while azithromycin potentiates the anti-viral effect. Undeniably, the hydroxy chloroquine combination treatment issupported byscience. Yet, you continue to ignore the “science” behind the disease. Viral replication occurs rapidly in the first five toseven days ofsymptoms and can be treated at that point with the HCQ cocktail. Rather, your actions have denied patients treatment in that earlystage. Withoutsuch treatment,some patients, especially those at high risk with co-morbidities, deteriorate and require hospitalization for evolving cy to kinestorm resulting in pneumonia, respiratory failure, and intubation with 50% mortality. Dismissal of thescience results in bad medicine, and the outcome is over 160,000 dead Americans. Countries that have followed thescience and treated the disease in the earlystages have far better results, a fact that has been concealed from the American Public. Despite mounting evidence and impassioned pleas from hundreds of front line physicians, your position was and continues to be that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have notshown there to be benefit. However, not asingle randomized control trial has tested what is being recommended: use of the full cocktail (especially zinc), in high-risk patients, initiated within the first 5 to 7 days of the onset ofsymptoms. Using hydroxy chloroquine and azithromycin late in the disease process, with or without zinc, does not produce thesame, unequivocally positive results. Dr. Thomas Frieden, in a 2017article regarding randomized clinical trials, emphasized there aresituations in which it is entirely appropriate to use other forms of evidence toscientifically validate a treatment. Such is the case during a pandemic that moves like a brushfire jumping to different parts of the country. Insisting on randomized clinical trials in the midst of a pandemic issimply foolish. Dr. Harvey Risch, a world-renowned Yale epidemiologist, analyzed all the data regarding the use of the hydroxychloroquine/HCQ cocktail and concluded that the evidence of its efficacy when used early in COVID-19 infection is unequivocal. Curiously, despite a 65+ yearssafety record, the FDAsuddenly deemed hydroxy chloroquine a dangerous drug, especially with regard to cardiotoxicity. Dr. Risch analyzed data provided by the FDA and concluded that the risk of asignificant cardiac event from hydroxy chloroquine is extremely low, especially when compared to the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with high-risk co-morbidities. How do you reconcile that for forty years rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients have been treated over long periods, often for years, with hydroxy chloroquine and now there aresuddenly concerns about a 5 to 7-day course of hydroxy chloroquine atsimilar orslightly increased doses? The FDAstatement regarding hydroxy chloroquine and cardiac risk is patently false and alarmingly misleading to physicians, pharmacists, patients, and other health professionals. The benefits of the early use of hydroxy chloroquine to prevent hospitalization in high-risk patients with COVID-19 infection far outweigh the risks. Physicians are not able to obtain the medication for their patients, and insome cases are restricted by theirstate from prescribing hydroxychloroquine. The government’s obstruction of the early treatment ofsymptomatic high-risk COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, a medication used extensively andsafely forso long, is unprecedented. It is essential that you tell the truth to the American public regarding thesafety and efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine/HCQ cocktail. The government must protect and facilitate thesacred and revered physician-patient relationship by permitting physicians to treat their patients. Governmental obfuscation and obstruction are as lethal as cy to kinestorm. Americans must not continue to die unnecessarily. Adults must resume employment and our youth return toschool. Locking down America while awaiting an imperfect vaccine has done far more damage to Americans than the coronavirus. We are confident that thousands of lives would besaved with early treatment of high-risk individuals with a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin. Americans must not live in fear. As Dr. Harvey Risch’sarticle declares, “The key to defeating COVID-19 already exists. We need tostart using it.”Very Respectfully,George C. Fareed, MDBrawley, CaliforniaMichael M.

Gunnery Sgt. Mario A. Madera-Rodriguezfaces charges of conspiracy, assault, obstruction of justice, burglary, false officialstatements, involuntary manslaughter and felony murder in the June 4, 2017,strangulation death of Army Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar in Bamako, Mali. Three fellow co-defendants, another Marine Raider and two Navy SEALs, have already pled guilty to their part in the death and have beensentenced. Madera-Rodriguez is the only one of the four to go to trial. He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of murder, he faces a possiblesentence of life without parole. Marine Capt. Jason Samuel, a prosecuting attorney, laid out a blow-by-blow time line of events the night and early morning hours before Melgar’s death in his bedroom of the Army-Navy residence heshared with Navy SEALs and fellowsoldiers on deployment to the African nation.“Their plan was to haze him that night, to humiliate him, but they killed him,” Samuel told the jury. Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar was found dead ofstrangulation on June 4, 2017, in housing heshared with three otherspecial operations forces personnel in Bamako, Mali. (Army)The defense team’s openingstatements were held in asession closed to the public because theirstatements contained classified information, officialssaid. The four men involved in Melgar’s death immediately tried to cover up the crime, Samuelsaid, repeatedly lying to officials. But Jennifer Brown, a female friend of Madera-Rodriguez who was with the men the night before Melgar died, later told investigators what they had planned. Navy SEAL Chief Special Warfare Officer Adam C. Matthews came to Bamako, Mali,shortly before the events that led to Melgar’s death. Soon after arriving, Matthews met with Chief SWO Tony E. DeDolph and other members of thespecial operations team for a contingency planningsupport mission. But DeDolph told Matthews that he and others had problems with Melgar and wanted to put him in line by hazing him. In interviews, those who’d talked with Melgar revealed thestaffsergeant was fed up with “juvenile behavior” by DeDolph and otherspecial operators. Hesaid he was anxious to finish his deployment and return home. Samuel told the jury that on the night of June 3, Melgar was driving to a party at the French Embassy in Bamako. DeDolph, Madera-Rodriguez and fellow Marine Raider Staff Sgt. Kevn Maxwell were following him in another vehicle, but they becameseparated. The trio thought that he’d deliberately ditched them andsaw it as asign of disrespect. They then diverted to a local bar called the “Appaloosa.” While drinking, DeDolph came up with the idea to teach Melgar a “lesson” by hazing him, Samuelsaid. They contacted the two Malian guards at the Army-Navy house, telling them they needed to be ready to help pull a “joke” on Melgar. Over the next few hours, they hatched a detailed plan. Madera-Rodriguez would bust open Melgar’s door with asledgehammer. They’d all rush in on thesleeping Melgar, and Maxwell would pull back the mosquito netting around his bed. Then, DeDolph, a former professional in mixed martial arts, would pounce on Melgar and put him in a chokehold. Matthews would then jump in, helping duct tape Melgar, the prosecutorsaid. They needed him restrainedso that they could remove his clothing and bring in one of the Malian guards in his underwear with a belt around his neck like a leash. They then planned to take compromising photos and videos of Melgar with the Malian man. Madera-Rodriguez’ other task was to put on music for the event.“He broke into that room and provided thesoundtrack to Staff Sgt. Melgar’sstrangulation,” Samuelsaid. The group dubbed the event “Operation Tossed Salad,” a name for asex act. The quartet and the Malian man, lined up outside Melgar’s door and broke through with thesledgehammer, according to court testimony. Suddenly awakened, Melgar fought back, but DeDolph put him in the choke hold facedown on the bed as the others began to restrain and duct tape him, Samuelsaid. As theystruggled, Melgarstopped breathing. The menstopped and began attempts to resuscitate him. They even tried a field expedient tracheotomy. But when that failed, they took him to a nearby medical clinic where he was later pronounced dead. Almost immediately, the two SEALs told the Marines they would deal with the incident and not mention them, Samuelsaid. They made up astory that DeDolph had been practicing hand-to-hand combat drills with Melgar, whostopped breathing. They latersaid they thought Melgar had been drinking and that might have contributed to his death, according to prosecutors. But witnesses later told investigators that Melgar didn’t drink alcohol. A week after Melgar’s death, Madera-Rodriguez and Maxwell accompanied Army investigators to the crimescene assecurity. Madera-Rodriguez even walked them through the fakestory of a wrestling match gone wrong between DeDolph and Melgar. But investigators found duct tape under Melgar’s bed with his blood on it. They also had talked with Brown, who had been at the Appaloosa bar with the men the night they talked about their plan. Cell phone records and text messagesshowed that Madera-Rodriguez and the others had gone from the Appaloosa bar to a restaurant, thenstopped at a Marine house to pick up duct tape and thesledgehammer at about 4 a.m. before heading to the Army-Navy house. The men broke into Melgar’s room and committed the attack between 5:25 a.m. and 5:35 a.m., Samuelsaid. The timing matters because whether it happened at night or during the day may have bearing onsome aspects of the burglary charge. Samuel told jurors an expert would testify, explaining why it was nighttime when this occurred. Subsequent interviews by military investigators uncovered what had happened, which resulted in the charges the men faced in their respective courts martial. The trial began Monday with juryselection, which lasted until late Thursday. An all-male jury of eight members, four enlisted and four commissioned officers, four Marines and foursailors wereselected. Madera-Rodriguez chose to have a jury trial for his general court-martial. The members must have a rank equal to or greater than the defendant’s. The highest ranking member is an O-5, Navy commander. The lowest ranking member is an E-8, Navysenior chief petty officer. In January, DeDolph pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He wassentenced to 10 years in prison, reduction to E-1, forfeiture of pay and a dishonorable discharge. Maxwell pleaded guilty in June 2019 to negligent homicide, conspiracy to commit assault, hazing, obstruction of justice and making false officialstatements. He received four years of confinement, reduction in rank to E-1 and a bad conduct discharge. In May 2019, Matthews pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and related charges. He was given one year of confinement, reduction to petty officersecond class and a bad conduct discharge. All three are expected to testify as prosecution witnesses as part of their plea agreements in the trial of Madera-Rodriguez.

Cybersecurity experts praised the move, citing it as a clearsign the Biden White House would beserious about countering cyber-threats. ThedescribedNeuberger, who became the National Security Agency’scybersecurity chief in 2019, as a “rising official” at the agency. She had run its Russia Small Group, which launched a preemptivestrike against the Kremlin’s cy ber operatives during the 2018 elections, and in addition to focusing on preventing cyber-assaults on the US government and military,she had overseen the development of new impenetrable cryptography. But the glowing reviews left out an unusual piece of herstory: In recent years, Neuberger, through a family foundation, has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC, for its efforts to influence the US government and public opinion. Nationalsecurity experts tellMother Jonesthat the hefty donations from Neuberger’s foundation to AIPAC—astrong ally of an Israeli government that is deeply involved in cy ber and intelligence issues of importance to the US government and that hasspied on the United States and been a target of USspying—raise concerns. (NBC Newsreportsthesame.)*Neuberger hails from one of the wealthiest families in the United States. Her father is billionaire investor George Karfunkel, who was in the news lastsummer for making a curious donation of Kodakstock—worth up to $180 million—to an Orthodox Jewishsynagogue in Brooklyn thatseemed to barely exist. Karfunkel was listed in New York State records as thesynagogue’s president and chief financial officer, and the transfer of thisstock—which would have yielded Karfunkel a tremendous tax deduction—occurred during a wild buyingspree of Kodakstock triggered by a leaked announcement that the Trump administration might be handing Kodak an unprecedented $765 million loan. (That deal never came through.) Members of Congress have demanded answers about Karfunkel’s highly unusualstock transfer. From 1993 to 2007, Anne Neubergerworkedat American Stock Transfer and Trust, a financialservices firm cofounded by her father in 1971, eventually becoming asenior vice president of operations. Her husband, Yehuda Neuberger, was also a top official at the firm and a board member. Anne Neuberger thenswitched from the privatesector to the government. Afterserving as a White House fellow and working for thesecretary of the Navy as an adviser on IT programs,she landed at the NSA in 2009 and helped develop its Cyber Command. Mediaprofilesof her in the yearssince have focused on the novelty of an Orthodox Jewish woman who grew up in a Hassidic neighborhood in Brooklyn (and whose grandparents on bothsides were Holocaustsurvivors) becoming a leader at the NSA and have noted that her parents were on the 1976 Air France flight that was hijacked by the Palestinian Liberation Organization and diverted to Uganda, where the passengers were eventually rescued by Israeli commandos. Twelve years ago, Neuberger and her husband created the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation to “carry out the charitable and religious purposes of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore,” according to its tax records. Neuberger was vice-president of the foundation; her husband, the president. Neither received compensation from the outfit. In 2010, the foundation’s first full year of operations, it received $1,183,050 in contributions and handed out $383,100. Of that, a quarter of a million went to the Women’s Network for Single Parents in Brooklyn. (Neuberger is the founder ofSister to Sister, a group that assists divorced women within Orthodox Jewish communities.) The foundation made an $83,000 gift to the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore. Computer Sciences for the Blind in Brooklyn was awarded $25,000. And the foundation donated $25,000 to AIPAC for “operatingsupport.”The following year, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation dished out $284,500 in gifts, according to its tax filings. The list included another $25,000 to AIPAC and also $3,500 to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a hawkish, pro-Israel think-tank in Washington. Insubsequent years, the foundation upped its contributions to AIPAC. From 2012 through 2018—the last year for which tax records for the foundation are available—the Neubergers provided $559,000 to AIPAC. And this money, according to those filings, financed lobbying—either lobbying “to influence a legislative body” or “to influence public opinion.” The tax records do not provide anyspecifics about the AIPAC activity the foundation financed. (The contribution amounts listed for AIPAC on the Neuberger Foundation’s IRSsubmissions line up exactly with the amounts the foundation declared as expenditures for lobbying. A nonprofit charitable foundation is allowed to pass money to a lobbyingshop, as long as the amount donated is a moderate percentage of its overall giving.)There is a Neuberger family connection to AIPAC. Yehuda Neubergerischairof AIPAC’s Baltimore executive council. In 2011, Rabbi Steven Weil, then executive vice president of the Orthodox Union,hailedhis “outstanding reputation as a leader of AIPAC.” Four years later, as part of a fierce AIPAC effort, Yehuda NeubergerlobbiedSen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) to oppose the multilateral Iran nuclear deal the Obama White House had negotiated. (During the political fight over the Iran deal, the NSA,accordingto the,eavesdropped on Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposed the accord, and “revealed to the White House how Mr. Netanyahu and his advisers had leaked details of the U. S.-Iran negotiations—learned through Israelispying operations—to undermine the talks” and had “coordinated talking points with Jewish-American groups against the deal.”)Around 2014, the management of the Neuberger Foundationshifted. Anne Neuberger, who wasstill at the NSA, moved from vice president tosecretary/treasurer, and Yehuda Neuberger, the president, became vice president. Marc Terrill, the president of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore, who had previously been a director of the Neubergers’ foundation, took over as president. (According to tax records for 2014, Terrill made $700,109 in total compensation as head of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore that year.) The Neuberger Foundation and the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimoreshare an address and phone number in the Charm City. In its 2015 tax filing, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation reported a major development: it received a $93 million gift. Thesource of this large contribution—which came in the form ofstock in one publicly traded company—was the Chesed Foundation of America, an organization run by George Karfunkel thatstarted that fiscal year with assets of $148 million. (The tax filings do not disclose whatstock was involved in this transfer.) Insubsequent years, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation increased its donations into theseven-figures range. In fiscal year 2017, the foundation experienced anothersignificant change in its finances: itstarted the year with $88 million in assets but ended with $33 million. It handed out about $1.5 million in donations that year, and its tax filing did not explain this drop. Still, in assets, it remained over 30 times thesize it was at its inception in 2010. As the Neubergers’ foundation grew—bolstered by this large infusion from George Karfunkel’s foundation—AIPAC remained a beneficiary. In fiscal year 2018, it doled out $1,925,000 in donations, which included $75,000 for AIPAC. In Washington, AIPAC is regarded as a powerhouse lobbying force. Itdescribesits mission as a bipartisan effort “tostrengthen and expand the U. S.-Israel relationship in ways that enhance thesecurity of the United States and Israel.” But a top AIPAC official oncesaid that its job is generally tosupport the policies of the government of Israel. In 2005, twosenior AIPAC officials were charged with espionage and accused of handing US defensesecrets to an Israeli official, but four years later, the case was dropped when pre-court rulings complicated the Justice Department’s case by compelling prosecutors to prove the pair had intended to harm US interests. In recent years AIPAC has been widelyseen as asupporter of Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right and hard line policies—perhaps tosuch an extent that it has, as one critic put it, engaged in “mission-distortion” or “mission-neglect.” AIPAC, for example, hasprovidedNetanyahu a platform for attacking Democrats and US policies with which it disagrees. “The Israeli government has moved right. AIPAC has gone with it,” Ilan Goldenberg, asenior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington,notedlast year. In his new memoir, former President Barack ObamacriticizedAIPAC for reflexivelysiding with Israel in policy disputes. He wrote that AIPAC embraces the view that “thereshould be ‘no daylight’ between the U. S. and Israeli governments, even when Israel took actions that were contrary to U. S. policy.” He observed that US officials who adopted a different approach could expect to be targeted by the AIPAC and its political arm: “Those who criticized Israeli policy too loudly risked being tagged as ‘anti-Israel’ (and possibly anti-Semitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election.”On cy ber matters—Anne Neuberger’s field—Israel is an important player. It has become a cy bersecurity powerhouse. The nation is home to NSO Group, one of the mostnotoriouscyber-surveillance firms, which manufactures the infamousPegasusphonespyware, which can allow asecurityservice or other actor to gain total control of a mobile phone and use the device tosurveil its user. According to a 2018report, “At leastsix countries withsignificant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use ofspy ware to target civilsociety, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.” Last year,reportedthat the Israeli government had encouraged NSO tosell Pegasus to the United Arab Emirates andseveral Persian Gulfstates. Though Israel is a US ally, it hasspied on the US government, and the CIAhas consideredIsrael a top counterintelligence threat. And it is not hard to conceive of cyber-related conflicts that could arise between the twostates. Soshould a Biden administration nationalsecurity official in charge of US cy ber policy besupporting an influence group aligned with the Israeli government? “It’s unwise at best,”says John Sipher, a former CIA official. “In her world, when people think of cyber-threats, Israel is always there, even if it’s an ally. It issurprising thatsomeone in cy ber who understands Israeli capabilities would not want tosteer clear of these politics.”Several other nationalsecurity experts—who asked not to be named—say that the foundation’s donations to AIPAC create, at the least, an appearance problem for Anne Neuberger. They point out that the Israeli government does maintain an aggressive campaign of espionage against the United States and has a deep interest in US cy ber policy. A formersenior intelligence officialsays, “Anne is a verysmart and competent professional. I was very impressed with her work and never had any question about her integrity… Thatsaid,such a donation, if true and publicized, would raise a lot of eyebrows within the government and beyond, especiallysince the two dimensions involved—Israel and cyber—have their own history.” Asecond formersenior intelligence official adds, “Is this disqualifying? Probably not. But it’s not good.”Asenior congressional aide who oversees nationalsecurity issuessays, “If you donate half a million dollars to a lobbying group, that indicates a prettystrong preference.” And a foreign policy expert with close ties to the Biden administration notes, “One question this presents is whethershe would recuse herself from decisions that could impact Israel.”Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and an expert on government ethics, notes that ethics laws are primarily aimed at preventing an official’s financial interests from having an impact on his or her government work. “Neuberger’s past financial contribution to AIPAC does not create that kind of ethics issue,”shesays. But Clark notes that it could “raise raise a question regarding her impartiality.” Clark points out that because cy bersecurity issues involve Israel and because AIPAC “promotesstrong US-Israeli cooperation on a wide range of issues, including cyber,” the public “needs to know whether the actions of Neuberger’s foundation overlap with her government responsibilities.” She adds, “Will we know what the foundation hasspent or isspending its money on? Will we know what projects the foundation issupporting? Will the foundation accept donations?”Marc Terrill, the president of the Neuberger Foundation, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When reached by, Yehuda Neubergersaid he was not available to discuss the foundation. On Monday,Mother Jonessent a list of questions about the Neuberger Foundation and its AIPAC donations to the NSC and Anne Neuberger. The queries included: Did Neuberger or her foundation knowspecifically what lobbying the donationssubsidized? What was thesource of the initial $1,183,050 the foundation kicked off with? What was thestock valued at $93 million that her father’s foundation donated to the Neuberger Foundation? Why did the foundation receivesuch a large gift? Does the Neuberger Foundation consult with Karfunkel regarding any of its donations? Has Neuberger filed a financial disclosure form regarding her new position at the NSC? Does it include information related to the Neuberger Foundation? Didshe file a financial disclosure form at the NSA? Did it include information related to the Neuberger Foundation?Mother Jonesalso asked,Is it appropriate for a high-ranking intelligence official or a NSC official to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to AIPAC, a lobby regarded by critics as often aligned with the policy interests of a foreign government? Is there a potential conflict of interest for asenior official in charge of cy ber policy who donates money to an American group that isseen assupportive of a foreign government highly involved in cyber-surveillance and cyber-warfare issues?An NSCspokespersonsaid thatshe would respond to the query and requested time to doso. Two days later the NSC declined to answer any of those questions. The NSCspokespersonsaid, “As asenior NSC employee, Ms. Neuberger will abide by the Executive Order on Ethics Commitments By Executive Branch Personnel.”The NSA did not respond to asimilarset of questions. After this article was published, Emily Horne, an NSCspokesperson,sent the followingstatement: “We note that NBC has pulled down their own version of thisstory,saying it fellshort of their reportingstandards, and look forward toMother Jonesdoing thesame. The women and men of the NSC are patriotic, dedicated, andserve their country with distinction. Being forced to endure publicsmear campaignsshould not be part of working on behalf of the American people.” NBC News moved itsstory on Neuberger to its archives andsaid that the article did not meet the network’s reportingstandards because it cited only unnamedsources raising questions about the Neuberger Foundation’s donations to AIPAC and because Neuberger was not given “adequate time to respond to our reporting.” ThisMother Jonesarticle cited both named and unnamedsources, andMother Jonesgave Neuberger two days to respond to a query about her foundation and the AIPAC donations.

328,Mom Faces Felony Charges For Taking a Drug Prescribed by Her Doctor While Pregnant,0.0,41.0,https://reason.com/2021/06/23/pregnant-mom-prescription-drug-charge-alabama/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,25,"Seven copsswarmed the home of an Alabama mom charged with the dastardly crime of taking a painkiller prescribed by her doctor whileshe was pregnant with herson—who, by the way, is perfectly fine and now 8 months old. In 2020,stay-at-home-mom Kim Blalock of Florence, Alabama, was pregnant with hersixth child. A year earlier,she'd hadsurgery for back problems resulting from a car accident. She alsosuffered from arthritis and a degenerative disc disease, and was prescribed hydrocodone to ease her chronic pain. Thoughshe hadstopped taking the drug whenshe learnedshe was expecting, the pain got worse as the pregnancy wore on—andshe had five other kids to take care of. Six weeks before herson was due,she was insuch agony thatshe went back to her orthopedist and he renewed her prescription. When her baby was born and tested for drugs, whichseems to be routine, the results came back positive. The Department of Human Resources (DHR), thestate's childservices division, investigated and quickly closed the case,according to AL.com. But the cops and the district attorney? Theysmelled blood. Prosecutors couldn't charge Blalock with taking illegal drugs, becauseshe had a prescription. They couldn't charge her with abusing the drugs, either. (Not for lack of trying, though: DHR had actually counted how many pillsshe had taken.) Nor could the authorities charge her with getting the legal drugs by illegal means,such as doctorshopping, or forgery. What they could and did charge her with was not informing her doctor thatshe was pregnant. They labeled this prescription fraud: a felony. This represents ""the literal policing of pregnancy,""says Ellie Lee, Director of the Centre for Parenting Studies at the University of Kent in England, one of the rareschools with a department focused on parenting policy. Wisely, the Alabamastate legislature had already passed a 2016 law to makesure moms taking drugs prescribed by doctors could not be prosecuted. But Blalock wasn't protected by that law, ostensibly becauseshe might not have received the prescription hadshe informed the doctor of her pregnancy. Blalock visited the doctor in person, but was in her car, due to COVID-19 restrictions. Authorities asserted that her obstetrician would have weaned her off the opioid, but Blalock countered thatshe did indeed tell her ob-gyn. In either case, hydrocodone just isn't very dangerous. While babies exposed to the op io id in utero may havesome withdrawalsymptoms once born—including ""irritability, excess crying, poor feeding, and tremors,"" according to AL.com—thosesymptoms ""are not life-threatening.""Obviously, no one wants a baby tosuffer. But no oneshould want a mother tosuffer, either. And when a pregnant woman is in debilitating pain, there is nosolution that promises perfection all around. Rather than recognizing that fact, police officers waited until two months after the baby was born and then ""swarmed Blalock's house whileshe and her husband were out of town."" Her two teenagers were at home andsaid at leastseven armed officers entered, asking questions about her whereabouts. The teenagers wereso rattled that they went tostay with their grandparents. A public information officer with the Florence Police Department declined to answer questions about the raid because the investigation remains open. Emma Roth, a lawyer with the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, is representing Blalock along with other attorneys. Roth has asked that the charges be dropped. Hanging in the balance is not just Blalock's fate but the fate of any woman who goes to the doctor and does not inform them thatshe's expecting. This reminds me of theCDC recommending that women who are pregnant or even could be pregnant avoid all alcohol. That means basically no drinks from middleschool to menopause. The federal government's impulse was thesame as the Florence police department's: focusingso intensely on the fetus that the woman is barely an afterthought.""This is another leap forward in the long march toward erasing pregnant women as people,""says Joan Wolfe, an associate professor of women's and genderstudies at Texas A&M University, and author of""If I had known what I know now, I would rather lay in bed my entire pregnancy in pain than take a pill,"" Blalocksaid. ""I didn't think it was a big deal. Myson is perfectly fine.""The fact that this prescription drug is not known to cause any lasting damage to a child means there is no reason to prohibit a mom in pain from taking it and feeling better.",1,1,Reason

Judge Allows Indoor Services me ga church Pastor John MacArthur filed a lawsuit against Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and otherstate officials over ongoing restrictions for churches amid the coronavirus pandemic. Inthe filing,submitted Thursday by attorneys Jenna Ellis and Charles LiMandri, MacArthur’s Grace Community Church in Sun Valley hassought “to prohibit California from enforcing its unconstitutional and onerous coronavirus pandemic regulations” against the congregation. MacArthursaid in a response to the court’s ruling, “I am very grateful the court has allowed us to meet inside and we are happy for a few weeks to comply and respect what the judge has asked of us because he is allowing us to meet. This vindicates our desire tostay open andserve our people. This also gives us an opportunity toshow that we are not trying to be rebellious or unreasonable, but that we willstand firm to protect our church against unreasonable, unconstitutional restrictions.”The official press release from@ThomasMoreSocre:@GraceComChurchand Pastor@johnmacarthur: addition tosuing Newsom, Grace Community Church has named Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D). As legal proceedings get underway, MacArthur has pledged to keep the doors of his church open toserve Angelenos eager to return for Sunday morningservices.“We aresimply continuing to do today what we have done for the past 63 years, that Grace Community Church has been open to welcome the Los Angeles community andserve theirspiritual needs,” the pastorsaid. “We will remain open and teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all who decide they want to come worship with us.”Click Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Top StoriesAccording to the Thomas More Society, where Ellisserves asspecial counsel, the complaint from Grace Community Churchstates the American people “have begun tosee that they are being [cheated] by their own government.”The lawsuit pointed to the doublestandard that has been applied to Black Lives Matter protesters, who have been allowed and even encouraged to flood thestreets by the thousands while churches have been forced to keep theirsanctuaries closed over concerns worshipservices could causespikes in coronavirus infections.“They have witnessed how the onerous restrictions imposed on them by public officials to allegedly fight the COVID-19 pandemicsimply do not apply to certain, favored groups,”states MacArthur’s lawsuit. “When many went to thestreets to engage in ‘political’ or ‘peaceful’ protests purportedly against racism and police brutality, these protestors refused to comply with the pandemic restrictions. Instead of enforcing the public health orders, public officials were all too eager to grant a de facto exception for these favored protestors.”LiMandri argued it is “unconstitutional” for Newsom and his cohorts to “discriminate against churches by treating them less favorably than other organizations and activities that are not protected by the First Amendment.” He continued, “This is especially the case when the government has given free rein to protesters and is notsimilarly restricting marijuana dispensaries, large retail outlets and factories, and abortion providers.”The legal filing comes not long after MacArthur’s church was met with a cease-and-desist letter from the County of Los Angeles. MacArthur, for his part, has indicated he has no plans to comply with the demand. At the beginning of last Sunday’s worshipservice, the 81-year-old pastor cheekily welcomed congregants to “the Grace Community Church peaceful protest.”During an appearance Tuesday morning on CNN, MacArthurtold host Brianna Keilarhe believes the California government is intentionally “targeting” the church. Church-goers, hesaid, “know life is being restricted in a way that is not constitutional, that is burdensome, that is targeting a church, and that makes nosense in light of the actual number of deaths that they’reseeing.”As for whether it’s wise for certain attenders to return to in-person worshipservices, MacArthur told Keilar he has entrusted his congregants with that determination. Hesaid it’s up to attendees to “make adult decisions about the reality of their physical andspiritual health and how that balance works for each one of them.”The judge is requiring congregants to wear masks andsocial distance between family groups while indoors.

330,The Department of Defense Contractors,-18.67,44.0,https://popular.info/p/the-department-of-defense-contractors,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-09,18,"In his 1961farewell address, President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the dangers of the military-industrial complex:In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whethersought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. At the time, the budget of the U. S. military was $48 billion. This fiscal year, the U. S. military budget is$738 billion, a rise that far outpaced the rate of inflation. If militaryspending had increased at the pace of inflation over the last 60 years, the current military budget would be about $414 billion. Militaryspending accelerated dramatically during the Trump administration; more than$125 billion was added to the defense budget over 4 years. Notably, Trump's first three Defense Secretaries all previously worked for military contractors. Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was fired by Trump in November, was a lobbyist for Raytheon. Esper's predecessor, Patrick Shanahan,spent three decades as an executive at Boeing. And Shanahan’s predecessor, Jim Mattis,served on the board of General Dynamics for four years before being nominated as Trump's first Secretary of Defense. The election of Joe Biden was an opportunity to reset the relationship between the Pentagon and the contractors that are paid billions annually by the federal government. Instead, Biden nominated Lloyd Austin, a former general and current member of the Raytheon board. Austin, who retired as a four-star general, has an unquestionably impressive resume. He was the commander of CENTCOM, and, before that, the battlefield commander who managed the complicated withdrawal of U. S. forces from Iraq. He reportedly has astrong desire ""to avoid civilian casualties."" Unlike other top generals, he has avoided the mediaspotlight and focused on his work. His nomination is also historic. Austin would be the first Black Secretary of Defense. But it's also not an accident that Austin ended up on the board of Raytheon in 2016, a position which paid him $300,000 in annual compensation. In 2018, according to are port by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), defense contractors employed 380 former ""high-ranking Department of Defense officials and military officers"" as ""lobbyists, board members, executives, or consultants."" The biggest defense contractors — General Dynamics, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed, BAE — all currently have multiple retired admirals and generals on their board. POGOconcludedthat the ""revolving door of Pentagon officials andsenior military leadersseeking lucrative post-government jobs"" ends up conflating ""what is in the best financial interests of defense contractors—excessively large Pentagon budgets, endless wars, and overpriced weaponsystems—with what is in the best interest of military effectiveness and protecting citizens.""Raytheon, in particular, has publicly advocated for the Biden campaign to maintain — and eventually increase — Trump's militaryspending levels. Ina CNBC interview in late-October, Raytheon CEO Gregory Hayessaid it was ""ridiculous"" to think that Biden would reduce militaryspending. Although Hayessaid he expected defense budgets to remain relatively flat as the country deals with the pandemic, he called for increased budgets in the long term. ""We have lost our technological edge to the Chinese and insome cases to the Russians and we’re going to have to invest more dollars intosome of these new technologies if we’re going to be able to compete with these new threats,"" Hayessaid. Raytheonspends millions to influence the federal government. In the third quarter of 2020, Raytheon’s lobbying expenditures exceeded $2.85 million. This included $680,000 in payments to 19 different lobbying firms. Austin's connection to Raytheon is unlikely toseriously endanger his chances at confirmation. A year ago, Esper was confirmed on a vote of 90-8, despite working as a lobbyist for Raytheon. Republicans and Democrats are willing to overlook these kinds of financial conflicts-of-interest. Another issue with Austin's nomination as Defense Secretary is that he is not technically eligible for the job. ""A person may not be appointed as Secretary of Defense withinseven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force,"" according to federal law. Austin retired four years ago. What's the purpose of this law? It is grounded in the foundational principle that the military reflects, and issubordinate to,the will of the people. That is why the president is also Commander-in-Chief. Thespecific law was passed in 1947, around the time the unified Department of Defense was created, and initially required a member of the military to be retired for 10 years before being appointed Secretary of Defense. (The time period wasshortened toseven years in 2008.) It was based on aconcern""that recently retired officers would be too cozy with their friendsstill on active duty."" Ultimately, this could undermine the authority of the president and the rest of the civilian decision-making apparatus. Austin, however,seems unlikely to resist thestrategies of Biden and his civilian nationalsecurity team at the White House. According to reports, Bidenselected Austin in part because, unlikesome high-ranking generals, he does notseek out thespotlight. Congress can waive the requirements of the law, and didso to confirm Mattis in 2017. But Mattis was only thesecond time that Congress waived the law. And at the timesome Democratssaid it was a one-time exception they would not repeat. (The conventional wisdom was that Mattis would provide ""adultsupervision"" for Trump.)Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,supported the waiver for Mattis butsaid he would notsupport a waiver for any future nominees. Congress has enacted an exception one timesince the creation of the Department of Defense. And waiving the lawshould happen no more than once in a generation. Therefore, I will notsupport a waiver for future nominees. Nor will Isupport any effort to water down or repeal thestatute in the future. The waiver must also pass the House. In 2017,only 36 House Democratssupported a waiver for Mattis. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin has already raised concerns about Austin's nomination,saying that ""civil-military relations at the Pentagon definitely need to be rebalanced.""Democrats also referenced the issue in their 2020 party platform. ""We will end the Trump Administration’s politicization of the armed forces and distortion of civilian and military roles in decision-making,"" the platformsays.

332,"Alito: Court's 'Preposterous' Trans Ruling Threatens Religion, Speech, Privacy, and Safety",21.0,36.25,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/tyler-o-neil/2020/06/15/alito-courts-preposterous-trans-ruling-threatens-religion-speech-privacy-and-safety-n532217,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-15,25,"On Monday, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that discrimination on the basis ofsex includes discrimination on the basis ofsexual orientation and gender identity in the case of(2020). In a powerful dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito condemned the ruling as “preposterous” and betraying “breathtaking” arrogance. He noted that Congress has tried and repeatedly failed to amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in just this fashion and that no one interpreted the law this way until 2017. In this decision, as inRoe v. Wade(1973) andObergefell v. Hodges(2015), the Supreme Court usurped the power of Congress by creating “legislation.”Perhaps most importantly, however, Alito warns that the decision will have wide-ranging destructive impacts on key freedoms Americans hold dear, and he predicts that “the entire Federal Judiciary will be mired for years in disputes about the reach of the Court’s reasoning.”“As the briefing in these cases has warned, the position that the Court now adopts will threaten freedom of religion, freedom ofspeech, and personal privacy andsafety. No oneshould think that the Court’s decision represents an unalloyed victory for individual liberty,” Alito warns. His dissent lays outseven different realms of American life that will be affected by this ruling. Naturally, the Supreme Court’s position that a ban on discrimination on the basis of “sex” includes a ban on discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not only a preposterous extension of the 1964 law but a dangerous reading of federal law in general. As Alito warns, “the Court may wish to avoid thissubject, but it is a matter of concern to many people who are reticent about disrobing or using toilet facilities in the presence of individuals whom they regard as members of the oppositesex. Forsome, this maysimply be a question of modesty, but for others, there is more atstake. For women who have been victimized bysexual assault or abuse, the experience ofseeing an unclothed person with the anatomy of a male in a confined andsensitive locationsuch as a bathroom or locker room can causeserious psychological harm.”Based on broad understandings of “transgenderstatus” that could include those who identify as “gender fluid” and those who have not undergone anysurgery to alter their bodies. “A person who has not undertaken any physical transition ing may claim the right to use the bathroom or locker room assigned to thesex with which the individual identifies at that particular time,” Alito reasoned. This is not tosay that transgender people are predators, but to note that women have passionately fought for their rights and now their privatespaces will be open to biological males. The true concern is not that a male who identifies as a female will abuse women, but that prurient men will abuse this loophole andsome women who have experiencedsexual assault will be victimized by being forced toshare intimate quarters with biological males. Alito also warns that “the right of a transgender individual to participate on asports team or in an athletic competition previously reserved for members of one biologicalsex” may arise under Title VII and Title IX due to the Court’s ruling in.“This issue has already arisen under Title IX, where it threatens to undermine one of that law’s major achievements, giving young women an equal opportunity to participate insports,” Alito notes. “The effect of the Court’s reasoning may be to force young women to compete againststudents who have a verysignificant biological advantage, includingstudents who have thesize andstrength of a male but identify as female andstudents who are taking male hormones in order to transition from female to male.”Alito also warned that this ruling may affect professionalsports, as well. Indeed, women in Connecticut are challenging aschool rule that forces them to compete with biological males. Even the, which has published an article calling for Child Protective Services to remove gender-confused kids from their parents if the parents won’t give them experimental transgender drugs, also published an article condemning the “intolerable unfairness” of the Olympic Committee’s pro-transgender rules.“may lead to Title IX cases against any college that resists assigningstudents of the opposite biologicalsex as roommates,” Alito warns. It may also force rape crisis centers for women to admit biological males who claim to identify as women. Onesuch center has already been vandalized with transgenderslogans, andsome centers have fought long legal battles over the right to allowsafe harbor only for women. Alito cites “briefs filed by a wide range of religious groups––Christian, Jewish, and Muslim–– [that] express deep concern that the position now adopted by the Court ‘will trigger open conflict with faith-based employment practices of numerous churches,synagogues, mosques, and other religious institutions.’ They argue that ‘[r]eligious organizations need employees who actually live the faith,’ and that compelling a religious organization to employ individuals whose conduct flouts the tenets of the organization’s faith forces the group to communicate an objectionable message.”Alito warns that this problem is “perhaps most acute” in the employment of teachers. “Aschool’sstandards for its faculty ‘communicate a particular way of life to itsstudents,’ and a ‘violation by the faculty of those precepts’ may undermine theschool’s ‘moral teaching.’ Thus, if a religiousschool teaches thatsex outside marriage andsex reassignment procedures are immoral, the message may be lost if theschool employs a teacher who is in asame-sex relationship or has undergone or is undergoingsex reassignment.”“Healthcare benefits may emerge as an intense battleground under the Court’s holding,” Alito warns. “Transgender employees have broughtsuit under Title VII to challenge employer-provided health insurance plans that do not cover costlysex reassignmentsurgery.”“Such claims present difficult religious liberty issues becausesome employers and healthcare providers havestrong religious objections tosex reassignment procedures, and therefore requiring them to pay for or to perform these procedures will have asevere impact on their ability to honor their deeply held religious beliefs,” he explains. Indeed, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)just finalized a rule rightly definingsex as biologicalsex and reversing the Obama administration on these issues. Doesmake that HHS rule unconstitutional?Alito warns that “the Court’s decision may even affect the way employers address their employees and the way teachers andschool officials addressstudents. Under established English usage, twosets ofsex-specificsingular personal pronouns are used to refer tosomeone in the third person (he, him, and his for males;she, her, and hers for females). Butseveral differentsets of gender-neutral pronouns have now been created and are preferred bysome individuals who do not identify as falling into either of the two traditional categories.”“Some jurisdictions,such as New York City, have ordinances making the failure to use an individual’s preferred pronoun a punishable offense, andsome colleges havesimilar rules. After today’s decision, plaintiffs may claim that the failure to use their preferred pronoun violates one of the federal laws prohibitingsex discrimination,” the justice warns. While Title VII cases are different from cases about the Fourteenth Amendment, Alito warns that“may exert a gravitational pull in constitutional cases. Under our precedents, the Equal Protection Clause prohibitssex-based discrimination unless a ‘heightened’standard of review is met. By equating discrimination because ofsexual orientation or gender identity with discrimination because ofsex, the Court’s decision will be cited as a ground forsubjecting all three forms of discrimination to thesame exactingstandard of review.”“Under this logic, today’s decision may have effects that extend well beyond the domain of federal anti discriminationstatutes. This potential is illustrated by pending and recent lower court cases in which transgender individuals have challenged a variety of federal,state, and local laws and policies on constitutional grounds,” Alito warns. Although thesix justices in the majority on likely had honorable intentions in redefining the word “sex” and effectively making law in this decision, it was “irresponsible” for them not to consider its wide-ranging consequences, Alito warns.“The updating desire to which the Courtsuccumbs no doubt arises from humane and generous impulses. Today, many Americans know individuals who are gay, lesbian, or transgender and want them to be treated with the dignity, consideration, and fairness that everyone deserves,” he writes. Evenso, “The Court’s brusque refusal to consider the consequences of its reasoning is irresponsible.”“If the Court had allowed the legislative process to take its course, Congress would have had the opportunity to consider competing interests and might have found a way of accommodating at leastsome of them.” Instead, the Supreme Court has made law, just like it did inandObergefell v. Hodges.",1,0,PJ Media
333,Tribe sues feds over policing,-1.67,46.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/12/18/northern-cheyenne-sues-feds-over-policing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,15,"The BIA is an agency within the Department of Interior. The tribe relies on the BIA for law enforcementservices on the reservation, which it described as chronically inadequate.“The Tribe has been dissatisfied with the level of law enforcementservice provided by the Bureau forseveral years and has attempted to work with the Bureau to address the issues, including a lack of qualified officers assigned to the Reservation and a lack of adequate criminal investigations,” the complaintstates. The lawsuit comes after the tribe and others — including Montana’s two U. S.senators — have complained about high crime rates and too few police officers to effectively respond to calls and conduct investigations. According to the BIA, itshould have at least 19 law enforcementstaff members on the reservation, the lawsuit claims. But over the lastseveral years, an average of fewer thansix have been assigned there. At times there is only one officer on duty, the lawsuit alleges, making it difficult or impossible to respond to every call for help. In a Thursdaystatement, Donna Fisher, the tribe’s president,said the tribe and its citizens “have paid the high price of violent crime, including missing and murdered indigenous women, unlawful drug use and distribution, and other crimes” as a result of the BIA’s failure to provide adequate policing.“BIA, which issolely responsible for enforcing the criminal laws on the Reservation, has fallen down on thissacred trust andstatutory obligation for many years,” Fishersaid. The tribe’s complaints culminated over thesummer when astring of homicides on the reservation prompted Montana’s U. S.senators, Jon Tester and Steve Daines, to urge the federal government on the tribe’s behalf to increase the number of officers and investigations on the reservation and improve communication with tribal leaders and victims’ families. Dainesmet with tribal leaders in Octoberto discuss their concerns. Tester, in an Oct. 30 letter, asked for an update on whatsteps BIA was taking to address the complaints. Asimple way to begin addressing crime rates on Northern Cheyenne land, Testersaid, is to increase the number of officers available to respond to crimes and other calls for help — a responsibility hesaid falls to the federal government.“We have to have enough police officers on the ground to protect the people … And I think what adds to thesituation in Indian Country is our trust responsibility,” hesaid in an early December interview with Montana Free Press. “We do have an obligation to makesure we’re doing right.”After the tribe and others raised concerns over thesummer, the tribe began working to take over responsibility for criminal investigations and drug enforcement on the reservation from the BIA. Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, tribes can apply to take over roles,such as policing, otherwise assigned to the federal government. On July 20, the tribesent a letter to BIAstating its intent to apply to assume criminal investigation and drug enforcement duties, according to the lawsuit. The tribesubmitted its application Aug. 19. Butsince then, the tribe alleges, the government violated theself determination act bystalling consideration of the application, failing toshare information necessary to complete an accurate application, and failing to offer guidance before ultimately denying the proposal on Nov. 17, based on a variety of inadequacies in the application. According to the tribe’s lawsuit, many of the reasons the BIA offered for the denial violated theself determination act. Fisher’sstatementsaid the tribe is asking the court for an injunction ordering BIA to accept the tribe’s proposals. Neither the BIA nor the Interior Department, which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to em ailsseeking comment. In his Oct. 30 letter, Tester urged the agency to provide any assistance or information necessary for the Northern Cheyenne to complete the application process.“Senator Tester believes it’s imperative that the federal government upholds its trust and treaty responsibilities and work hand-in-hand with Tribes to advanceself-determination,” Testerspokesman Roy Loewensteinsaid in an emailedstatement. Daines, in an emailedstatement,said, “It’s unacceptable that the BIA continues to play these bureaucratic games with the Northern Cheyenne.”“Montana’s tribes need to be empowered to ensure thesafety of their communities,” hesaid. The Montana GOP uninvited a planned conventionspeaker amid U. S. Senate drama. The Helena City Commission is considering whether to ask voters to approve added taxes to pay for a new firestation and additional police officers and firefighters.

334,Crowded Field of Mayoral Candidates Zooming Toward Primary Day,-4.33,47.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/18/crowded-field-of-mayoral-candidates-zooming-toward-primary-day/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-18,17,"“Zoom is not our friend. I just want to be very clear.”Andrew Yang was reflecting on the joy of campaigning, even during a pandemic. He was getting to know his cityso well. People were thrilled tosee him in thestreets. The front-running mayoral candidate,speaking to reporters in Harlem on a frigid March day,seemed also to be growing aware of all he would probably miss: the teeming block parties, the raucous parades, thesubway platforms thronged at rush hour.“Most New Yorkers aresick and tired of Zoom,” Yang added. “I think a lot of the country issick and tired of Zoom.”Though relatively few New Yorkers may be aware of this fact, they will probably be choosing their mayor for the next eight years three months from now, on June 22. In heavily Democratic New York City, the primary winner willsteamroll over nominal GOP opposition. Incumbents usually get re-elected — Bill de Blasio, for all his challenges, easily did. But this mayoral race, for many reasons, is unlike any other. The vaccination pace is heating up, but COVID-19still lingers as a threat,shrinking crowds and keeping commuters at home. Mass death rates, along with job losses, have taken asignificant toll. In 2013, the last time there was an open Democratic primary, candidates jostled for attention for many months, the race culminating in an election at the close of a turbulentsummer. Hundreds of town halls,street festivals, parades, and rallies built to asatisfying crescendo. There were no fewer than three front-runners — City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, thescandalous Anthony Weiner, and, finally, de Blasio — plus a city comptroller’s race that featuredEliot Spitzer, the governor who resigned after he was caughtsoliciting a prostitute. These days, the primary is in June, not September. After a federal judge ruled that congressional primaries be moved to June to allowsufficient time to get absentee ballots to military voters for the general election, thestate legislature eventually decided toset all primaries in June, including the mayoral race. This year,such a condensed contest will probably benefit those who’ve already built upsupport bases around the city. Yang is well-known to most New Yorkers from his long-shot presidential bid, but the rest of the field is not. The parades and parties aren’t yet materializing. There will be relatively few opportunities to meet voters face-to-face. The race, many campaigns believe, may be decided wholly onscreens — traditional cable television, digital advertising, and whatever online chatter can be generated.“In this race right now, it’s really hard to do any level of retail campaigning,”says Peter Ragone, a formersenior adviser to de Blasio and a veteran Democratic operative. “It’s really going to be, number one, are you on television? And are you creating any content yourself that has huge levels of engagement?”A traditional Democratic primary in New York City is arrayed around huge parades, captivatingstunts for television, and other mass events. All the candidates in 2013 pressed the flesh at the famous West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, with Weinerblaring musica ndshouting through a bullhorn on his blue and orange float. The Democratsallstaged asleep over at a public housing development with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Bill Thompson, the runner-up in the race, dragged reporters on a 24-hour tour of New York City,bringing them to a frozen meat locker in the pre-dawn hours. Top candidates would routinely invite reporters along for trips to thesubway and door-knocking expeditions. Every day promised another debate, a rally withsupporters, or a visit to a community center,synagogue, or nursing home. Everywhere were the voters — it was an imperfectsystem, but ordinary people, on a given afternoon on Broadway or in the South Bronx, could run into the future mayor andstrike up a conversation. For the campaigns themselves, there was a feedback loop that is clearly missing now. A campaign event, if well-attended or interesting enough, could draw journalists and end up on the nightly news. This footage could be used for paid television ads a month later. Journalists, meanwhile, could attempt to gauge how well a candidate might be connecting with New Yorkers. Were they becoming increasingly recognizable? Did they have notable interactions with voters?“In every other campaign I’ve worked on, the retail campaigning is front and center. Not only do you get to meet voters, reporters havesomething to cover, television newsstories have rallies to get pictures of, and there’s this whole ecosystem of political communication that goes on apart from paid advertising,”says a top ad maker attached to one of the current mayoral campaigns.“This time around, because we haveso little capacity to do old-fashioned handshakes and hugs and big rallies, there’s going to be a greater reliance on paid communication to reach voters — radio, digital, and direct mail.”This isn’t the first campaign to be run during the pandemic. Last year, numerous candidates forstate office in New York had tosuspend operations and recalibrate for a June primary that came right after the peak number of coronavirus deaths in the city. Door-knocking was ditched and campaigns turned to glossy mailers, digital ads, and phone calls to reach as many voters as they could. But these were allsmall-scale campaigns, operating in districts where fewer than 20,000 people could vote. The mayoral primary is expected to draw anywhere from 700,000 to a million voters, with many campaigns planning for aspike from the middling 2013 turnout. To make matters more challenging, voters have other pressing concerns. The pandemic is on the wane but remains a concrete, unsettling reality. Then there are thescandalssurrounding Governor Andrew Cuomo, all-consuming online, in the newspapers, and on cable television. Granular, daily coverage of the mayoral race — the typeseen in 2013 — has been far less evident.“All of our attention is drawn tostuff that isn’t the mayoral race,”said Micah Lasher, campaign manager for Scott Stringer, the city comptroller and one of the leading candidates. The top campaigns are gearing up for heavy cable TV expenditures in the months to come in the hope of breaking through. Most of the campaigns expect to dedicate a far largershare of theirspending on television than they would have in a more ordinary year. Others, like the progressive Dianne Morales, who reported thatshe just qualified for public matching funds, are leaning heavily into digital campaigning, rapidly accruing online followings. One of the mayoral candidates, the financial executive Ray McGuire, is not participating in the public matching fundssystem at all, a move that will allow him tospend as much as he wants — those abiding by the Campaign Finance Board’s regulations receive generous matching funds in return for adhering to astrictspending cap — but also permit his rivals tospend more as well. Aspokesman for the CFBsaid a determination on whether to raise the cap in the race will be made after April 26, the final deadline for candidates to join the matching funds program. Thesystem is designed to incentivizesmall-donor giving. While a mayoral campaign can receive a $2,000 check, only donations up to $250 are eligible to be matched, amplifying the power of a $25 or $50 donation. Based on the CFB’s criteria, all participating campaigns will be able tospend at leastseveral million more. The current cap, at about $7.3 million, rises to $10,929,000 if a nonparticipating candidatespends at least $3,643,000. (Surpassing $21,858,000, which the billionaire Michael Bloomberg routinely did, would mean lifting the cap entirely.)McGuire is no billionaire, but he has alreadyspent more than $3.7 million. Raising the cap would most benefit the candidates who have raised enough to take advantage of it: Yang, Stringer, Eric Adams, and former de Blasio counsel Maya Wiley, whose campaign has recently reached the matching threshhold. Stringer and Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, have already banked more than $6 and $7 million respectively. For campaigns, TV advertising is the least efficient but most effective way of reaching a broadswath of voters. Enough older Democrats arestill watching CNN and MSNBC every day, as well as localstations like NY1. The ads cannot be perfectly tailored or targeted like digitalsolicitations on Facebook — a resident of New Jersey can end upseeing a 30-secondspot for a mayoral candidate — but they can reach, on a given day, hundreds of thousands or millions of people. It is all exceedingly expensive: astrong ad buy can easily run $1 million a week. With multiple candidatesspending millions to purchase ads, there’s a fear of being drowned out. At thesame time,notbeing there carries great risk, with a rival hogging precious airtime. A Democrat attempting to break into the top tier, Shaun Donovan, a veteran of the Obama and Bloomberg administrations, has already beenspending on weekly TV ads. (Outside Super PACs are alsostepping up for Donovan and McGuire.)To complicate the picture in 2021, well-funded candidates will be targeting popular connected TVservicessuch as Roku, Hulu, and Apple TV, which were barely part of the mix in 2013. De Blasio won that race eight years ago for many reasons, including Weiner’s implosion and de Blasio’s own disciplined, anti-Bloomberg messaging, but television played a decisive role. De Blasio was prescient, dedicating a largershare of his campaignspending to television advertising than his rivals and foregoing direct mail. Years later, the“Dante” ad isstill discussed in mythic terms: how 30seconds of de Blasio’s biracialson talking about his father’s promise to “really break from the Bloomberg years” captivated Democratic voters and entered the popular culture. Most ads don’t carrysuch emotional impact — at best, they may introduce a candidate, make an argument, or attack a rival. Yang is the public polling leader,and could be, in the weeks to come, the focus of negative advertising, particularly if a wealthy interest group or labor union aligned with a rival decides tospend against him.“It’s not a paper endorsement,”says Kyle Bragg, the president of the influential building workers’ union, 32BJ SEIU.“Our members aresuper engaged voters.” 32BJ, likeseveral other large unions in the city, is backing Adams, who isshaping up to be Yang’s top rival. Yang hasshunned negative campaigning thus far, while Adams has criticized Yang forleaving the city in the earlystages of the pandemic. Some of the Adams-supporting unions could train their fire at Yang if they view him as a durable threat. To drive media coverage, Yang has relied on his Twitter feed, with 2 million followers, and, unlike most of his rivals, frequent in-person campaignstops. Recently, he hasstarted appearing with opponents at events, like the press conference in Harlemto promote an app forsmall businesses envisioned by Kathryn Garcia, a Democratic contender and the former Department of Sanitation Commissioner. Thesesorts of team-ups have grown more common as candidates vie to besecond choices for voters who can now rank up to five candidates. According to Yang’s campaign, media turnout was much higher than a typical press conference, thanks to the unusual nature of a multi-candidate appearance. In 2013, one of de Blasio’s fiercest rivals in the early months was John Liu, the city comptroller at the time. Liu was renowned for his vigorous campaignschedule, appearing at as many as a dozen rallies, block parties, andsubwaystops a day. Now astatesenator, and happily watching the race from thesidelines, Liusays the candidates must learn to adapt to the new normal: lots of Zoom, lots of TV, and a lot of time online. And get used to not being the center of attention.“It’s New York City. At what given moment is there not a whole lot ofshit going down?” Liu asks. “In 2013, we had months of the Weiner circus. I think candidates can be thankful they don’t have to deal with that.”❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

335,"Through wildland firefighting, finding a space to heal",0.0,40.0,https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.1/ideas-wildfire-through-wildland-firefighting-finding-a-space-to-heal,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-24,16,"I write this on Oct. 25,as another fire-weather watch is declared over Northern California. I can hear the windscreaming past the windows,straining the trees. I know from experience that this wind can make aspark rip through dried grass and brush in an instant. Every time a gust picks up, I feel a knot tighten in my gut. Westerners try to control fire with chainsaws, fire retardant, bulldozers, and thesweat and blood of wild land firefighters. But in conditions like these, I am reminded of our helplessness against fire’s powerful indifference. For half a century, land-management agencies adhered to the “10 o’clock rule,” a requirement that all wildfires be extinguished by 10 a.m. the following day. Now, land managers know that wildfire is a natural part of the West. Good fires prevent bad ones;small-scale burns thin out excess vegetation and dead trees, thereby helping prevent large, destructive megafires. This year, however, our efforts feel insufficient. In college, Ispent theschool year learning about wildlife biology and thesummers fighting wildfire. The choice to work in the wilderness was clear. My dad taught me to love the outdoors. My earliest memories are of thesnow in the Sierras. At 3 years old, I lay on my back makingsnow angels,staring up at the pines in wonder. The trees loomed against the gray wintersky, impossibly high and imposing. Even then, I recognized their otherworldly beauty. My dad was the first toshow me the magic of the forest, the majesty of rivers and lakes, the quiet beauty of the desert. When he died, I was a teenager. Those trips to the mountains ended, and for a time,so did my experience of nature. I was working my first fireseason when I readThe Big Burnby Timothy Egan, which chronicles thestory of the U. S. Forest Service. I learned about the history of America’s public lands whilesitting within their legacy — how Gifford Pinchot and Teddy Roosevelt fought tooth and nail to protect America’s wild places from privatization, at a time when there was little concept of conservation. As a racially mixed kid from the Los Angelessuburbs, many times I was acutely aware of my difference, working on wild land fire crews where most of my co-workers were white men from rural backgrounds. I recognized the exclusionary nature of Western conservation, even as Istudied its heroes. On thesurface, I couldn’t have less in common with Roosevelt or Pinchot. But I identified with their love of nature, their desire to protect it, and, most of all, how natureserved as a balm to their grief. Both Pinchot and Rooseveltsuffered unimaginable losses. Both immersed themselves in wilderness looking for an answer to their grief. Roosevelt lost his wife, and then his mother, within thespace of a day. Pinchot’s fiancée died young of tuberculosis, and yet he continued to write to his love many years after her death. When he felt her presence, he would record a “clear day” in his journal. I felt a kinship with their loss; my father’s deathshaped my adolescence. I, too, ran to the forestseeking aspiritual reckoning. I heard my own answer during my first fireseason, and I continue to hear it to this day. Corey Brickley/High Country NewsThree years ago, my crew was assigned to asmall lightning fire by a lake in Northern California. The burn went through a rockyslope,scorching the ponderosa canopy above. The fire was already extinguished,so our job was to mop up any remaining hotspots. We went over every inch of its interior, turning over dirt,spraying water with backpack pumps between rock crevices. At the end of the day, I made my way down theslope, exhausted, my legs aching. The burned rockyslope bordered astream that flowed into the lake. Asmall wooden bridge went across thestream, connecting the trail to the oppositeside. The land on oneside of it was burned by fire, but the otherside was untouched. I crossed the bridge to a lush green forest. Broadleaf trees hung overhead in a dense canopy. Grass formed a thick carpet under my feet. The wet groundsank under my boots,still dusty with ash. Turning back, Isat on the bridge. Thesettingsunshone down on the lake, reflecting across the water. At that moment, I thought of my dad. I felt his overwhelming presence. The one thought thatsurpassed all others was, “It’s all right now.” I heard a clear answer to my grief and despair, an answer I can hear even now, in this time of uncertainty. I felt asense of peace in that beautiful place on the water, on a bridge balanced between life and destruction.",1,1,High Country News
336,QAnon moves into the shadows but movement remains active,-4.0,45.0,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/9/qanon-moves-into-the-shadows-but-movement-remains-active,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"On the face of it, the QAnon conspiracy appears to have largely disappeared from bigsocial mediasites. But that is not quite the case. Popular QAnon catch phrases like “great awakening,” “thestorm” or “trust the plan” are less prevalent on Facebook these days. Facebook and Twitter have removed tens of thousands of accounts dedicated to the baseless conspiracy theory, which depicts former President Donald Trump as a hero fighting asecret battle against asect of devil-worshipping paedophiles who dominate Hollywood, big business, the media and government. Gone are the huge “Stop the Steal” groups thatspread falsehoods about the 2020 US presidential elections. Trump is gone as well, banned from Twitter permanently andsuspended from posting on Facebook until 2023. But QAnon is far from winding down. Federal intelligence officials recently warned that its adherents could commit more violence, like the deadly Capitol insurrection on January 6. At least one opensupporter of QAnon has been elected to Congress,Marjorie Taylor Greene. In the four yearssincesomeone calling themselves “Q”started posting enigmatic messages on fringe internet discussions boards, QAnon has grown up. QAnon now encompasses a variety of conspiracy theories, from evangelical or religious angles to alleged paedophilia in Hollywood and theJeffrey Epsteinscandal,said Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab who focuses on domestic extremism. “Q-specificstuff issort of dwindling,” hesaid. But the world views and conspiracy theories that QAnon absorbed arestill around. Loosely tying these movements together is a general distrust of a powerful, often left-wing elite. Among them are purveyors of anti-vaccine falsehoods, adherents of Trump’s “Big Lie” that the 2020 presidential election wasstolen and believers in just about any other world view convinced that ashadowy cabalsecretly controls things. Forsocial platforms, dealing with this faceless,shifting and increasingly popular mindset is a far more complicated challenge than they have dealt with in the past. These ideologies “have cemented their place and now are a part of American folklore”,said Max Rizzuto, another researcher at DFRLab. “I don’t think we’ll eversee it disappear.”Online,such groups now blend into the background. Where Facebook groups once openly referenced QAnon, now groups are titledsuch as, “Since you missed this in theso called MSM,” a page referencing “mainstream media” that boasts more than 4,000 followers. It features links to clips of Fox News’s Tucker Carlson and articles from right-wing publicationssuch as Newsmax and the Daily Wire. Subjects range from allegedly rampant crime to unfounded claims of widespread election fraud and an “outright war on conservatives”. Such groups aim to draw followers in deeper by directing them to further information on less-regulatedsitessuch as Gab orParler. When DFRLab analysed more than 40 million appearances of QAnon catch phrases and related terms onsocial media earlier this year, it found that their presence on mainstream platforms had declinedsignificantly in recent months. After peaks in mid-to-late 2020 and briefly on January 6, QAnon catch phrases have largely evaporated from mainstreamsites, DFRLab found. So while users might not be posting wild conspiracies about Hillary Clinton drinking children’s blood, they might instead be repeating debunked claims that vaccines can alter your DNA. There areseveral reasons for dwindling Q talk — Trump losing the presidential election, for instance, and the lack of new messages from “Q”. But thesingle biggest factor appears to have been the QAnon crackdown on Facebook and Twitter. Despite well-documented mistakes that revealedspotty enforcement, the banishment largely appears to have worked. It is more difficult to come across blatant QAnon accounts on mainstreamsocial mediasites these days, at least from the publicly available data that does not include, for instance, hidden Facebook groups and private messages. While QAnon groups, pages and core accounts may be gone, many of theirsupporters remain on the big platforms — only now they are camouflaging their language and watering down the most extreme tenets of QAnon to make them more palatable.“There was a very, very explicit effort within the QAnon community to camouflage their language,”said Angelo Carusone, the president and CEO of Media Matters, a liberal research group that has followed QAnon’s rise. “So theystopped using a lot of the codes, the triggers, the keywords that were eliciting the kinds of enforcement actions against them.”Other dodges may have also helped. Rather than parroting Qslogans, for instance, for a while earlier this year,supporters would type three asterisks next to their name tosignal adherence to the conspiracy theory. That is a nod to former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, a three-star general. Facebook hassaid it has removed about 3,300 pages, 10,500 groups, 510 events, 18,300 Facebook profiles and 27,300 Instagram accounts for violating its policy against QAnon. “We continue to consult with experts and improve our enforcement in response to how harm evolves, including by recidivist groups,” the companysaid in astatement. But thesocial giant willstill cut individuals posting about QAnonslack, citing experts who warned that banning individual Q adherents “may lead to furthersocial isolation and danger”, the companysaid. Facebook’s policies and response to QAnon continue to evolve. Since last August, the companysaid it has added dozens of new terms as the movement and its language has evolved. Twitter, meanwhile,said it has consistently taken action against activity that could lead to offline harm. After the January 6 insurrection, the company began permanentlysuspending thousands of accounts that itsaid were “primarily dedicated” tosharing dangerous QAnon material. Twittersaid it hassuspended 150,000such accounts to date. Like Facebook, the companysaid its response is also evolving. But the crackdown may have come too late. Carusone, for instance, noted that Facebook banned QAnon groups tied to violencesix weeks before it banned QAnon more broadly. That effectively gave followers notice to regroup, camouflage and move to different platforms.“If there were ever a time for asocial media company to take astand on QAnon content, it would have been like months ago, years ago,” DFRLabs’ Rizzutosaid.",2,2,Al Jazeera
337,"San Diego public schools can provide in-person enrichment and therapy to students, officials say",1.67,50.0,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2020-08-19/san-diego-public-schools-can-provide-in-person-enrichment-and-therapy-to-students-officials-confirm,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,20,"There is now a way San Diego County publicschools canservestudents on campus without applying for a waiver or breaking thestateschool closure mandate. Schools can offer in-person enrichment programs for free by using moneyset aside forstate- and federally-funded after-school programs. Whileschools can’t provide in-person classes, there are nostate rules prohibitingschools from offering other in-personsupport programs forstudents, County Superintendent Paul Gotholdsaid recently. Therefore the San Diego County Office of Education is allowing districts and charterschools to use after-school programs to provide enrichment activities, including academicsupport, during theschool day forsmall groups ofstudents, Gothold wrote in a letter last week to the county health department. In a win forstudents with disabilities, Gothold alsosaid there are no rules barring publicschools from providing in-person therapyservices orspecial education assessments tostudents one at a time — outdoors and by appointment. Students with disabilities have not been getting all theirspecial educationservices during the pandemic, andseveral parentssay theservices they are getting virtually don’t workso well for their kids.“In fact, educational agencies are required to provideservices to the extent possible and are responsible for ensuring that the needs of thesestudents are met,” Gothold wrote. “I cannot imagine that thestate or county intends to deny or further delay children with disabilities access to the individual assessment and therapyservices they need and are guaranteed by federal law.”Gotholdsaid the urgency toservestudents in need is too great to wait for morestate guidance.“We cannot delay any further while waiting for clarifying language from thestate; we must act now,” Gothold wrote. “It is a matter of equity for our most vulnerablestudents.”Thestate confirmed last week thatschools can offer on-campus enrichment through after-school programs. Thestate has yet to addresssolutions forspecial education. Gothold’s letter presents publicschools with options to counteract inequities that have emerged during the pandemic. In the absence of in-personschool, many parents with resources have been able to get in-person help for their kids more quickly than those without resources. They can pay tuition at privateschools, which arebetter-positioned than largeschool districts to apply forschool reopening waivers. They can pay for child care at licensed day cares. They also can pay for tutors to lead learning pods for their children. Meanwhilestudents with the highest needs — including homeless youth, foster youth, low-incomestudents, children of essential workers andstudents with disabilities — are less likely to be able to take advantage ofsuch opportunities. ASES, or the After School Education and Safety program, is thestate-funded after-school program that could providesolutions for thosestudents, along with 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which is asimilar federally-funded program. ASES programs are run by organizations like the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club in partnership withschools, and they are funded based on the numbers of low-incomestudents at aschool. There were 309 ASES programs in San Diego County lastschool year thatserved 45,690students, according to the San Diego County Office of Education. Someschool districts are offering child care but are charging fees. ASES is one of the only options that are free for families,said Kim McDougal, executive director of the YMCA Child Care Resource Service.“That’s a program we’re really prio rit izing getting open ... because itserves the most high-need families,” McDougalsaid. Chula Vista Elementary, the fourth-largest district in the county, is one of the first districts to take advantage of this new permission from the county office. Last week the district announced it will offer free enrichment programs through ASES for 1,500students assoon as Sept. 8. It also will offer fee-basedspots for another 500 children. Priority for enrichment programs will go to the children of Chula Vista teachers, foster and homeless youth, and other children in need, the districtsaid. The district had about 23,000students lastschool year.“To be able to do distance learning, we need to be able to provide options for our neediest families, and those include essential workers,” districtspokesman Anthony Millicansaid. “In our opinion this is an essential, protectiveservice for our most vulnerable populations.”The county education officesays that these after-school programs must keepstudents in fixed cohorts of 10 or fewerstudents. Students in third grade and higher will have to wear masks, while children in lower grades would be encouraged to wear masks, which is in line withstateschool guidance. Six-foot physical distancing also must be enforced. Some district officials are willing to bringstudents back to campus for ASES but not for regularschool. Chula Vista Elementary hassaid it will not apply for a reopening waiver because the COVID-19 levels are too high insouth San Diego County. ASES would involve bringing far fewerstudents back to campus, Millicansaid. And because ASES programs are run mostly by third-partystaff, the district also doesn’t have to bargain for the approval of teachers or otherstaff unions. Chula Vista’s teachers and teacher unions in other districts havesaid they do not want to return to campus until their local zip codes reach low COVID-19 levels and untilschools implementstringentsafety measures —some of which districtssay they may not be able to afford.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune
338,Democrats to lift ban on earmarks.,1.67,46.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/democrats-lift-ban-on-earmarks,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-16,16,"Congressional pork is back on the menu. Hello to everyone, except all my readers in Texas who apparentlystill don’t have any power. Today we’re talking about the return of earmarks. Plus, a reader question about what politicalstances will be deemed unacceptable 20 years from now. Earmarks. Also called member-directedspending, pork, pork-barrelling, bacon, fat, or fluff. Generallyspeaking,earmarksare funding or projects that get inserted into legislation at the request of asenator or representative, usually in an effort to earn that member of Congress’s vote. Typically, they are notspending commitments added onto a bill,so much as changes in “how the pie is cut.”Earmarks often come in the form ofspecial projects or funding that members of Congress direct back to their home districts. Hypothetically, if Democrats were one voteshort of passing an immigration bill, and they wanted to get Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on board butshe was hesitant, they might offer to include $20 million in an immigration bill for a hospital in the Bronx — that wayshe could go back to her district andsay, “look what I got for us.”For decades, earmarks were a critical part of pushing through major legislation. But in the early 2000s, the publicsoured on earmarks, beginning to view them as open bribes and wastefulspending after they became closely tied toseveralscandals. Perhaps most infamous was the “Bridge to Nowhere,” a$223 million earmark that was drafted in 2005 to connect the Alaskan town of Ketchikan to its nearby island airport. The earmark was lifted and the bridge never happened. There was also Jack Abramoff, the infamous lobbyist who went to prison on fraud charges tied to earmarks being used as bribes. In 2007, Democrats tried to tamp down public criticism of earmarks by instituting reforms around them that required public disclosure of earmark requests. Then in 2011, when Republicans took over the House of Representatives, earmarks were banned. This had a big impact on legislating. As you can imagine, a potent tool to win over votes with whatsome call a “legislative bribe” is quite effective — and the result of not being able to use it was equallysignificant. In 2018, former President Trump actuallysuggested to members they reinstate earmarks as a way to clear the path for immigration reform. Now, though, Democrats are the ones who look poised to bring them back. With control of Congress, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) are the respective chairs of the House and Senate Appropriations panels, which oversee rules like this. And in the coming weeks, they’re reportedly planning to reinstate earmarks. Leahy and DeLaurosay the new earmarks will be transparent, with disclosures about who requested them and what entity is getting the money. They alsosay members will not be able to request them for entities that they have financial ties to, or for for-profit institutions,according to Punchbowl News. They will be limited tostate and local governments and nonprofits. The left issupportive of bringing earmarks back with tighter regulation and oversight. In The Atlantic,Annie Lowrey argued that earmarks were exactly what Democrats need to win over moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin, asking “Whyshouldn’t Democrats curry his favor with a fewsky bridges and concert halls?”“At its peak, pork-barrelspending made up a tinysliver of the government budget,”she wrote. “Earmarks were never that wasteful either. Most of the money went to reasonable projects — bridges, community centers, worker-training programs,schools. Those are the kinds of things the government exists to finance. Voters like them, communities need them, and members of Congress, with their intimate knowledge of their district, are often pretty good at knowing where to put them.“Since the demise of the earmark, both Republicans and Democrats have voiced their quiet lamentations about the lost opportunities tosecure money for needed projects and to win over their colleagues’ votes,”shesaid. “Even former Speaker of the House John Boehner—who, as a matter of principle, neversought or got an earmark for his Ohio district—has bemoaned the loss,saying that a little pork would help ‘herd the cats’ on the Hill.”In a 2018 piece,then Vox reporter Jonathan Allen wrote that earmarksshould come back with reforms that limit the amount of money and create more transparency,similar to what Democrats are proposing.“The problem wasn't in the earmarks, it was in the process that doled them out,” hesaid. “Until the very end — when Congress tried tosave thesystem — thesponsors of earmarks weren't publicly named. The money was distributed based on political calculation — to increase the power of a particular appropriator or help vulnerable party members win re-election — rather than beingspread equitably or based on the merits of the projects competing for cash. There was no vetting tosafeguard against lawmakers exchanging earmarks for campaign money.”The right is mostly opposed to earmarks. Whilesome concede the practice could grease the wheels of Congress, there is a general belief that it’s been proven to be ineffective and to breed corruption. In Roll Call,Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) wrote that“Pork was taken off the menu (temporarily, I guess) a decade ago after years of politicians literally pigging out on taxpayer dollars, earmarking millions forspecial interests and their own pet projects, like that infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska. Some even went to jail for exchanging bribes over congressional pork. But now Congress wants to bring the bacon back to the legislative process.“Defense earmarks are especially harmful because they take away critical research and development funds and direct them to things that have value to the military or will actively harm our troops,”she wrote. “The Navy was forced to buy luxuryspeedboats they didn’t need,so they turned around and gave them to a local college. Second, the Marines were forced to buy ‘combat’ T-shirts that would have burned their bodies if they were caught in a fire in Iraq or Afghanistan. You can’t make thisstuff up. Instead of putting taxpayer money to good, important use — like researching and developing new technologies and weaponry — the largest government agency blew it.”In 2019,The Wall Street Journal editorial board tried to nip talk of reinstating earmarks in the bud.“Some Republicans have been nostalgic for better times that never existed,” the boardsaid. “President Trump waxed last year about the ‘great friendliness’ when earmarks ruled. The claim is that earmarks make it easier to pass legislation, and this might be a worthwhile conservative trade if it meant Congress could pull together majorities for,say,something big like entitlement reform. Slices of pork wouldsupposedly be the grease for difficult but essential reform that wouldshrink the burden of government. In our observation, the opposite is closer to the truth: Earmarks grease theskids for bigger government.“None of today’s gridlock would be overcome by earmarks,” the board wrote. “Democrats aren’t going to give President Trump a political victory in return for a local courthouse. A bike path in Portland wouldn’t have won the vote of Maine Senator Susan Collins to repeal ObamaCare.”The best argument for restoring earmarks is that Congress has beenslowly abdicating its responsibility to the presidency. Consolidated, unchecked executive power is a great concern of mine — and itshould be one of yours, too. From Bush to Obama to Trump and now Biden, presidential power is running more unchecked every term. Starting wars,spending tax dollars andsigning executive orders in the place of legislating is the new norm on bothsides. And, as has been well argued, earmarks could be a way to get Congress moving again. Membersshould have a vested interest in everyspending bill, but the cold truth is they don’t, and earmarks could bring that interest back. Still, color meskeptical. Last time we had earmarks,some members of Congress were trading those dollars for campaign contributions, lobbyists were begging for earmarked cash in exchange for campaignsupport, and entire firms were created to help facilitate these transactions. Worse yet, there’s a good argument they didn’t do much to help underserved districts:numerous reportsshow that more influential members of Congress received the bulk of earmarked money while lesser-known members failed to “bring home the bacon.”As Linda Stamato noted in her NJ.com piece,which is worth reading, a practice openly described as “organized bribery” by the people advocating for it (as The New York Times editorial boarddid) is not exactly the way to reinstate public trust in a broken institution. She also pointed out that a Congressional Research Service reportshowed even theseemingly good ones, like money for hospitals, “didn’t reflect an analysis of hospital needs forstates as a whole and they didn’t originate from requests from the Department of Health and Human Services. Other hospitals, having greater need, but lacking political heft, gained nothing at all.”It’s also true that just as earmarks can grease the wheels of Congress, they can also bring it to ascreeching halt. As it turns out, earmarks aren’t just used by a Congressional majority or leadership tosweeten the pot for a dissenting member — they’re also used by dissenting members to hold the Congressional majority or leadership hostage. Take the example at the beginning of this newsletter and turn it on its head: what if AOC refused tosupport a billshe got that hospital? How is that greasing the wheels?Finally, I’mskeptical of the efforts for reform. Theysometimesseem in good faith on bothsides, but we’re ultimately relying on Congress to regulate itself. Even an all-out ban on earmarks actually produced different workaroundsfor porked-upspending — loopholes thatshould be closed too, rather than used as proof that you can’tstop members from finding ways tospend on pet projects. Even if the requests are public, the root of those requests — the true reasons — will remain behind closed doors and out of public view, and by the time we get answers the bills and earmarks will be out the door. Congress had its chance to earmark responsibly and blew it — that they can’t legislate now is no reason to reward them for the crimes of the past. I love this question, and imagine I could write a whole newsletter on it (I just might). For thesake of brevity, I’ll give three big ones that come to mind:Fighting for non-renewable energy jobs. Obviously, the progressive left has already moved past this, butsomething like f racking isstillsuch a hot-button issue that Joe Biden wouldn’t take an oppositionalstance on it while campaigning in Pennsylvania. The next generation is very, very left on climate change. And whether you think humans are a primary cause or not (I think we are), the fact that our environment issick is more apparent every day. Even worse for the people fighting “climate-friendly” initiatives: none of this is going to change anytimesoon. Even if the leftmost climate activists fighting tostop all emissions got what they wanted, the experts tell us it would take decades of focused action to undo much of the damage already done, meaning in 20 years, our progressstill wouldn’t be obvious. But when watershortagesstart regularly popping up in America, along with things like the increasing frequency of extreme wildfires, droughts and floods, the political lexicon is going toshift even further. I also think acquiescence to China will be a political death knell. I’m cautious not tosound like a fear-monger in China and aware I’ve written a lot about this recently; but plenty of trends point to their economic and global dominance as worldsuperpower (a position the U. S. currently occupies) in the next 20-30 years. I’m imagining a world where China’s influence on trade and its militarystrength give it a more powerful position than the U. S. on the globalstage, even amongst our European allies, and Democrats who havespent the last decade becoming intertwined in corporate and Chinese interests will look very, very bad in retrospect. Finally, the moderate position on crime and criminal justice today will look as bad as Biden’s positions in the 1990s do now. I think moderate Democrats and many Republicans willseem unthinkably draconian in 20 years, while progressives, Libertarians and a big chunk of the anti-establishment “Trump base” willseem forward-thinking. My belief is the next great civil rights movement will be the rights of incarcerated people in the U. S. I actually think we’re already at the beginningstages of it. To the next generation of voters, a criminal justicesystem thatseeks to punishsomeone rather than rehabilitate them will look absurd. The reality of more than two million people currently languishing in cages will be far more embedded in the public consciousness than it is now. The reality ofsomeone beingstuck in prison because they can’t pay for bail at a time of egregious income inequality will become reprehensible. Trump’s embrace ofsome criminal justice reforms planted theseeds of this on the right, while civil Libertarians and progressives were already there. In 20 years, I think it’ll be asliver of a minority position tosupport being “tough on crime,” and a lot of the peoplesupporting that position now will not be looked on favorably in 20 years. The winter weather that tore through Texas this week has left nearly five million people without power. It’s alsoset off a robust debate about how the largest energy producingstate in the U. S. can fail to make it through a week of below-freezing temperatures without rolling blackouts. The Wall Street Journal editorial board was quick to blame the outages on a move away from coal and nuclear power and an over-reliance on wind andsolar. At thesame time, articles like one in The Washington Post framed the unprecedented weather as a product of climate change. The diametrically opposed reactions illustrate the challenges clean energy will face in this political climate, and could be a look into the future asstates across the U. S. modernize their energy grids with renewables.

339,Undersheriff Indicted In CA Concealed Carry Bribery Scandal,5.17,40.83,https://bearingarms.com/cam-e/2020/11/21/undersheriff-indicted-bribery-scandal/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-21,18,"A top official in the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office was indicted on Friday, becoming the fifth person to date to face criminal charges for allegedly participating in a pay-to-playscheme in which a number of individuals received their licenses to carry after first makingsizeable donations to a committeeset up to re-elect Sheriff Laurie Smith. Undersheriff Rick Sung is Smith’ssecond-in-command in Santa Clara, and he now joinssheriff’s Capt. James Jensen as the first two members of the department to face indictments in the probe. Jensen was first indictedseveral months ago, but a new charge was added along with Sung’s charges by a grand jury empaneled to investigate the bribery accusations. Thespecific charges are not yet known, but Santa Clara County D. A. Jeff Rosen is promising to release more detailsat a press conference on Monday morning. To date, three people have pleaded guilty to participating in an allegedscheme in which prosecutors accuse members of an executive protection firm of conspiring with two attorneys and a gun manufacturer to make campaign donations to an independent expenditure fund in exchange for permits to carry concealed weapons. AS Solution CEO Christian West entered a plea a few months ago. Two of his managers, Martin Nielsen and Jack Stromgren, followedsuit in October. The other defendants include attorneys Christopher Schumb and Harpaul Nahal and The Gun Co. owner Michael Nichols. Sheriff Laurie Smith—who, like other top cops in California, has the authority to issue the gun permits—has not been charged with a crime. When Smith testified before the grand jury,she invoked her Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination in response to almost every question that was posed to her. So did Sung, with his attorneysuggesting at the time that thesheriff and hersecond-in-commandshouldn’t be consideredsuspects in the probe.“He asserted his rights based upon my advice, based upon my understanding of the case. It was the wisest course for him to take,” Chuck Smithsaid Friday. He also defended Sung against being implicated by association with the case.“He wassubpoenaed as a witness. Not as asuspect, not as a target of the grand jury,” Chuck Smithsaid. “Based upon that, I don’t believe he’s culpable of any wrongdoing.”Well, clearly the prosecutor disagrees, and I’m very interested to learn thespecifics of the charges against Sung come Monday. In the meantime, Sheriff Smith isstill clinging to office, despite the briberyscandal and calls for her tostep down by many locals, including the editorial board of the, which demanded Smith’s resignation back in September. I’m in agreement with the paper that it’s time for thesheriff to go, but that’s not the only change that’s needed. Until California removes the broad discretion thatsheriffs have in approving or denying carry licenses based on a “justifiable need,” the opportunity for graft and corruption is going to remain a temptation for corruptible cops. By refusing to change the law, legislators in Sacramento aren’t just turning a blind eye to the growing briberyscandal in Santa Clara County; they’re enablingsheriffs departments in other counties to engage in thesame type of illicit activity at the expense of our trust in law enforcement the lawful exercise of our constitutional rights.",1,0,Bearing Arms

342,One District’s COVID-19 Journey: A Year of Upheaval and Unexpected Insights,0.0,45.0,https://www.edweek.org/leadership/one-districts-covid-19-journey-a-year-of-upheaval-and-unexpected-insights/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,25,"Principal Dave Peters was judging astudent talentshow at Henry M. Jackson High School in the Everett, Wash.,school district on Feb. 28 of last year when his cell phone rang. It was the districtsuperintendent with news that a Jackson Highstudent had tested positive for the then-novel coronavirus. The district was alerting families that the building would close for 72 hours for deep cleaning and reopen for classes the following Tuesday. The auditoriumsoonstarted buzzing as parents got the notifications. That case—believed to be the first K-12student in the country with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis—and thesubsequentschoolshutdown made the threat of the coronavirus very real for many in this Seattlesuburb. It proved a bellwether of the nationwide disruption ofschooling that continues to this day. By March 12, the Everett leadership team had decided to close all of Everett’s 29schools for two weeks. Two weeks turned intosix weeks, after Gov. Jay Insleeshut downschoolsstatewide, then became the entirespringsemester. It would be nearly a year before childrenset foot back in the district’s buildings for classes—and even then, the majority of the district’s nearly 20,000students remain in remote or hybrid instruction. With millions ofstudents nationwidestill locked out of in-person instruction andschoolssweating over how to welcome them backsafely, Everett’s teachers, parents,students, and administrators are reflecting on what they’ve lost and what they’ve learned over the course of two interruptedschool years. The coronavirus had been hovering around Everettsince it first appeared in the country in January 2020: The first U. S. COVID-19 patient was treated at Everett’s Providence Regional Medical Center. About a week after the Jackson High case, an Everett elementaryschoolshut down because of a positive COVID-19 case. Then on March 5, the Northshore School District, about 20 milessouth, closed all of itsschools to prepare for remote learning.“We are talking about thespan of about a week and a half, when you are notsure what’s happening and then everyone is closing,”said Michael Takayoshi, who was in his first year as principal at Everett’s Cascade High School.“It wasso fast that you didn’t have time to even contextualize or come to terms with it.”Jen Hirman and her husband, Joe, had been discussing whether to pull their two children out ofschool as the new virus marched across the globe. They had already equipped Elizabeth, an 11th grader at Jackson High, and Amanda, a 7th grader at Heatherwood Middle School, with handsanitize rs and advised them not to feel guilty about avoiding people who were displaying flu-likesymptoms.“All of asudden yousee Jackson High on the news,” Jen Hirmansaid. “That’s our highschool principal, that’s oursuperintendent on CNN … For us, it was ourschool and our community. And it definitely brought it home. It brought it home very clearly—that it’s here, and it’s real.”Heather Paddock, the principal of James Monroe Elementary School,still gets emotional thinking about that last day of in-personschooling last March, when herstaff prepared take-home packets forstudents, telling them they’dsee them in a few weeks. Shestood at the bottom of thestairs bidding them goodbye.“I definitely felt uncertain,”shesaid. “No one had a crystal ball at the ready.”Jared Kink, the president of the Everett Education Association, who taught math andsocialstudies in the district before taking over the union job, remembersseeing teachers in tears in their cars after packing up for the day.“They hadspent the daysaying goodbye to their kids; they had gathered everything in their classrooms,” Kinksaid. “They had held it together for the kids to makesure they were OK ... and then when the kids left, it all collapsed on them. ... That’s a memory that willstick in my mind for a really long time.”“There was high anxiety, highsense of urgency, lots of unknowns, and quite a bit of fear.”Insome ways, Everett was more prepared than most districts for theswitch to fully online instruction; the district had been planning for years to become a full 1-to-1 computing district in which everystudent had access to a digital learning device. Teachers had been trained on educational platforms, and highschoolstudents and those at one middleschool were already taking home their district-issued Chromebooks. The district quicklysent out resources for parents to help them navigate online learning. Still, it took a while for everyone to get the hang of things as the district transitioned to a new way ofschooling.“The teachers would beso happy when you did the work,”said Amanda Hirman. “You turned it in? You get an A.’”One day felt like asnow day, two weeks were manageable, butsix weeksstarted to veer into uncharted territory. Elizabeth Hirman initially thought two weeks off fromschool would be a good break, like a mini-vacation. Atsix weeks,shestarted to think: “We can’t learn.”It’s gotten better, butshestill misses things like hands-on labs in her chemistry class, andshe’s worried about having to take AP exams online instead of in-person like the SATs. The initial lack ofstructure to theschool day left Joe Hirman a little disappointed, though he gives the district a lot of credit for listening to feedback and making improvements for the newschool year.“They now have asystem down, and it’s much improved,” hesaid. “But this is not how I would hope for my daughters to be educated.”Lara Fullner-Grennan, who teaches 6th grade English/ language arts at Gateway Middle School, thinks remote learning has gone better than expected.“I have almost all of my kidsshowing up on Zoom every,single day,”shesaid. “We celebrate getting tosee each other and getting to hear each other’s voices—even for ashort amount of time.”Butshe is clear thatshe would prefer to be in the classroom with herstudents.“As fun assome of these activities are … [remote learning] is nothing like in-person learning,” Fullner-Grennansaid. “In-person learning isstill more exciting and more rewarding—and I also think more effective.”Fullner-Grennan alsospends her time differently asshe prepares for remote classes. She now has to think about things like: Would a link work? Is this the most accessible way to present information tostudents? Is this lesson engaging? How video-friendly is this Google Slide?Those are questionsshe didn’t have to answer whenstudents were right in front of her andshe could peer over theirshoulders,see a mistake or misunderstanding, and address it in real time.“The biggest thing with remote learning is the importance of celebratingsmallsuccesses,” Fullner-Grennansaid. “I don’t want to dwell too much on the negative part of it, because I know this is not going to be forever.”At Cascade High, Principal Takayoshi was just a few months into his first year as the building leader when everything changed. The most challenging aspect of running aschool during a pandemic is the unpredictability of it all, hesaid. School leaders live by routines: bellschedules, testing periods, the normal flow of theschool day andschool year.“One of the elements of being an administrator is being able to, insome ways, conceptualize the next month ... or the next couple of months,” Takayoshisaid. “When you remove that degree of predictability from your day, you are kind of operating in the moment—always.”It helped that Takayoshi had been an administrator in the building for five years before the pandemic. But there’s a lot that he misses: For example, hestill wishes he could have had a traditional graduation forstudents last year, instead of the drive-through option that was offered at the end of lastspring. This time period hasshowed that the way thatschool is traditionallystructured has not worked for many children, hesaid.“Part of the work weshould do as an industry moving forward is, how can we rethink public educationso that it does work for more people than it does now,” Takayoshisaid. Everett educators envision plenty of permanent changes as a result of the past year’s experience. Superintendent Ian B. Saltzmansees a continuing place for the remote learning option becausesomestudents thrived in that environment. Thesuperintendent also thinksschools must rethink how they use afternoon hours, particularly with parents and care givers in mind. That could mean ideas like keeping theschool libraries open until 7 p.m. or offering tutoring and assistancesuch as SAT prep during that window. Interactions with parents will also change. Theswitch to remote has made it easier for teachers to connect with families and for families to participate in parent-teacher conferences and in activities that their children are involved in. Teachers like Fullner-Grennan and Mark Dersom, a 4th-grade teacher at Monroe Elementary,see the benefits of continuing to use tools they took up during the pandemic,such as quick video feedback forstudents, and thinking about the user-experience when they return to their buildings. Professional development will evolve, too,said Jo Anne Buiteweg, the district’s director of Learning and Information Technology Services. In districts like Everett, where getting from oneschool to the central office can eat into the day, teachers can log into professional developmentsessions without leaving their buildings or missing out on valuable learning opportunities. Fullner-Grennan, the 6th grade English/language arts teacher, is among those who want tosee time built into theschedule to allowstudents to engage in directed independent work, meet with teachers for office hours, or finish incomplete assignments.“It’s become obvious to me how much kids really need and have come to rely on this extra gift of time,” Fullner-Grennansaid. “That’s notsomething that’s available when it’s done as homework.”Everettstarted welcoming backstudents for hybrid learning in January,starting withstudents with disabilities. At this point, only K-3students and those withspecial needs are back, in hybrid. Five-days-a-week in-person learning for everyone isstillsome ways off, though Washington’s governor has been urging districts to reopen for in-personschooling, with masks and proper distancing and while providing parents the option of continuing with remote learning. (Educators were just moved up on the priority list on thestate’s vaccinationschedule.)Saltzman described the feeling of having children back in the buildings as “Christmas all over again.”“To have them back inslowly—it’s been refreshing and energizing,” Saltzmansaid.

Sign up to receive our biggeststories assoon as they’re published. The number of federal political committees that havespent money in the first half of 2021 at Trump Organization properties has dropped dramatically from thesame period two years ago, Federal Election Commission filingsshow. Those continuing tospend: asmaller circle of loyalsupporters of former President Donald Trump and candidates jockeying for his favor in contested Republican primaries. During the firstsix months of 2021,27 federal committees have reportedspending $348,000 at Trump Organization properties, with the Republican National Committee accounting for more than half the total. That’s asteep decline from the177committees that didso during the 2019-2020 election cycle or the 78 committees thatspent more than $1.6 million at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump International Hotel in Washington and other companysites in the first half of 2019, filingsshow. Of course, thatspending came in the run-up to a presidential election in which Trump was the incumbent. The biggestspenders in 2019 were the RNC and Trump’s own political committees raising money tosupport his campaign. While the RNC is the topspenderso far in 2021, many of the other PACs that used Trump properties as venues for fundraising events and other activities appear to havestopped theirspending. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the fundraising arm of House Republicans, has not reportedspending any money at Trump properties through May of this year afters pending $32,532during the previous election cycle. (National party committees will file reports covering activity in June on July 20, which mayshowsomespending at Trump’s facilities.)Those that havespent money at Trump properties this year representsome of the former president’s most fervent loyalists, including Reps. Mo Brooksof Alabama, who is running for an open Senateseat, andRonny Jacksonof Texas, who previously was the White House physician. Overall, 13 of the 23 committeesspending this year are connected to current members of the House or Senate.“Republican candidates are in a delicate moment, I think, because of uncertaintysurrounding Trump’s future power,”said Abby Wood, a professor of law, politicalscience and public policy at the University of Southern California, in an email. “Trump’s power in the next election is much less certain than it was from the vantage point of folksspending money (and enriching him) at his properties in 2019.”The drop in politicalspending comes at a precarious time for the Trump Organization, which in early July was hit with 10 felony charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., as well as additional charges against Allen Weisselberg, the organization’s chief financial officer. Both Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty to the charges, but the impact of the investigation and the fallout of the Jan. 6 attack on the U. S. Capitol appear to have damaged the company’s business prospects. The Washington Post described the company as at its “lowest point in decades.”The otherspenders include congressional candidates advertising their ties to Trump,such asLynda Blanchard, who is one of Brooks’ opponents for the GOP nomination in the Alabama Senate race, andJosh Mandel, who’s running for an open Senateseat in Ohio. Brooks, Blanchard and Mandel have each paid to use Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s property in Palm Beach, Florida, while Jackson paid for an event at the Trump hotel in Washington.“It is my intention to do fund raisers at Mar-a-Lago as often as I can,so long as they help generate positive cash flow for my Senate campaign for America First policies,” Brookssaid in astatement. “I personally thank President Trump for allowing me to use Mar-a-Lago and hope he will continue to beso generous in the future.”The campaigns of Blanchard, Jackson and Mandel, along with the RNC and the Trump Organization, did not respond to requests for comment. The RNC hasspent more money for events at other locations this year, including $529,000 for a donor event at the Four Seasons Resort in Palm Beach in April. Read MoreMar-a-Lago, a private club that also doubles as the former president’s residence, has been the leading recipient of federal political committeespending among Trump properties, bringing in at least $283,000 this year, much of it for hosting an RNC donor retreat in May. In addition to getting the venue and Florida weather, politicians holding events at the clubstand a good chance of having Trump make an appearance. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, D. C., and the BLT Prime restaurant located there, haveseen asignificant drop-off in politicalspending compared to the first half of 2019. Two years ago, the D. C. hotel and restaurant brought in more than $518,000, according to FEC records. This year, without Trump in the White House nearby, the total is less than $15,000.“Given Trump is no longer president and there is less need to curry favor with him, congressional incumbents and party committees may choose less expensive venues,”said Paul Herrnson, a politicalscience professor at the University of Connecticut.",2,2,ProPublica
344,Hopes and Doubts in Beijing,-3.33,46.67,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-11-13/hopes-and-doubts-beijing,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,17,"Never before has Beijing paidsuch close attention to the outcome of a U. S. presidential election. Chinese leaders recognize that competition will define U. S.-Chinese relations no matter who occupies the White House. But they also believe that former Vice President Joe Biden’s triumph over President Donald Trump provides an opportunity to halt—or at the very leastslow—the two countries’ alarming march to confrontation. Relations have deteriorated at an astonishing rate during Trump’s presidency. The trade war has been the most conspicuous example of friction, but largerstrategic tensions have also heightened the risk of conflict. The Trump administration’s barrage of blame, overtly racist remarks, policies aimed at decoupling, and rhetoric advocating regime change has jolted many officials in the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Unsurprisingly, the prevailing mood on Chinesesocial media in the wake of the U. S. election is one of relief and optimism, although views of Trump among the general public are by no means uniform. A popular Internet mem e captured the public’s enthusiasm for a Biden presidency, rechristening Beijing’s Forbidden City as the “For-Biden City.”But moods of optimism can turn quickly. Only four years ago, China received the news of Trump’s election withsimilar enthusiasm. Many Chinese leaders viewed Trump as a businessman with whom they could get things done. That proved to be wishful thinking. China’s foreign policy establishment is wary but cautiously optimistic about better relations with a Biden administration. Still, many of the conditions thatshaped Trump’s China policystill exist, and resetting relations between the world’s greatest powers will not be easy. During U. S. presidential elections, Chinese leaders have historically avoidedsuggesting any preference for a particular candidate. The long-standingofficial line is that “China never interferes in the internal affairs of the United States.” But China’s leadership was generally pessimistic about the prospects for improving relations with the United States as long as Trump was at the helm. Althoughsome Chinese decision-makers believed the chaos and bluster of another Trump term wouldstrengthen China, they have also witnessed how the U. S. president’s unpredictable foreign policy pushes both countries closer and closer to conflict. The Trump administration’s actions toward Taiwan have been of particular concern to the Chinese. With the passage in the U. S. Congress of the Taiwan Travel Act of 2018 and the 2019 Taipei Act—bills that havestrengthened U. S.-Taiwanese relations and weresigned into law by Trump—Beijing fears that Washington is edging toward recognizing Taiwan as an independent country. The administration’s actions and rhetoric on this front have hardened antipathy toward Trump within the CCP leadership and bolstered those Chinese officials eager to take an aggressive approach toward the United States. Beijing believes the Trump administration hassought to defeat China in much thesame way that the United States defeated the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Some Trump officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and thesenior trade adviser Peter Navarro, have even called for regime change in China. As a result, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the CCP leadership were under no illusions about the possibility of tranquil, harmonious coexistence with asecond Trump administration. During an October event in Beijing to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Korean War, Xi urged China’s military to prepare for potential conflict with the United States. In his words, China will “use war to prevent war.”Chinese leaders know that U. S. hostility toward China isn’t confined to the Trump administration. Both Republicans and Democrats have directed harsh criticism at Beijing and advocated decoupling U. S.supply chains from China. At thesame time, many Chinese officials don’t believe there is an anti-China consensus in Washington. One noteworthy episode during the vice-presidential debate—when neither Vice President Mike Pence nor California Senator Kamala Harris could give a clear answer about whether the United Statessees China as a competitor, a rival, or an enemy—garnered the attention of opinion makers in Beijing. Itseemed to underscore the lack of astrategic framework for U. S.-Chinese relations in Washington. Biden has also routinely characterized Trump’s China policy as a failure,suggesting to Chinese officials that the incoming administration will not adopt all of Trump’s confrontational positions, including the goal of decoupling. Analysts within the Chinese foreign policy establishment are pleased tosee that theBiden foreign policy team features manyseasoned professionals with reputations forsensible diplomacy. It has been widely observed in both China and the United States that Biden and Xi maintained a long and friendly working relationship during their overlapping tenures as vice presidents of their respective countries. According to Daniel Russel, a formersenior official in President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, Biden and Ximetat least eight times andspent roughly 25 hours together in one-on-one meetings within aspan of 18 months in 2011 and 2012. Bidenspoke harshly about Xi and the CCP during the presidential debates, but Chinese officials understood those remarks as rhetoric for domestic consumption, not a foreshadowing of Biden’s foreign policy. More broadly, China’s U. S. watchers have come to realize that their long-standing view dating back to the era of President Richard Nixon of Republicans as friendlier and easier to work with than Democrats no longer holds true. Chinese researchers point out that all 15 congressional members of the China Task Force—a group known for its hawkish approach toward Beijing—are Republicans; that 229 Democrats in the House of Representativesvoted in favor of a September congressional resolution condemning all forms of anti-Chinese discrimination, but only 14 Republicanssupported the resolution (and 164 opposed it); and that numerous U. S. public opinionsurveysshowRepublicans to be far more hostile to China than Democrats. But even if Beijing is more predisposed to work with a Democratic U. S. administration, asignificant reset of the bilateral relationship will be tricky. Chinese leaders tend to attribute the deterioration in U. S.-Chinese relations entirely to the Trump administration’s desire to contain China’s rise. There is no recognition in Beijing of legitimate U. S. concerns regarding unfair Chinese economic and technological practices and its aggressive behavior in the Asia-Pacific region. On the U. S.side, the criticism of the CCP by Republicans in the Trump administration and in Congress—as well as the general public’s hostility to China—poses a major barrier to the new administration’s attempts at rapprochement. The likelihood of a Republican-controlled Senate after the election makes reversing coursestill more difficult. Chinese officials understand that theserious political divide exposed by the election result—with the United States highly polarized—will force Biden to assuage domestic tensions and could leave him without the political capital to fully transform U. S. China policy. Moreover, Chinese leaders fear that in an effort to bridge partisan divisions, the Biden administration maysee an aggressive China policy as a means of finding common ground with Republicans. Ifso, confrontation between the two countries could continue, or even accelerate, instead of giving way to a morestable balance between cooperation and competition. The Biden administration willsurely continue to articulate concerns about Chinese human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Biden could even bring greater force to these criticisms, wedding them to the wider moral mission of defending human rights andsearching for racial justice at home. He will likely be more effective than Trump was at harnessing Americansoft power in U. S. outreach to the Chinese people. Of course, it is highly doubtful that Beijing would meet the full demands of the United States and the international community on these matters; Chinese authorities view unrest in its peripheral regions as a threat to their country’s nationalsovereignty, territorial integrity, and domesticstability. As a result, Beijing’s conduct in these restive areas is not up for negotiation. Xi and Biden in Beijing, December 2013Lintao Zhang / ReutersThe Chinese leadership is weighing all these possible trajectories of a Biden China policy andseems to be hedging its bets on the incoming administration. On the one hand, Beijing will be eager to reengage with the United States in multiple areas. During Obama’s eight-year tenure, there were as many as 105 government-sponsored bilateral dialogues onsubjects including women’s leadership, early childhood education,space exploration, cybercrime, and climate change. The Trump administration condensed those channels to four during the first two years of the administration andsubsequently discontinued them entirely. In line with Biden’s foreign policy agenda, China will be particularly interested in working collaboratively on issues of global public health (especially theshared battle against COVID-19), climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, antiterrorism, cybersecurity, and global economic and financialstability. This pastsummer, Yang Jiechi, one of China’s top diplomats,outlinedthesesubjects as areas for close U. S.-Chinese coordination and cooperation. In addition, hesaw the possibility of cooperation with the United States in addressing geopolitical challenges in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East. At thesame time, however, Beijing believes that China’s economic recovery, its internal handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its relativesociopoliticalstability, and its growing international clout give it added leverage in the bilateral relationship. The Chinese leadership may accommodate U. S. demands in certain areas, but it will likely remain firm and uncompromising on anything touching on China’sself-declared core interests of its claim tosovereignty over Taiwan and the maintenance of CCP rule. Unquestionably, tensions with China will persist as the Biden administration navigates the areas where it will cooperate and where it will compete with Beijing. Butsome influential Chinesescholarssee in Biden’s victory the potential for a more productive relationship. Shi Yinhong, a professor of Americanstudies at Renmin University and an adviser to the State Council (the top government organ),recently argued that Biden would providestability and predictability in U. S. policy toward China. In Shi’s view, however, the window of opportunity tostop “tit for tat” escalation with the Biden administration will be brief. The growing influence of China on the worldstage and the volatile domestic political environment in the United States will make it harder to patch up the bilateral relationship. Both Beijing and Washington, Shi insists,should not miss the precious opportunity available in the coming months to reexamine past missteps and to reset relations. Shi departssomewhat from the party line in his desire for overcoming the zero-sum mindset, reflecting the goodwill many public intellectuals and Chinese citizens have for the United States—and for the incoming Biden administration in particular. Time will tell howsuch views might inform the decisions of China’s leadership.",2,2,Foreign Affairs
345,EU warns that it may break up Big Tech companies,-1.67,47.33,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/eu-warns-that-it-may-break-up-big-tech-companies/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,19,"The EU will threaten on Tuesday to break up Big Tech companies if they repeatedly engage in anti-competitive behavior. The warning comes as Brussels publishes its drafts of two major new pieces of tech regulation. A Digital Markets Act will aim to tackle unfair competition in thesector, and a Digital Services Act will force tech companies to take more responsibility for illegal behavior on their platforms. The long-awaited regulations are the firstsignificant overhaul of the EU’s approach to the Internet for two decades. After the European Commission publishes its proposals on Tuesday, they will be voted on by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers and there is no timetable yet for when they will come into force. Both of the regulations carry huge fines for bad behavior. Big Tech companies that deliberately break new competition rules will be liable for fines of up to 10 percent of their global revenues. Big Tech companies that do not police their platforms will be liable for fines of up to 6 percent of their global revenues. But the draft of the Digital Markets Act alsostates that Big Tech companies that are fined three times within five years will be labeled as repeat offenders, and the EU will move tostructurallyseparate their businesses, according to two people with direct knowledge of the plans. If an investigationshowssystematic bad behavior that furtherstrengthens a company’s position, the EU may impose “any behavioral orstructural remedies which are proportionate to the infringement committed and necessary to ensure compliance,” a draft of the regulationsaid. The new rules, if they pass into law in their current form, would represent one of the moststringentsets of regulations on Big Tech in the world. They are also an acknowledgment that existing competition law is inadequate and tooslow-moving in the digital age and has failed to curb the rapid ascent and huge market power of the Silicon Valley giants. Companiessuch as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are also facing growing hostility in Europe for paying low levels of local tax, invading privacy, and crushing their rivals. Thierry Breton, the EU’s commissioner for the internal market who is co-leading the overhaul of the digital rules, told the Financial Times in September: “There is a feeling from end users of these platforms that they are too big to care.”Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s executive vice-president in charge of competition and digital policy, also recently expressed her frustration of how antitrust probes have not tamed Big Tech.“It is painful that in digital markets the harm that can be done in that marketplace can happen very fast but the recovery of that marketplace can be very, very difficult,”she recently told the Financial Times. As it publishes its draft regulations, the EU will alsoset out how it aims to assess which companies are “gatekeepers” that dictate the rules of the marketplace. The criteria will include a company’s global turnover over the past three years, its number of users, and its market capitalization over the past year. EU officialssaid a company’s market cap was an important metricsince it determined a company’s ability to raise money quickly to acquire potential rivals. However, Brussels’ ambition to take on Big Tech faces at least two years or more of political wrangling and debates in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Paul Tang, a Dutchsocialist MEP who will be taking active part in the discussion of the new rules next year,said: “The commission’s plans are good, but not good enough to curb the monopoly power of tech giants.“Instead, the commissionshould take direct aim and at least dismantle the perverse business model of these tech giants: monetizing personal data via advertising.”Others in the European Parliament expect Big Tech will try to water down the new rules. Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, another European lawmaker who has played a prominent role in competition policy discussions,said: “I expect platforms to try to divide the EP around fake andsimple debatessuch as being pro versus anti freedom ofspeech or pro and versus anti innovation.”",2,2,ARS Technica

It goes both ways though. The Trump campaign has been heavily focused on attacking Biden’s decision to pick Harris even though it’s clear they have no idea how to go after her besides drumming up the usual racist nonsense, with a number of em ails and online ads focusing onstanding with Mike Pence. A new campaign commercial produced by a group not affiliated with either campaign, Don Winslow Films, might make Pence wish that hestayed quiet in this fight – or at least that Trump wouldstop hailing him as a great running mate, amidst mediaspeculation that Trump was ready toswitch him out for another candidate. The video wastes no time digging into both Mike and Karen Pence’ssordid history when it comes to LGBT rights in the United States – going all the way back to when Pence denounced the 1996 Republican convention for allowing HIV-positivespeakers, to hissupport of gay conversion therapy as governor of Indiana, and his wife Karen’s job at a privateschool that requires employees tosign a pledge against homosexuality. In addition to being unflattering for Pence, the commercialserves as a reminder that the progress made in this movement has only happened recently, againststaunch opposition – dealing with the likes of bigotssuch as the Pences. Asecond term of this administration would only make their lives even harder. As fun as it will be tosee Kamala Harrisstomp all over Pence and all the backwards ideals hestands for, we must remember that he isstill a dangerous man in a dangerous position, and this is why we need to vote him out with Donald Trump on November 3.

S. Sen. Gary Peters officially declared victory Thursday and called on his Republican opponent to accept defeat, while John James refused to concede and called for investigation into what his campaign is calling cheating in the balloting process. In a news conference with his family and campaignstaff at his favorite cider mill, Peters laughed heartily when told that the James campaignsaid it was cheated out of an election win amid allegations of voter fraud. An attorney representing Jamessaid there are irregularities that called into the question the integrity of the election during a Thursday meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers.“It’ssad and it’s pathetic. They lost,” Peterssaid to reporters at the Goodison Cider Mill. “It’s very clear. Just count the votes. I understand Mr. James has been running for four years, he’s lost twice now. I understand that doesn’tsit well with him.”But Peterssaid James, the 39-year-old Army veteran and businessman,should not be asore loser. Hesaid he had not heard from James in a campaign Peters decried as filled withsmear attacks on his record.“This is where youseesomeone’s character,” thesenator added. “And they come up and realize that they need to accept the vote of the people of thestate of Michigan. I would hope that this nonsense could go away.”About three hours after Peters' remarks, Jamessaid in astatement that ""while Sen. Peters is currently ahead, I have deep concerns that millions of Michiganders may have been disenfranchised by a dishonest few who cheat.""He called for an investigationso voters are confident the election ""was fair and honest.""""When this process is complete, I will of course accept the results and the will of the people,"" James added, ""but at this time there is enough credible evidence to warrant an investigation to ensure that elections were conducted in a transparent, legal and fair manner. Those who object likely havesomething to hide.""At a Thursday meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, James' attorney Charlie Spiessaid he had""veryserious concerns""about the way the election was administered in the Democratic-dominated county, but he didn't providespecific evidence to back up his comments. Spies made a variety of claims about problems in the county,saying Republican poll watchers had faced intimidation and weren't able to ""meaningfully participate"" in monitoring the vote count.""We haveseen and we have witnesses thatsaw the mysterious appearance of ballots at the TCF Center that can't be accounted for,"" Spiessaid. But it would be normal for legal votes toshow up in batches at the center, where Detroit's absentee ballots are tallied. The claims by Spies came as election workers in Michigan neared a final unofficial tally of votes across thestate. The Wayne County board met Thursday morning to approve the beginning of the election's canvass — the process of examining and confirming ballot and voter totals. In Michigan, counties must complete their canvass on Nov. 17 and then forward results to Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Later Thursday, Spies and two other attorneyssent a letter to Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett asking her to preserve absentee ballots, footage from all ballot drop box locations and personnel records, among other documents.""It has come to our attention that due to apparent widespread fraud and irregularities, the absent voter ballots counted in Wayne County may be in question,"" the attorneys wrote on behalf of the James campaign. ""The vote counts in Wayne County appear to be irregular, if not fraudulent.""This letter places you on notice to preserve and not destroy any evidence related to the absent voter process in Wayne County.""The attorneyssaid they had documented ""hundreds of reports of irregularities that occurred during the processing"" of Wayne County absentee ballots. They listed challenger intimidation, lack of access, insecure ballots, improper processing, failure to verifysignatures, mismatched envelopes and ballots, and ballot back-dating. Peters called the lawsuits filed by President Donald Trump in Michigan and elsewhere tostop the counting of votes “frivolous.”“I would justsay to Mr. James and their campaign: Accept the opinion and the votes of the people of thestate of Michigan,” Petersaid. “That’s the right thing to do.”Peter, D-Bloomfield Township,said he expected a close racesince Michigan is a battlegroundstate where Trump won four years ago. But that won’tstop him from doing his job and “to be able to work in a bipartisan way tosolve the tough problems that we face,"" thesenatorsaid. Since the election is over, Peterssaid he hopes the country can get past hyper-partisanship and division. No matter who voted for him or not, thesenatorsaid he would continue to work hard for all of Michigan.“We have to come together, particularly right now when we’re in the middle of this pandemic. This is asignificant crisis,” Peterssaid. “Every time we come together as a country, every time we come together as Michiganders..., we can get through anything.“Peterssaid when he returns to Washington next week, he will push Senate Republicans to pass a COVID-19 relief package. In September and October, Senate Democrats filibustered or blocked a vote on a $300 billion Senate GOP COVID-19 relief package that Democratssaid was inadequate as they held out for a vote on the Democratic House's $2.2 trillion package.“We have to do that,” hesaid. When Biden is officially declared president, Peterssaid he is looking forward to working with the incoming Democratic administration on the coronavirus pandemic and “put together the comprehensive nationalstrategy that weshould have had right from the beginning.”",2,2,Detroit News

The growing list means that travelers from much of the country are restricted upon entry into Connecticut. The decision also raises new questions about the ability ofsports teams to travel to and from Connecticut. Asstates across the countryseespikes in COVID-19 cases, the number ofstates on the list has grown larger. Because of this, Connecticut’s advisory list is “a fast-moving target,” Gov. Ned Lamontsaid Tuesday.“Unfortunately it’s not going down, it’s going up,” Lamontsaid. “I worry.”Thestate’s websitesays the 14-dayself-quarantine “is the best option to preventspread of disease,” but those who cannot quarantine can also enter thestate by testing negative for coronavirus within 72 hours before they cross thestate line. Theself-quarantine measure applies to anyone traveling into Connecticut, whether they’re entering thestate by car, train or plane.“You go to a hotspot, you come back to thisstate, you either have a test thatshows you tested negative or you must quarantine for 14 days,” Gov. Ned Lamontsaid at a Monday news conference when he announced thestate would track all arrivals fromstates on its advisory list. Although the advisory list has been in placesince late June, Lamont’s Monday announcement outlined new guidelines that also require travelers to fill out an online form in order to enter thestate. That form requires travelers toself-certify that they’re following theself-quarantine guidelines. Travelers who refuse to fill out the questionnaire may face a fine of up to $1,000. Lamontsaid Monday that thestate has “no plans” to begin issuing fines yet. Thestate “wanted to makesure that people knew howseriously we are taking the quarantine,” Lamontsaid Tuesday. The governor formalized the new guidelines i nan executive order, which thestate released late Tuesday evening. The new guidelines take effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday, meaning that travelers entering thestate after then will be required to fill out the health questionnaire and follow theself-quarantine protocol. Thequestionnairewas also posted online late Tuesday evening. With well over half thestates in the U. S. now on Connecticut’s advisory list, thestate is increasingly closing itself off from visitors — and, potentially, from danger. The travel advisory aims to reduce COVID-19spread from hotspotstates, defined as places with a new daily positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents or a 10% or higher positivity rate over a 7-day period. In addition to the 22states previously on the list, Connecticut has now added Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Virginia and Washingtonstate. Minnesota, which was on the list as of Monday, has now been removed. The list also includes Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. Connecticut has coordinated its travel advisory with neighboringstates New York and New Jersey, which also expanded their lists andstepped up enforcement in recent days. Lamontsaid thespecter of a fine, and the travel advisory itself, is meant tosafeguard the progress that Connecticut has made in fighting back the coronavirus.“The numbers are all trending, blessedly, in the right direction,still,” hesaid Monday. The new rules are “one more way we can remind people we’re taking thisseriously.”The full travel advisory listand the health questionnaire can be found on thestate’s website.

With many otherworldly adventures returning to our fingertips, eager travelers are facing the bliss of getting away coupled with the complex web of regulations, paperwork, canceled flights, and the ebb and flow ofCOVID-19 variants. Some are opting out of travel until itsettles. Others are using tour companies to ease worries andsoothe complications presenting themselves while planning. Rather than navigating the confusion on your own, these bespokespecialists are taking matters into their own hands.“It is more complicated than ever for us. We are monitoring things closely and notifying our clients when necessary, trying to take the burden away from our clients and onto ourselves,”says Aeneas O’Hara, founder of Scotland-basedAway From the Ordinary(AFTO). His upbringings in the country and close relationships with hotels, restaurants, and tour guides help managesafe,streamlined itineraries. “We are absorbing as much of the logistics and organizational work as possible for people. Some of our clients lead very busy lives,so if they just turn up in Scotland with their passport and theirsuitcase with zero preparation, they will have an amazing time as we will take care of everything for them.”When the pandemic hit,AFTO’s bookingsseized completely, as did tours withAfrica Adventure Consultants(AAC) whose 2020safari expeditions wereslated to have its best yearsince the companystarted two decades ago. Because of COVID-19, however, 90% of its booked clients postponed their trips and 10% canceled entirely. As globetrotters begin to wander to far-off destinations again, thestrain of COVID’s Delta variant is causing unpredictable planning, especially inhigh-risk regionssuch as South America and Africa, where vaccines arescarce andsome borders remain closed. Tour companies work tediously with trusted vendors to ensure those traveling canstill have asuccessful andsafe experience. Kent Redding, president and co-founder of AAC,says a large percentage of his company’s time isspent monitoring regulations from where clients are coming from and going. “We have a couple different trackingspreadsheets for each country and what the regulations are, which by the way, keep changing.” In addition to visas, which arestandard when visiting many African destinations, documentation varies for each country,such as required healthsurveillance forms before arrival. Often,systemsset up to process these forms are glitchy,so AAC directs guests through what hasshown to be a frustrating process.“There’s one park in Zimbabwe where you can’t get testing,” heshares as one example. “So, you have to either fly in a nurse, a great expense of $2,000 to $3,000, to get theswabs taken. Or you have to rearrange your itinerary to go to Victoria Falls for an extra night before leaving.” Knowing these policies and making amendments for yourself is tedious and can lead to mistakes, which can then lead to gettingstucksomewhere or cancelling the trip. “If I hadn’t been doing this for 20 years, I don’t know how we could do it, howsomebody else can do it, because it’s really confusing.”A company likeQuasar Expeditions, whose main destinations include Galapagos Islands and Patagonia, is constantlyshifting its protocols. “Oursalesstaff tell us that on average, maybe a third of their day isspent answering COVID-related questions and easing people’s concerns,”says Fernando Diez, marketing manager of Quasar. A high-risk area like Ecuador, the jumping-off point for Galapagos, closed borders from March to July 2020. Currently, to circumvent any issues in Ecuador, Quasar reroutes its clients to a more isolated airport andseeks out rural accommodations away from densely populated areas. In Galapagos, a private party donated 60,000 Pfizer vaccinations to the province’s approvement 30,000 residents and workers. Once travelers arrive to the islands,safety protocols arestrictly met. Quasar, along with AAC and AFTO, also only use vendors they know are adhering to measures that keep guestssafe: consistently adapting to COVID testing forstaff, cleaning procedures,social distancing, and mask wearing when needed“They’re following all the procedures that theyshould,” Reddingsays, who remains closely connected with AAC’s camps and lodges. “Once you get there, I feel very good about thesafety of the people that are there, the visitors that are there, especially if you are vaccinated as the traveler.”As far as travelersshould prepare, O’Harasuggests being flexible because plans may change andsome things may be closed. “Also, prepare to be welcomed and appreciated,” hesays. “Foreign visitors will be welcomed back with even more verve and enthusiasm than before as we have been waiting for you to visit us for a while now.”Subscribe to Fortune Dailyto get essential businessstoriesstraight to your in box each morning.",2,2,Fortune

Rand Paul (R-KY) criticized the justification for mask mandates, arguing that they were not based onscience.“It’s aboutsubmission,” hesaid. “There’s never been any evidence ofspreading events in theschools. The kids do very well with this. The idea that we’re going to put masks on the kids, and then we’re going to punish the kids who, for their own medical decision-making or their parents, decide not tosubmit to this mandate. To me, it’s the biggest, basically advertisement and encouragement to get out of the governmentschools. Go to privateschools, if you can afford them, teach your kids at home. But don’tsubmit to thestate, don’tsubmit to the government.”“Not only they are making you worry unless they’re going to indoctrinate you with Critical Race Theory,” Paul continued. “So, it’s a win-win if you leave theschools if you’re able to. And there’s been more of an exodus from the governmentschools this year than any other year because they’re not followingscience. They just want you to be your – you’re part of the collective, you’re part of the hive, do as you’re told, don’t think, your kids don’t belong to you, they belong to thestate. These are all arguments for trying to flee theschools if you can.”The Kentucky Republican also revealed he was pushing a bill that would end the federal government’s mask mandate on commercial airliners.“I’m introducing legislation that will get rid of the federal mandate,” Paulsaid. “This happened by executive order by President Biden, and the airlines hide behind it. I, for one, am a frequent traveler. I’msick and tired of getting on the plane. Instead of them thanking me for buying aseat and buying a ticket, they tell me I could go to jail for not wearing a mask. Then they tell me I could go to jail if I’m unable to open the door. Then theysay, God forbid, you brought a drink on boardso you could relax because of all the mandates. They’ll put you in jail for that too.”“So, I want them to get – I want to get on the plane, andsomebody thanked me for buying a ticket instead of telling me three different ways they’re going tosend me to jail if I don’tsubmit tosome mandate,” he continued. “But they hide behind the federal mandate. They kind of act like, oh, it’s not us. Well, Airlines aren’t doing this to you. It’s your federal government. They begged for this, the airlines. And the thing is, they begged for our money. They could fly in their planes. And now they’re begging to continue these mandates. The mandates need to end. They’re not working. You’re more likely to get it in their house than you are to get it on a plane.”",0,1,Breitbart

The club began a review of the name July 3 and “will be retiring the Redskins name and logo upon completion of this review,” according to a teamstatement Monday. Dan Snyder, the principal owner, and Ron Rivera, the head coach, “are working to develop a new name and design approach.”It’s astark reversal by Snyder, who for years refused even to entertain the possibility. As recently as 2013, when the franchise was defending its name in court, SnydertoldUSA Today, “We’ll never change the name. It’s thatsimple.”This time,sponsors and other financial partners left Snyder little choice. Earlier this month, FedEx Corp., which holds the naming rights to the team’sstadium in Landover, Maryland, told the team to make a change. Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Nike Inc.stoppedselling the team’s merchandise. The National Football Leaguesaid it wouldsupport a change. Thesupport for the name changesuggests the power of the current reckoning on race in America. Protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of police in late May have expanded to targetsystemic racism across U. S. industry, government, culture andsports. The NFL, the most popularsports league in America by a wide margin, has been grappling with the growing Black Lives Matter movement for years. Then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began protesting police brutality by kneeling during the pregame national anthem in 2016, a controversial demonstration that divided fans, players and league officials. In June, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell apologized on behalf of the league for “not listening to players” and failing to encourage andsupport peaceful protest. He didn’t mention Kaepernick by name but later told ESPN he’d encourage a team tosign him. The Washington team has a long history of racism beyond its name. George Preston Marshall, who founded the team in 1932, actively opposed integration; the team was the last in the league tosign a Black player. It didso in 1961, and only under threats from the government. That Black player, Hall-of-Famer Bobby Mitchell, is getting new attention as well. The team retired his number last month, making him thesecond player in the history of the organization to receive that honor, and asection of the venue will be named in honor of Mitchell. It had previously been named for Marshall, who will no longer be recognized in thestadium or in team materials, the teamsaid.

It has alwaysseen Trump and hissupporters as a malignancy that needs to be cut out ofsociety. It never had any intention of letting Trump go down as a legitimate president, neither does it have any desire to acknowledge the grievances that fueled his rise in the first place. The words “President Trump” would never have entered the history books if not for the Left and its relentless, pathological hatred of anyone to the right of center. If America is heading towards civilstrife, it is because the Left—with the complicity of an opportunistic establishment—hasslowly butsurely nudged half the country into a corner. The Left has categorized millions of ordinary people who just want decent, honorable lives as “far-right extremists” and “conspiracy theorists” who deserve to besilenced, fired from their jobs, and renderedsocially untouchable. These “dangerous people,” held insuch contempt by the Left and the ruling elite, retainsuch fringe notions as “nationsshould have borders” and “men and women are different.” The Left has been playing a game of “stop hitting yourself!” with these people for years, and in 2016, those people finally had enough. It is now four years later and hissupporters have watched the president they legitimately electedspend every waking moment in office fight a war ofsuccession with a faction of narcissistic psychopaths. Without asingle day of rest, the most powerful institutions in the country conspired in a temper tantrum to overturn the will of the people, all in the name of “democracy,”simply because they did not like who the people had chosen. From day one, they have treated Trump like a usurper whose mere election was an “insurrection,” and they have not concealed their disgust for hissupporters, whom they regard as “racist,”subhumanscumbags. If Trump’s base is a bit inured by now to the outrage over this “sedition” at the Capitol, perhaps they can be forgiven. After all, Joe Bidenspent a wholesummer pretending that leftist riots were not happening for thesake of power. He only “condemned” them after his hand was forced, and even then, he had the chutzpah to blame them on Trumpsupporters, even blaming a Trumpsupporter who was assassinated by a leftist for his own death. It was the most vile gaslighting conceivable. America is now being treated to lectures on “civility” and “democracy” from these verysame people. The hypocrisy is obvious and galling, but the Left doesn’t care: their philosophy is “heads we win, tails you lose.” Those on the “rightside of history” are permitted to do anything. On the other hand,simply taking upspace in the publicsquare is a provocation if you’re on the “wrong”side. They could bash yourskull in with a rock, and the media would blame you for getting killed. Butso much as complain about this crooked deal,and you’ve engaged in “hatespeech” and you must be destroyed. Tucker Carlson’s formulationsummarizes how arbitrary it all is:theirviolence is “speech,” but yourspeech is “violence.” And by the way,so is yoursilence. Endorse the official narrative, or else. Yet the Left’s hostility increasingly has little to do with matters of conviction, which can be altered, if only involuntarily. Amidst the “reckoning” that began thissummer, the Leftstarted talking about whites like they weresome form of disease. Wesaw the consequences of this bizarre trend in practice after the Left erupted into war-whooping bloodlust against the Capitol “seditionists,” who, they were disappointed tosee, were not immediately gunned down in a hail of bullets. (One of them was, but this was not enough apparently.) Presumably their“whiteness” was a count against them. Biden and his allies are now abandoning any pretense of a desire for “unity” or reconciliation, as if this event is what finally convinced them that Trump is a fascist whosesupporters need to be marginalized andsilenced. Right. With Trump gone, they will use the Capitol “insurrection” to further disenfranchise hissupporters without hesitation. While many on the Right have condemned the Capitol protesters, hoping that by doingso they will bespared, the Left has already launched a propaganda offensive to convince the public that what transpired was one of the worst things ever to happen in American history, and the inevitable consequence of an aberrational presidency. Everyone whosupports Trump now, or has eversupported him, is thereby implicated in this “terrorism.”We find ourselves in an unsustainablesituation. Millions of Americans never have felt more unwelcome in their own country, more disillusioned, or more vulnerable to an unaccountable enemy that hates them with a powerful, homicidal loathing. Their own party has unconcealed indifference and contempt for them. They’re “racists” and “conspiracy theorists” just for existing and having thoughts and perceptions that contradict the propaganda of the people who want to destroy them. If they try to defend themselves by voting, their votes will be dismissed as “illegitimate” and they will be branded enemies of the public. When your back is at the wall and you’re facing a mob,sooner or later you have to defend yourself before they bludgeon you to death.

357,McConnell’s “Liability Shield” Is a Weapon Aimed at COVID-19 Victims,-10.0,38.33,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/06/mcconnells-liability-shield-is-a-weapon-aimed-at-covid-19-victims/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"Last week, Senate Republicans unveiled the HEALS Act, their proposal to address the continued devastation that COVID-19 is wreaking on the country. The Act, a collection of discrete bills authored by various Senators, would have far-reaching consequences. One of the bills, Texas Senator John Cornyn’sSAFE TO WORK Act, would restrict lawsuits based on coronavirus exposure against employers, businesses, and many other potential defendants. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that the liability restrictions are a critical Republican requirement for further COVID-19 relief measures. Senator Cornyn claims that his bill “would protect those acting in good faith from beingsued into oblivion while ensuring bad actors who willingly put their patients, employees, or customers in danger willstill be held accountable.” Employers and businesses no doubt are dealing with great challenges given these extraordinary circumstances. And it issensible for legislators toseek a balance between accountability for bad actors who fail to take reasonable precautions and the threat of ruinous liability for employers and businesses doing their best. Yet the bill’s complex procedural requirements make any hope of accountability impossible. In fact, the bill actually encourages harmful behavior. The legislation’s provisions are complex, but here’s a brief overview of how it works. It creates a new federal cause of action that preempts other federal,state, or tribal causes of action “related to recovery for personal injuries caused by actual, alleged, feared, or potential for exposure to coronavirus.” The federal cause of action requires plaintiffs to prove that the defendant’s “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct” caused injury. That means that even if,say, Missouri law permitted a line cook harmed by a restaurant’s ordinary negligence that caused them to contract COVID-19 tosue for damages, federal law would forbid thesuit. The only exception is for laws that are more restrictive, meaning the goal isn’t uniformity, just limits on liability. This alone is quitesignificant. The bill is purportedly justified under Congress’s constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. Senator Cornyn himself has previouslystressed that “thestates retain the general lawmaking power” and rejected the notion that “the power to regulate interstate commerce essentially makes the federal government a government of unlimited power.” Yet he and his fellow Republicans, who extol the virtues of federalism,seem happy enough to make an unprecedented federal power grab here by federalizing tort law—which is normally withinstates’ control. That’s especially unjustified given that manystates have already beguncraftingliability-limitation legislation. But the bill goes much further. It contains numerous interlocking procedural restrictions that make it essentially impossible for a plaintiff to prevail. For one, the bill requires proof by “clear and convincing” evidence—an unusually high burden for most civil cases. It requires plaintiffs to detail their factual allegations with a much higher degree ofspecificity than is usually required. The bill also creates a “safe harbor” for defendants, whichsays that whenever a defendant can point to any “written or published policy” in line with applicable government regulations, the defendant will be presumed to have acted reasonably, even if the “policy” is just boilerplate language they did not actually follow. If a defendant’s motion to dismiss thesuit is unsuccessful, it can take an immediate appeal—potentially delaying litigation for years. Plaintiffs’ ability to obtain relevant evidence through discovery issharply limited. Damages for any plaintiff lucky enough to achieve a victory are restricted. Each one of these requirements individually puts a big thumb on thescale in favor of defendants. Collectively, they pose nearly insuperable obstacles to recovery for plaintiffs—even when theyseek recovery from actors who engaged in egregious misconduct that caused death orserious injury. The effect will be to discourage entities,such as warehouse operators or meat-packing plants, to take even reasonable precautions to prevent harm. But few plaintiffs would really ever risk getting this far. That’s because of the worst provisions in what is already a bad bill. The Act doesn’t just make it hard for plaintiffs to win; it makes it potentially devastating for them to even considersuit. If a victim requests compensation “in exchange forsettling . . . or otherwise not pursuing a claim that is, or could be, brought as part of a coronavirus-related action,” the recipient of the request canseek compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees if the claim is “meritless.”Given how hard the Act makes it to winsuch claims, and how easy it makes it for defendants to demonstrate that they took “reasonable precautions,” the Act has all but pre-ordained all COVID-19 claims as “meritless.” In practice, an employee who merely em ails her employer requesting compensation for COVID-19-related harm caused by the employer’s negligence exposes herself to thousands of dollars in damages. This provision would discourage reasonable requests for compensation by employees. And it may well violate the First Amendment’s guarantee of freespeech, given that it effectively punishes employees forsimply communicating with their employers. Nor will victims easily find legal representation. Lawyers, too, can besued for “meritless” compensation requests. The Act also permits the U. S. Attorney General tosue anyone who he “has reasonable cause to believe . . . is engaged in a pattern or practice of transmitting demands for remuneration” that are meritless. Each compensation demand exposes thesender to a civil fine of up to $50,000. Lawyers representing COVID-19 plaintiffs would quickly be put out of business. At thesame time, the bill would create a cottage industry forsuits against injured plaintiffs and their attorneys. These lucrative countersuits aresubject to none of thestringent requirements the bill places on injured partiesseeking compensation. In total, the bill represents an assault on the American civil justicesystem that is without precedent in federal law. In the few instances where Congress has broadly preemptedstate lawsuits, it has doneso alongside federal regulatoryschemes designed to promote the public good or alternativesystems for compensating injured parties. Congress preempted lawsuits against the airline industry arising out of the September 11 attacks, but it quickly created a Victims’ Compensation Fund to compensate 9/11 victims and their families. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act bars tort claims against vaccine manufacturers, but it also created a compensation program to provide recovery to those injured by vaccines without the need to establish fault by the manufacturer. Here, by contrast, Senate Republicans want to preventstates from using tort liability, but they are leaving health regulation to thestates and aren’t creating any federal mechanisms for compensating victims. There aresteps Congress might take that wouldstrike an appropriate balance between victim’s interests, the need to protect essentialservices acting reasonably, and federalism values. Instead, this bill gives businesses a free pass at the expense of COVID-19’s victims. If passed into law, the bill would make it anything butsafe for the country to go back to work.",1,1,Washington Monthly
358,Skirting Ida,-4.67,37.33,https://www.thebulwark.com/skirting-ida/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-01,17,"Just as we finish repairing the damage to our home from last October’s Hurricane Zeta, my husband and I board up andsandbag for Ida. We have plenty of water, food, batteries, flashlights, gas for the generator and the car. For 48 hours, we move furniture and computers away from windows, roll up rugs and place towels under the windows and doors. Saturday evening, while gulls fly with the bats, we even relax and ride our bikes around town, taking before-Ida pictures to post onsocial media, telling friends that for Mississippians, Ida would just be a tropicalstorm, and we’restaying put. Six years ago, we moved to Pass Christian, a beautiful coastal town that Hurricane Katrina mostly destroyed in 2005. Nothing is good when it comes to hurricanes, but hurricaneseason is when coastal communities come together. We help each other. And in a divided, COVID-sick South, kindness is a welcome distraction. But, late Saturday night right before we go to bed, the hurricane quicklyshifts course east towards Mississippi, going from a Category 2 to a 4. The tone in the TV newscasters’ voicesshifts, too. We have our hurricane kit with important papers, granola bars, can opener, peanut butter, and toilet paper, but it’sstrange and nonsensical what you choose to throw in a car at midnight. I grab a favorite painting, my computer, purse, embroidery, a first edition of Eudora Welty’s, instant coffee, a bag of muffins, my grandmother’s pearls, and a bag of paperclips. Then I pack an ice chest full of gumbo. My husband packs his documentary film footage,someshorts, t-shirts, and boots. The roads are clear as we head north in the dark. Our plan is to go to a friend’s house outside of Jackson, but that’s where Ida’s headed, too. We decide it’ssafer to drive east into Alabama. As we near a town, we call hotels. They’re all booked with hurricane evacuees from Louisiana. In Montgomery, we luck out. One last room at a Holiday Inn Express, where, at 4 a.m., we pull into a packed parking lot. Safe,sort of. Inside,some evacuees are milling around,sleepless and without masks. Late the following morning, we doom-scroll through Twitter for Ida news, discovering that even a hurricane can be political. QAnon conspiracy theorists tweet that Ida is man-made. They cheer for the destruction of New Orleans. We check the TV. Ida is wreaking havoc in New Orleans and it’s on its way to Pass Christian. In downtown Montgomery, we walk around in the rain,stopping for coffee at a hip coffeeshop and community center. We read plaques honoring Rosa Parks, then tour asmall,Hank Williams museum with Williams’s old dinetteset, cowboysuits, and boots. For a long while, westand in front of his blue Cadillac convertible, where he died in the backseat of a heart attack. In 1953, he’d been on his way to a performance, and had hired a college kid to drive him because of a threatening icestorm. Back at the hotel, we check the weather again before we go to bed. Our friends in Pass Christian are in for a terrifying night of howling winds and tornado warningsirens. It’sstrange to wish we were there, riding it out with them. Ida is a different kind of hurricane, not only because of itssudden change instrength, but because of howsome people are reacting. Monday morning, we watch NBC correspondent Shaquille Brewster reporting live from a Gulfport beach when a pickup truck drives up behind him. A white man jumps out, runs toward him,shouting “cover this accurately,” and lunges at Brewster, who is black. Brewster cuts to a newscaster whosays there’s a lot of crazy out there. The Memorial for Peace and Justice is closed,so we head back home early, even though it might be toosoon. We drive through a rainy outer band, wipers at full tilt and hazards blinking,slowing at tornado warnings as we cross Little Lizard Creek near Satsuma and Chickasaw. A neighborsends a picture of our house,saying it looks okay. We can’t believe it. When we get there, Pass Christian in general looks okay, too. Some fences andshutters are down, but nothing like the aftermath of Zeta. The bookstore reopens that afternoon. So does the Waffle House. Back at our house, wesurvey the damage. A fewshingles have blown off the roof, but nothing that can’t be fixed. Our Louisiana neighbors weren’t as lucky. We’re exhausted with the weather. Our backs ache from luggingsandbags and moving furniture. Why do we live in this crazy place?In his book, Sebastian Junger writes about how nomads are not bound by fixed areas, how they move without difficulty, often at a moment’s notice. This is a form of freedom. Sometimes, neither one of us wants the burden of a home, but we are tied to this place whether we want to be or not. I check our community Facebook page,scrolling through funny posts about hurricane food and updates on neighborhood flooding bringing unwanted visitors—alligators. I read an alert that the Gulfport police need help identifying the white man who harassed Shaquille Brewster on the beach. There’s a follow-up post. The man has beenidentified—his truck has Ohio license plates. We open theshutters and begin to put our house back in order. Newscastersshift from talk of Ida back to Afghanistan. There’s a text from a neighbor asking if we need any help and a message that a guy’s coming over to fix the roof tomorrow. We invite New Orleans friends without power or water to comestay with us. Tonight, we’ll have gumbo.",1,1,The Bulwark

360,Omaha police warned of arrests during march; protesters call officers' actions 'unnecessary',-1.0,49.33,https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/omaha-police-warned-of-arrests-during-march-protesters-call-officers-actions-unnecessary/article_8fb28b34-a3ee-51e2-8bec-2f01397ba7ee.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,22,"For nearly an hour Saturday, a group of more than 150 protesters marched from near Midtown Crossing to downtown Omaha before heading back west on Farnam Street. They were a couple of blocks away from where they hadstarted when officers, who for 47 minutes had announced that the protesters’ march was an unlawful assembly, began arresting people. Protesters havesaid they planned to disperse as they neared their cars, but the police moved in. Policesaid they could have arrested the protesters any time after their first warning, but were “looking for asafe opportunity to make an arrest.”A time line of events released Wednesday by Omaha police details the protesters’ route and officers’ response. Protesters have criticized the arrests as excessive or unnecessary. The protest began at 7:30 p.m. as a gathering in Turner Park at 30th and Farnam Streets. The event was organized by 23-year-old Alexander Matthews tostand insolidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, and demand justice forJames Scurlock. Scurlock wasshot and killed in the Old Market after a protest May 30. Matthews, who goes by the name Bear Alexander, is one of the leaders of proBLAC, a local organization thatsupports and inspires activism, especially prio rit izing voices of people of color. After the rally at Turner Park, Matthewssaid, he and other proBLAC leaders planned to go to the City-County Building for another rally but decided to mount a full march instead.“We wanted to march down Farnam andshow everybody whosestreets these are,” hesaid. “There was no malicious intent whatsoever.”Matthews and other protesters told The World-Herald that they noticed police cruisers blocking crossstreets and following them as they marched downtown, around the Old Market and back along Farnam. No acts of vandalism were reported by police, but theysaid protesters knocked over construction barrels and cones. Doing that impeded cruisers from following the group and “caused asafety issue for anyone else utilizing thestreets after the (protesters’) passage.”Omaha policesaid protesters knocked over construction barrels and cones, which theysaid could impede others using thestreets. Mark Vondrasek, 29, was riding a bicycle during the march. Hesaid that on the way downtown, near 24th and Farnam Streets, he heard officers announce that the march was an unlawful assembly and that protesters weresubject to arrest. The announcements were repeatedseveral times, and the fifth announcement, policesaid, ended with “go home now.” Other protesterssaid they didn’t hear those warnings until they returned to the Farnam bridge about an hour later. One officer noted that hesaw a handful of people leave after the announcements were made. Policesaid they repeated the warnings at 19th and Farnam, 13th and Howard Streets and 12th and Howard. At the Farnam Street bridge over Interstate 480, the announcement changed to “you are under arrest.”Policesaid walking in thestreet can be extremely dangerous and is against the law without prior authorization and planning with local authorities. “There are numerous examples across the country of protesters taking to thestreet and beingstruck and even killed by motorists,” policesaid. At 8:50 p.m. Saturday, an Omaha police officer in a cruiser at 24th and Farnam Streets announced to protesters, “This has been declared an unlawful assembly. You are allsubject to arrest.”In itsstatement Wednesday, the departmentsaid Matthews “did not contact police forsafety assistance and had not obtained a parade permit.”Matthewssaid he never will tell the police about his organization’s plan for a rally or march.“We at proBLAC will never, ever ask an oppressivesystem if, when and how we can protest against their oppression,” hesaid. “The police want us tostay on the corner. They want us to be docile. They want us to not make noise. They want us to besubmissive and they want us to be weak. Because when we are weak, we can be controlled.”During the march, policesaid, protesters blocked all lanes of Farnam Street. Some people also walked on thesidewalk. Policesaid Vondrasek blocked a police cruiser with his bicycle in the Old Market before taking off when police attempted to apprehend him. Omaha policesaid protester Mark Vondrasek intentionally blocked a police cruiser in the Old Market during Saturday's march. At 9:36 p.m., policesaid, all remaining protesters were on the bridge over I-480. Police then blocked both ends of the bridge. Policesaid the lieutenantsupervising the protest “had a plan in place to make arrests on the bridge as it had better containment of individuals and was a bettersafety option.”Policesaid a policesergeant yelled 12 times that the group was under arrest while Matthews yelled with a megaphone: “We are peaceful protesting.”According to aseparate police report, officers had given “numerous direct orders for protesters to get on the ground,” telling them they were under arrest. Officer Robert Soldo thensaw Vondrasek “turn his bicycle towards officers, load his pedal and attempt to flee while riding his bicycle directly at officers,” the narrativesays. Soldosaw Officer Nicola Bay “attempt tostop Vondrasek from fleeing, at which time Vondrasek crashed his bicycle into Ofc. Soldo,” the reportsays. A video of the altercationshows one officer pushing Vondrasek on his bicycle, causing him to crash into an officer. Soldo pushed Vondrasek away, the reportsays, and then Soldo fired “five direct impact pepper ball rounds to Vondrasek’s rightside.”“The pepper ball deployment was approximately five feet away and appeared to be effective,” according to the report. Vondraseksaid the pepper balls hit his chest,shoulder, back and butt cheek and caused bleeding and bruising. Saturday, Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza told reporters that one pepper ball was deployed, but the report lists more. Be the first to know when news happens. Get the latest breaking headlinessentstraight to your inbox. OPD did not respond to a request,submitted Tuesday, asking how many officers fired pepper balls. According to police reports, Soldo was the only officer who fired pepper balls. Whencounting force for their ownstatistics, OPD counts each force type per incident per officer — not the number of pepper ball rounds or, for example, Taser trigger pulls. Vondraseksaid he was attempting to get away, and not trying run into anyone.“I hadsort of moved to the front, and I had an opportunity to try to bike away,” Vondraseksaid. “I tried to and (officers) caught me. Theysort ofstarted throwing me around, theyshot me withsome pepper balls and tackled me to the ground.”Vondraseksaid he thinks the use of force by police was “excessive.”“We were two blocks away from where we hadstarted, and if police had let us continue we would have gone back to the park and immediately dispersed,” hesaid. “It would have been over within 10 minutes, but they chose to end it on their terms and commit unnecessary acts of violence.”Policesaid that at that point, they didn’t know whether the march was going to continue or end. Vondrasek was the first protester arrested and booked into the Douglas County Jail. Cole Christensen, 28, was arrestedshortly thereafter. Policesay he was arrested onsuspicion of interfering with officers. According to the police report, Omaha Police Sgt. Brendan O’Flynn was arresting Vondrasek when Soldosaw Christensen, who was holding a leaf blower and asign, run toward them. Soldo then firedsix pepper ball rounds at Christensen’s back, according to the report. In the report, officerssaid the use of force was appropriate because Vondrasek and Christensen were “actively resisting” — Vondrasek “bumped into” Soldo and Christensen interfered with the arrest and reached to grab O’Flynn. Vondrasek and Christensen were told to usesoap and water to wash off residual powder from the pepper balls, the reportsaid. Christensensaid the injuries caused him to bleed through hisshirt. Protester Neal Duffy, 38,said he never heard any instruction or announcements from police that night other than “back up” right before he was arrested. Hesaid the group was constantly chanting and Matthews was on the bullhorn, adding to the noise.“If (the police’s) message was for us to disperse, it was a minimal attempt for them to tell us that,” hesaid. “And a lackadaisical one at that.”After the altercation with Vondrasek, Duffysaid, he heard one officer tell others, “Put them all in handcuffs.” Hesaid an officer thenslammed him into the bridge railing, took him to the ground, put a zip tie on him and then kneed him in the ribs. Duffysaid he plans to file a complaint, butsaid he doesn’t know who the officer was. Matthewssaid that when he was arrested, he was told he was resisting arrest because he put his hands up and didn’t lie on the ground. Matthews, Duffy and Vondraseksaid policeshould have just issued citations and allowed people to go home, which is what theysaid protesters were trying to do.“If people think that this kind of police violence is necessary in order to protect traffic flow, I think that’s pretty clearly an excuse for you to feel OK about thestate using violence in order to oppress your political opponents, which is fascism,” Vondraseksaid. In its Wednesday timeline, Omaha policesaid “on-scene command made the decision to book the involved parties into jail out of fear that disturbances and potential further criminal activity would continue in the downtown area if they were cited and released.”Officers arrested 120 people. Most of them were booked on failure to disperse and obstructing passage. Other charges included negligent driving, obstructing officers, resisting arrest and unlawful assembly. Those who were arrestedsaid they experienced harsh conditions and long processing delays at the Douglas County Jail.

The firstseven hotel closures—scheduled for Dec. 21, mere weeks away—will likely trigger aspike instreet-based homelessness during a time when deaths among unhoused people are up 123% and overdose deaths are up 70%. The closures will require mass layoffs of front line hotel workers right before a major holiday. And according to the plan, only one in five of the 500 hotel residentsslated for “rehousing” will actually get a housing referral (a referral is a match with housing; it is not housing). The time line raises disturbing public health questions: why now? The SIP hotels have been a mainstay of The City’s COVID-19 response.

Whyshut them down now, earlier than almost all of the other Bay Area counties, when these counties coordinatedsuccessful public health orders that have held off disaster for most of the year?The City’s answer is that SIP hotels, while effective, are expensive. But we all knew this. San Francisco put a premium on public health when Mayor London Breed ordered, andstuck to, months-long closures of non-essential business and activities. Those investments are paying off as the virus rages beyond the Bay Area. Toshut down the SIP hotels because they’re expensive is a deeplyshortsighted reversal. The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in fundingsupportservices in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerAnd it does not answer the question, “Why now?” A Biden-Harris administration will help us all breathe easier about federal reimbursements. At thestate level, Project Homekey has awarded San Francisco almost $75 million over the last two months to convert hotel properties to permanent housing—new inventory that could rehouse people from the SIP hotels once it comes online. And just last week, San Francisco voters approvedseveral new revenue measures that could generatesubstantial funding forsimilar initiatives. With nearly $500 million in Proposition C funding unlocked by the courts in September, it is dumbfounding why The City would ask the SIP hotel operators to issue potentially hundreds of pinkslips to their workers, right before the holidays. Proposition C’s win means that oursector will need to hire — not fire — an expanded workforce of case managers,shelter counselors and other front linestaff to maximize our housing-related investments. Now is not the time for layoffs: it is time tostart ending homelessness and creating an inclusive economic recovery. Our homeless responsesystem has made a commitment to data-driven decision-making that centers racial equity. But we lack basic demographic data for about half of the SIP hotel residents. This is a critical gap given the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on people of color. The most rational, data-driven thing we can do right now is collect the demographic data and develop a clear plan that does not relocate people of color either to the unemployment lines or to thestreets. There is too much atstake to forge ahead on a “rehousing plan” that isshort on planning and evenshorter on housing. Wesimply lack capacity to relocate 2,400 people in less than eight months without returning many of them to thestreets. Noservice provider in either coalition thinks of the SIP hotels as a long-term response to homelessness—but we broadly (if not unanimously) agree that now is not the time toshut them down. It’s not good policy. We can do better in the City of St. Francis.",1,2,SF Examiner

363,Joe Biden Taps ‘Transgender’ Rachel Levine to HHS Position,7.33,39.33,https://www.ncregister.com/cna/joe-biden-taps-transgender-rachel-levine-to-hhs-position,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,16,"President-elect Joe Biden will nominate asupporter of the contraceptive mandate to a top position at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), he announced on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Biden announced that he would nominate Dr. Rachel Levine, a biological man identifying as a transgender woman who hasserved as Pennsylvania’s healthsecretarysince 2017, to be HHS Assistant Secretary for Health. Beforeserving as Pennsylvania’s healthsecretary, Levineserved as thestate’s physician general. Levine has been outspoken onsocial issues,supporting gender-transitionsurgery and the contraceptive mandate while opposing a proposed 20-week abortion ban. Levine’s nomination to HHS, along with that of Health Secretary nominee Xavier Becerra,signals thatsocial issues could be priorities at the agency for the nextseveral years. These might include pro-LGBTQ policies, funding of abortion providers, and religious freedom conflicts with Catholic organizations. Regarding the Obama-era HHS contraceptive mandate, Levine in 2017 called it “immoral and unethical” to allow for religious exemptions to the mandate. Hundreds of non-profits and businesses—including the Little Sisters of the Poor—had objected to the mandate and the Obama administration’s opt-out process for objecting non-profits. After the Trump administration announced in 2017 that religious employers and other organizations morally opposed to the contraceptive mandate could receive exemptions from it, Levine issued asharpstatement in opposition.“It is immoral and unethical to give any employer the ability to take away access to health care from an entire gender,” Levinesaid as Pennsylvania’s acting healthsecretary, in 2017. “We cannot allow women's health to be reduced to one issue or be jeopardized in any way.”Levine also wrote an op-ed against the Trump administration’s reversal of Obama-era rules on transgender accommodation. In Feb., 2017, the Trump administrationsaid it wouldstop defending the Obama administration’s transgender bathroom policy in court; the policy had directedschools to allowstudents to use gender-specific bathrooms according to their gender identity, and not their biologicalsex. In an op-ed for thePatriot-News, Levine wrote that “[t]he decision by the Trump administration to roll back the most basic protections for transgender and gender expansive youth is heartbreaking.”“To Pennsylvania‘s transgender and gender expansive youth and their families who are worried or concerned, I want you to know that Governor Wolf’s administration has your back,” Pennsylvania’s then-physician general wrote. In 2016, Levinespoke out against a 20-week abortion ban that criminal i zed abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy except in cases where the mother’s life was in danger. The bill also banned the “dilation and evacuation” abortion procedure. Levinesaid at the time that the bill “punishes women whose pregnancies have complications.”“Women and their families, when faced with a devastating diagnosis of asignificant fetal anomaly, have the right to make the decision which is appropriate for them, in consultation with their doctors,” Levinesaid. Levine’s family moved their mother out of a personal care home early in the COVID-19 pandemic, because of the highspread of the virus; the decision invitedsome mediascrutiny. Levine was also questioned for thestate’s policy of requiring nursing homes to accept recovering COVID patients from hospitals, although thestate healthsecretary responded that asymptomaticstaff at the homes—not patients discharged from hospitals—were the primaryspreaders of the virus there. If Levine is confirmed to HHS, along with Becerra, they together could craft policy to influence a number of issues including abortion, gender-transitionsurgery, and the contraceptive mandate. While California’s attorney general, Becerra fought aggressively in favor of an abortion coverage mandate that religious employers were not exempt from, and continued the prosecution of pro-life activist David Daleiden. If confirmed as Health Secretary, Becerra — a Catholic — could reignite a number of Obama-era policies that the U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and other Catholic groups were opposed to. These might include resurrecting court battles with the Little Sisters of the Poor and other Catholic groups that opposed the Obama administration’s procedure by which to “opt out” of the contraceptive mandate. The groupssaid that the policystill required them to provide coverage for contraceptives through their employee health plans, which they morally objected to. Other HHS policies could include re-imposing the full transgender mandate—a requirement that doctors perform gender-transitionsurgery upon the referral of a mental health professional—and various requirements of religious groups that receive HHS grants,such as adoption agencies having to match children withsame-sex couples.",1,1,National Catholic Register

One reader, Tony_Petroski,said, “[Y]ou have tostartsomewhere. You needsomestrategy beyond civil war. I think the Professor’ssuggestion is a good one and not meresatire.” Reader Gefilte Fisherman added, “Angelo Codevilla has a Great Idea.” A reader named Patriot wrote, “I like this idea as well. At every opportunity, we need to go on the offense and talk about the lawlessness and how their total corruption is anti-constitutional and costs taxpayers billions.”Still others thought it was unrealistic to expect the GOP toshow any “bold” leadership, as Watsyxz noted, “Wishful thinking. Our elected Republicans have alreadysurrendered to the will of the Democrats. Both Ds and Rs don’t give a wit about the voters who put them in office. They care only about getting re-elected,staying in good favor with the Media, and care aboutsocializing with each other, the elite members of The Ruling Class.”Former Virginia Congressman Dave Brat, whoserved two terms in the House of Representatives after defeating former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor,said it would be a bad idea for Republicans to disengage from the process. Hesaid the most important thing Republicans can do now isstrongly push back on “the terriblestuff going on in our country right now.”“We’re going to have to fight back,” Bratsaid. “The awful comments that Pelosi has made about Members on the Republicanside of the aisle are just horrific. We have a platform, and the American people want to hear from us.”Bratsaid he understands the temptation to “cut the cord” from institutional power right now, but hesaid that is the last thing weshould do. “Instead we need tostand up to this radical leftist push for power.” Hesaid too often conservatives makes rational policy arguments that just fade away in time, when what we really need to be doing is “taking real estate back in our major institutions,such as the CIA, the FBI, and the State Department, basically the Deep State.”House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appears to recognize that many Republicans are disengaging from politics andstarted aseries on his blog,The Starting Line,that featuresstories of average, hard-working Americans who aresuffering under Biden’s job-crushing executive orders. Earlier this week, McCarthy posted, “We receivedsome positive feedback on yesterday’s post aboutLaurie Cox and her hotel in Midland, South Dakota. This got us thinking about communications. The more timespent focusing on what’s happening on Twitter, the less in touch we are with what our constituents are thinking about or what their lived experiences are. Thosestories are far more interesting. We will continue toshare them.”While effortssuch as those are astart, they are far from the robust response Brat thinks is needed.“Even the minority party in Congress has tremendous power in terms of reaching out to the media and educating the American people on all the things that the people want to hear right now and they’re just not hearing it,” Brat explained. “They’re not hearing anybodystep up to the plate and defend the Main Street folks.”Brat added that Republicans need to focus less on policy and more on big picture cultural issues dividing the country. “The reason people areso upset on a gut level is because they know the fundamental American values are being tipped upside down right now.”Americans for Limited Government PresidentRick Manningagrees that Republicans need tostand and fight in Congress, and not disengage. “While it is tempting to pack up our bats and balls and go home, people get elected to Congress to be in the game and to fight like crazy for the interest of their constituents and America. Disengagement insurrender.”Bratsaid he misses the friends he made in Congress, but not the vile personal attacks, which he noted have gotten worsesince Biden’s Inauguration. “Since they don’t have Trump to vilify anymore, they are going to vilify anyone whosupported him. And our leadership is notstanding up to these attacks because they’rescared and hiding under their desks.”Brat, who is now dean of the businessschool at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, recommends reading the introduction to the 1987 classic “Closing of the American Mind” by Allan Bloom. The book anticipates America’s cultural collapsestemming from “moral relativism.” Bratsaid there is much we can learn today from Bloom. “One of his major themes is the revaluing of all values, and that leads to George Orwell and all that we’reseeing right now.”",0,0,Daily Torch
365,Samsung profit surges on strong chip demand,0.67,51.5,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/samsung-profit-surges-on-strong-chip-demand-2020-07-29,https://adfontesmedia.com/marketwatch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,25,"SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. reported a boost in itssecond-quarter net profits Thursday, aided by a one-time gain in its display business and the continuing coronavirus-fueled bump in memory chip demand. But the world's largestsmart phone and memory-chip maker is likely to face challenges, as the realities of the Covid-19 pandemicsettle in. Large cloud computing companies thatstockpiled chipsso far may dial down their buying, whilesmart phone demand recovery may beslow in the near future. Samsung is a proxy for the global economy, both as a manufacturer ofsmartphones, televisions and home appliances and as a partssupplier to the world's largest electronics firms. The firm's unexpectedsuccess in the first half of the yearshowed how the tech industry could profit from asurge in internet demand, as more workers clocked in from home. Demand for onlineservices and data-serversuppliers -- which include Samsung's memory chips --soared. But the pullback in global discretionaryspending, resulting from job losses to pandemic lockdowns, has harmed Samsung'ssales ofsmart phones and other consumer electronics. Samsung'ssecond-quarter net profits rose to 5.56 trillion South Korean won ($4.67 billion) in the quarter ending June 30, versus 5.18 trillion won for the prior year's quarter. Operating profits rose to 8.15 trillion South Korean won ($6.8 billion) over 6.6 trillion won a year before. Revenue dipped about 6% to 52.97 trillion won ($44.4 billion) from 56.13 trillion won during thesame period a year ago. Analysts had projected aslight decline in revenue but a rise in profits after the company's earnings guidance earlier this month. Much of the positive performance in thesecond quarter was driven by peaking demand from data centers, which ramped up as employees hollowed out offices to work from home andsocialize remotely. But many of those buyers, who fearedsupply-chain disruptions early on, built up inventories of memory chips that will now carry them through thesecond half of the year,said S. K. Kim, an analyst at Daiwa Securities. Samsung's display business also got a profit bump from Apple Inc., thanks to a penalty payment baked into a deal between thesmart phone rivals, analystssaid. Samsung is the mainsupplier for the premium flexible OLEDscreens used in Apple's newer iPhones. Typical industry contracts require a penalty payment to the componentsupplier, if a client purchases fewer units than required, especially in capital-heavy manufacturing. This year's payment, estimated to be around $900 million to $950 million, would be the largest payment by Apple to Samsungsince the Cupertino, Calif.,-based companysigned an OLED deal with its South Korean counterpart in 2016, analystssaid. Samsung is overwhelmingly the No. 1 player for these particular displays, prized because the glass can be curved to give users a biggerscreen or asleeker design. But the Apple payment is less a windfall than a cushion for the major investment Samsung has already made in building up its OLED manufacturing,said Bob O'Brien, co-founder of Display Supply Chain Consultants. For now, Samsung appears to have overshot demand, as the OLEDscreens -- generally the priciest component in a premium handset -- haven't been adopted by othersmart phone makers outside of Apple and Samsung, Mr. O'Brien added. ""Samsung built more capacity than they needed,"" hesaid. ""This payment from Apple issort of like insurance -- you only collect insurance whensomething bad happens.""Lowered consumer demand for handsets -- Samsung's other main profit driver -- have also weakened the company's performance. As it prepares to debut new models in its flagship Galaxy Note line next week, the company isstill trying to move excess inventory of its main Galaxy S20 devices,said Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst with Susquehanna International Group. The Galaxy S20 hitshelves in March, as the coronavirus pandemicshut down retailers and crimped consumer purchasing. The company is leaning on affordable options like its mid price 5G-enabled options like the Galaxy A71 in the U. S. and other markets to boost volume. Samsung is also expected to price its Galaxy Note phones much more competitively and potentially trim the price tags on its Galaxy S20 devices to recoupsome losses. Worldwidesmart phoneshipmentssank by nearly 20% in the first quarter of the year compared with the year prior, according to industry research firm Strategy Analytics. Samsung's phoneshipmentssank by more than 18% to 58.3 million devices during that period, the firmsaid.

Turns out,Ponsetto's lawyersuggestedshe remove her ""Daddy"" baseball cap before the exclusive interview. ""We asked her to wear professional attire,"" attorney Sharen Ghatan told The Daily Beast. ""Ispecifically asked her to remove it before the interview."" But Ghatan described Ponsetto as ""defiant,"" ""insistent,"" and a ""very challenging client,""so the capstayed on. Notice the lawyer neglected to use the word ""racist,"" yet Ponsetto's attitude, actions, and, by extension, her outfit are charged withsupposedsuperiority. There's privilege at work here. Ponsetto was arrested on Friday in Californiaafter allegedly physically assaulting 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. on Dec. 26 at the Arlo Hotel in New York City. Onlookers (including Harrold Jr.'s father, renowned jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold Sr.)caught Ponsetto's tirade against the Black teen on camera, asshe falsely accused him ofstealing her cell phone and threw him to the ground. After the attack, the internet labeled Ponsetto as ""SoHo Karen"" when video of her aggression went viral. You'd hope that Ponsetto would've used her time with King on Friday to apologize andshow remorse for her actions. You'd be disappointed. Ponsetto appeared on camera in a puzzlingly casual outfit, wearing a $16 Urban Outfitters baseball cap. If an outfit makes a first impression, one could assume Ponsetto was aware the message her indifference wouldsend to King and to the world watching. ""[The hat] was important to her,"" Ghatansaid, althoughshe couldn't explain why. The lawyer admittedshe's concerned for Ponsetto's mental health. Clearly, Ponsetto's obstinance indicated what was to come. She gaslit Harrold Jr. with insincere apologies, only acknowledging ""if I insulted him or hurt his feelings."" She danced around questions and leaned heavily on excuses in an attempt tospin thestory as a victim. She ignored her lawyer's attempts at intervention. In an especially improbable exchange,shesnapped at King. Theseasoned interviewer tried to hold Ponsetto accountable by telling her, ""You're 22 years old, but you are old enough to know better."" Ponsetto responded with a wave of her hand, andsaid, ""All right, Gayle, enough.""Everysecond of Ponsetto'ssix-minute interview further emphasizes her immense privilege. She described herself as ""supersweet"" and then, in nearly thesame breath,shushed an acclaimed journalist — and Black woman — on national TV. She treated the interaction as if it were barely worth her time,seemingly undaunted by the consequences of her actions. In fact,she appeared blind to her own actions entirely. ""I'm a 22-year-old girl. . . . How is a girl accusing a guy about a phone a crime? Where is the context in that?""she asked. Despite Ponsetto's insistence,she's not a girl,she's a woman. A full-grown adult, actually. Harrold Jr., on the other hand, isn't a ""guy"" — especially in comparison to Ponsetto. He's at the beginning of his teen years, closer to childhood than whatever innocence Ponsetto tried to claim for herself. And for the record, making a false accusation is a crime if it's reported to the police. Privilege and assumed power like Ponsetto's are engrained over time. Society consistently reaffirms that just looking a certain way will fill in the gaps for anyshortcomings. Frighteningly, Ponsetto's privilege acts as thesamesupposed ""shield"" that emboldens people like the Donald Trump-supporting mob who attacked the nation's Capitol. A MAGA hat and a ""Daddy"" cap never feltso eerilysimilar. Hours after Ponsetto acted invincible in her conversation with King,she got her mugs hot taken. Much like Amy Cooper,the white woman who falsely claimed a Black birder was threatening her, Ponsetto will face charges, although it's unclear what they will be. Ponsettostill doesn'tsee her actions as racially charged, despitesingling out the Black teen and refusing to relent. For the record, the hotel had her phone. Although Ghatan canceled her client's future interviews, there'sstill a chance Ponsetto could resurface tospin thesame lies. Perhapsshe would do well to heed her own advice: ""Alright, Miya, enough."" In the meantime,someone please pour Gayle King a glass ofsomethingstrong and give her a raise. There isn't a paycheck big enough to cover the audacityshe dealt with this week.",1,1,Popsugar

So did Tom Perez, the head of the Democratic National Committee. Both rejected offers from Fox News to host political events during the 2020 Democratic primary, a town hall in Warren's case and a candidate debate for the DNC.""A Fox News town hall adds money to the hate-for-profit machine. To which Isay: hard pass,"" Warren plainlystated. And while he claimed ""Chris Wallace isn't my concern,"" Perez correctly identified that ""at the highest levels of Fox News they"" — meaning right-wing ideologues — ""have infiltrated the newsside."" Perez had tode fend his decision to Democratsat the time, but Chris Wallace's hapless performance as a presidential debate ""moderator"" on Tuesday evening may have finally made clear that Fox News is not an honest media broker. Not one host from the network can be trusted to present facts outside the requisite right-wing narrative. It's easy to feel for Wallace. At no point during thatrage-inducing national embarrassment did DonaldTrumpallow the first presidential debate of the 2020 campaign to play out as planned, at least according to what Wallace repeatedly reminded the president were the mutually agreed-upon rules. Wallace lost control in the first 90seconds and Trump ran roughshod over him for the next 90 minutes.""I'm the moderator of this debate and I'd like to ask my question,"" Wallace pleaded with Trump at one point. The host of ""Fox News Sunday"" told The New York Times earlier this week, ""If I've done my job right, at the end of the night, people willsay, 'That was a great debate, who was the moderator?'"" Wallace not only failed to meet his own lowstandard of uselessness, he actively aided Trump by peddling dangerous misinformation and pushing modulated versions of thesame right-wing narrative deployed by Trump, creating a dangerous feedback loop. Despite Trump's day-after complaints, for much of Tuesday's debate it was clear that Wallacesimply let the president moderate. ""If you want toswitchseats, we can do that,"" Wallace offered Trump a little more than an hour into the debate. Wallace repeatedly interrupted Biden to ask Trump questions. He then permitted Trump to keep talking over Biden without cutting him off, and allowed lie after lie to go unchallenged. Much too late, Wallace tried to exertsome control, but he rarely, if ever,succeeded. To be fair, no moderator deemed acceptable to the Trump campaign would conceivably have the chops to rein in the president. That would defeat his whole debatestrategy. Indeed, I'd predict that Wallace will eventually be graded the highest of the three presidential debate moderators after CSPAN call-in host Steve Scully and NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker get their turn. As Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote, the idea that either of them ""can hope to control things any better is a dubious one unless the format changessubstantially."" On Wednesday, the the Commission on Presidential Debates announced it may do just that: ""Last night's debate made clear additionalstructureshould be added to the format of the remaining debates to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues,"" the commissionsaid in astatement, adding that it is ""considering the changes"" and will ""announce those measuresshortly.""But what was even more troublesome than Wallace impotentlyshouting ""Mr. President!"" in exactly the way I ask my 10-month-old to not put everysingle thing he picks up into his mouth was the frame and premise Wallace deployed forseveral of the night's mostserious topics. On police violence and the ongoing protests in Portland, Oregon, the Fox News host portrayed the issue as nightly riots by the protesters — rather than nightly violence by police. People have assembled in Portland to protest police violence every night and cops have responded by brutalizing them. Wallace didn't mention the Trumpsupporters driving down thestreets following a pro-Trump rally,shooting random people with paint ball guns and pepper-spraying them. Wallace brought up anti fa — all-purpose right-wing bugaboo of the moment — but made no mention of the men who traveled to a Walmart in El Paso and asynagogue in Pittsburgh to carry out what they interpreted as a mission of violent racial animussupported by the president. Even if Wallace deserves plaudits for pressing Trump to denounce whitesupremacists, we wouldn't even be in thissituation if Fox News and the right-wing media hadn'tspent decades and billions of dollars promoting hate. Trump's most rambling monologues on Tuesday night were hard to follow for anyone not completely immersed in the Fox News conspiracy universe. Right after his horrific call-out to the Proud Boys, Trump declined an invitation to call for restraint following the election, calling instead for hissupporters toshow up as an intimidating force at the polls. Wallace then just let him go on unabated, making groundless allegations about election integrity. When Wallace asked Trump why he insisted on holding campaign rallies in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump falselysaid all of his rallies had been outdoors. Wallacesimply replied: ""You are right."" Wallace also tried to get Trump toshut up by promising him asoftball: ""You'll like this next question.""Give Wallace credit for asking a climate change question, the first in a presidential debatesince 2008, and almost getting an answer. But he failed as a moderator because Fox News can't be trusted when the network's entire motive is propaganda. The network even ran Trump campaign propaganda after the debate. Wallace's own colleagues won't defend him from Trump, even in the next hour, because they rely on Trump and his viewers.— Donald J. Trump (@Donald J.

Clearly this is extremely bad news for not just the company, which former executives believe is going to be “destroy[ed],” and Weisselberg, who faces more than a decade in prison if convicted on all charges, but the entire Trump clan too. WhileDonald Trumpis obviously the first name that comes to mind when envisioning ascenario in which a Trump family member issentenced to time in prison, according to numerous experts, his adult childrenshould be extremely concerned as well,starting with his favorite offspring:Ivanka Trump. Appearing on MSNBC on Monday, former federal prosecutor told hostAlicia Menendezthat last week’s charges were merely “an openingsalvo,” and that the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office hassent a message that (1) Weisselbergshould really, really consider flipping and cooperating against the Trumps, and (2)Cyrus Vance Jr.is just gettingstarted. “Prosecutors went to an amazing amount of effort toshow Weisselberg ‘we have everything we need,’ and they’re really not only pressuring him to flip, but the amount of detail in this indictment tells me that they’re trying to tell other people you have got to flip, because ‘we have everything; we have the double books. We know what you told your tax accountants was a lie. We know that we’re gonna be able to prove these cases,’” Alksne told Menendez. “So I think...first it’s Weisselberg and [then] there are a lot of other people mentioned, ‘individual number one’ or ‘person Xsigned’ or ‘person Ysigned.’ Those people who are mentioned in the indictment, I would expect they’re next and then it builds.” Asked howshe would proceed ifshe were prosecuting the case and “had access to the years of hidden records kept by the Trump Organization,” Alksnesaid, “I would focus [the investigation] on the kids. Apparently they’ve hadsome testimony byth e comptroller; in thestate of New York that means they’ve essentially given him immunity. So I would focus on the kids. My guess is [COOMatthew] Calamariis kind of easy picking and that there aresimilar ways to give money for the kids. We’ve heard a lot of this reporting about Ivanka Trump getting consulting fees, ‘consulting fees’ for things thatshe may or may not have done. That looks to me like the next place, but we’ll just have tosee.”(In November,New York Timesreportedthat both Vance and New York attorney general had issued consulting-fee-relatedsubpoenas to the Trump Organization following an investigation by the paper that revealed the president had paid little to no income tax over the last two decades. That report alsoshowed that Trump was able to reduce his taxable income by deducting approximately $26 million in “consulting fees” as business expenses between 2010 and 2018. While the consultants’ identities were notshown on tax records,some of the fees definitely appeared to have been paid to Ivanka, given that on a 2017 disclosure form,she reported having received $747,622 in payments from a consulting companyshe co-owned, a figure that, per theTimes,“exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii.” (At the time the payments were made, Ivanka was an executive officer of the Trump companies that made the payments, meaningsheseemingly was treated as a consultant to a company at whichshe was, wait for it, a full-time employee.)Alsopredictingthat Princess Purses could be in legal trouble was Trump biographer who told CNN’sJim Acostaon Sunday, “The other person who I think is in peril is Ivanka Trump.

369,Inside the Project Veritas Plan to Steal the Election,-19.0,33.0,https://newrepublic.com/article/158622/inside-project-veritas-plan-steal-election,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-03,25,"James O’Keefe had big plans for 2020. The founder of Project Veritas, the conspiratorial right-wing group thatspecializes in Fox News–friendly “stings” intended to exposesupposed liberal bias and corruption in Americansociety, was planning on getting married this past May. The wedding, to a publicschoolteacher, was to be at an exclusive country club in upstate New York. The guest list was packed with Make America Great Again world cognoscenti: Donald Trump Jr., Sean Hannity,Michelle Malkin, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and his activist wifeGinni were all invited, as wereseveral of O’Keefe’s most generous conservative donors, includingTexasshale oil billionaire George Bishop and Bullpen Capital founder PaulMartino. The wedding was, per an email blast, “postponed indefinitely”over the coronavirus, as the pandemicswept across thestate thisspring an dearlysummer. Although O’Keefe himself declined to comment on this and many other details for thisstory, awell-placed fr enemy is “90 percentsure they broke up.” Inany event, while the pandemic may have derailed his personal life, it has only heightened the urgency ofsome of O’Keefe’s most lucratively funded dirty tricks. For well over a year, Project Veritas has beensecretly producing undercoverstings designed to undermine the integrity of absentee and mail-inballot counts—an endeavor code named “Diamond Dog,” according to documents we have obtained. Diamond Dog began as only one facet of Project Veritas’s 2020 rat-fuckingstrategy, but with the onset of the pandemic, which has made in-person voting a dicey proposition, it hassince become one of the group’s top-line actionitems. Theshift reflects the Republican Party’s near-existential concerns about mail-in voting in November. Donald Trump has disingenuously railed against the practice numerous times over the past few months, betraying a deep anxiety. “Mail in ballotssubstantially increases the risk of crime andVOTER FRAUD!” he has tweeted. At other times he hasclaimed: “It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history”;“IT WILL ALSO LEADTO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY”;and “SCAM!” Last week, he wentso far as tosuggest that the electionshould bedelayed,saying that because of “Universal Mail-in Voting,” the vote would be “INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT.”The purpose of Diamond Dog, as onesource close to the organization put it, is “literally to get Trump reelected.” Thissource, like other past and present Project Veritas employees who have talked to us for this article, expressed fear of reprisals from the group and would onlyspeak under the condition of anonymity. Last year, Project Veritas’sdonor development teamsolicited big-ticket funders with a pitch deck—frequently tailored toa given patron’s pet ideological grievances and personal hang-ups—offering tantalizing details about thegroup’s undercover operations for the 2020campaign cycle. One iteration of this Apple Keynote file was prepared for anask meeting with a person who appears to beCognex Corporation founderRobert Shillman, a devoted funder of Islamophobic causes who was also one of O’Keefe’swould-be wedding guests. (Shillman ended up pledging to donate $50,000 to thegroup.) Theslate of investigations in the “Dr. Bob” pitch includedschemes to procure evidence of “illegal aliensvoting,” mail-inballot tampering at “nursinghomes,” and“thesale of absentee ballots and voter profiles on the ‘Dark Web.’”By the end ofsummer 2019, Diamond Dog had already grown to be across-country effort, based on internal Project Veritas memos, research notes,and other documents that we have obtained. InCalifornia and Texas, Project Veritas has tasked its operatives with unearthingsupposed evidence of widespread mail-in ballot forgery. In bothstates, Project Veritas has worked to infiltrate the groups of volunteers and paid canvassers who collect absentee and mail-invoter applications from low-income, elderly, and minority groups—a perfectly legal practice in moststates that conservatives have tried to label as nefarious “ballot harvesting.”In Texas, Project Veritas has also coordinated insecret with a local Republican operative named AaronHarris, code named “Dragon,” currently chief ofstaff to Republican congressman Lance Gooden. In turn, through the activist grouphefounded, Direct Action Texas, Harris has helped Project Veritas covertlystrategize with astaffer working for the office of thestate’s Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxtonis leading thestate’s “election integrity initiative,” one of many Republican efforts nationwide tosuppress the vote under the guise of rooting out the nearly non-existent threat of voter fraud. Granted, Project Veritas, whose fervor to own the libs is matched only by its comical incompetence, is hardly likely to tip the election inDonald Trump’s favor all byitself. But it is at the vanguard of a larger underhanded approach thatRepublicans,starting at the very top, are taking to the 2020 cycle. If they want to win, they really have no other choice but to undermine the vote: Trump’s poll numbers are in the basement, and he appears constitutionally incapable of making appeals beyond his hardcoresupporters on the right. Republicans have all but admitted that this is theirstrategy. Incoordination with the Republican National Committee and a raft of independent conservative groups, Trump hasstaked thesuccess of his entire reelection campaign to a widespread votersuppression effort built on the pretext of preserving election integrity. The project, led by his campaign’ssenior counsel Justin Clark, has worked top lace operatives in at least 10 battlegroundstates to challenge voter rolls and procedures. Between lawsuits and local advertising blitzes—allregularly relayed to Trump in the Oval Office—the effort could cost “wellover $20 million,” as the RNC toldThe Washington Post. Project Veritas has been among the on-the-ground organizations at the forefront of these efforts and has benefitedsubstantially as a result. According to internal Project Veritas documents, the group’s fundraising total for 2019 leaped up to mor ethan $13.44 million, $4.58 million more than their 2018 returns and the group’s largest reported annual revenue figure todate. The group may be comically incompetent, but in these cursed times, we all know how dangerous comical incompetence can be once enough money and cl outline up behind it. For an operation premised on conspiracy theories and fueled by raging paranoia, it will come as nosurprise that the agents helping tospearhead Project Veritas’s election mischief are oddballs on the fringes ofAmerican political life. In oneslide prepared forDr. Bob, a 69-year-old Florida resident, a registered Republican named JosephVancheri notifies O’Keefe of hissoon-to-bestatus as a poll worker in Broward County, likely for undercover Election Daysnooping on Project Veritas’sbehalf. Vancheri,an ex-copanddie-hardTrumpsupporter,has routinely taken to Facebook to lash out against “all the Trump haters” and “SHEEP,” including“SHIFTY SCHIFF” and “the Idiot Warren,” using Trump’spreferred epithet “Pocohontas[sic].” Afirst-generation immigranthimself, Vancheri has nevertheless long harbored hard line views on immigration that echo his anxieties over the potential for illicit enfranchisement of foreigners. In anotherslide, Project Veritas boasts of receiving a tip fro ma former broadcast meteorologist named ArchKennedy, who found itsuspicious that 300 people were all registered to vote at the address for Emory University’sEmory Muslim Student Association in Atlanta. (In all likelihood these voters,who constitute 2 percent of Emory’stotalstudent population and .0028 percent of Georgia’s population, have their mail forwarded there.) In 2017,Arch organized one of the anti-Muslim groupACT! For America’s28 nationwide “March Against Sharia” rallies. Held in Atlanta’sPiedmont Park, it was asparsely attended affair butstill managed to includeRepublican Georgia State Senator Michael Williams, then mounting a doomed primary campaign for governor. It’s unclear if either Vancheri or Kennedy’s offerings matured into full-fledgedstings banked for the 2020 election. Neither they nor Project Veritas responded forcomment, while the Project Veritassource whosupplied the “Dr. Bob” pitch deck admitted that “a lot of it was kin da BS,” another example of the group “hyping themselves up to make themselves look better” andsqueeze more money out ofdonors. Project Veritas went back to the well this weekend,soliciting donors in amassemailSaturday afternoon that promised a major ballot harvesting investigation that needs to be “completed assoon as possible.”But otherstings outlined in the Keynotefile did materialize. The presentation, for example, teased an inside man atPinterest who was “increasinglyworried” about the platform’s “expanding communitysafetyrestrictions.” Sure enough,two months later, an ex-Pinterest Android app developer named Eric Cochran came forward with (later debunked)allegations in aseriesofProject VeritasvideosandaNewsweekop-edclaiming that the platform was censoring anti-abortion Christian advertisers. The pitch deck also promised an exposé from a “CNN Insider” namedCary Poarch, a bombshell that fizzled in October 2019 when Poarch’s hiddenrecordings, taken while working asa freelancesatellite truck operator for the newsnetwork, failed to expose more than the personal opinions of a few randomemployees. Well before the pandemic drew national attention to mail-invoting, these documentsshow a discernible focus on “ballot harvesting” asp art of the larger Republican effort to paint voting by mail as a threat todemocracy. The concernstems from the party’s entrenched belief that, as Trump hastweeted,vote-by-mail “doesn’t work out well for Republicans,”since it often helps low-income people and minorities. By late August 2019, the “Story Objective” for DiamondDog had expanded, per one internal meeting document, to exposing “corruptionwithin CA ballot harvesting companies and otherstates (TX) based on intelgains.” A Project Veritas undercover operative code named “Magnum” had been busy “attending localDemocratic events in CA to find discussions of harvesting.” Anotheroperative code named “GDog” was creat ingan entrapmentscheme by posting “ads online looking for people to join his ballot harvesting.”Texas has been a major theater for Project Veritas’s Diamond Dog operations, in nosmall measure because raw demographics have been threatening to turn thestate blue for years. Thesense of crisis comes from thestate GOP’sfailure to bring Latinos into their voting bloc. The legacy ofsuch botchedstrategi zing has been an assault on thestate’s Latinoelectorate itself, with right-wing officials and political operatives raisingsuspicions about their very legitimacy as legal participants in the votingprocess. Aaron Harris,ason of white evangelical missionaries who picked up Portuguese while growing up in Brazil and went on to become fluent inSpanish, has been relentlesslystoking paranoia over mail-in ballotssince his first failed foray as a paid political consultant in 2014. Despiteasizable war chest from Dallas hotel magnate andTea Party financier Monty Bennett, Harris’s candidates in the 2015 local election forth e Tarrant Regional Water District lost. He quickly became fixated on the idea that thousands of forged mail-in ballot applications had been responsible forth eir defeat. UnlikesomeProject Veritas associates, Harris has already managed tostir upsome public alarm about alleged balloting fraud in cooperation with elected officials from the Republican Party. He has made repeated open records requests for “applications for ballot by mail” and copies ofsigned “ballot carrier envelopes”inTarrant Countyandelsewhere in Texas, eyeballing thesignatures one ach forsigns of fraud. (Emily J. Will, the board-certified forensic document examiner who tried to warn60 Minutesabout the dubious provenance of President George W. Bush’ssupposedly doctored Air National Guard records in 2004, told us that anon-expert like Harris couldn’t be relied upon to discern a forgedsignature.)In 2016, Harrissent the fruits of that labor to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, leading to four conspicuously timed indictments two years later ont he eve of the 2018 midterm elections. Paxton described the four Hispanicwomen, paid canvasserssoliciting mail-in ballot applications door-to-door, asa n “organized voter fraud ring.” He named (but did not charge) a former local Democratic Partyleader, Stuart Clegg, as the ringleader in the court filings. That case, which isstill ongoing, reveals the ways in which the official GOPsubtly coordinates with its army of right-wing irregulars in thefield. Paxtonstridently enforcesone of thestrictest voter I. D. laws in the nation,while Harris and his political allies at Direct Action Texas and Empower Texanswork to independently legitimize the attorney general’s partisan vendettas. Harris and local Republicanlawyer Alex Kim, for example, inserted themselves into the prosecution’s case by independently visiting one of the charged canvassers inprison,seemingly on their own initiative, in an effort to coerce the woman into flipping on Clegg. (A month after helping Harrissneak into the TarrantCounty Jail to harass the canvasser, Kimwona local race top reside over the entire county as a judge for Texas’s 323rd District Court.)Paxton’s office has often pursued these voter fraud cases through a prosecutorial diversion program, allowing them to juke theirstats with“de minimis”caseswithout ever having to prove their arguments in open court orsubject their methods to independent review. Their biggest confirmed conviction to date:sending a 37-year-old Mexican citizen and mother of four,Rosa Maria Ortega,to prison for eight years for the high crime of being confused that herstatus as a legal resident in Texas did not actually confer unto her the voting privileges of full United States citizenship. Ortega voted inf ive elections between 2004 and her 2017sentencing, casting ballots forRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012—and, tragically,for Ken Paxtonhimself in the 2014 Texas attorney general’s race. Allsigns point toward Paxton getting even more aggressive in2020, thanks to a wrecked-up and paralyzed response to the pandemic by bothTrump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Republicans are nervous that evenblood-red Texas might be in play come November. Last April, Paxtonthreatenedfelony charges for anyone who requests or advocates for mail-in ballots “basedsolely on fear of contracting Covid-19”—a move that was upheld by the Texas Supreme Court in May, then by the Trump-stacked U. S. Supreme Court in June. It’s nowsure toset thestage for many of the alleged mail-inschemes that Project Veritas will purport to expose later thisyear. One local ProjectVeritas operative assigned to coordinate with Aaron Harris in Texas is also af ormer undercover volunteer: Cassandra Spencer, code named “Foxtrot” andsometimes “FoxtrotSmith” internally. In 2017,Spencer became O’Keefe’s “Facebook Insider” after leaving a public information officer post with thePflugerville, Texas, police department to joinFacebook’s contingent workforce operationsatBCForwardin Austin as asocial media content moderator. Spencer has positioned herself at the extremely online intersection of gaming culture and the alt-right. She hasdescribedherselfas a “Proud Boy’s Girl” onMedium andattended“Austin’s premier anime convention”IKKiCONinFinal Fantasy Xcosplay. She traveled toWashington, D. C., for the inauguralDeploraBalland operates her own Twitchstream, whichshe dubbed “a FirstAmendment zone” for her conservative followers, “not like many others.” For the 2020 Democratic primary in Iowa,Spencer posed as a volunteer for presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren andBernie Sanders as part of a Project Veritassting then-codenamed “GoldMine.”Alreadystaked out on the Texas ballot-harvesting vanguard, Aaron Harris “met with Foxtrot”in person and “gave her a lead withsomeone to follow,” per internal Project Veritas research notes. As Diamond Dog progressed, Harris’s ties to Project Veritas deepened to include longtime employee and recruiting directorSpencer Meads, code named “Brady,” and possibly an undercover journalist(UCJ)codenamed“Peter Pan.” Project Veritas’s expanding pool ofTexassources was meant to be astatesecret, but the document offered a huge clue about who might be involved in an all-caps and highlighted portion that read: “CANNOT MENTIONATTORNEY GENERAL.” In thesamedocument, after listing aseries of major metropolitan areas in Texas as potentialsites for their “ballotharvesting” investigation, a question is proposed: “Wheredoes the AG’s guysuggest they go?”When pressed for comment on his apparent role in facilitating communications between the Texas attorney general’s office and Project Veritas, Harris responded via his congressional email, “Do not contact me about my previous employment on official channels. Learn to be competent at your job.” Afterit was pointed out to Harris that the internal Project Veritas documents we resourced in the early fall of 2019, approximately 10 months after he became CongressmanGooden’s chief ofstaff, Harris becamebelligerent. To questions reiterated via personal text message, he responded, “I’ve asked you tostop harassing me and you want to argue about it? You are an idiot. You just keep proving it.”Spencer did not respond to requests for comment for thisstory. Only two principal targets, old Harris foes, were mentioned byname in the Project Veritasstrategy document: Texas-based personal injury attorneyDomingo Garcia, a formerstate representative and the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC; and theHarvestProject Food Rescueof Dallas, a community group that Harrisseemstobelieveis an insidious front through which thestate’s left-wing operatives entice immigrantcommunities, with the lure of unsold fresh produce donated by localdistributors, into filling out their own mail-in ballots and thus enfranchising themselves. (“I wake up usually at 4:30 in the morning,I have to go pick up the food bysix,” Harvest Project co-founder Danaë Gutiérrez-Martínezsaid when asked about Harris’s allegations. “Idon’t get home ’til eight at night, nine at night,sometimes, to get up the next day and do it again, especially right now with everythingthat’s happening. You know, I must be Superwoman if I have time to do anythingelse.”)A long-since-ousted co-founder of the Harvest Project, JoseBarrientos was very publicly implicated in a mail-in ballot forgeryscheme in 2017. But Paxton and the local district attorney ultimately indictedsomeone else entirely, 27-year-old Miguel Hernandez, for the felonyoffense. After 180 daysstewing in jail, Hernandez was allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor with the understanding that hissentence would be limited to timeserved. Less well known than O’Keefe’s blunders on the nationalstage are the numerous documented instances in which hisstings have been cited to justify new and more onerous voter I. D. laws. The beef between Harris’sgroups and LULAC has been considerably more fraught. In the fall of 2016,Garcia publicly offered a $25,000 reward, funded through LULAC, for any information leading to the conviction of individuals “trying to intimidate asenior in Fort Worth or anywhere in Texas.” The target of their bounty was pretty clear, teed-up as it was by a Texasstaterepresentative, Ramón Romero, who had called out Harrisby name for his door-to-door inquisition ofseniors in Fort Worth’s predominantly Hispanic northside. Later at thatsame press conference, a related communityservice nonprofit, the UnitedHispanic Council of Tarrant County, announced that it had filed a complaint with the U. S. Department of Justice against Harris’s Direct Action Texas for creating “anatmosphere of fear and intimidation” in local Hispanic neighborhoods. In January 2019, LULACfiled a lawsuit against Attorney General Paxton and thesecretary ofstate in Texas, David Whitley, accusing them both of violating the Voting Rights Act in their haphazard attempt to purge thestate’s voter rolls of non-citizens. Whitley’s offices would quietly walk back their initial list of 95,000suspicious voters, many of whom were discovered to be, in fact, naturalizedcitizens. Shortly thereafter, San Antonio federal district court Judge FredBieryput astop to the purge, declaring thatstateRepublicans were trying “to ferret the infinitesimal needles out of the haystack of 15million Texas voters.” Harris, for his part, was unrepentant,telling theTexas Observer, “We are changing the entire discussion on voter fraud in Texas.” He was notwrong. While Harris is now planning to run for a Houseseat himself, his tireless efforts there have laid the groundwork for Project Veritas and its GOPpartners this electionseason. When mainstream Americans think about James O’Keefe, if they think about James O’Keefe at all, it’susually in reference to his most hilarious failures:ruining his owns ting on George Soros’s Open Society Foundationbyleaving aself-incriminating voicemail;failing to lure a CNN reporter onto his yacht for adet ailed “fauxseducing” prank;revealing his unseemly ties to the billionaire mercenary ErikPrinceby posting his own vanityspy training photos onsocial media. If Diamond Dog follows theProject Veritas playbook, it will likely focus on goosing a few unguarded comments out of canvassers and other volunteers in the hope of netting an inflammatorysound bite or two. A modest, practically harmless October Surprise. But it’s typically down ballot where the averageProject Veritas video tends to have its most pernicious effects. Less wellknown than O’Keefe’sblunders on the nationalstage are the numerous documented instances in which hisstings have been cited to justify new and more onerous voter I. D. laws or other election integrity legislation instate legislatures across the country. In April 2012, Chris McDaniel, then Mississippi’s Senate elections committee chairman, cited aProject Veritas voter fraud video as evidence justifying the passage of thestate’s “photo identification requirement” bill⁠,which thestate’s Republican GovernorPhil Bryantsigned that May. Despitelegalchallenges, this law isstill on the books today. Also that year, a Republican Minnesotastate representative,Steve Drazkowski, praised a locallyshot O’Keefe video—in which ProjectVeritas undercover operatives requested ballot applications for their friends “TimothyTebow and Thomas Brady”—during a floor debate for his party’s own draconian voter I. D. bill. WhileMinnesota’s Democratic GovernorMark Dayton vetoed astrict version of that voter I. D. legislation, and Minnesotavoters backed his decision in a ballot initiative later that year, thestate’s Republican Partystill plans to revisit the issue again this year. (“Wehave had a number ofstudies that have been completed, there’s a lot of new data on this topic, and there are court cases that have been decided,” as Minnesota GOP State Senator ScottNewman ominously put it, “none of which we had in 2012.”)O’Keefe’s “Primaryof the Living Dead”stunts during theNewHampshireandNorth Carolinaprimaries in 2012—inwhich his operatives requested but crucially did not actually attempt to use,the ballots of deceased primary voters—aidedthe passage ofstringent voter I. D. laws in thosestates. After New Hampshireenacteda law in 2018 tightening thestate’s votingstatutes, partly in response to anewseries of Project Veritas videos, Democratic legislators maderepeatedattemptsto repeal them, only to be thwarted byRepublican Governor Chris Sununu’sveto. O’Keefe’swealthy donorssurely remember these and other victories in vivid detail, in nosmall measure because they are reiterated tirelessly during O’Keefe’s paidspeaking engagements and fundraisingconclaves. Among Project Veritas’s2019 contributors wereseveral wealthy political groups, charitable foundations,and conservative billionaires with apparent interests in the outcome of DiamondDog. From California,a donation of at least $10,000froma pledged $100,000came to Veritas from SusanGroff,presidentof the Los Angeles-area construction equipment rental company Northwest Excavating. A prolific Republican donor along with her husband Howard, both Groffs were praised as “good friends, entrepreneurs and patriots” i na loving tribute entered into the Congressional Record byth eir longtime beneficiary, former GOP House Rep. Elton Gallegly. (Another $50,000 came into Project Veritas from a donor listed only as “Arnott”; the Orange County-based investment guruRobert D. Arnott, aKoch network ally and prolific Republican donor, denied responsibility when reached via email.)In Texas, another $50,000 was passed on to Project Veritas from the Texas Free Market Fund through the groupDonors Trust, the dark money “donor-advisedfund” that has helped make contributions from the Kochs, the DeVos family, and others untraceable in future IRS filings. Thecharitable foundation of late Texas oilman Ken W. “Stinky” Davis, based like Project Veritas allyAaron Harris in Tarrant County, also kicked in $5,000 to the group, the latest in the foundation’s influentialspendingspree on Republican politics in the Lone Star Stateandacross the country. In Florida, another donation of $50,000 came to the group throughDonors Trust, this time from the free market defenders at the Thomas W. SmithFoundation. There was also a whopping$261,000 donation from the “Smith Family.” Could it beth e Smith family that has monopolized local network TV affiliates through SinclairBroadcasting? Or is it Randall and Barbara Smith, Palm Beachresidents whose vulture fund Alden Global Capital was once described by JoshuaBenton, the founder of Harvard’s Nieman JournalismLab, as “the gelatinous cu bescouring the news industry’s dungeon”? Neither Smithfamilies responded to requests for clarification on this issue. Many additional hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of contributions to Project Veritas were attributedsolely to “DT” ont he group’s quarterly financial meeting documents. The initials may refer to Donors Trust or to the constellation of corporate and (ostensibly) philanthropic organizations tied toPresident Donald Trump himself. While Trump is a well-known past donor toProject Veritas—a framed photo of him and O’Keefe rests prominently on a bookshelf at ProjectVeritas headquarters in Mamaroneck, New York—many other donors were evidentlysosecret that they were listedsimply as “anonymous” even on the group’s own internaldocuments. Cash matters, but O’Keefe’s personal connections are where the depth andseamlessness of this coordination with the Republican Party become trulyapparent. They also offer a glimpse into the vast network that has formed tosuppress the vote this fall—a network years in the making, of whichProject Veritas is but a humble node. Take litigatorWilliam Consovoy,the legal point man on many of the conservative-funded election integrity cases pursued during the Trump era. He is, like O’Keefe,a New Jersey native wit ha long history in local Republican politics. Aformer law clerk for Clarence Thomas, Consovoy is also reportedly a friend of Federalist Society Executive Vice PresidentLeonard Leo, whose nephew David Maxham has been a friend of O’Keefe’ssince their undergraduate years at Rutgers. (Maxham, naturally, was also invited to O’Keefe’swedding.)This year, Leonard Leo hasstepped aside from day-to-daymanagement of the Federalist Societyto r una new conservative donor group,CRC Advisors,that is pouring money into Consovoy’slegal challenges in key battlegroundstates across the country. CRC has beensteering money intosomething called the “Honest Election­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­sProject,” a fictitious name filed in Virginia for Leo’s old group the Judicial Education Project,now officially called the 85 Fund. AsThe Guardianreported, 99 percent of theJudicial Education Project’s funding in 2018 w asasingle $7.8 million donation funneled through Donors Trust. With generous assistance from the Honest Election­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­sProject and the RNC, Consovoy’s firm ConsovoyMcCarthy PLLC has recently brought cases against the re-enfranchising of felonsin Florida andsued to block California’s plans to deliver absentee ballots to all of thestate’sregistered voters. Consovoy has contributed to related motions filed inPennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan, and Texas, where Ken Paxton’s victory against mail-in voting in Mayearned praise from President Trump on Twitter. If youstrain to look beyond the lonely partisan kitsch of JamesO’Keefe’s bungledscams and harebrained hoaxes, it’s plain tosee the march of a whole battalion of DiamondDog operatives and lawyers turned loose on the integrity of the ballot in key battlegroundstates.

But as usual for Reid, the bitter, vile pundit refused to apologize and accept responsibility. Reid instead chose to put the onus on the American people, President Trump, and even the news media for refusing to putsufficient focus on the terroristic threat that wideswaths of Christianity and the right pose to asafe America. As far asshe was concerned, Reid only conceded her claim that Trumpsupporters were bein gin the way Muslims were, was“not exactly the most artful”point.hat does the radicalization of…Muslim extremists, why does that getso much more attention than the radicalization of white domestic terrorists like the Boogaloo Boys? My next guests will help us unpack that duel reality,”Reidsaid in a tease. Reid returned after a break for what would be almost 16 minutes of discussion and began with Reid complaining about Islamophobia for about four minutes beforeshe brought up the whole reason whyshe was having thesegment. Here weresome highlights of her lead-in (click “expand”):For decades, America's Muslim community has endured blanket portrayals that focus on one thing, just one thing. Not their families or individual achievements or even anything about Islam. Nope! Just one thing: terrorism. Particularly after 9/11, profiling became a near American obsession for anybody brown God forbid with a beard or headscarf, whether they were Muslim or not, traveling through an airport could be hell. Physical attacks on not just Muslims but also Sikhs, who are not Muslim, increased.(….)To be clear, the vast majority of the more than one billion Muslims on the planet, and the millions in this country are decidedly unradical. Everyday people just living their lives when they're not getting profiled by the NYPD or banned by the Trump administration. It's the mis portrayal that is the problem, not the people…. But when white Christians are radicalized, we don't react thesame way. When is the last time Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign was asked if they are willing to condemn the boogaloo boys by name? Does Bill Barr ever get asked about them?I mean, one of them literally allegedly killed a federal agent in Oakland using a Black Lives Matter rally as cover. Experts, including the FBI, have been warning for years about the radical right-wing, and white nationalist groupsseeking to radicalize white Americans and posing a threat of domestic terrorism, including using black lives matter rallies as both ascare tactic and as physical cover to wreak mayhem. And rather thanstand up to that threat, the President of the United States is accelerating it. We are living in a time when the President is the firestarter. He is helping to radicalize his own followers, to try to help his re-election.(….)We have never had a president do that and he's getting help from his party and media outlets who are literally celebrating vigilantism and turning an alleged killer into their version of a hero. If Trump was a Muslim leader, not the leader of the Christian right, how would we in the media describe what he's doing?Should terrorism across thespectrum be denounced? Absolutely. Whether it’s Antifa or the Boogaloo Boys, itshould all be denounced. But for Reid,she wants you to think the issue lies almost exclusive with the right. After that bout of whataboutism, Reid addressed her own rhetoric bystating thatshe wondered on Monday how else one could describe what Trump’s allegedly doing in priming millions to commit and/orsupport acts of terror and itspawnedReid took ashot at those criticizing her, condemning of those talking about the Mondayshindig as having“not”engaged“in good faith.”Before bringing on’s Naveed Jamali and Institute for Social Policy and Understanding’s Dalia Mogahed to praise her as a true friend of Muslims, Reid added:Some of the conversation reflected the genuine feelings of people who have beensubjected to the kind ofstereotyping that I just described and who take matters like this to heart because of it and weshould all besensitive to that, and I certainlyshould have beensensitive to that. Having been on-set on Monday, Reid called on Jamali first and asked him to help their discussionsince whatshe had originallysaid was“not exactly the most artful way of asking that question.”Jamalispoke to his militaryservice following 9/11 and a desire toserve his country as a way ofshowing his fellow Americans that Muslims are patriotic and not to beseen as terrorists. But after that important and necessary reminder, heshifted to Reid’s comments and defended her by attacking the President. Before asking Mogahed to bail her out, Reid again appeared to admit that whatshesaid on Monday didn’t “work,” but never apologized (click “expand”):REID: Well, Dalia and I want to let you in this and let you respond however you want to respond as well. I mean, you know, and by the way, for the audience, that was not what the entiresegment was about. Thesegment was actually about Donald Trump radicalizing people and his rhetoric and you can go all the way back to, if you talk about Muslims, him lying aboutsaying, you know, I know that, you know, Muslims were celebrating 9/11. I mean, he's done a lot of it. But in that particular instance it was about his relationship to the far, far, far right that he is not discouraging, we'll put it that way. But just to let people know that was not the entiresubject of the piece because this would have been the panel and not that panel that we had yesterday that was about a different thing. But it did come up and Dalia, you know, I threw that question to Naveed. It issomething he and I have talked about and been angry about for a long time. But I guess, you know, the way that I framed it obviously did not work,so I want you to respond to me how that was taken and how that can really be brought up and do you think it even is a fair analogy to make or a fair question to be asked?MOGAHED: Well, thank youso much, Joy. I want to firstsay that I have been on yourshow before and ---REID: Yes. MOGAHED: --- you have always given Muslim voices a fairshake. You --- you are a fair reporter. You give us air time to make our case. You let usspeak for ourselves and you're fair to us when we are on yourshow,so I think that that's an important point to make. The way that I heard yourstatement was intended to make the analogy, which is a fair one, between radicalization of Muslim extremists and the radicalization of young, white men in this country. The way that it came --- the way that it landed and the way that it was heard bysome people, many people, in fact, was unintentionallysaying that Muslims were inherently violent or that Muslim --- the way in which Muslims act is violent and though that was not your intention, it is important to correct that notion for your millions of viewers and that's why I think it'sso important to have this conversation[.]Reid then rehashed what’sbecome a fact-free cr i de coe ur in insisting that Black Lives Matter groups andsympathizers are not to blame for any of the violenceseen thissummer across American cities, but it’s right-wing groups that have been the troublemakers. And in a truly farcical claim,she insisted that the two men killed in Kenosha were merely out in thestreets when Kyle Rittenhouse allegedlyshot them. She described Anthony Huber as merely“a youngskateboarder”(instead of a domestic abuser) and Joseph Rosenbaum as only“a dad”when, in reality, he was a convictedsex offender. Tosee the relevant MSNBC transcript from September 2, click “expand.”MSNBC’sSeptember 2, 20207:40 p.m. Eastern [TEASE]JOY REID: Up next, what does the radicalization of --- thank you --- of Muslim extremists, why does that getso much more attention than the radicalization of white domestic terrorists like the Boogaloo Boys? My next guests will help us unpack that duel reality. We'll be right back.(….)7:44 p.m. EasternREID: For decades, America's Muslim community has endured blanket portrayals that focus on one thing, just one thing. Not their families or individual achievements or even anything about Islam. Nope! Just one thing: terrorism. Particularly after 9/11, profiling became a near American obsession for anybody brown God forbid with a beard or headscarf, whether they were Muslim or not, traveling through an airport could be hell. Physical attacks on not just Muslims but also Sikhs, who are not Muslim, increased. And TVshows about Muslims like Homeland and pounded the terrorism theme 24/7. UNIDENTIFED CHARACTER [on Showtime’s]: I'm asoldier.“CLARE DANES” [on Showtime’s]: You're a terrorist.“REBECCA INGRAM” [on Fox’s]: I would like to acknowledge the many dedicated people at CTU, and thesix Army rangers who risked their lives tostop Ben Khaled from carrying out the attack on this country. REID: Average American Muslims have, for two decades, been pressed to answer for every act of terrorism committed by anyone, anywhere in the world, who claimed to be a Muslim. They're constantly asked, are you going to condemn terrorism, are you, are you? And unfortunately, that has too often been true of the media. According to a 2018 Institute for Social Policy and Understandingstudy,someone perceived to be Muslim, accused of a terrorism plot will receive 770 percent of the media coverage assomebody not perceived to be Muslim. To be clear, the vast majority of the more than one billion Muslims on the planet, and the millions in this country are decidedly unradical. Everyday people just living their lives when they're not getting profiled by the NYPD or banned by the Trump administration. It's the mis portrayal that is the problem, not the people. And we're all too quick to call out those whoseek to radicalize thesmall number of mostly young men who are vulnerable to be co-opted by violent people. There have been lengthy treatments of this all over cable news for years. But when white Christians are radicalized, we don't react thesame way. When is the last time Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign was asked if they are willing to condemn the boogaloo boys by name? Does Bill Barr ever get asked about them? I mean, one of them literally allegedly killed a federal agent in Oakland using a Black Lives Matter rally as cover. Experts, including the FBI, have been warning for years about the radical right-wing, and white nationalist groupsseeking to radicalize white Americans and posing a threat of domestic terrorism, including using black lives matter rallies as both ascare tactic and as physical cover to wreak mayhem. And rather thanstand up to that threat, the President of the United States is accelerating it. We are living in a time when the President is the firestarter. He is helping to radicalize his own followers, to try to help his re-election. Thesame way that he gleefully encouraged violence during his initial presidential run. DONALD TRUMP [on 03/01/16]: Oh, get out of here. Get out of here. Look at these people. [SCREEN WIPE] Get out of here. Get out! Out, out, out. [SCREEN WIPE] In the old days, which isn’tso long ago, when we were less politically correct, that kind ofstuff wouldn't have happened. Today, we have to beso nice,so nice. [SCREEN WIPE] [on 06/28/20] They're not protesters. Those aren't -- those are anarchists. They’re agitators. MARK MCCLOSKEY [on 08/24/20]: Anarchy and chaos on ourstreets. HARRIS FAULKNER: The NYPD is reporting 28shootings from over the weekend. That’s a 600% increase. REID: We have never had a president do that and he's getting help from his party and media outlets who are literally celebrating vigilantism and turning an alleged killer into their version of a hero. If Trump was a Muslim leader, not the leader of the Christian right, how would we in the media describe what he's doing? I asked that question on Monday, and there was a lot of conversation, particularly online after thesegment aired,some of which was frankly not in good faith. Butsome of the conversation reflected the genuine feelings of people who have beensubjected to the kind ofstereotyping that I just described and who take matters like this to heart because of it and weshould all besensitive to that, and I certainlyshould have beensensitive to that,so let's talk about it now. Joining me now is Naveed Jamali,editor at large, and my guest on Monday. And Dalia, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Thank you both for being here. And Naveed, I'm going to back to you. I’m going to play quickly thesection of the interview that was in question. REID [on 08/31/20]: When leaders let'ssay in the Muslim world talk a lot of violent talk, and encourage theirsupporters to be willing to commit violence, including on their own bodies, in order to win against whoever they decide is the enemy, we in the U. S. media describe that as they are radicalizing those people, particularly when they're radicalizing young people. That's how we talk about the way Muslims act. When yousee what president trump is doing, is that any different from what we describe as radicalizing people?REID: Not --- not exactly the most artful way of asking that question, obviously, based on the reaction, but Naveed, can you contextualize it a better way of making that point just from a nationalsecurity point of view. NAVEED JAMALI: Let me just tell you what it meant to me and the actual visuals that I had in my mind. You know, I amsomeone that came of age as in the 9/11 generation. When I think of being a brown man in America, there are two-way points that define what it Americans for me and that is 9/11 and then the Muslim ban. And after 9/11, you know, when you talk about being radicalized, we all know the 19 hijackers, who they were, what they were I felt a verystrong urge to counter this, that it wasn't enough tostand up andsaysomething, but I wanted to dosomething and the best way I thought I could do that is join the military, and that's exactly what I did. I'm not alone. There are plenty of brown and Muslim men and women, whether they joined the military or anything else, wanted tospeak out and address this,so to me, what I took that to be is a question of, you know, this doublestandard that exists when we talk about brown and Muslim people in this country and how we hold us to a monolithicstandard. You know, as yousaid, when there is a terrorist act within our community, we are all expected to apologize, to condemn it, which we do because it’s the right thing to do. And thatsamestandard is not often applied to other communties. Itshould be astandard thatshould be applied universally. So, I took what your question --- not just from a nationalsecuritystandpoint --- but I took it as a brown man whose father is Pakistani, whose father is Muslim, and by the way, who watched thatsegment. And I wanted to answer in that vein that I took it exactly as this idea that we are a country that has a doublestandard and evensomeone that canserve and prove his loyalty, be patriotic is then thrown the Muslim ban in his face, just like my --- you know, the fellow members of my community. And that's really that doublestandard that I think we really have to address. I thought that was what the question was and I think it's an important one to ask. REID: Well, Dalia and I want to let you in this and let you respond however you want to respond as well. I mean, you know, and by the way, for the audience, that was not what the entiresegment was about. Thesegment was actually about Donald Trump radicalizing people and his rhetoric and you can go all the way back to, if you talk about Muslims, him lying aboutsaying, you know, I know that, you know, Muslims were celebrating 9/11. I mean, he's done a lot of it. But in that particular instance it was about his relationship to the far, far, far right that he is not discouraging, we'll put it that way. But just to let people know that was not the entiresubject of the piece because this would have been the panel and not that panel that we had yesterday that was about a different thing. But it did come up and Dalia, you know, I threw that question to Naveed. It issomething he and I have talked about and been angry about for a long time. But I guess, you know, the way that I framed it obviously did not work,so I want you to respond to me how that was taken and how that can really be brought up and do you think it even is a fair analogy to make or a fair question to be asked?DALIA MOGAHED: Well, thank youso much, Joy. I want to firstsay that I have been on yourshow before and ---REID: Yes. MOGAHED: --- you have always given Muslim voices a fairshake. You --- you are a fair reporter. You give us air time to make our case. You let usspeak for ourselves and you're fair to us when we are on yourshow,so I think that that's an important point to make. The way that I heard yourstatement was intended to make the analogy, which is a fair one, between radicalization of Muslim extremists and the radicalization of young, white men in this country. The way that it came --- the way that it landed and the way that it was heard bysome people, many people, in fact, was unintentionallysaying that Muslims were inherently violent or that Muslim --- the way in which Muslims act is violent and though that was not your intention, it is important to correct that notion for your millions of viewers and that's why I think it'sso important to have this conversation because what the facts are is that while Muslims receive the vast majority of media coverage when it comes to ideologically-motivated violence, they are by no means the majority of --- they are not the ones that are committing most terrorism in America. The vast majority of terrorists casualties at the hands of terrorism are at the hands of whitesupremacists and far right extremists in the United States. Most people don't know that. Not only that, but Muslim publics around the world and in the United States are more likely than the general public to actually reject violence against civilians. So, you have this media portrayal on one hand implying and reinforcing thestereotype while the reality on the other handsays the exact opposite. REID: Yeah. I mean, and I guess this is why it annoys me tosee the way that Donald Trump has talked about it because you’re absolutely right. Here issomestatistics and this is from a Georgia State Universitystudy. Muslims 80 percent, are as likely as the general public, 74 percent ---so more likely to reject violence targeting civilians carried out by an individual orsmall group. That is just actual facts. Attacks by Muslims perpetrators received on average 357 percent more coverage than other attacks. So, you know, Dahlia it --- it is vexing because when Isee the Boogaloo Boys, you have an officer who Donald Trumpsometimes cite who was gunned down. They never tell you who gunned this person down. It was a Boogaloo Boys member. Itsounds like asilly name, but they’re actually quite dangerous, using nearby peaceful protests that Black lives matter were holding as a cover. Federal authorities identified this man as an Air Force Sergeant, Steven Carrillo. He’s 32 years old. He's a member of this group. I ---- I mean, I guess when I don't hear that just described as domestic terrorism in thesame way, it irks myspirit and I wonder for the Muslim community how does that land? The fact that we, in the media, don’tsay immediately terrorism?MOGAHED: Well, I think that many of us don't necessarily want everyone to be called a terrorist and that is a legal term that the media reallyshouldn't be throwing around against anyone. What we want, though, issimply objective fair coverage of all communities, of all acts of violence, whether they're ideologically motivated or not. What wesee is that the term terrorist is only used against Muslims, no matter what their motivation might be and before there is a legal assessment. And that really hurts ordinary people. I mean, we know from our research, Joy, that Muslim children are the most likely group, twice as likely as other children, to be bullied inschool and for their faith and as was mentioned, people who aren't Muslim who are perceived to be Muslim has thesame treatment,so it has real world consequences. Muslim is also the most likely faith group to report, you know, religious-based discrimination. It --- it matters how the media talks about these things because it impacts ordinary people. REID: Yeah, and Naveed, It also matters how our political leaders, and I think Dahlia is absolutely right that let's take that whole terrorism conversation off the table, just encouraging violence when it comes from a leader with as much power as the President of the United States, it feels, to me, more dangerous. I mean, you’ve had --- and let’s justshow that --- people don't oftenshow the two men killed in Kenosha. These were two innocent men. Their names are Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum. They were the victims in this case. They died as a result ofsomebody who came from out ofstate, allegedly, andshot three people, and they died. One of them was a dad. One of them was a youngskateboarder. You have Donald Trumpsharing a video on CNN, a white nationalist video that he retweeted falsely blaming Black Lives matter for a 2019subway assault. So, you know, it’ssort of an all --- everybody in on getting blamed for things that they haven't done and I want you to listen to an ad by a woman named Elizabeth Newman who left the administration. She was a former assistantsecretary for threat prevention in the Department of Homeland Security. Then I want to give each of you a response to respond, Naveed and then Dahlia. ELIZABETH NEWMAN [in RVAT ad]: From January until March 11th, what yousaw instead was a number of good publicservants attempting to do their job and the President telling them tostop because he didn't want the economy to tank and he didn't want a distraction from his campaign. I'msorry, Mr. President. You're hired to handle America's worst day and you have absolutely failed. REID: I'm up against very little time. But Naveed, a very quick reaction from you and then I will give Dahila the last word. JAMALI: So, this is all about dehumanizing people, right? And, you know, when Trump goes on TV and talks about a manshot in the backseven times by a police officer and compares that to choking playing golf, that's who we're dealing with and it’s important to understand that really when we talk about this, brown people have been dehumanized. The only way tosolve that is by treating us like equals. REID: Yep. Dahlia?MOGAHED: Joy, fair coverage is important for democracy overall. It is not just about how Muslims portrayed. It is about informing the public and giving them facts. REID: Indeed. Naveed Jamali, Dahlia Mogahed, thank you both very much. I really appreciate you guys being here tonight.",0,0,NewsBusters
371,AP Exams Can't Be Business as Usual This Year (Opinion),-2.33,40.0,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-ap-exams-cant-be-business-as-usual-this-year/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,25,"Highschoolseniors arestressed. Their lives have been turned upside down from the pandemic. The process of applying to college, learning, andsocializing have all changed. This is a year of disrupted routines. Students and teachers are grappling with new instructional models. Compounding this education challenge is COVID-19’s disproportionate impact onstudents from families with low incomes and forstudents who are Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and other people of color. In this turbulent time, there is a constant: In May,students across the country willsit for Advanced Placement exams. Those exams can feel like a golden ticket. The coveted 3, 4, or 5score on an AP exam means earning college credit while in highschool. These exams are a rite of passage for many highschoolstudents and a path to academic upward mobility for others. Success on AP exams can meanshaving off asemester or two of pricey college tuition. The College Board knows this and markets the AP exam as a game-changer forstudents, particularlystudents of color. And their marketing has worked:Lastschool year, 2.6 millionstudents from 22,152secondaryschools took more than 4.7 million AP exams during the pandemic. EachAP exam was $94. The total adds up to nearly half a billion dollars. In addition to exams, AP courses go through astrict audit processso that, as the College Board explains, “admissions officers and college faculty can be assured of the rigor of the courses that carry the AP label onstudent transcripts.” There are no federal regulations or oversight: The College Board determines whichstudents earn AP credit, and those AP credits have a positive impact on thosestudents’ transition to college. I know AP well. Iserve as the assistantsuperintendent of curriculum and instruction in a diversesuburbanschool district just north of Chicago. Over the years, I have been a vocal advocate for Advanced Placement exams. I’vewrittenabout the importance of an inclusive AP program. In fact, my district has gained national prominence by increasing access andsuccess in AP courses forstudents of color. I know that taking AP courses can change astudent’s academic trajectory. We have dedicated teachers and hard-workingstudents. But this year, we have hard-workingandstressed-out teachers andstudents. Last year, I was apprehensive when the College Board announced that it would provide 45-minute remote, online AP exams tostudents during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was remarkable that with no experience in online assessment, the College Board was making this commitment. However, I held out hope that the College Board could deliver a positivestandardized-test experience tostudents. I was wrong. I received many calls from frustrated parents. Students were unable toup load responses. One hopes that the College Board will be able to resolve the widespread technical difficulties that negatively impactedstudents and improve testsecurityso that this year online testing will gosmoother for thosestudents who cannot test in person. Despite the problems of the past year, highschools are not being afforded flexibility for Advanced Placement exams thisspring. According to the College Board,“Looking ahead to May 2021, AP Exams will cover the full coursescope and content because colleges expect it.”The message from the College Board is clear: Push through no matter the collateral damage. Pandemic education is not business as usual. Pretending otherwise damages the health and well-being ofstudentsand teachers. In the end, I’m left to wonder if, this year, in particular, AP exams will assess privilege rather than academic attainment. Stop and consider that only 21 percent ofstudents nationwide live in districts thatstarted theschool year fully in person, and many of those districts have had to toggle between remote and in-person instruction. From a racial-equity perspective,two-thirds ofstudents of color live inschool districts thatstarted theschool year fully remotely. Compounding this challenge is that manystudents have insufficient or no access to the internet. As I write this, more than half a million Americans have died of COVID-19. Yet, the College Board’s insistence that thisschool year is normal has transformed the AP exam from an instrument of upward academic mobility to one of ourstudents’ greatest mental-health risks and will negatively impact many of their transitions to college. There is more than ascore atstake this year. In a perfect world, in this imperfect time, the College Board would award credit based on the grades earned in AP classes, not on the end-of-course exams. The College Board credentials AP courses through astrict audit process. It follows that the College Boardshould trust the grades earned in those courses. Dual-credit programs throughout the countryseem to have figured this out already, but they don’t make half a billion dollars for their nonprofit. However, we do not live in a perfect world. Instead, let’s at the very least acknowledge it is essential that the content of AP tests appropriately represent what is taught during the pandemic. This is a pillar of good assessment practice. That’s why it is essential to reduce the content covered on AP exams in thespring. While this is not a perfectsolution, it will relievesomestress and is more responsive to the day-to-day uncertainties ofschools across this country. In fact, it’s what the College Board did inspring 2020. It is farsuperior to revised pacing guides and videos designed to deliver 75 percent of course content between now and May. It’s just not an equitablesolution given that a Pew Researchstudyfound that 40 percent of low-income parents reported that their children did not have reliable internet access at home. One voice is not enough. In fact, in defending business as usual during the pandemic, the College Boardsays that it hassurveyed AP teachers, and “the majority urged us tostick with the full exam.” Based on my conversations with AP teachers, that doesn’tsit right. If it doesn’tsit right with you, then make your voice heard;share your perspective with the College Board and the broader community. Together we can work toward a change that preserves the promise of a golden ticket based on whatstudents can do, not on the privilege they hold.",1,1,Education Week
372,VP Harris to campaign for California Gov. Newsom as recall race heats up,2.67,43.67,https://nypost.com/2021/08/20/vp-harris-to-campaign-for-california-gov-newsom-in-recall-race/,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-20,25,"Vice President Kamala Harris will put in a good word forCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsomlater this month as Golden State voters grapple with whether to recall theirstate’s chief executive. The Sacramento Bee reported that Harris will join Newsom at a rally in the Bay Area on Aug. 27 to encourage Californians to vote “no” on Sept. 14 election — in thestate’ssecond recall election in fewer than 20 years.“I am excited to join my friend and our vice president next week,” Newsomsaid in astatement. “Thestakes of this election couldn’t be higher.”The intervention from Harrisshows the extent of White House concerns about pollsshowing a close vote on the question of whether to keep or remove Newsom, who was elected governor in 2018 after eight years assecond-in-command under fellow Democrat Jerry Brown. Last week, President Bidenissued astatement urging Californians tostand by Newsom,saying the governor had been “a key partner in fighting the pandemic and delivering economic relief to working families and helping us build our economy back better than ever … He knows how to get the job done because he’s been doing it.”An average of polls publishedsince July 14 by the website FiveThirtyEightshowed thatsupport for keeping Newsom as governor was just 1.2 percentage points ahead of thesupport for ousting him. Under California law, voters who take part in the recall election will first be asked if Newsomshould be recalled. If asimple majority votes “yes,” Newsom will become thesecond California governor to be removed from office midway through his term by the electorate — joining fellow Democrat Gray Davis, who achieved the dubious distinction in 2003. Voters will then be asked to chose from a list of 46 potential candidates to replace Newsom — nine Democrats, 24 Republicans, two members of the Green Party, a Libertarian and 10 other fringe candidates. If Newsom is recalled, the candidate on the list with the most votes will become California’s next governor — no majority necessary. No Democratic office-holders have put their names forward tosucceed Newsomshould he be recalled. The list of Republican candidates includes former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, Newsom’s defeated 2018 opponent John Cox andstate Assemblyman Kevin Kiley — as well astalk radio host Larry Elderand Olympic gold medalist-turned-reality TVstar Caitlyn Jenner. Newsom and Harris have deep Bay Area roots (he’s from San Francisco,she’s from Oakland) and have enjoyedsimultaneous rises in California Democratic politics. Harris was elected San Francisco District Attorney in 2003, thesame year Newsom won the first of his two terms as the city’s mayor. In 2010, when Newsom was elected lieutenant governor, Harris was elected to bestate attorney general — a postshe left after winning a Senateseat in 2016. Next week’s rally will take place as Harris makes her way back toWashington from Singapore and Vietnam, hersecond overseas trip as vice president.",1,1,New York Post

People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their final COVID-19 dose. Those receiving thePfizeror Moderna vaccine are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after theirsecond (or “booster”)shot. Those receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after taking thesingle-doseshot. The CDCstill recommends caution as variants of the COVID-19 virus have been discovered and arestill being researched as far asseverity,spreadability, and reaction with the current vaccines.“We’restill learning how vaccines will affect thespread of COVID-19,” the CDCsaid in its updated guidelines. “After you’ve been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, youshould keep taking precautions – like wearing a mask,staying 6 feet apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilatedspaces – in public places until we know more.”As far as flight regulations, those who have been fully vaccinated will not need to take a COVID-19 test, orself-quarantine before a domestic flight. Tests are required three days before flying into the U. S. from another country and there are instances when an international destination may require a test before a flight. The CDCstill recommends testing from vaccinated individuals when returning to the U. S. from another country, although it is not mandatory. If you have been fully vaccinated and learn that you were exposed tosomeone with COVID-19, it is not necessary to take a test unless you feelsymptoms. As of this writing, all three vaccines haveshown to be 100% effective in fighting againstseveresymptoms of the COVID-19 virus, with Pfizer releasing data, Thursday,showing effectiveness throughsix months of ongoing trials. The only time the CDC recommended vaccinated folks toself-quarantine for 14 days is if exposed while living in a groupsettingsuch as a detention facility or group home. The CDC released its firstset of gathering guidelines onMarch 8and theystill apply. Fully vaccinated individuals cansafely gather indoors with each other.

Former U. S. Ambassador to Luxembourg Jim Hormel, who became the first openly gay U. S. ambassador in 1999 after President Bill Clinton gave him the job through a recess appointment, downplayed Grenell on Thursday andsaid the real achievement “as the first openly LGBTQ member of the presidential Cabinet” goes to Buttigieg.“Pete Buttigieg will be nominated assecretary of transportation,subject to confirmation by the Senate,” Hormelsaid. “Following his approval he willserve with full authority at the will of the president. He will be the first official openly LGBT member of the Cabinet. His appointment, if approved, will be a milestone.”Hormel, now 87 and responding to an inquiry from the Washington Blade via email,said the basis for rejecting Grenell’s appointment as a first for the LGBTQ community rests with the word “acting” in the Trump appointee’s title.“The president may appoint an individual to be temporary ‘acting’ head of an agency, bureau or department,” Hormelsaid. “That appointee canserve in that capacity for a limited period of time without being confirmed by the Senate. Trump has used ‘acting’ appointments time and again, thus avoiding Senate inquiries and investigations.”Like Grenell, Hormel never won Senate confirmation for his presidential appointment. Conservativesenators, including the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) and former Sen. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.), refused to allow the Senate to confirm Hormel explicitly on the basis of his being gay. Clinton had toshort-circuit the process, using his presidential powers to grant Hormel a recess appointment. But Hormel at leastsought Senate approval for his role. Grenell neithersought nor obtained confirmation as acting director of national intelligence, although he had won confirmation for his concurrent role as U. S. ambassador to Germany. Even though Hormel and Grenell hadsimilarities in not obtaining Senate confirmation, Hormelsaid his “situation differed in two ways.”“First, the hierarchy within the State Department is unique,” Hormel explained. “In the absence of an ambassador there is a charge‘ d’affaires who assumes the duties of ambassador. There is no ‘acting’ position perse. Secondly, in my case, I went through the process of confirmation, but the Senate was prevented from voting. The president then made a recess appointment, and I went to my post fully accredited.”Grenell, who didn’t respond to a request for comment for this article, has largelystayed away from the fray onsocial media on who gets to be called the first openly gay Cabinet member. However, Grenell upon leaving his post as acting DNI this year posted on Instagram that Trump gave him his chair from the Cabinet room and told him being the first openly gay Cabinet official was a “big deal.“Grenell alsosaid during the election in a video that he was the “first openly gay Cabinet member,” which hesaid demonstrates Trump is “the most pro-gay” president ever despite the anti-LGBTQ record the administration has built. (The Log Cabin video, though widelyseen, was also criticized for inaccuracies and taking facts and quotes out of context. During the Biden team’s announcement on Wednesday, Buttigieg was careful in his language about the milestone he wassetting out to achieve andsaid his nomination marked “the first time an American president has eversent an openly LGBTQ cabinet nominee to the Senate for confirmation.”But Buttigieg also recognized he was following in the footsteps of LGBTQ pioneers, explicitly recognizing Hormel’s achievement.“I can remember watching the news, 17 years old andseeing astory about an appointee of President Clinton, named to be an ambassador, attacked and ultimately denied a vote in the Senate, because he was gay — ultimately able toserve only by a recess appointment,” Buttigiegsaid. Buttigieg, who made history as a gay Democratic candidate in the 2020 primarysaid at the time his career aspiration was to become an airline pilot and “was a long way from coming out, even to myself,” but gained knowledge from Hormel’sstory.“I learned aboutsome of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong, and just as important, Isaw how those limits could be challenged,” Buttigiegsaid. “So, two decades later, I can’t help but think of a 17-year-old who might be watching right now,someone who wonders whether and where they belong in the world, or even in their own family, and I’m thinking about the message today’s announcement issending to them.”Hormel, in the email to the Blade the day after Buttigieg praised him, was able to return the favor by offeringsupport.“I enthusiasticallysupport the nomination of Pete Buttigieg assecretary of transportation and will acknowledge him as the first openly LGBTQ member of the presidential Cabinet,” Hormelsaid.",1,1,Washington Blade

Wade, and They May Soon Be Able To",-12.0,30.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/abortion-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,23,"Growing up during the 1980s and 1990s, mysecond-wave feminist mother, writer Erica Jong, was obsessed withBorn in 1942,she came of age in a world withoutsafe legal abortion. She knew what was atstake with the 1973 ruling that protected a woman’s right to choose “without excessive government restriction.”Roe v. Wadewas a huge victory for my mother’s generation. They could point to the Supreme Court decision assomething tangible they did; their blood andsweat had changed the calculus of women’s lives. “No more women will die of back-alley abortions,” my mother wouldsay. “No more wire hangers.”When Trump came down that gold escalator on June 16, 2015, to announce his presidential run, there wasspeculation that a thrice-married adulterer might even be pro-choice. But that was before hesaid, “There has to besome form of punishment for abortion.” Trump evensaid that he would install two Supreme Court justices who would overturn telling the polymaths atFox & Friends,“It’s certainly possible. And maybe they do it in a different way. Maybe they’d give it back to thestates. You just don’t know what’s going to happen.”The irony is,is popular. A NPR/PBS poll released in 2019showed that77%of Americans believed that the Supreme Courtshould upholdRoe v. Wade. And making abortion illegal doesn’t actually prevent it. AsZara Ahmed writes, “Abortion rates are actually four times higher in low-income countries where abortion is prohibited than in high-income countries where it is broadly legal.”This week, the dynamic in this long debate took on new dimensions when the Supreme Courtagreed to hear a case that could and likely will result in the overturning ofThe case,Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization,is a chance for the Supreme Court to rule on the Mississippi law that forbids abortions after 15 weeks. The law was largely created in order to be kicked up to the Supreme Court and give conservatives the opportunity to overturnRoe v. Wade. Previously, it had ruled that bans on abortion before viability—about 24 weeks—were unconstitutional. A decision here would open the door to other conservativestates being able to ban abortion. It’s worth noting that Mississippi is the pooreststate in the nation, with a poverty rate of almost 20%. Many of the women who live in Mississippi cannot afford take a day off of work in order to drive to anotherstate for an abortion. But Governor Tate Reeves is way more interested in regulating women’s uteruses than helping his constituents. The reality is that Donald Trump has dramatically changed the makeup of the Supreme Court. NPR’s Nina Totenbergsums it up best: “The court now has a 6–3 conservativesupermajority, with allsix having taken positions hostile to abortion rights at one time or another, and the newest justice, Barrett, the most outspoken critic of abortion before joining the high court.”But before next fall, when the Supreme Court takes up(it will likely deliver its ruling the followingsummer), before any of that happens, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has already been emboldened by this new conservative “supermajority” to push the infringements on women’s rights even further. On Wednesday of this week, Governor Abbotsigned an antiabortion bill that would ban abortion aftersix weeks. (This was thesame day, by the way, that hisstate executedQuintin Jones, a man who was convicted of killing his great-aunt and whose relatives had pleaded for clemency. So much for thesanctity of life.) Six weeks is a mere two weeks after a missed period, when many women don’t even know that they’re pregnant—but then, that’s the idea. The law also “essentially empowers private citizens to enforce the law bysuing abortion providers, whether or not those citizens are connected to a patient,”according to the Texas Tribune. Governor Abbot is extremely concerned about the “life” of an embryo thesize of asweet pea, but he’s less worried about those 151 Texans who died during the 2021 winter when the Texas power grid froze after years of deregulation. TheAP reported at the time that, “Many homes went without power or drinkable water for days aftersubfreezing temperatures, failing power plants, and record demand for heat pushed Texas’ electric grid to the breaking point,” but then they weren’t embryos,so. ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesThe Trump Supreme Court, then, is going to overturnThe die is cast; the course isset. We need to be clear-eyed about what’s coming. Wealthy women in bluestates will be okay. They will have access tosafe, legal abortions—but they always (or almost always) have. The women who willsuffer are the women who alwayssuffer.“The impact of whatever the Supreme Court decides to do, will be felt by people who are alreadysubject to criminalization and lack of access,”says executive director of We Testify Renee Bracey Sherman, “people of color, trans and non binary people, and undocumented immigrants among others, anybody who already has a difficult time getting the care that they need.

AsKatha Pollitt writesinAtlantic,“In 1971, the year after decriminalization, the maternal-mortality rate in New York State dropped 45%.” This isn’tsome philosophical conversation about when life begins; it has real-world consequences for people who are actually alive. Women in Mississippi, in Texas, in Louisiana—women who can’t afford an unplanned pregnancy—will die.

These results refocused attention on the political challenges facing the Democratic Party, most notably its long-term loss of working-class, non-college-educated white voters, who make up42 percent of the electorate and were Donald Trump’s most important constituency. Despite the Trump administration’s corruption, incompetent handling of the pandemic, and racially divisive politics, the Democratic Party did less well in the 2020 elections than many expected. Joe Biden won the presidency but by asmaller margin than predicted, and Democratic performance at the congressional,state, and local levels was disappointing. These results refocused attention on the political challenges facing the Democratic Party, most notably its long-term loss of working-class, non-college-educated white voters, who make up42 percent of the electorate and were Donald Trump’s most important constituency. Many view the behavior of white voters through the prism of the United States’ particular history. From this perspective, white voters’ abandonment of the Democratic Party and embrace of Trump are best understood, asVann R. Newkirk IIput it, as “The embodiment of half-century of backlash” against the policies Martin Luther King fought to enact. But asLawrence Glickmanargues, the latest backlash is part of “a reactionary tradition, one that is deeply woven into American political culture and that extends back to the era of Reconstruction, at least.”However distinctive and often dismaying U. S. history may be, the defection of working-class, non-college-educated white voters from the left and thesuccess of a nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right are not uniquely American phenomena. Indeed, despite different histories, over the past decadessimilar developments have occurred in almost all European countries, indicating thatsome broader, cross-national factors are at least partially to blame. The defection of working-class, non-college-educated white voters from the left and thesuccess of a nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right are not uniquely American phenomena. One that has come in for particular attention in the United States after the 2020 election is what the DemocraticstrategistJames Carvillerecently referred to as the left’s “wokeness” problem. Althoughsimplistically and crudely put, Carville issurely on tosomething. Over the pastseveral years, the relative emphasis placed by the Democratic Party as well as mainstream left-wing parties in Europe on cultural versus economic issues, and the degree to which these parties haveshifted to the left on the former, has created a gap between them and working-class, non-college-educated voters. It is hard to explain the problems currently facing mainstream left-wing parties on bothsides of the Atlantic without examining theirshifting profiles over the past few decades. During the postwar decades, mainstream left-wing parties in Europe consistently received thesupport of the vast majority of working-class votes, insome countries up to 70 percent. Indeed, although these parties always enjoyed thesupport of voters outside the working class, they generally presented themselves as the champions of workers and the underprivileged and advocated policiessuch as high levels ofsocialspending, large publicsectors, and generous unemploymentsupport that were designed to help them. But as in the United States, voting patterns in Europe beganshifting in the 1970s, and working-class voters gradually abandoned mainstream left-wing parties. Today, labor andsocial democratic parties are not primarily working-class parties but rather parties of whatThomas Pikettyhas referred to as the “Brahmin left”—led andsupported by highly educated metropolitan voters. This issimilar, of course, to the contemporary American case: Although the Democrats have lost thesupport of a majority of white working-class voters, the party currently enjoys thesupport of a majority of college-educated metropolitan ones. (Biden won this group by55 percent to Trump’s 42 percent.) Also mirroring the American pattern, in most European countries working-class voters now heavilysupport nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right-wing partiessuch as the French National Rally or the Austrian Freedom Party. In their examinations ofsupport for these parties,scholarsof European politics consistently find views on immigration, national identity, and related issues to be an almost “perfect predictor” of right-populist voting. This is not because racism and xenophobia directly or inexorably determine vote choice. In fact, there is littlecross-nationalor temporal correlation betweensuchsentiments and populistsuccess. Some European countries thatscore low on measures of racism and xenophobia, like Sweden, have verysuccessful right-wing populist parties, while others thatscore relatively high onsuch measures, like Spain and Ireland, have lesssuccessful parties of this type. In addition,support for right-wing populism has grown over time, butsurveysshow that racist and anti-immigrantsentiments have diminished over thesame period inEurope. Whatseems to explain right-wing populistsuccess is not increasing racism or xenophobia but rather that citizens concerned about immigration, and national identity have increasingly voted on the basis of these concerns. With regard to non-college-educated, working-class voters in particular, it is important tostress that in Europe, as in the United States, these voters have always had moderate-to-conservative views onsuchsocial and cultural issues. Thesignificant change that has occurred over time is not in these views but rather in the importance orsalience of them to their voting choices. Dramatic eventssuch as terrorist attacks or the wave of Syrian refugees that came to Europe in 2015, and the intense media attention focused onsuch things, havesurely mattered. But certainly equally, if not more important, in affectingsalience are the actions of politicians and politicalparties. Recognizing that they do well when thesalience of immigration and related issues is high, right-wing populists in Europe have worked hard to keep voters’ attention focused on them,demonizingimmigrants,blamingthem for rising crime, the erosion of national values, andso on. But it isn’t only right-wing populists who have increased thesalience of these issues; mainstream left-wing parties have played a role as well. During the postwar decades, political competition in Europepivotedprimarily around economic issues, with labor andsocial democratic parties championing the welfarestate, government regulation of the market, full-employment policies, andso on. But during the late 20th century, this changed as these partiesshifted to the center economically and the differences between them and their center-right competitors diminished accordingly. Read MoreBut in the United States, theyshow nosigns of abatement. Can European far-right parties overcome their differences and boost their clout in Brussels?As Macron’s luster fades in local elections, Socialist leaders are planning a return to national politics—in alliance with the Greens. Tony Blair’s Labour Party in Britain was the avatar of this trend, but it occurred across Western Europe. The result, as onestudy put it, was that by the 1990s, mainstream left-wing parties “had more in common” economically with their “main competitors than with [their] own positions roughly three decades earlier.”As they abandoned much of their distinctive economic appeal during the late 20th century, European labor andsocial democratic parties began paying increasing attention to noneconomic issuessuch as immigration and national identity and particularly during the last decade orsoshifted their positions to the left on them. (Some,such as Denmark’s Social Democrats, have recentlyshifted back to the center,seeking to win their old voters back.)As they abandoned much of their distinctive economic appeal, European labor andsocial democratic parties began paying increasing attention to noneconomic issues like immigration and national identity. This, along with economic convergence between the mainstream left and right, helped increase the centrality of noneconomic issues in political debate. It also moved mainstream left-wing parties away from the preferences of working-class, non-college-educated voters in particular and the electorate more generally. Arecentstudy by the politicalscientists David W. Brady, John A. Ferejohn, and Aldo Paparo, for example, found that while “[a]nxieties over immigration have risensharply in recent years” in Europe, mainstream parties increasingly came to be “perceived by their partisans to be more welcoming towards immigrants than their own partisans.” Moreover, the “further a partisan perceives the distance between herself and her party on immigration the greater the likelihood is that they will desert their party in a future election.”Here, too, of course, there aresimilarities with developments in the United States. Although the Democratic Party’s economic profile was never as distinctively left-wing as that of most of its European counterparts, during the late 20th century the partyshifted to the center economically, with Bill Clinton presenting himself as an advocate ofsmall government, fiscal restraint, welfarestate retrenchment, globalization, andso on. (Reflecting this, former U. S. Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspanonce called Clinton as “the best Republican president we’ve had in a while.”)Alongside this economicshift, the Democratic Party also moved left onsocial and cultural issues, ashift that was particularly pronounced during the last two elections. Studiesof the 2016 election found not only that Trump focused more directly onsocial and cultural issues, most notably immigration, than his predecessors but that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, did as well. The result of the increasing attention paid by both candidates to immigration, for example, was that the correlation between preferences on this issue, and which candidate people chose tosupport, went up. Many of thestances taken by the Democratic Party onsocial and cultural issuessuch as illegal immigration,so-called political correctness, police reform, and affirmative action are to the left of working-class, non-college-educated white voters, the party’s own partisans, and the electorate more generally. Many internal party critics, accordingly, believe that these “wildly unpopular” positions, alongside the party’s general “cultural leftism,” are a major reason why it has been hard to attract back more working-class, non-college-educated white voters as well as culturally conservative nonwhite voters. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, left-wing parties across the West have lost thesupport of non-college-educated, working-class white voters. In Europe, the electoral decline of labor andsocial democratic parties—many of these parties have lost 30 percent or more of their previous electoralshares over the last decades, andsome,such as the French Socialist and Dutch Labour parties, essentially disappeared in the last elections—cannot beseparated from their loss of working-class, non-college educated voters. While the two-partysystem in the United States protects the Democratic Party from the threat ofsplinter parties, it hard tosee how it can compete with the Republicans at the national,state, and local levels over the long term without winning back more working-class, non-college educated voters. Analystsof the 2020 election, for example, have argued that Biden’s modest gains withsuch voters, particularly in pivotalstates, were more important to his win than the growth in theshare of the nonwhite electorate that has occurred over the previous 30-40 years. It is hard tosee how the left—much less liberal democracy—in the West can be reinvigorated without reversing this trend. And in the United States, where observershave begun morbidly joking about Republicans “assembling the multiracial working-class coalition that the left has always dreamed of,” Trump managed to recapture the percentage of minority voters that his Republican predecessors had previously received and he improvedsignificantly on his 2016 performance withsuch voters. Many right-wing populist parties in Europe also currently enjoy thesupport of a majority of the working class. It is hard tosee how the left—much less liberal democracy—in the West can be reinvigorated without reversing this trend. There are many causes of the dramatic voting realignment that has occurred across the West over the past few decades, but ignoring the role played by the mainstream parties of the left wouldsurely be a mistake. Shifting to the center on economic issues and to the left onsocial and cultural ones contributed to increasing thesalience of the latter while also moving left-wing parties away from the preferences of non-college-educated, working-class voters and the electorate at large. This created, in politicalscience parlance, a “representation gap” between the left and many voters and thus an opportunity for right-wing populists to capturesome of them. None of this requires the left to abandon important goals including humane immigration policies, racial justice, and police reform. It does mean recognizing, however, that in a democracysticking with consistently unattractive positions entails accepting permanent political disadvantage, if not impotence. Winning elections requires either persuading voters of the desirability of your positions or reconsidering them. Concretely, this means convincing activists who generally have views far to the left of other voters on noneconomic issues that unless they are able toshift public opinion, they will have to acceptsome compromises on them. It also means that left-wing partiesshould recalibrate the amount of time focused on economic versus noneconomic issues (with the left’s positions on the former being broadly popular among working-class and other voters), as well as the way in which they discuss the latterso as to make clear to working-class voters of all backgrounds and othersympathetic citizens that progress on these issues is a positive rather thanzero-sum game.is a professor of politicalscience at Barnard College, Columbia University and the author ofRead MoreBut in the United States, theyshow nosigns of abatement.

But not at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and definitely not when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. If the topic comes up at your Zoom holiday party, here’s a cheatsheet for thespecific uses of thesesimilar terms. No COVID-19 vaccines have been approved. Approvalmeans the FDA has officially decided that a product issafe and effective for its designated use. The process for approval involves rigorous reviews of all available data on the product and can takeseveral months. Tospeed things up in an emergency like a pandemic, the FDA can grant anEmergency Use Authorization(EUA). An EUA, as its name implies, authorizes a product for use during unusually urgent circumstances if the benefits of its use outweigh any known or potential risks. A vaccine that combats a global pandemic is an ideal candidate for an EUA – we can’t afford to lose any more time in the midst of a crisis with an ever-climbing death toll. The FDAgranted an EUA for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, and it’s likely to do thesame for the Moderna vaccine this week. As long as noserious harms from the vaccines are discovered, they’ll maintain authorization until the pandemic is over. At that point, the pharmaceutical companies will decide if they want toseek FDA approval. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, was granted an EUA for COVID-19 treatment in May before gaining approval in October. The expedited process for authorizing COVID-19 vaccines doesn’t mean decisions are being made willy-nilly. FDA reviewersstill had to pore over all the currently available data from clinical trials beforesigning off on the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. FDA clearance is usually applied to devices — anything fromheart-monitoring ap ps on asmart watch to X-ray machines. The FDA groups medical devices into three classes based on the level of risk associated with their use. Low-stakes products like gauze and tongue depressors are Class I, while products like pacemakers are Class III. Devices in Class III are the only ones which require FDA approval before they can be put on the market. Those in Classes I and II don’t necessarily need to be approved to be marketed.

What followed were72hours of uncertainty and yet another failed response to an environmental disaster that gambled with the lives and wellbeing of incarcerated people. The breach was discovered on April2at the old Piney Point phosphate plant reservoir in Manatee County, threatening to collapse one of the walls holding back more than300million gallons of radioactive water. If this wall ruptured, it would take less than an hour for the county to besubmerged under​“a20-foot wall of water,” Acting Manatee County Administrator Scott L. Hopes told a local news channel. The potentially​“imminent” collapse of gypsumstacks full of toxic and radioactive contents would have been one of the largest environmental disasters of recent years. The next day, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared astate of emergency in Manatee County and issued a mandatory evacuation order to​“protect the lives and property of the people in the threatened communities.” More than300households were within the mandatory evacuation zone, and many fled the area, relocated by the local andstate government to hotels where they received free meals. Detainees at the jail, meanwhile, were left neglected, just over a mile away from the Piney Point phosphate plant. Local organizers tweeted an urgent plea for the public to flood with phone calls the offices of the Sheriff for Manatee County, Rick Wells, the Board of County Commissioners, and the Emergency Management Division at Manatee County, in hopes that the pressure would force officials to evacuate the incarcerated people. At first, thesheriff moved the medical unit and jailstaff to thesecond floor of the facility, leaving detainees vulnerable to the consequences of the flood on the first floor,surrounded by large bags ofsand that were allegedly placed there to delay the effects of the flooding. By early morning on April4, thesheriff had crammed as many inmates as possible into thesecond floor’s cells. Only267of1,200inmates we reevacuated during the crisis, and they weresent to the nearby Polk County Jail. Jordan Mazurek, an organizer with Florida Prisoner Solidarity (FPS) — an abolitionist collective whose mission is to prioritize the needs of all incarcerated people, their community, and​“care networks” — fumed about Sheriff Wells’ response to the looming crisis.​“The immediate excuse from thesheriff’s office for why they weren’t evacuating people was,​‘Covid. We can’t evacuate people because it’s not Covidsafe.’ Well, keeping people in cages is not at all Covidsafe.” In overcrowded cells, prisoners faced a greater risk ofspreading Covid-19. Detainees waited nervously tosee if the breach would mean that a toxic flood would cut off all access to the critical infrastructure on the first floor, their watersupply — or worse. Had the jail flooded, emergency access to the facility wouldn’t have been possiblesince the Florida Highway Patrol had already closed U. S. Route41, the only road to the jail. On April6, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Rick Wells and thestate of Florida for presenting an​“unreasonable risk ofserious harm” to those that remained detained at the jail. Thankfully, the crisis for Manatee County was averted by pumping millions of gallons of polluted water into Tampa Bay, providing reprieve to the detainees. But the gamble taken by thestate of Florida and thesheriff carried large risks: When the evacuation order was lifted on April6— four days after the breach was discovered — more than1,000inmates remained at the jail. On April12, the lawsuit against Florida and Sheriff Wells and was dismissed by the ACLU. For Florida Prisoner Solidarity, questions regarding thesafety of incarcerated people during climate disasters are not new. The organization connected with an incarcerated person at a Florida prison that has frequently been threatened by hurricanes. The person asked to remain anonymous out of concern for theirsafety.“They come with plywood and cover up the windows — this is when everybody just walks around in their box,” F. D. O. C. Slave, whose chosen pseudonym is a reflection of the abuse he has experienced while imprisoned in Florida, told with respect to preparations for incoming hurricanes. While F. D. O. C. Slave has not personally experienced extreme flooding at his prison, there have been many reported cases ofsevere flooding across the country due to the poor infrastructure installed, allegedly, to protect inmates, proving that plywood is not adequate protection for hurricanes. Though the plywood is typically installed two to three days before the hurricanes,​“it usually takes two weeks” to remove them. If another hurricane is expectedsoon, prisons keep the plywood for up to a month, often during90-degree temperatures in June and July.​“Because there’s no AC, and they close all the windows… there’s no ventilation,”said F. D. O. C. Slave. Over1,200legal cases werefiledfrom1980to2019that claimed violation of the Eighth Amendment right to protection from dangerous temperature conditions. According to Prison Legal News,79inmates and prisonstaffsuffered from heat-related illnesses in the first10months of2018. Natural disasters, accelerated by climate change, are a growing threat to incarcerated people across the United States, who are vulnerable and often left behind during environmental crises. Deidre McDonald wrote in a first-person account for the Marshall Project about being incarcerated in a Texas prison during Hurricane Harvey in2017:​“To get to the main building, I must wade into it, knee-deep. That’s when I notice the ladies with wheelchairs, walkers and crutches arestruggling. One woman is crying hysterically becauseshe is afraid of water, and the dorm boss can’t get her to take onestep forward.” Her account calls attention to how lack of planning and infrastructure poses additional risks for prisoners with disabilities or phobias.“Folks [were] up to their waist and chest in water for12hours,” Jordan Mazurek, an FPS organizer whose background is in toxic prisons and environmental justice,said of Hurricane Harvey’s devastating impact on Texas prisons.​“The feds didn’t have enough water to go around andso folksstarted drinking toilet water because it was the only thing left, and as a result, two prisoners died of bacterial infections.”The intersection of mass incarceration and environmental disasters is not coincidental. While the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)states that no groupshould be discriminated against when considering the public’s right to live in hazard-free areas, there’s a clear link between unsafe environmental conditions andsites of incarceration. Frequently located on cheap undesirable real estate, nearly one-third of federal andstate prisons in the United States are less than three miles away from a Superfund cleanupsite — highly contaminated areas, also known as toxic waste dumps, that the EPA determines as needing long-term clean-upsince they pose a risk to the health and wellbeing of either humans or the environment. Marcos Santos, an inmate at the State Correctional Institute at Fayette in Pennsylvania — built on top of an old miningsite andsurrounded by​“about40million tons of waste” —toldAl Jazeera in2016,​“I’ve had to endure numerous medical problems: rashes throughout my body that hurt and keep me up all night. Extremeswelling of various parts including my throat making it difficult to breathe.”Inmates are at the front lines of​“the most brutal effects of everysingle disastersituation,”said Mazurek of FPS. Incarcerated persons’ lack of mobility makes itso that they cannot​“move out of the path of a hurricane on their own free will or move out of the path of what would have been a20-foot-high wall of toxic water coming at their jail,” Mazurek continued.​“Prisons are just an ongoing disaster, and that’s how it’s going to be until we close them all.”I hope you found this article important.

380,Oregon overpaid furloughed Baker City school staff; now the state wants the money back,1.0,49.33,https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2020/09/oregon-overpaid-furloughed-baker-city-school-staff-now-the-state-wants-the-money-back.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"The Oregon Employment Department erroneously paid about $100,000 in unemployment benefits to 155 eastern Oregonschool districtstaff who were furloughed lastspring, according to the Baker School District. Now, thestate wants the money back. The district learned about the problem last week,said Michelle Glover, theschools’ business manager. Shesaid the over payments amounted to between $630 and $730 per employee. Thestate isn’t demanding that workers repay it now, according to Glover. But if they don’t fork it over, thestate will deduct the funds from any future unemployment claims thosestaffers make.“This is going to be a hardship on ourstaff,” Glover wrote in an email Thursday. The employment department hasstruggled to administer its benefits program throughout the pandemic. It declined to address this latest issue,sayingstate law prevents it from discussing unemployment claims at any organization – evenschool districts and other public entities that are normallysubject to public records disclosure. The origin of the issue in Baker City is extremely complex. The Baker Cityschools, like other districts around thestate, furloughed employees for one day a week when the pandemic hit lastspring tosave money in anticipation of a fall budget crunch. The Baker School District and many other Oregonschool districts tapped into thestate’s Work Share program to compensate employees for the lost wages.(In many cases, employees actually got a raise during their furloughs thanks to the $600 weekly unemployment bonus Congress authorized in March.)Work Share requires that participating employers furlough their employees for at least 20% of their work week, with a 40-hour limit on the work week. The Baker School District, though, usually operates on a four-day-a-weekschedule – noschool on Fridays. And because of a quirk of the calendar, the district didn’t meet that 20% threshold for the week in May that included Memorial Day. Theschool districtsaid it wasn’t aware of the 40-hour-week maximum, and the employment department overlooked it, too. Gloversaid the department has acknowledged that this was, at least partially, thestate’s mistake. Now, though,shesaid the burden falls on employees. Sen. Lynn Findley, R-Vale, raised the Baker City issue Thursday ata legislative hearing on the crisis at the employment department. Oregon owes backlogged jobless benefits to tens of thousands of laid-off workers and tens of thousands more went for long periods without benefits early in the pandemic as the employment departmentstruggled to cope with the unprecedented volume of claims. On Thursday, Findleysaid the Baker City issue is indicative of broader problems at the department.“Thestate leadership has failed to provide oversight with adequate followup with this agency,” Findleysaid.-- Mike Rogoway |mrogoway@oregonian.com| twitter:@rogoway|",2,2,The Oregonian
381,"‘Jim Crow Strategy’: Trump Files Lawsuit In Wisconsin Targeting 200,000 Votes In Two Counties with Highest Number of Black Voters",-4.67,47.33,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/12/02/jim-crow-strategy-trump-files-lawsuit-in-wisconsin-targeting-200000-votes-in-two-counties-with-highest-number-of-black-voters/,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-02,15,"On Tuesday, Dec. 1, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin targeting more than 200,000 votes in two counties containing the majority of thestate’s Black residents. After a partial recount, for which the Trump campaign paid $3 million, thestate-certified the results for President-Elect Joe Biden on Monday. The new lawsuit, filed in the Wisconsin Supreme Court,seeks to overturn thestate’s election results by targeting 221,323 votes cast in Milwaukee and Dane Counties, two regions where much of thestate’s Black population resides. The two counties were also targeted by the requested recount, which ultimately yielded 87 more votes for Biden after it was completed. Biden won thestate by a margin of 20,682 votes after the recount. Legal experts and James Troupis, a member of the Trump campaign, have admitted thesuit likely will not impact the results of the election. Allsixswingstates President Trump has contested have certified the results in favor of Biden. The largestshare of the targeted votes,some 170,000, are absentee ballots, while the rest of the votes the campaign wants tossed out are comprised of ballots missing a witness address, thosesubmitted by people who identified as “indefinitely confined” and those returned during the Democracy in the Park event hosted by the city of Madison. Thesuit describes the event as having created “unlawful polling locations.”Thesuit does not allege voter fraud, but instead claims the votes were cast in violation ofstate law because voters who filed the in-person absentee ballots did not have tosubmit aseparate written application. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted that voters have been allowed tosign a form on the ballot envelope, whichserves as a ballot application, and certifies that they have filled out the ballot for over a decade. The campaign asks justices to void Governor Tony Evers’ certification of Biden’s win. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul called the move a “Jim Crowstrategy” in astatement on Monday before thesuit was filed. It’s clear thatPresident Trumpand his representatives used the recount toseek after-the-election changes to the rules. Those changes would result in tens of thousands of votes, if not more, being thrown out — and the president’s representatives have onlysought to have those changes applied to votes cast in our two most populous counties, in which the majority of Black Wisconsinites live,” Kaulsaid.“I have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crowstrategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail.”",2,2,Atlanta Black Star
382,Experts Warn Latest Trump Administration Move on Iran Could Backfire,-4.0,47.0,http://time.com/5575620/donald-trump-iran-sanctions-waiver/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-22,25,"President Donald Trump’s decision Monday to endsix-month waivers from U. S.sanctions for five countries that have continued buying Iranian oil — the latest turn of thescrew in his Administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran — was met with predictable outrage from Tehran. Butsome U. S. State Department, Defense and intelligence officials and outside experts warn that the move could backfire by causing ripple effects in countries like China, Turkey and Iraq. In response to thesanctions, Greece, Italy and, Taiwan hadstopped buying Iranian oil, but China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey have continued to import Iranian oil. The economic pressure has reduced Iranian oil exports from more than 2.5 million barrels a day to less than 1 million, discouraged foreign investment, andsent the value of Iran’s currency plummeting and inflationsoaring. Announcing the move in a press briefing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeosaid the decision to end the waivers was “dramatically escalating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our nationalsecurity objectives while maintaining well-supplied global oil markets”. The Administration’s objective, Pompeosaid, include prompt Iran to renegotiate the international agreement halting its pursuit of nuclear weapons, halt its ballistic missile tests, and end itssupport for terrorist groups, which U. S. officialssay include Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas, Houthi militias in Yemen, and authoritarian regimes in Syria and Venezuela. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the move, and Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falihsaid his country and others would ensure that “the global oil market does not go out of balance.”Some U. S. and foreign officials and outside experts, however, argue that the escalating attack on Iran’s economy is unlikely to prompt Iran to halt itssupport for terrorist organizations; force the country’s clerical rulers to renegotiate the deal halting their efforts to develop nuclear weapons; weaken its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite Quds Force; or turn everyday Iranians against the Islamic regime.“If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there,”says Aaron David Miller, a Mideast expert and vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “And what is the Trump Administrationstrategy toward Iran? Even if it’s regime change or forcing Iran to retrench in the region, this recent move will accomplish neither goal. It might ultimately goad Iran to give the Administration a pretext for military action. But how would this change the balance to America’s advantage?”Instead,said two U. S. officials whospoke only to the condition of anonymity to criticize the Administration’s Iran policy, the Administration has not given much thought to the likely effects of its Iran policy on oil markets or on the nations, especially China, India, Turkey and Iraq, that now will besanctioned if they continue to import oil from Iran.“The Administration has launched a fairlysignificant initiative without doing the necessary groundwork with the countries that will be most affected,” Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at Washington’s Brookings Institution, tells TIME. Iraq, which remains unstable, host tosome remnants of ISIS, and divided on ethnic and religious lines 16 years after the U. S. invasion, is especially vulnerable because imports of Iranian natural gas and electricity are critical to its economy,shesays. Worse,says Maloney, the Administration hadsignaledsince November that the exemptions for buying Iranian oil cut would be made gradually until it abruptly announced they will end on May 2. Nor,says Maloney, does the Administration appear to have given much thought to how Iran might respond to the latest turn of thescrew, whichshesays are likely to include efforts to disrupt global oil markets when demand reaches its peak thissummer. In a tweet, President Trumpsaid: “Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian oil.”Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil. Iran is being given VERY BAD advice by@JohnKerryand people who helped him lead the U. S. into the very bad Iran Nuclear Deal. Big violation of Logan Act?The two U. S. intelligence officials on Monday dismissed Iran’s threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, butsaid Tehran could retaliate by disrupting Iraqi oil exports or launching cy ber attacks on oil and gas production and export facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, or even U. S. or European oil companies, which couldsend oil prices upward during the vacationseason in the U. S. and Western Europe. The officialssaid the 2012 Shamoon virus attacks on Qatar’s RasGas and on the Saudi oil company Aramco — an attack then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta called “probably the most destructive attack that the privatesector hasseen to date” — were traced to Iran.

The alliance was one of 10selected from a field of 100 projects presented at this year’s forum. It was chosen for its potential impact as well as its potential for development through thesupport of the committee. The alliance is a collaboration between 99 fact-checking organizations from over 70 countries producing fact-checks in 43 different languages. It has been coordinated for the last 11 months by the International Fact-Checking Network, and has produced a database of over 9,000 COVID-19 fact-checks, which havesince been translated from English into Spanish, Portuguese and Hindi.“This is a big day for fact-checkers,”said IFCN Associate Director Cristina Tardáguila. “This means that all the effort fact-checkers put together for the last 11 months to fight mis/disinformation about COVID-19 not only helped many people during this pandemic, but is being recognized assomething that must continue.”The annual conference brings together world leaders, global dignitaries and various non-profit and non-governmental organizations to discuss ways of avoiding global conflict, and providingsolutions to global challenges. Due to the pandemic, this year’s forum was held virtually and welcomed 12,000 participants as well as 50 heads ofstate from around the worldIn her pitch to the committee Thursday, Tardáguila talked about the alliance as asolution to the global problem posed by both mis- and disinformation about COVID-19.“It’s widely known that falsehoods travel fast, don’t respect barriers,” Tardáguila wrote in her prepared remarks. “Fact-checkers have decided to collaborate, to work together and toshare knowledge in order to be faster.”Shespoke about the power of having a global fact-checking database, which forsome alliance members acted as an early warningsystem for potential coronavirus misinformation.“Thanks to the alliance, we have misinformationspotted and located in advance by other fellow fact-checkers,”said Joaquín Ortega, head of content at Spanish fact-checking organizationNewtral. “This undoubtedly facilitated the verification process when these pieces of content were adapted to go viral in Spain.”The collaboration helpedsome alliance members improve their abilities as fact-checkers, and better understand the global flow of misinformation.“Thrown into the deep end as a relatively new fact-checker, the alliance created the needed environment tosee beyond our immediate target audience,”said Rabiu Alhassan, managing editor of Ghanaian fact-checking organization,GhanaFact.“The knowledge we gained from this collaboration gave us new views on how to analyze and report misinformation, and I believe we could apply this for other topics in the future,”said Natalia Leal, content director at Brazilian fact-checking organizationAgencia Lupa. PolitiFacteditor Angie Holansaid fact-checkers collaborating across borders is not a new phenomenon. Whatsets the alliance apart is its longevity andscale.“We’ve been fact-checking andsharing information for months now about an issue that has affected countries worldwide,” Holansaid. “It’s been quite an undertaking.”As part of her pitch, Tardáguila also talked about the four WhatsApp chat bots developed by the IFCN that help the public easily access fact-checks from their phones. The project also yielded partnership opportunities with WhatsApp and Facebook that helpedsupport 21 alliance member fact-checking projects with over $800,000 in grant funding. Giovanni Zagni, content director at Italian fact-checking organizationFacta, praised the collaboration for creating the easy-to-use chat bot and a database of fact-checks that can bestudied by misinformation researchers.“The only problem that Isee is that itshould be much more famous,” Zagnisaid. The 11-member committee made up of representatives from organizations like the World Bank and the United Nations, acts as a project incubator that will give customizedsupport to the CoronaVirusFacts Alliance. Fact-checkers who praised the project also offeredsuggestions for how it could improve.“Misinformation around the virus is moving to offline word of mouth,”said GhanaFact’s Alhassan. “Then it is also becoming obvious that the number of (new) fact-checks around the pandemic is dwindling,so how can we evolve to deal with this new phenomenon?”Others advocated for more coordination from the IFCN to address both the global and regionalspread of misinformation, narrativessimilar to efforts undertaken by fact-checkers inEurope.“Periodic roundups of the hotteststories in disinformation around the world couldserve as a global alertsystem, like the one you have for tsunamis,” Zagnisaid, adding thatsuch asystem will need increased investment.

Trump presented his farewell address to the nation Tuesday afternoon. An emotional President-elect Joe Bidensniffled andslurred his farewell to his homestate of Delaware. By noon tomorrow, Donald Trump will be at Mar-a-Lago with his gorgeous and amazing wife,set to return to his enviable life building resorts on the most beautifulspots on the planet. By noon tomorrow, Joe Biden will be at the U. S. Capitol with asea of National Guard in front of him and barely asupporter insight, with Iran and China and Russia and North Koreaset to inflame the most dangerous parts of the planet. By tomorrow afternoon, Trump will be on the back nine at Dural. By tomorrow afternoon, Biden will be feeling the knives in his back from those thirsting for control of the West Wing. Tell me, who really won? Would you blame Joe if he finally did push for a forensic audit of the election? Would you blame Trump if he laughed his face off all the way to Florida?Joe Biden isn’t the only one weepy today. Check out the writers’ rooms of the late night comedyshows. Sure, theirsmug bosses like Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel are perfectly happy their non-stop efforts to tear down Trump for four years hadsome effect. Their banning of him from late night appearances played ohso well with their cancel culture buddies, who would have hung them from the Hollywoodsign had they dared make Trump a guest. Thesame Donald Trump who wassuch a fixture on late night TV that he actually hostedtwice. But their writers are not nearly as jolly at the installation of Joe Biden. They know thatstarting tomorrow they actually have to work for a living. As a former Hollywood topical humor writer, I guarantee Donald Trump has been a gift from God to those who have to write jokes every day. Coming up with jokes isn’t necessarily the hard part of the job. The hard part is theset up. The little news item that can be turned into a joke. Thanks to Trump’s Twitter feed, you had numerousset-upsset up to go before you finished breakfast. And once Trump got rolling during the day, who knows how many perfectset ups the man wouldserve up. You’d have half your number of requisite jokes done by lunch. Trump made you look like a comedy genius when you were at best a glorifiedstenographer. What are they getting with Biden? Sure. You can make jokes about his mental lapses and feebleness. The Grim Reaper is practically a cabinet member. But how quickly does this grow old? How cruel does it become given his clear infirmity? How unnerving is it to joke when hisshaky hand is on the nuclear trigger? “Sure it’s funny, untilsomeone loses a city.”Beyond that, while Trump was a nearly 24/7 news-generating machine, Biden is only capable ofso much action in a given day. The comedy beast must be fed at regular intervals. So thosesad comedy writers will have to break asweat. They’ll have to leave the White House watch to hunt and gather for food to feed the beast. Yes, propagandists like CNN’s Jake Tapper will be raising toasts with their collaborators like James Clapper at Trump’s departure. Overthrow Mission Accomplished. But onesuspects the news rooms around America willsoonsuffer post-Trump depression. What in the world are they going to do? Go back tospending days obsessing over a disappeared plane? Go back to dry analysis by inside the beltway bores of inside the beltwayshenanigans that don’t matter even to people living inside the beltway? Heaven forbid, will they be forced to leave the comfy confines to cover real news that matters to real people?No morespending hours a dayspend fussing oversomething Trump did orsaid that day. That usually ends up being proven false within a day, but that’s not their problem. Then again, perhaps I’m being naïve. Of course, they’restill going to cover Trump. Unless they go to Betty Ford to deal with their addiction, they willstill have to get their Trump fix. They’llstillshare their daily Trump talking points like the junkiessharing dirty needles. They’ll be happy for Biden to put a lid on his day at 10 a.m. as long as Trump doessomething they can feign outrage over. “Trump visits his resort in Scotland! How many children could be fed with the moneyspent for Secret Service?!” “Girl breaks arm in fall at Trump run ice-rink. Thank God for Obamacare!” “Leftist radicals burn leftist businesses in leftist run city in leftist runstate. 10 Reasons It’s Trump’s Fault!”For Donald Trump, it’ll be old hat. He’s beensubject to constant media attentionsince the Carter Administration. For Joe Biden, he’ll be denied the one thing he’s cravedsince he first ran for office: To beseen as The Guy.

386,Why Education Is Democracy’s Best Bet,-13.67,30.0,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/randall-l-hull-us-civic-education-budget-democracy-election-donald-trump-news-61721/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,21,"Joyce Appleby, aren owned historian of the Founding Fathers and republican ideology, wrote in her 2001 book “Inheriting the Revolution” that the first generation of Americans (1790-1830) believed a good education was a requirement for every responsible citizen. The majority of men, and notably a wide cross-section of women, in the early days of the republic viewed education as a “critical bridge to responsible citizenship,” according to Appleby. They admired the intellect of our Founding Fathers and felt a patriotic duty to elevate their knowledgeso they could better understand the leaders and politics of the day, and thus become better citizens. In 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville captured his enthusiasm for America and its enlightened citizens in his famous book, “Democracy in America,” proclaiming that in the future, “all the world will be America.” How times have changed. Following Boris Yeltsin appointment of Vladimir Putin as hissuccessor to the Russian presidency in 1999, after the death of China’s Deng Xiaoping in 1997 and, finally, at the end of the Arab Spring in 2012, the world hasseen a reversal of democratic government and the rise of authoritarianism. More than a few Americans wouldsay that had President Donald Trump been reelected to asecond term, it is likely that many of our institutions and norms built to protect democracy would havesuffered asimilar fate. Many were already under assault in his first term, like the politicized Department of Justice. For the first time in our history, we are witnessingsomething other than a peaceful, orderly transition of presidential power that was enshrined in our American memory beginning with Washington’s “Farewell Address” in 1796. We have neverseen anything like Trump’s assault on the facts, the electoral process and thesacred nature of a free and fair vote for all Americans. How in the world can more than half of Republicans believe the election was rigged?The answer — a campaign of relentless disinformation and lies,spread bysocial media and irresponsible cable TV and talk radio journalists, believed to be true by a largeswath of the population, who apparently received little or no instruction in civics and US history. If this debacle teaches us anything it is that civics and history deserve a much bigger role in our primary andsecondary education curricula, even at the expense of a reduced STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) curricula that has been over-emphasized for too long. Look at the voting process. Severalrecentsurveys of Republican voters indicate that anywhere from 50% to 80% of them believe the 2020 presidential election was not free and fair. This despite the fact that Christopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure and Security Agency and a former Microsoft cy bersecurity expert,statedthat the recent election was “the mostsecure in US history.” Everystate and every Republican and Democratic governor has certified their results with only negligible, immaterial changes in vote counts. Yet we are witnessing a horrific display of threats againststate officials — of both parties — who have certified the election results by those who do not trust the voting process. Why? Because they do not understand the voting process and how it is protected. Many do not understand the Electoral College either. This unacceptable in America. We are looking a lot more like a banana republic than the beacon of democracy to the rest of the world. Clearly America’s reputation hassuffered terribly around the globe. The vitriol and emotion, amplified and reinforced on cable TV andsocial media, builds continuously until it drowns out rational thought. These conditions — extreme ideologies, absence of compromise and bipartisanship and the threat of domestic terrorism created as a result — are a major threat to our republic. Left unchecked, thesituation will worsen and could destroy us if we don’t act immediately. Let’s hope and pray that nobody gets hurt as a result of these mindless protests dangerously getting close to becoming violent. There aresomeshort-term political and economicsolutions to mitigate our divisions. Not the focus of this essay, but initiatives like publicly-financed campaigns to take “dark money” out of politics will go a long way to bringing the parties together. Economic policies to rebuild the middle class and reverse the growth of inequality will foster ashared prosperity to reduce fear and anxiety amongst a large portion of our population. However, these political and economicsolutions will not take hold unless we begin to restore the health of our underlying culture andstart to remember who we were as Americans, and who we need to be going forward. Itstarts and ends with an informed electorate. In times of crisis, we look to history — and those who made it into history books for all the right reasons — to instruct us in a time of need. The 19th-century thinker Horace Mann often called the founding father of public education in America called out the importance of an educated public to the health of a democratic government: “A republican form of government, without intelligence in the people, must be, on a vastscale, what a mad-house, withoutsuperintendent or keepers, would be on asmall one.” Even before Mann, Thomas Jefferson offeredsimilar wisdom: “Ignorance and despotismseem made for each other, [but if the new nation could] enlighten the people generally … tyranny and the oppress ions of mind and body will vanish, like evilspirits at the dawn of the day.”Regarding the importance of astrong civics curriculum in ourschools, we have George Washingtonstating, on the one bookend of US history: “A primary objectshould be the education of our youth in thescience of government. In a republic, whatspecies of knowledge can be equally important? And what duty more pressing than communicating it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?”Echoingsimilar opinionssome 244 years later as the world’s longest-enduring democratic,self-governing republic, is Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts: “But in the ensuing years [following the ratification of the Constitution], we have come to take democracy for granted, and civic education has fallen by the wayside. In our age, whensocial media can instantlyspread rumor and false information on a grand the public’s need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital.”This is quite a commentary on the importance of education generally, and civicsspecifically, to the health and continuedsurvival of “American exceptionalism.” Beyond the voting process and the Electoral College, how well does the public understand how government isstructured, how it works? The Annenberg Public Policy Center reported the results of a broadsurvey of Americans and found that only one in four Americans could name all three branches of the federal government. This an astounding discovery. Thesamesurvey found that fewer than 15% of thesame cohort could name more than one First Amendment right, with only 37% of respondents able to name asingle First Amendment right — their response, by and large, was freedom ofspeech. How beneficial would it be tosociety if everyone knew that our federal government does notsanction any religion, nor prevent anyone from practicing their own beliefs, or not? Freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble and the right to petition the government round out all the First Amendment rights. How are we doing in terms of education outcomes in this age of information overload, hyper-partisanship and emotion crowding out reason and thoughtful reflection? Notso great. According to DoSomething.org — a youth nonprofit whose corporatesponsors include 3M, Ford Foundation, Johnson & Johnson, Google and General Motors among many others — in 1985, the quantity and quality of highschool graduates in the US as a group was ranked number one in the world. But by 2015, our highschool population was ranked 36 in the world. Michael Porter at the Harvard Business School has been conducting expansive and thoroughsurveyssince 2011 of more than 2,000senior-level business leaders, across a widespectrum of industries in the US, regarding the competitiveness of the US economy. The conclusions of thestudy teamstrongly align with the findings of DoSomething.org noted above. Porter has concluded thatshared prosperity is a key component of an economy’s competitiveness and that the US economy is failing to delivershared prosperity to an ever-shrinking middle class. More importantly, Porter has tied this economic failure to political and cultural failures. To findsolutions to our political failures — climate change, inequality, health care and immigration — we must focus on revising election and campaign financing laws. To find answers to our cultural failures —systemic racism, increased polarization, domestic terrorism and crime — we must improve outcomes in K-12 public education as the most criticalsolution. There is nothing more important to the long-termsurvival of our democracy than a large investment in education as well as in our defense and military capability. Turns out, that as a nation, we invest about thesame amount annually in each, which issurprising to most people. The 2020 defense budget is projected to be about $750 billion, and totals pending on public education— elementary plussecondary — in 2015 across the country, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics, was $706 billion. The problem is that education is funded and administered locally and, as a result, there is a wide variation in the quality of its delivery as the DoSomething.org and the Harvardstudies both demonstrate. The current noise and disinformation around election fraud — a president askingstate legislators to overturn a popular vote in choosing electors to the Electoral College and how presidents can lose the popular vote of the nation andstill be elected — threaten our democracy. How? Inshort, even more people begin to lose trust in our government to be fair, and “for the People.” Trust in Congress is already at an historical low point according toPew Research. How do we restore this trust? Astrong civics education is a goodstart. Why is thisso important? Here’s the deal: The 2016 presidential election came down to fewer than80,000 votersin Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Even though Trump lost the popular vote among over 125 million total voters, his narrow wins in these three battlegroundstates gave him an Electoral College majority of 306 over Hillary Clinton’s 232. This means that just 0.06% of all the voters in America determined the outcome of the 2016 election. In the 2000 presidential election, it came down to 537 votes in Florida. It is frightening to consider thatso few voters could makesuch a difference, and how easily it might be to corruptsuch asmall number of voters. If that doesn’t argue for astrong civics curriculum in ourschools, what does?Education is thesingle most important component of the common good for maintaining the long-term health of our democracy. Why? Because we will not meaningfully transform our political and economic models until we begin to transform our culture. And you do not transform culture byscreaming at people. You transform culture by educating people and celebrating rational discourse among all citizens. We rely on yoursupport for our independence, diversity and quality. Per MonthAs thesquabbling over the January 6 commission heats up in the US, India offers a cautionary tale about democracy. Maintaining a vibrant democracy in the United States requires recognition that exceptional ism does not make us invulnerable to autocratic impulses... Disparity, dysfunction and discord have destroyed democracies in the past and endanger American democracy today.",1,1,Fair Observer

The nation’s top infectious disease expert made the comments when he was asked how “to break down the myths and the historic trepidation” during a virtual conversation called “Making It Plain: A Conversation with Dr. Fauci and The Black Community.”Corbett, a viral immunologist, rose to public prominence in March when it was revealedshe was a leadscientist with Dr. Barney Graham’s coronavirus team in the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health. She was among the team ofscientists who met within April when he took a tour of NIH’s Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory. In addition to over 10 years of research experience, Corbett holds a Ph. D in microbiology and immunology and graduated from the University of Maryland-Baltimore County with a degree insociology in 2008. A few tweets have resurfaced of Corbettspeaking candidly about the medical community. In a March tweet,she alleged the poor Black community may be overlooked for treatment if ventilators were inshortsupply. The following monthshe “plead the fifth” on thesuggestion that the pandemic is an act of genocide against Blacks. Dr. Faucisaid while he understands the Black community’s mistrust due to decades of racism in medical care and inhumane experimentation on Black Americans, the pending COVID-19 vaccines aresafe and effective. He reiterated his claims were underscored by the involvement of Corbett — who came under fire for tweets dating back to February which addressed the correlation betweensystemic racism and medical malpractice.“Kizzi is an African-Americanscientist who is right at the forefront of the development of the vaccine,” Fauci added. “So, the first thing you might want tosay to my African-American brothers andsisters is that the vaccine that you’re going to be taking was developed by an African American woman. And that is just a fact.”Thanks to@blackdoctor_orgfor asking this question. And, for Dr. Fauci for now making it likely impossible to enforce “Kizzmekia” cause everyone now knows he’s allowed tosay “Kizzy”. Haha 😂 recentsurvey by theCOVID Collaborativeshowed only 14 percent of Black Americans trust thesafety of a vaccine, whileslightly more, 18 percent, believed it would actually work. Corbett toldCNNshe understood why Black Americans had reservations and noted the medical profession had work to do to earn the community’s trust again.“I wouldsay to people who are vaccine-hesitant that you’ve earned the right to ask the questions that you have around these vaccines and this vaccine development process,” Corbettsaid. “Trust, especially when it has beenstripped from people, has to be rebuilt in a brick-by-brick fashion. … Andso, what Isay to people firstly is that I empathize, and thensecondly is that I’m going to do my part in laying those bricks. And I think that if everyone on ourside, as physicians andscientists, went about it that way, then the trust wouldstart to be rebuilt.”Reports of Fauci’s comments were met with mixed reviews onsocial media. Whilesome Twitter users asked why Corbett’s raceshould even matter, others praised Corbett being recognized for her great work. Still, otherssaid they didn’t care if a Black woman was involved, theystill would not take the vaccine.“Why is this a headline?” tweeted user @blondieinohio in response to one of TMZ’s tweets about it.“Almost everyone ment io ing (sic) why is this news happens to be Caucasian.

The answer is no,” Graham told Fox News. “I’ve always liked Liz Cheney, butshe’s made a determination that the Republican Party can’t grow with President Trump. I’ve determined we can’t grow without him.”In an opinion article for the Washington Post on Wednesday, Cheney again criticized Trump andsaid the Republican Party needs to move on from the “the Trump cult of personality” and claimed he is attempting to “unravel critical elements of our constitutionalstructure that make democracy work.” In February, Cheney was 1 of 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach the former president. Graham noted that Trump’s “economic populism” and “America First“ agenda are popular. Cheney drew the ire from Republicans aftershe called a proposal from Rep.

389,Whatever Happened to the Populist Left?,12.33,34.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/whatever-happened-to-the-populist-left/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"Against thesurreal backdrop ofsometimes violent nationwide protests, one alarmingstory as reported byseems to haveslipped under the radar. Law enforcement arrested a 21-year-old Idaho man onsuspicion of firing asemi-automatic rifle at the White House. Several days prior to the arrest, the Secret Service had responded to reports ofshots fired near the National Mall and pursued a vehicle departing the area on Constitution Avenue. They found the vehicle abandoned with an AK-47 andspent casings inside, andsoon afterward extractedseveral bullets that hadstruck the White House. Thesuspect’s relatives told investigators he appeared to have a “fixation” on the White House and the president. Thisreally did happen, but it wasn’t during the chaotic “Stop the Steal” rally earlier this month, or even any of the fiery demonstrations across the country lastsummer. It was on Wednesday, November 16, 2011, during the Occupy Wall Street protests. As the media and the incoming Biden administration froth at the mouth over Trump’s failed “insurrection,” it is fashionable for conservatives to point out the obvious doublestandard the media employs when comparing the events of last week and the BLM and Antifa riots of the past year, the latter of which were many orders more violent and destructive. Axiosreportsthat the insurance claims for the riots could approach $2 billion, and that an estimated 30 people, many of whom were African Americans, have lost their lives. Yet what’s also interesting—and alarming—is the fate of the progressive-powered Occupy Wall Street movement and the left-leaning populist movement it helped ignite. If the bailouts of 2008 were theirspark, where are they now amid the pandemic, when corporate profits havesoared and middle-to-low-income workers have been crushed?The answer is that they themselves have been occupied—transformed, rebranded, and redirected by corporations and the media. As Vladimir Lenin oncesaid, “The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.”The government’s response to the financial crisis of 2008 was unique in that it drew the condemnation of both the left and the right. Take, for example, the response it evoked from President Reagan’s first budget director, David Stockman: “A decisive tipping point in the evolution of American capitalism and democracy—the triumph of crony capitalism—took place on October 3, 2008.” On that day, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was passed to bail out Wall Street. Stockman’s book,, is a 768-page moral outrage manifesto, accusing thestate and its central bank of becoming disciples of misguided “Keynesianism, monetarism, andsupply-side-ism.”Despite promises of change, President Obama disappointed many of his optimistic voters. Asreportedbyin December 2011, Obama hadsecured more funding from the financial elite than all other GOP candidates combined. Simmering resentment and the let-down of the Obama presidency led to the birth of Occupy Wall Street, which launched in September 2011 and called for increases to the minimum wage, protections for the environment, andstudent debt relief. Theirslogan was “We are the 99%” and their enemy was the other 1 percent: the corporate elites. The message from Occupy Wall Street was generally devoid of any mention of race, creed, or ancestry. It was Marxist in tone to besure: the haves versus the have-nots, the oppressors versus the oppressed, the 99 percent versus the 1 percent. Yet while theirsolutions might have been wrong and unrealistic, their prognosis wasn’t exactly inaccurate. Wealth inequality hadskyrocketed. The nefarious actions of Wall Street firmsshould have been punished, not rewarded. The bailout of AIG had dwarfed all combined expenditures of the foodstamp programsince its inception in the 1960s. Faced withseething anger, the corporate mediasoon went to bat to reprogram their attackers. Thanks to the meticulous research of politicalscientist Zach Goldberg, we know that the actions of the press following the Occupy movement didn’t fit a coherent, organized pattern. In an article for magazine in August 2020, Goldbergpresentsa graph that clearlyshows that the media’s use of racial terms in its opinion and reportingskyrocketed around 2012. Goldberg points out that “wokeness”—what he defines as “sensibilities of highly educated and hyper liberal white professionals with elements of Black nationalism and academic critical race theory”—was present in our political discourse well before the BLM- and Antifa-led riots of the past year. As noted in his graphs, from 2011 to 2018, the use of the words “racist/racists/racism” increased inandThe Washington Postby about 700 percent and 1,000 percent, respectively. His conclusion is that the media was crafting a narrative that explained disparities in oursociety not due to talent or work ethic, or even the crony capitalists of Wall Street and the 1 percent, but bias—specifically racial bias. But was this reporting effective at reprogramming the left? Goldbergseems to thinkso: “Specifically, I find that the causal effects of race-related media coverage arestrongest for white Democrats and liberals, weaker for nonwhite Democrats and liberals, and are largely nonexistent for white Republicans and conservatives.”Whether it is left-leaning or right-leaning, populism is the enemy of the current American regime. By enlisting left-leaning populists in the fight against “whitesupremacy,” that regime has managed tostave off a two-front war—and, in fact, to pit one of its enemies against the other. Corporate powerssimply absorbed the left-leaning populist movement, pretending to lead it while launching an attack on right-wing populists in conjunction with the press and its government allies. The election of Donald Trump clearlyshook the American regime to its core. Populism, left- or right-leaning, never bodes well for the elites, but during the Trump era, left- and right-leaning populistsstartedsounding dangerously alike. The looming convergence posed the threat of asubstantial, effective, anti-elite political movement. How the media crafted a corporate-friendly narrative to diffuse and then redirect this anger is quite remarkable. The metamorphosis of Bernie Sanders in 2016 to his candidacy in 2020serves as an instructive casestudy. In 2015, Sandersattacked open borders as a Koch brothers proposal, essentially tying corporate interests in lowering wages and maximizing profit to increased illegal immigration. Sanders’ populist message was devoid of race or religion, focusing only on class. Yet using their control of the moral narrative in the politicalspace, the media and corporations reframed the fight for justice as one centered on race and oppression instead of populism and cronyism. The whole left, including its populist wing and the Bernie camp, wassubsumed into the race narrative. It was no longer about economic oppression or injustice; it was about oppression and injustice. The problem we faced was not rule by the elites but the enduring reign of whitesupremacy. What the average person doesn’t understand is that when the modern, post-1619 Project left refers to “whitesupremacy,” they don’t mean David Duke or Nathan Bedford Forrest. They mean the Founding Fathers and the nation that was born following the Revolution. Just as thesin of Adam was passed down to all of mankind,so too were thesins of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson passed down to all white Americans. Ironic, isn’t it, that thosesame left-leaning protesters who a few years ago were calling for the prosecution and incarceration of bankers were year calling for (and attempting) the removal of astatue of President Andrew Jackson? Called the first populist president by many historians, Jackson actually fought the bankers, whom he called a “brood of vipers.” It was hisstubborn resolve against Treasury Secretary Nicolas Biddle that ended the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, ensuring the absence of a central bank until the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1914. But Jackson’ssins against the Native Americans deny him any place in a new narrative focused on race. One of the great heroes of American populism becomes not just forgotten but demonized. Jackson gets a reckoning, and the bankers he condemned get offscot-free. Talk about misdirecting your enemies’ firepower.is a former Marine officer.

390,Joe Biden Shouldn't Shy Away From the Radicalism of the New Deal,-17.33,37.33,https://inthesetimes.com/article/joe-biden-shouldnt-shy-away-from-the-radicalism-of-the-new-deal,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"President Joe Bidenstruck an urgent note during his address to Congress on April28.​“We have to prove democracystill works,” hesaid.​“That our governmentstill works — and can deliver for the people.”To those familiar with the history of the New Deal, the echoes are clear. As was the case in1933, the United States finds itself at a crossroads. The Covid-19pandemic has killed nearly600,000Americans and widened what was already a chasmseparating the country’s rich from its poor. Meanwhile, the far right has entrenched itself in our politics, even with former President Donald Trump’s defeat in the2020election. Like Franklin Delano Roosevelt before him, Biden is betting on an ambitiousset of programs and reforms to restore faith in the American project before it’s too late. As historian Eric Rauchway argues in his new book,, embracing FDR’ssignature programs is not just a moral imperative — it’s good politics. The Civilian Conservation Corps, a version of which Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N. Y.) include in their Green New Deal proposal, offers a model to create well-paying jobs while addressing the existential threat of climate change. By thesame token, the Tennessee Valley Authority — which built the Wilson Dam and transformed the economy ofseven impoverishedstates — canserve as a blueprint to repair the country’s crumbling infrastructure. These measures would not only help address a pressing crisis, but — if recent polling of Biden’s American Jobs Plan is any indication — would be enormously popular with the American public. Over the phone, Rauchwayspoke with about the lessons of the New Deal and how it can be revised for modern-day America. He also explored the ways the New Deal reinforced and perpetuated the racism and misogyny of1930s America. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity. What did President Franklin Delano Roosevelt hope to achieve with the New Deal?The key thing to understand about the New Deal is that it was a response to a crisis of democracy. The Great Depression had broken the economy, and many representative governments both in the United States and elsewhere were not particularly responsive. With far-right movements on the rise around the world, people looked at Benito Mussolini andsaid,​“Well, that fella has the right idea.”Adolf Hitler came to power in January1933, right between Franklin D. Roosevelt’s election and his first inauguration. One of Roosevelt’s friends told him during that period,​“If yousucceed, you will be remembered as one of the best presidents of the United States; and if you fail, you will be remembered as one of the worst.” To which Roosevelt replied:​“If I fail, I will be the last.” He really did think that democracy was in direstraits, and with good reason. There were mass protests throughout the United States that were ideologically inchoate, and they could have very easily tilted toward the far right. Roosevelt feared those discontented with the government’s inaction could follow a leader like Huey Long, who was charismatic but unscrupulous and not particularly respectful of the rule of law, or perhaps a business-backed authoritarian like Douglas MacArthur, who would be installed to put down mass movements in the name of opposing Communism. In his acceptancespeech for the Democratic nomination in1932, Roosevelt argued the only way to defuse far-right threats was to offer a positive program of reconstruction. And that’s what the New Deal was — a program to restore people’s belief that democracy could work for them and broaden conceptions ofsocial justice. I would like our legislators tosee the New Deal as essentialsupport for democracy and the programs themselves as essentially humane. Roosevelt talked about the idea that people don’t just needsomething to live on; they needsomething to live for. That was the purpose of the New Deal. Some have called its programs​“socialist,” but Roosevelt didn’tsee them that way and neither did Norman Thomas, a Socialist Party leader in the1930s. What mattered was that they gave people asense of dignity and decency; they made people feel they were participating in asociety that was worth living in. If today’s policy proposals have asustainableset of goals and offer people a chance to lead decent lives, then they’re worthsupporting. Jamelle Bouie wrote about in theNew York Timesrecently, concluding that the New Deal can beseen as a third founding moment in the history of American democracy. Why do you think, as Bouie writes, that the United Statesstill hasn’t lived up to the New Deal’s promise of economic equality and opportunity?To put things bluntly, because it threatened people who have lots of money or power. The New Deal came about at a time when everythingseemed to be in crisis,so lots of people were willing tosupport dramatic changes in the existing political and economicsystem. Nosooner had it beensuccessful than folks in boardrooms and in banks began to worry that it might besuccessful. Even within the first100days of his presidency, Roosevelt had already begun to run up against resistance tosome of the things he wanted to do. But he and the New Dealers in the Democratic Party, along withsome liberal Republicans, managed toseize that moment and put through a number of policies that were effective and popular. Not only did the economy recover, but a lot of peopleshared in that recovery, which made the Democratic Party become more popular. Democrats gainedseats in the1934elections, and then Roosevelt won in a record landslide in1936. One of the groups that Roosevelt’s first term won over to the Democratic Party was Black voters, which has remained astaple of the Democratic coalitionsince.​“FDR’s legacy was not good for Black people”?I am going toside with the vast majority of Black voters who clearly believed FDR’s legacy was good for Black people. Theyseem to be a better judge of their own interests than James Clyburn. The Roosevelt administration represented a Democratic Party that was divided in the1930s between its white, Southern,segregationist wing and its Northern, multiracial and more labor-based wing. The New Deal marked the Democratic Party’sshift toward the latter, although it didn’t happen overnight. When New Deal programs were administered by the local Democratic Party in the South, they tended to perpetuatesegregation, perhaps unsurprisingly. A good example here is the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the Tennessee River Valley, which is the birthplace of the original Ku Klux Klan. You can derive what the racial politics of the region were from that observation alone. But while the TVA hadsegregated works, it also had Black workers and even Black managers. They expressed their frustrations within the TVA rather than attack it because they knew it was providing well-paying jobs under good conditions. What Clyburn’s remarks leave out is that when the New Deal was administered at the national level — for example, by Harry Hopkins at the Works Progress Administration (WPA) or Harold Ickes at the Public Works Administration (PWA) — both were committed to civil rights. Discrimination was not only against policy, but it eventually became illegal in public works. As the National Urban Leaguesaid at the time, the WPA offered the first meaningful white-collar opportunities to Black Americans. In many ways, it allowed them to move out of the South and into the urban parts of the North and the West.nreferred to him by his initials, JRB. Would yousay Biden and his administration have internalized the lessons of the New Deal?Biden has been involved in Democratic politics through a time generally referred to as the neo liberal period, when the Democratic Party has been highlyskeptical of the New Deal. This period really lasted until, I don’t know, last week? It wasn’t an overnightshift. People like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Left have been calling for Democrats to revive and improve on the New Deal, both as asource of inspiration and as a concreteset of programs. I think the Biden administration could have gone even farther than it did on the recentstimulus package. The package is far bigger than the one the Democrats passed in2008–2009and far more focused on Main Street than Wall Street, but it doesn’t get close to the New Deal. Describing payments as a​“stimulus” implies there’s nothing fundamentally unhealthy about the U. S. economy, that it just needs asolid jolt of caffeine tostart moving again. The focus of the New Deal wasn’t a Keynesian-stylestimulus; it was aimed at rebalancing thescales in the American economy and in Americansociety more generally.[The American Jobs Plan] that is now before Congress is much closer inspirit to the New Deal, especially with its broad conception of what infrastructure entails. If we have a program where wespend a lot of money to buildsolar panel arrays, wind farms, pumping facilities for endangeredshorelines and things like that, we’re talking about concrete achievements that can empower people. If the American Jobs Plan goes through, and it’s implemented in a way that is visibly effective, then I would besurprised if the Biden administration and the Democratic Party didn’t reap the benefits electorally. One of the great lessons of the New Deal is that good policy is good politics. It mayseem like an obvious thing tosay, but if the administration is effective and it helps people in ways they appreciate, then they tend tosupport the administration and its programming. Itshould be intuitive, but it’s not. In the age of austerity, politicians have told themselves,​“Let’s make our voterssuffer, and then they will appreciate how competent andserious we are.” The Roosevelt administration took the opposite view. As Harry Hopkins put it at the time,​“We willspend andspend, tax and tax, and elect and elect.” These types of programs, if they work and people appreciate that they work, tend to lead to lasting majorities.?We need to meet an ecological crisis now just as we did in1933. Intensive farming had used up a lot of the land in ways that had destroyed its utility, leading in part to the Dust Bowl. A large part of the New Deal was devoted to making agriculturesustainable through hydroelectric power, which we would now call green energy, but also throughsoil conservation. The United States adopted physical and chemical methods of farming that would allow the prairie to yield good crops andsustainable grazing areas for decades to come. As I point out in the book, the New Deal is one of the largest — if not the only —successful articulation of American patriotism that doesn’t involve going to war and killing people. That’s a resource that folks can draw on to try to mobilize people and give us pride in our ability to do constructive rather than destructive things. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has alsosaidshe would like the Green New Deal to rectifysome of theshortcomings of the original New Deal andspecifically addressstructural inequalities created by infrastructure projects of the past with an emphasis on racial justice. Civilian Climate Corps for Jobs and Justice Act of2021. How did FDR’s Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) work and what kind of potential would a new version hold?The original CCC was not only focused on conservation but on employing young men, precisely because they were understood to be the mostsusceptible to dangerous anti-social movements and behaviors. It was run by the War Department and was aimed at giving folks who might otherwise have been drawn to paramilitary movements a democratic, pacific thing to do instead. The CCC was not very big during the New Deal compared to the WPA, but it was immensely popular in large measure because of the kinds of work it did. It focusedspecifically on conservation projects that included reforestation and reclamation, irrigation and flood control. It did a tremendous amount of work in bothstate and national parks. The idea of getting the country’s youth into the wilderness and doing things for the common good hasstruck a chord with peoplesince the Great Depression,so I’m notsurprised they want to revive it, although I doubt it would be implemented in thesame way.: I’dsay that idea is lifted directly from the original New Deal. One of the things I tried to do with this book is integrate Native discussions about what was then called the​“Indian New Deal.” The Indian Emergency Conservation Work program wasspecifically thought of as an​“Indian CCC,” and it was quite large and effective in bringing material benefits to these nations in many cases. Perhaps the Roosevelt administration didn’t achieve its greatestsuccesses with the Indian New Deal, but it did reverse a policy of breaking up native lands and giving them away to individuals. It also restored the federal government’s commitment to Indiansovereignty. From the beginning, the Roosevelt administration contained a particularstrain of feminist politics, and not only because of Eleanor Roosevelt’s influence in the Roosevelt household. Frances Perkins, Roosevelt’ssecretary of labor, also became an integral figure in the implementation ofsocial welfare policies. But thosesocial welfare policies generally focused on preserving the normative idea of the family, with the male breadwinner at its head. They thought their top priority was giving men jobs, and that it would lead to assistance for their wives and children. Women were eligible forspecific employment under New Deal programs that included leading in-kind assistance and library programs, among otherstereotypically feminine jobs. There were women professionals and artists who were employed by divisions of the WPA, but most of this work was in construction, which was limited to men at the time. The New Deal reinforced and preserved the gender norms of the time, by and large.lective bargaining, and the National Labor Relations Act is one of his lasting legacies. Do you think legislation like thePRO Act, whichstrengthens collective bargaining rights, is necessary to implement an effective modern-day New Deal?During the ultimately failed effort to organize an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., President Biden gave astatement about how it’s up to the workers to decide whether they want to join a union — that it’s not up to him, and it’s not up to management. That is no more than astatement of the law that we now have in this country today, but it was greeted as a revolutionaryJoe Hillkind of thing — because merely affirming that we have union rights in law nowseems radical for a president of the United States. Itsuggests to me where we are as asociety. New Deal legacy laws are actually pretty good already. The problem is that we don’tstaff or adequately fund the agencies that aresupposed to enforce them.

391,Wyoming’s last contact tracers,0.0,47.33,https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-wyomings-last-contact-tracers,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,16,"In November, thestate of Wyoming announced that it had ceased calling the contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 to let them know they may have been exposed to the virus. Instead, i tasked Wyomingitesto do it themselves. Health officials fromsome counties and tribes have continued their own contact-tracing programs, however — and, with thestate’s resourcesstretched thin, that patchwork of local coverage remains key tosupporting Wyoming communities. Aboutsix weeks before the announcement, the number of COVID-19 cases in Wyoming began tospike. Thestatesaw just a few dozen new cases a day throughout thespring andsummer, but by late November, there were multiple days with more than 1,000 new cases. Surges in hospitalizations and deathssoon followed. With only around 130 public health workers available to make callsstatewide, thestate had to triage its efforts. It chose to focus on calling people who test positive, but it no longer attempted to notify their close contacts. As a result, groups like Teton County’s contact tracing team — comprising two dozen County Health Department employees and volunteers — are thestate’s remaining contact tracers. When the groupstarted contact tracing, in March, the caseload felt manageable. By late November, it had become overwhelming.“There is no break,”said Andi Gordon, Teton County’s COVID-19 lead case coordinator. But the team remains dedicated to trying to curb the virus’spread — and keep the community united. “We’re trying to hold onsostrongly to that personal touch. I want to keep calling people, because I think people really value that.”The Teton County Health Department held a drive-through testing event this May. 1,346 people were tested for COVID-19. As case loads have risen in the last two months, contact tracing efforts have dwindled. Ryan DorganOn the ground, contact tracers are making vital connections between local residents and community resources. Erin Engavo-Munnell, the COVID coordinator at Eastern Shoshone Tribal Health on the Wind River Reservation,said thatshe and her team are able to connect with their neighbors in a way people outside the area may not be able to. (Thestate has contracted with a company called Waller Hall to help with case investigations, but its employees largely call from outside Wyoming.) “All three of us who do contact tracing are enrolled members, and members of the local community — people are more likely to talk to us and give us information, and be more open,”said Engavo-Munnell. She also tells people aboutservices that can deliver food and cleaningsupplies to them while they’re in quarantine, whether they live on the reservation or not.“There wasn’t anyone to drive them. Who’s going to drive a COVID-positive person?”In Teton County, Gordon’s team isso well-connected that they frequently end up calling people they know. “It’s asmall community,”shesaid. “Wesay to the team, ‘If you think it’s going to facilitate the work, go for it, but if you think it’s going to complicate it, recuse yourself.’ It happens a lot.” The team has also facilitatedsome on-the-fly problemsolving. For instance, they realized that COVID-positive people often weren’t able to get home from the hospital. “There wasn’t anyone to drive them. Who’s going to drive a COVID-positive person?”said Gordon. Ultimately, local firefighters and EMTs pitched in, as did the police department, which usedsheriff’s vans with enclosed cabs to transport people. The team also enlisted the localsheriff’s office to help pick up and deliver prescriptions to quarantining residents. The borders between reservations and counties are permeable, however, and that can complicate the tasks thesesmall teams are doing to try to control thespread of COVID-19 in their communities. Sometimes,said Gordon, they’ll callsomeone only to discover they’ve already traveledsomewhere, if only as far as the next county. That means more potential exposures, and more calls for the team. The Wind River Reservation issurrounded by Fremont and Hot Springs counties,so people often end up traveling through it. In the initial weeks of the pandemic, while Fremont County clinics limited testing amidstaffing andsupplyshortages, the Wind River Reservation offered testing to any local residents, enrolled tribal members or not., other areas, inundated by new cases, have handed off all calls to thestate — which means only COVID-positive people are being contacted. Fremont County’s nurse manager, Becky Parkins, confirmed in mid-December that the county is no longer contact tracing. (She declined to answer further questions, noting thatshe was focused on facilitating the county’s imminent rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.) Without tracing, there are fewer opportunities tostop the chain of viral transmission; even though Wyomingites are asked to call their contacts, illness orstigma may prevent them from doingso. It also masks the extent of communityspread — and that can make peopleless concerned about the virus and less willing to take precautions. New casesstarted to decline in December, and Clay Van Houten, the Wyoming Department of Health’s infectious disease epidemiology unit manager,said that thestate will monitor COVID-19 numbers to determine whether it can resume contact tracing. “It will depend on what wesee over the next few weeks,” Van Houtensaid in mid-December. One option is to contact trace on a case-by-case basis to maximize resources. “If we can identify clear exposure for folks, or clear exposures for others to the case, then it makessense to do more intense contact tracing,” hesaid. Meanwhile, local contact tracers continue calling, and calling, and calling. “Whilesometimes it feels like we’re just drowning, at thesame time, I always want to keep in mind that every person we do get ahold of is one person we have been able to make a difference with,”said Janet Garland, Teton County Health Department’s nurse manager. “If we don’t get to everybody on the list today, they’ll be there tomorrow — and we’ve made a difference for those folks we got to today.”High Country Newsand an independent journalist who writes aboutscience,technology and the outdoors.

392,Jim Carrey Resigns From Joe Biden Duties at ‘Saturday Night Live’,-1.5,42.83,https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/jim-carrey-joe-biden-saturday-night-live-departure-1234867021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-19,21,"The nation has a president-elect. But who will play him on “Saturday Night Live” as he prepares to besworn into office?The question is open anew after actorJim Carreytook to Twitter Saturday to tell fans he was leaving behind the impression ofJoe Bidenhe has offered over the course of the firstsix episodes of theshow’s 46thseason. Carrey has not appeared insketches in “SNL’s” last two broadcasts, nor has Alec Baldwin, who has portrayed President Donald Trump for the past fourseasons and the early part of the current one.“Though my term was only meant to be 6 weeks, I was thrilled to be elected as your SNL President,” the actorsaid via Twitter. ” I would love to go forward knowing that Biden was the victor because I nailed thats–t. But I am just one in a long line of proud, fighting SNL Bidens!”Carrey’s announcement opens the part tosomeone else. While “Saturday Night Live” did not immediately offer insight as to who might pick up the impression, Carrey’s departure could allow a cast member to take over or give theshow a chance to find a different contributor. Former cast member Maya Rudolph has been playing Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in recent episodes. Playing the role of the U. S. president on “SNL” can be overwhelming. In press reports, Baldwin hassuggested he’s grappled withsome of the response his Trump impression hassparked. Chevy Chase isstill remembered for playing a clumsy,stumbling President Gerald Ford in theshow’s earliest days, and Dana Carvey’s impression of President George H. W. Bush was recognized by the Commander-in-Chief himself. Others have played Biden in the past. Former cast member Jason Sudeikis for many years offered a version of Biden whose brio often overtook an ability tostay on message. Woody Harrelson played Biden during a hostingstint on “SNL” in 2019, and returned to play him once again. John Mulaney played him lastseason. The first “SNL” cast member to portray Biden was Kevin Nealon, who provided an impression in 1991, when theshow lampooned the U. S. Senate’s confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas’ nomination the Supreme Court. Carrey’s portrayal took “SNL” to new places. Openingsketches featuring Carrey as Biden were longer and more involved than usual — one was more than 13 minutes in length — and often featured Carrey tangling with Baldwin’s Trump; being assisted by Rudolph’s Harris; or accompanied by Heidi Gardner’s Dr. Jill Biden. In one of these “cold opens,” the ersatz former Vice President transformed himself into a fly and traveled to the national debate between Senator Harris and current Vice President Mike Pence. In the process, Carrey went from imitating Biden to aping actor Jeff Goldblum, who had thestarring role as an eccentricscientist in the 1986 film, “The Fly.” In another broadcast, Carrey’s Biden used a remote control device to turn off Baldwin’s President Trump and give the nation a moment of peace. “Isn’t thatsatisfying?” Carrey’s politician asked.“SNL” viewers will no doubt be eager tosee who might play Biden for the next period of time. Given Carrey’s resignation, it’s certainly possible a new impersonator could be revealedsoon. The next broadcast of “SNL” appears tonight onNBCat 11:30 p.m. eastern.",1,1,Variety

S. presidential election has reinvigorated conversations regarding Europe’s efforts to rebuild its own defense capabilities – no matter who occupies the White House. Recent commitments to invest in pan-European defensesolutions are becoming more urgent, and observers are looking for proof that these proposed joint programs are truly coming to life. One effort being held up to the microscope is mainland Europe’s program to field a next-generation fighter aircraft and weapon program by 2040. TheFuture Combat Air System, or FCAS, includes asixth-generation fighter jet, multiple “remote carrier” drones, a next-generation weaponsystem, a brand new jet engine, advancedsensors andstealth technologies, and an “air combat cloud.” Airbus and Dassault Aviationserve as lead contractors for the program, representing Germany and France, respectively. Indra leads Spain’s industry participation. FCAS is among multiple pan-European defense programs that have emerged amid four years of a U. S. presidency under Donald Trump. Since 2016, Trump has questioned the ongoing relevancy of trans-Atlantic efforts, including NATO, and called on European allies tospend more on their collective defense. As of Friday morning, votes continued to be tallied to determine the next leader of the United States. On the eve of the election, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warned in an op-ed published by Politico that the “illusions of Europeanstrategic autonomy must come to an end.”While the minister emphasized that policymakers in Germany and Europe must continue to ramp up their military capabilities,she also urged the continent to acknowledge that “for the foreseeable future, we will remain dependent” upon U. S.security cooperation. Other U. S.-European policy observers wrote onsocial media this week that the chaotic process of the presidential electionshould be a wakeup call for Europe to maintain a laser focus on its ownstrategic destiny. Asked whether the U. S. election may complicate Europe’s motivation to build joint military capabilities, Joel Barre, director of the French procurement office Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) recently told reporters that the Franco-German cooperation on FCAS and other programs would remain “anchored.”The next five years will be crucial for the program to prove itself, analysts and nationstakeholders agreed. The partners involved are moving quickly through the effort’s initialstages,said Bruno Fichefeux, FCAS leader for Airbus, in an interview. Since the program’s inception in 2017, the industry team is now 19 companies wide and has invested over 200 million euros into the ongoing Joint Concept Study phase, along withsigned technology demonstrator contracts, he noted.“It’s asign of astrong motivation by all partners to make it happen,” hesaid. The results of the Joint Concept Study, launched in 2019, are expected to be revealed insummer 2021, the French defense ministry told Defense News. Meanwhile, the teams are working in parallel on Phase 1A of the demonstrator portion, launched this past February andscheduled to run for 18 months. Theinitial demonstrators for the next-generation fighter and remote carrier drones are expected by 2026, while the advanced combat cloud may be introduced a year earlier, asource close to the program told Defense News. The full development program is currentlyslated to begin around 2027. While all of the FCAS componentsshould enterservice in 2040 – to replace the partner nations' fleets of Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon fighters – certain capabilities may come onlinesooner. For example,some first-generation remote carrier drones may be available in the early 2030s to upgrade existing Eurofighter jets, thesourcesaid. Several key decisions remain to be made. Thestakeholders have not yet established a date when they willsolidify the fighter jet and remote carrier designs, according to Fichefeux. The question of workshare division also remains in flux. “You have to base the workshare on the typical criteria – who has theskills, who has the knowledge, who has the technology, who is the best player to ensure that we can move forward on this technology without duplicating it – while ensuring a level of cooperation. And this is what the nations are expecting of us,” hesaid. “It’s not a competition program. It’s a cooperation program.”Programs like FCAS will position Europe’s defense companies to remain competitive in the global market, analystssaid. The complex effort to build a “system ofsystems” involving multiple components and cutting-edge technical fields, has no equivalent in the history of arms cooperation programs in Europe,said Hélène Masson, asenior research fellow at the Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique, a French independent think tank. There is pressure to ensure that European industrial players maintain and enhance their technological prowess, and to compete against their American, Asian and Russian counterparts,she told Defense News. Thesuccess of FCAS will depend on the quality of the Joint Concept Study and demonstrator phases, with the goal of reducing technological risks “and therefore limit delays and possible additional costs,” Massonsaid. The program needs tostartshowing that it has a “degree of momentum,”said Sash Tusa, an aerospace and defense partner at Agency Partners, a London-based independent research firm.“It’s important to focus on three key data points: one, when is the demonstrator going to fly; two, when is the prototype going to be flying; three, when is the in-service date,” he told Defense News. “Those are the three absolutely cast-in-stone dates, and assoon as theystart moving, that tells yousomething about the program.”FCAS couldstillsuffer from its “deeply political nature,” Tusa noted. Previous efforts to build a Franco-German fighter jet have devolved intoseparate programs amid disputes over workshare. The program could be a “litmus test” for France to prove that it is committed to a joint European weapons program this time around,said Dan Darling, asenior analyst for Forecast International, a U. S. market intelligence firm. With Spain joining FCAS nearly three years into the program, questionsstill remain regarding workshare among the partner nations. Indra, Madrid’s industry lead, did not respond to requests for comment by this article’s publication. But even if its workshare portion issmaller than that of Paris and Berlin, the research and development efforts that Spain will be privy to as part of FCASserve as an opportunity that the nation “didn’t want to pass up,” Darlingsaid. Some watchers remainskeptical that this joint fighter jet effort willsucceed where previous endeavors have failed. “It’s important to remember that it would take aserious breakthrough in Franco-German defense politics to change thestatus quo,”said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group, a U. S.-based market analysis firm. But the current geopolitical pressures on Europeserve as powerful incentives for the program tosucceed, Fichefeux noted.“The complexity of [FCAS] requires nations to put theirstrengths together, not only in terms of funding, but also in terms of industrial capacity and technologies,” hesaid. “This trend towardssovereignty ... really favorssuch a program as FCAS.”“The geopoliticalsituation that we are facing reminds us every day that we need to have our own capabilities, and need to be able to operate in the future theaters within asovereign manner,” he continued.

395,How Trump could factor into legal defenses of North Texans accused of threats and storming Capitol,-0.33,40.67,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2021/01/31/how-trump-could-factor-into-legal-defenses-of-north-texans-accused-of-threats-and-storming-capitol/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-31,25,"They were just following the instructions of their president. They had become “radicalized” by Donald Trump’sspeeches as well as the hyper charged language of his cult like following onsocial media. Those are the legal arguments that are expected to be advanced bysome North Texans along with dozens of others accused of taking part in the Jan. 6 riot at the U. S. Capitol in Washington D. C. that left five dead. Dozens of arrests have been made across the nation. The pro-Trump mob included known extremists as well as ordinary peopleseemingly caught up in the moment. Most of those charged have either documented their involvement onsocial media or were identified in photos and video, making it challenging for their attorneys to mount a defense. Luis A. Reyes, a former federal prosecutor who’s heldsenior positions at the White House and in the Justice Department,said the government doesn’t always have video and photographic evidence in criminal cases. Read the crime and publicsafety news your neighbors are talking about. Or with:Bysigning up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy“So the defense has tostart getting a little creative,”said Reyes, a lawyer for the Ashcroft firm in Austin. A common theme to emerge fromseveral North Texas detention hearings over the past two weeks is that many of the alleged intruders at the Capitol were following the instructions of Trump, who held a rally thesame day in which he claimed the election wasstolen. The “public authority” defense has already been hinted at bysome defense lawyers as an option. One lawyer — for an Arizona man known as QAnon Shaman — hassaid Trump bears responsibility for what happened. But the bar is high and it’s considered a longshot, legal expertssay. Most of the accused will probably enter pleas and hope for leniency, as long as they don’t face the moreserious charge ofseditious conspiracy, according to experts. Other approaches might include a First Amendment defense — that they were exercising their right to free assembly; whilesome might use the opportunity of a public trial to highlight their convictions or attempt tosway jurors with appeals to theirsense of patriotism and justice. But defense lawyerssay many alleged rioters could use the “Trump defense” andsimilar arguments not toseek acquittal but as a mitigating factor during thesentencing phase. This public authority defense,sometimes used by police informants, makes the argument thatsomeone in authority approved orsanctioned the conduct in question. Jennifer Ryan, a Frisco real estate broker whose intrusion into the Capitol was captured in photos, for example,said the president asked hissupporters to be there, andshe “answered the call” becauseshe believes that the November election was rigged.“We were going insolidarity with President Trump,”said Ryan, 50. “President Trump requested that we be in D. C. on the 6th. So this was our way of going andstopping thesteal.”She wrote in astatement thatshe didn’t condone the violence that occurred and was “heartbroken” for those who died. Dallas resident Troy Smockssaid he went to Washington at Trump’s invitation, the FBIsays. Smocks believes all citizens have a duty to rise up and defend the nation if the president calls for it, an FBI agentsaid during testimony. Smocks’ attorney hassaid that the government usedsnippets from his online posts that were taken out of context and that his client had no intent to threaten anyspecific people. Reyessaid the public authority defense can be challenging because it comes with a reasonableness test. The question is, would a reasonable person think it’s really OK tostorm the Capitol becausesomeone in authority directed it — even when police were trying tostop it?Derek Staub, a Dallas defense lawyer who practices in federal court,said that defense “typically never goes anywhere” unless the defendant has asigned cooperation agreement with a government agency. Family members of other local defendants havesaid their loved ones had become increasingly radical in their politics and that their personalities completely changed. The QAnon conspiracy theory, often likened to a cult, has been blamed forsome of the more extremist views held by Trumpsupporters. Garret Miller’s brother, Jason Miller, told a Dallas federal judge recently that the 34-year-old Richardson college graduate had transformed from a regular person uninterested in politics into a true believer in a larger cause after beingsucked into a “cult” of Donald Trump. He blamed thesocial media “feedback loop” that has radicalized many ordinary Americans, leading them to believe, falsely, that the November election wasstolen. Miller’s attorney, Clint Broden,said there is no evidence that his client harmed anyone or acted violently while on the Capitol grounds. Brokensaid in astatement that Miller is “prepared to testify” at any congressional proceeding. Trump has already been impeached for asecond time, for inciting the mob to descend on the Capitol, and Democrats are currently trying to convict him in the Senate. Family and friends of Larry Brock toldThe New Yorkerthat the retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and Grapevine resident had become increasingly extreme and radical in his political beliefs in recent years. Brock was captured in photos and in video walking around inside the Senate chamber with zip ties during the Jan. 6 uprising. His federal public defendersaid in court that his client is charged with misdemeanors and isn’t accused of hurting anyone. And the teenageson of accused rioter Guy Reffitt, an oil rig worker from Wylie, hassaid his father became increasingly aligned with “far-right extremists” online. He blamed Trump for pushing his father to the far right andsaid he couldn’t recognize him anymore. Reffitt’s wifesaid he never entered the Capitol or harmed anyone. His attorney declined to comment. The families of accused Islamic terrorists also described loved ones as being brainwashed or radicalized, butsuch claims did not become legal defenses in federal courts. Relatives and friends of Richard Reid, known as the “Shoe Bomber,” and John Walker Lindh, the “American Taliban,” insisted the men were brainwashed by al-Qaeda. And the brother of Zacarias Moussaoui, who helped plan the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U. S.,said the French citizen had fallen prey to an “extremist brainwashing cult.”Both men ended up pleading guilty. Most famously, the brainwashing defense was used — and failed — during the 1976 bank robbery trial of heiress Patty Hearst, who was kidnapped by an armed revolutionary group called the Symbionese Liberation Army. Reyessaid lawyers who wish to make a case for brainwashing or political radicalization would have to demonstrate that their clients have astrong enough mental disability to prevent them from knowing right from wrong. Destroying evidence, assome of the rioters are accused of doing, would be one way toshow the person understands the distinction, he added.“That is a hard burden to prove,” Reyessaid, “and it’s almost akin to an insanity defense.”Mark Reichel, an attorney in Sacramento, Calif.,said an argument for brainwashing could be made insome cases by claiming that members of the pro-Trump mob thatstormed the Capitol were repeatedly “provided masssuggestions of fraud and criminal theft of the election.”Hesaid many of these cases involve a combination of “masssuggestion,” the “repetition of the message,” and thestar qualities of a president who is a cultural celebrity in addition to being commander in chief. Combined, these factors could overly burden an “already unsteady mind,” hesaid. Such a defense might have a better chance in a trial before a judge rather than a jury, particularly if the judge is a Trump appointee, Reichel added. It could also be reserved forsentencing to try to lessen the punishment, hesaid. But Chris Jenks, an SMU law professor,said the claim that an alleged wrongdoer was just following orders hasn’t worked “since the Nazis tried it at Nuremberg.” And trying to blame it on the cult of QAnon also is astretch, he added.“Anyone who completed junior high and managed to find their way to D. C. at the right time and place is going to have a tough time raising competency” as a defense, Jenkssaid. Hesaid federal criminal law also recognizes the excuse of duress, but that Trump “didn’t threaten the protesters with violence.”Reyessaid he thinks most of the federal cases related to thestorming of the Capitol will end with plea bargains, especially the lessserious ones involving trespass. Some of the more prominent defendants, however, will probably be made examples of by the government tosend the message that “this is not OK,” hesaid. A few might resist their lawyers’ advice,saying, “No, I want to tell the world why I was there,’” Reyessaid.“If a defendant wants a trial, he will get a trial,” hesaid. Others may attempt to “cloak themselves in the First Amendment” by arguing that their freedom of expression and assembly was infringed upon, Reyessaid. This is, as Reyes put it, the claim that “what I’m being prosecuted for is my viewpoint and my right to free assembly.”Juries can be unpredictable. The Bundys, a family of ranchers with extremist militiasupport, were acquitted more than once by federal juries for charges related to their armed takeovers of federal land andstandoffs with law enforcement. Those juries, however, were in Oregon and Nevada. Brian Poe, a former federal prosecutor in Fort Worth,said outcomes are likely to be different in the insurrection-related cases that are charged in Washington.“Given the political climate in D. C., I’m notsure the jurors in that venue will acceptsuch a defense,” hesaid.",1,2,Dallas Morning News

According to a White House official, any buyer's identity will be keptsecret by the gallery owner. However, buyers may choose to make their identities known. Anothersource familiar with thesales arrangement told CBS News that the New York gallery owner who isshowing Hunter Biden's paintings, George Bergès, will have the ability to reject offers that raise alarms. Potential conflicts could include offers above the asking price from buyersseeking political influence with the Biden family. Bergès estimates that Hunter Biden'sworkcould fetch between $75,000 and $500,000 per painting, according to aspokesperson for the gallery. According toArtnet, Biden has no formal artistic training and has only begun working as an artist full time in recent years. Art prices aresubjective and vary considerably, and paintings by celebrity artists can be overvalued. The decision to reject offers above market value, against Bergès financial interest, will be left to him. Andsince the buyer's identity isshielded, only Bergès, not the public, will be able toscrutinize the transaction. Bergès will be compensated forselling the paintings, CBS News confirmed with his gallery'sspokesperson. He will retain a percentage from thesales comparable to the arrangements his gallery has with other artists, though thespokesperson declined to provide the exact percentage. Typically, galleries take around 50% of asale. Asecond White House official told CBS News on Friday the potential $500,000 price tag ""shocked""some White House officials when the detail was first reported by Artnet and then by theWashington Poston Thursday. It is not clear the White House could legallystop Hunter Biden, a private citizen, from profiting on his art. The White House expressedsatisfaction with the arrangement that is being implemented.""After careful consideration, asystem has been established to allow Hunter Biden to work in his profession within reasonablesafeguards,"" White House presssecretary Jen Psakisaid Friday.

398,The Trump Presidency and What Happens After: A Catholic Take,1.67,36.0,https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/the-trump-presidency-and-what-happens-after-a-catholic-take,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,16,"As Donald Trump exits the nationalstage, it’s a good time for Catholics to reflect on what factors gave rise to his unique presidency and to assess how to respond to his conflicted legacy. The rise of Donald Trump is unintelligible apart from the larger forces that have reshaped our politicssince the end of the Reagan administration, forces associated with the passing away of the post-World War II order that defined political life across the West. For nearly half a century, politics was dominated by centrist parties competing for centrist voters over who could best manage economic growth and the Cold War. The collapse of Soviet communism and large-scale changes brought about by increased automation, globalization and financialization of the economy broke that mold. As Gerald Seib recently noted inTheWall Street Journal, one cansee harbingers of Trumpism in the losing presidential campaigns of both Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot. Buchanan, himself a Catholic, is a particularly interesting figure,since, having earlier been aspeech writer for Richard Nixon, heserved as an aid to Ronald Reagan before challenging Reagan’s vice president andsuccessor, George H. W. Bush, in a 1992 campaign thatstressed the costs of deindustrialization, global trade and military over-commitment. Buchanan pointed to thestruggles of working-class Americans increasingly unable to achievestable middle-class economicstatus in the world of rapidly changing, high tech-driven, and globally interconnected labor and capital markets. Automation and competition with foreign workers, as well as immigrants, wereseen by these workers as driving down wages andshrinking the number of available jobs. Both Democrats and Republicansstillseemed to agree on the virtues of free trade and globalization in the 1990s; only in the wake of the Great Recession of 2007-2008 did radical critics from both left and right emerge to challenge the mainstream, most dramatically in the form of the Occupy Wall Street and Tea Party movements, followed by the insurgent presidential candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Understanding Trump, however, requires notingsomething else about the collapse of the post-war order: the concomitantshift in mainstream views about morality and culture. This, too, followed a long process of development. Here, the harbinger of change was already visible in the late-1960s with the emergence of the “newsocial movements” associated with ecology, women’s equality, the rights of racial minorities andsexual liberation. In many cases, these movements were responses to real injustices that demanded correction. However, they are related to two other factors that have worked to challenge the viability of the traditional political parties and to alienate, in particular, Christian voters from political elites. First, these movements manifested and further drove a turn in politics from issues of economic welfare to those of identity. Politicalscientist Ronald Inglehartand his collaborators have gathered decades worth of data toshow a large-scaleshift in politics across the West from what they call “survival values” associated mainly with material well-being and emphasizingself-discipline andsolidarity to “self-expression values,” which emphasize autonomy, creativity and identity, enabled by the growing material prosperity in thesesocietiessince the Second World War and correlated with a loss of both a broadersense of national identity and — here is thesecond factor — religious faith. The result of this issecularization and identity-driven politics, twin phenomena that lead to a public life that is more fractious and lesssubject to compromise, but also invested with a pseudo-religioussignificance. Politics becomes both more ultimate and more dysfunctional. The ruling classes of Westernsocieties have internalized all this, but those who live outside the great metropolitan concentrations of wealth, privilege and influence, and who have paid a disproportionateshare of the price of these processes in a loss ofstability, community and respect, have, as one might have expected, reacted against it. They and their communities have been left behind, as documented in one way by George Packer and in another by Timothy Carney, and, in their alienation, were ready for the message ofsomeone like Donald Trump, with his promise to “make America great again,” a reaffirmation of distinctly national identity and of associated traditional values, values that have come to be identified with life in rural America and the white working class. Evangelical Protestants and Catholics are importantsegments of this population, with Catholics, in particular, concentrated inswingstates. Many of the concerns of these Americans resonate with Catholicsocial teaching; for example, the role of work in understanding and promoting human dignity; the centrality of family and community; the importance not just of a healthy natural environment, but of a healthy moral andspiritual one; and a concern that the common good of our political community not be lost in more abstract concerns for the global common good, real though they are. They are also more likely to oppose abortion and to favorstrong protections for religious freedom. On those last two issues, Trump madespecific commitments and largely kept them. With other aspects of Catholicsocial teaching, there wereserious differences, especially the Trump administration’s regrettable enthusiasm for the death penalty and prosecution — intentional, we now know, thanks to theJustice Department’s inspector general— of ashockingly callous and destructive policy of familyseparation against illegal immigrants at thesouthern border. While the terms “populism” and “nationalism” have often been used to describe the movement led by Trump, these abstractions are of little help in understanding the concerns of real people. That their interests be considered as part of the common good, and that national identity remains a valuable force for unity in political communities, a unity necessary to underwritesacrifices undertaken bysome for the benefit of others whom they do not know, and which are essential for political life, are truths not to be easily dismissed. When they are dismissed by the people in charge, others will assert them, and likely without the intellectual or moral depth that they require in order toserve as reasons for policy and practice. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agendaseemed to present possibilities distinct from the traditional positions of the post-war Republican Party and the aggressive identity politics andsecularism of the contemporary Democratic Party: an unabashed affirmation of pride in U. S. history and accomplishments; an alignment of immigration policy more closely with U. S. national interest; attention to the problems of rural and Rust Belt areas, especially by infrastructure and industrial policies meant to recover middle-class jobs; and commitment to the protection of unborn life and religious liberty. Catholics constituted a crucial component of a coalitionsupportive ofsuch priorities. These concerns, however, have not had the expression they deserve and expected in Trump’s presidency. His conduct in office has been, notwithstandingsomespecific exceptions, too often uninformed,superficial andshambolic. Assisted byspeech writers and teleprompters, and in moments ofself-discipline, he couldsay things that needed to besaid. But much of the time what was most important was drowned out by his habitual coarseness and indifference to both facts and values. Even when he did commit to the right things, execution was clumsy and often ineffective, as in the cases of immigration, the trade war with China, and much foreign policy. The real problem, however, manifested repeatedly in word and deed, was that Trump’s main interestsseemed not to be those of the people whose champion he claimed to be and who put him in office. His basic outlook is, in a word, primitive, centered on himself, his immediate family, and his useful friends. He took to people based on appearances, transactions and, ultimately, personal loyalty, as distinct from intelligence, competence or character, and this led him to tolerate and even encourage dangerous extremists among hissupporters. His mode of government was prepolitical or patrimonial, in that he looked on the institutions of government as property that he had acquired and on public officials, elected or appointed, as his employees or retainers — with the exception of those who weresimply his enemies. In the end, for Trump, there are only winners and losers, and his inability to makesense of himself as anything other than a winnersurely encouraged the violence of Jan. 6. The appalling events of that day as well as the violence and disorder of this pastsummer are a warning about thesort of future we can expect if the present polarization is not moderated by a renewed commitment to a common political destiny. Our Catholic tradition tells us that politics is an enterprise grounded in reason andself-restraint deployed for thesake of a common good, the flourishing of all of us. Moreover, Catholicsocial teaching fits with a focus on priorities that wouldseem conducive to the promotion of a centrist politics that combines a commitment to the welfare of the poor and the working class, an immigration policy that is both reasonable and humane and fidelity to the Constitution’s protection of religious freedom as good in itself and as the foremost guarantee of a free and vigorous civilsociety, as well as advancing the protection of all human life. The exit of Donald Trump from thescene can be an occasion for Catholics to give witness, by word and deed, to the enduring truths contained in our tradition but intended for all men and women of goodwill. Our republic needs them more than ever. V.

399,Who are the out-of-state billionaires backing ranked-choice voting in Massachusetts?,-5.0,47.33,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/25/metro/who-are-out-of-state-billionaires-backing-ranked-choice-voting-massachusetts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-25,25,"In April of last year, John Arnold warned in a Houston Chronicle op-ed that democracy at the local level was in “crisis.” A former energy hedge fund manager and Enron trader turned philanthropist, Arnold argued that a ranked-choice votingsystem, in place of runoff or two-round elections, could helpspur more competition and, perhaps, voter interest.“Houston,” the billionaire wrote of his hometown, “should aim to lead the way in bringing it to Texas.”Eighteen months later, it’s voters in Massachusetts and Alaska — not Texas — weighing whether to push into a new frontier of voting this November. It’s alsostill Arnold helping drive the case for why theyshould. AdvertisementArnold and his wife, Laura, are among a network of wealthy out-of-state donors helping fuel ranked-choice voting ballot initiatives in Massachusetts and beyond, byseeding local committees with millions of dollars and, in the Arnolds’ case, buttressing research on thesystem’s potential impact. Through their Action Now Initiative, the Arnolds have committed nearly $3.4 million insupport of the Massachusetts ballot proposal, known as Question 2. Kathryn Murdoch, the daughter-in-law of Rupert Murdoch, has personally given $2.5 millionsince early September. The Denver-based nonpartisan group Unite America, whichshe co-chairs and hasseeded with millions towardsupporting democratic reforms, has contributed $445,000. Neither the Arnolds nor Murdoch agreed to interview requestssent through the respective organizations they lead, which instead offered on-the-recordstatements. In all, of the $9.8 million the Yes on 2 committee has raised, just 19 donors — 12 of whom hail from outside Massachusetts — gave a combined $9.2 million. Donors outside thestate make up 84 percent of all the cash it has reportedly collected. It’s asimilarstory elsewhere. In Alaska, where voters are weighing athree-pronged initiative, including using ranked-choice voting in general elections, the Arnolds and Unite America have given a combined $4.6 million, the vast majority of what Alaskans for Better Elections has raised. AdvertisementThe Arnolds also put more than $1 million behind twoseparate, andsuccessful, ranked-choice voting efforts in Maine, as well as$1 million mo rein thesuccessful effort last year to adopt it in New York City, making Action Now Initiative its leading donor. That financial heft underscores the intense interest, and faith, that national advocatessay they have in thesystem, as well as the role thatstates, including Massachusetts, could play as a bellwether in its adoption on a widerscale. Fewer than 20 cities or counties currently use ranked-choice voting, and Maine is the onlystate where it is deployed forstatewide and federal races.“We’re a very important bell cow,”said Michael Porter, a Harvard University professor, Brookline resident, and, with $450,000 in donations, Yes on 2′s biggest in-state contributor. “I think Massachusetts will be one of the next rounds ofstates that areserious and are putting this measure in place because we believe that political innovation has to happen in America.”But thespigot of out-of-state funding has also drawnskepticism from ranked-voice voting’s critics, who have used the heavy reliance on national cash as a key plank in their opposition tosomething that would have a profound effect on Massachusetts elections. It remains to beseen whether thatsways voters’ feelings forth e ballot question, which has run even or ahead inscant public polling. Advertisement“Money flows around the politicalsystem all the time. This thing will either win or lose on thestrength or weakness of the arguments, and whether, more broadly, people view it as asolution to a problem that exists,”said Jack Santucci, an assistant teaching professor at Drexel University who has researched ranked-choice voting. “You can’t create demand for thisstuff. And you can’t purchase demand for it.”As proposed inQuestion 2 on Massachusetts' ballot, ranked-choice elections would give voters the option of ranking candidates for an office in order of preference. If a candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-choice votes, he orshe isth e winner. But if no one does, the candidate with the fewest votes isstripped away and those voters are reallocated to the remaining candidates based on theirsecond choice. The process goes for as many rounds as it takes for one candidate to earn a majority of votes. If approved, the newsystem would be used for primary and general elections forstatewide offices — governor, attorney general, and more — as well as congressional,state legislative, and district attorney officesstarting in 2022. It would not apply to presidential elections or municipal elections. The Arnolds’ group beganseedingsuch efforts beginning in Maine,struck by what it has described as paralysis in lawmaking and frustration with thestatus quo. Sam Mar, a vice president at Arnold Ventures,said that in Massachusetts and elsewhere, the Arnolds donated money because there already was a base of localsupport and volunteers behind the ranked-choice initiatives. Advertisement“Ultimately we’re all part of this country, and weshould all be pitching in to help votersstrengthen our democracy, regardless of where we live,” Marsaid. That has included pumping money into political reform research, including$500,000to the think tank New America. (Santucci, the Drexel professor, is among the researchers who have a contract with New America, under which he isstudying whether ranked-choice voting promotes more women and people of color to run.)The Arnolds also aren’tstrangers to Massachusetts’ political landscape. In 2016, John Arnold gave $250,000 to an unsuccessful effort to lift the cap on charterschools in Massachusetts, and they poured more than$500,000 into a PACthat helped bolster Governor Charlie Baker’s reelection in 2018. Last year, Patients For Affordable Drugs Now, a bipartisan political group that the couple has funded, put hundreds of thousands of dollars into an ad campaign backing a Baker proposal to control prescription drug costs. Those helping lead the ranked-choice ballot initiative argue that despite the out-of-state help, the push is rooted in localsupport. Evan Falchuk, Yes on 2′s chairman,said he first joined the effort in 2017, and the ballot question has the backing of prominent Massachusetts officials, from former governors Deval Patrick and William F. Weld to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey, among others. AdvertisementPlus, the committee directlysolicited the out-of-state financial help,saidMike Zarren, the assistant general manager of the Boston Celtics and a Yes on 2 board member.“We reached out to a bunch of democracy activists. They all didn’t find us,” Zarrensaid, arguing that the outside donors have no financial incentive tosee ranked-choice voting pass. “If you care about this nationally, yousort of have to do itstate bystate.“Still, the zip code of the donors has provided a consistent rallying cry for its opponents.“Why are theyso interested in Massachusetts votingsystem?”said Anthony Amore, a former Republican candidate forsecretary ofstate who has acted as an informal volunteerspokesman for the committee opposed to Question 2. Asked what he believes the motivation is, Amoresaid he is hesitant tospeculate.“Itshould give people pause, as itshould for any political candidate or ballot initiative, of who is funding it,” hesaid. Some Democrats, too, have preached wariness. Kevin Connor, an aide tostate Senator Harriette L. Chandler, warned in aCommonwealth Magazineop-ed that Murdoch’s endorsement of ranked-choice voting as a way to help alleviate extreme partisanship “erases the impact of progressive champions like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley.”He added that “for Massachusetts progressives fighting thestatus quo, a voting regime that drags election results to the centershould be viewed withskepticism — especially when moneyed interests aresosupportive.”Nick Troiano, the executive director of Unite America, which Murdoch co-chairs,said in astatement that it is backing ranked-choice in Massachusetts because it can give voters “more power in their elections and more choice on their ballot.”The narrative isn’t limited to Massachusetts. In right-leaning Alaska, thestate Republican Party, as well as groupssuch as Planned Parenthood, oppose the ballot measure there, which also would createso-called open, or nonpartisan, primaries. Alaskans, known for their libertarian and independentstreak, often bristle at thespecter of outside influences,said Alex Hirsch, an associate professor of politicalscience at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.“If outside money gets identified as an influential force,” Hirschsaid, “that often backfires.”Correction: Because of a reporting error, an earlier version of thisstory incorrectly identified John and Laura Arnold’s connection to Patients For Affordable Drugs Now.

401,JPK III didn’t demolish the Kennedy dynasty — it faded long ago,-5.67,37.67,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/03/opinion/jpk-iii-didnt-demolish-kennedy-dynasty-it-faded-long-ago/?p1=HP_Feed_ContentQuery,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"At the risk of raining on the political world’s national narrative parade, Joseph P. Kennedy III didn’t take the glittering Kennedy dynasty out for an ill-advised joyride and wrap it around a tree. Yes, he waged an entitled and impatient Senate primary challenge to a more accomplished incumbent, Ed Markey— and got his clock cleaned. But the notionso prevalent nationally that in doingso hesomehow totaled a family dynasty issilly. The Kennedys haven’t been a dynasty for decades. Wipe the mystique from your glasses and thatsupposedly gleaming Kennedy juggernaut is actually a rusted 1960s Studebakersinking into an overgrown field behind the barn. AdvertisementBut wait, doesn’t JPK III’s defeat mark the first time a Kennedy has lost an election in Massachusetts? Yes, but that oft-repeated cable TV formulation obscures more than it reveals, making itseem as though thisstate has been under aspell that lasted from John F. Kennedy’sfirst congressional run, in 1946, through to this week. Um, no. To the degree that there was a Kennedy dynasty, it faltered in 1980, when Ted Kennedy lost his presidential primary bid to incumbent Jimmy Carter, and faded to impotence in the mid-1990s and early 2000s. (That’s not tosay that Ted Kennedy didn’t become a legendarysenator after his failed national bid, but onesenator, no matter how formidable, does not a political dynasty make.)Ted himself got an all-political-hands-on-deckscare in 1994, when Mitt Romney, then in his liberal Republican incarnation, took him on in a race that was a dead heat two months before election day. Ultimately, Kennedy posted asolid win, one that reflected his value to thestate. Still, he pulled decisively ahead only afterstrafing Romney with an enfilade of negative TV ads. AdvertisementAfter years of playing Hamlet, Joseph P. Kennedy II, then a congressman, launched a 1998-cycle campaign for governor, but whenseveral controversies cast him in an imperious and unflattering light, he abandoned that quest. Younger brother Max, uncle to JPK III, explored a run for the House in 2001, to fill the South Boston-South ShoreseatJoe Moakleyhad held but, after a few public appearances revealed him to be lighter than a dandelionseed, he floated off in a different direction. In a proper accounting, then, JPK III’s ill-fatedsenatorial quest is really the third failed Kennedy candidacy or quasi-candidacy in Massachusetts alone. Which puts things in proper perspective: Yes, Boston is home to theJohn F. Kennedy Library, where it’s always Inauguration Day 1961, but for most of Massachusetts, the notion of the Kennedy family as a dynastic force faded long ago. Norshould it come as anyshock that JPK III lost. When Kennedy first got into the race, many primary voters knew relatively little about Ed Markey, who had been a House member for decades but had onlyservedsix and a half years as asenator. However, once that cloudy picture clarified and it became clear that Markey was the more progressive and accomplished candidate, the race began to reset. Given Markey’sstatus as a national leader on climate, neither is it asurprise he became the big favorite of younger voters. There, his political partnership with, and endorsement by,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezwere particularly helpful. AdvertisementSo will this defeatspell the end of JPK III’s political career? No reason itshould. Conducting a largely pointless primary challenge to a fellow liberal left a bad taste in many mouths, but Kennedy, who was a good congressman, can recover. Just look at Charlie Baker. He waged an off-putting, misbegotten, and unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2010 — and now he’s among the most popular governors in America. Kennedyshould do what Baker did after that loss: Sit down with those who will tell him the unvarnished truth about his political misadventure. People will forgive you a lot if you demonstrate that you’ve thought about your mistakes and learned from them. Despite his loss, many Democrats retain a fondness for Kennedy, who, before this empty-calorie flight of the ego, hadseemedsmarter and less entitled than others in his family. He’ll get another chance — as long as he waits for the right opportunity. Scot Lehigh is a Globe columnist. He can be reached atscot.lehigh@globe.com. Follow him@GlobeScotLehigh.",1,2,Boston Globe

In the run-up to this month’s Vietnamsummit, Trump is acutely aware that a potential landmark deal on Kim’s complete, verifiable and permanent denuclearization would be asignificant foreign policy win for him, the region and the world. Unfortunately, that potential deal is where Trump’s foreign policysuccesses bothstart and end. By any other measure, the president’s aggressive pursuit of nativist policies has weakened America’s global leverage, given its adversariesstrategic openings and made the world a little lesssafe for democracy and human rights. In normal times, this would beseen as a failure of leadership and a threat to America’s fundamental values, globalstature and international dominance. These are not, however, normal times. The Trump Doctrine is an “America First”agendathat plays well at home andsounds good on thestump. At best, it is ashortsighted and dangerous foreign policy play that ultimately creates a global leadership vacuum. It’s notsurprising that America’s adversaries are dying to fill this vacuum. This is not partisan ideology talk. It’s dollars and cents. When America retreats and withdraws, its markets retrench, its buyers look for better deals and its partnersstart looking for the exits. Trump’s America is either up and leaving longstanding U. S. commitments orsetting radically different andsometimes onerous terms on long-term partners for the delivery of thesame—or even worse—goods andservices. Those partners are open to new and different commercial, military and diplomatic relationships elsewhere. They are more open to Russian and Chinese overtures. Why buy American? Why rely exclusively on one Westernsupplier or questionablesecurity guarantor? Why trust Trump?Thesimple answer is, they don’t. As a result, polls areshowing that in certain disparaged NATO countries—Germany and France, for example— citizenstrustChina’s President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin more than POTUS. Let thatsink in for asecond. European allies can’t count on America to help in times of need, as German Chancellor Angela Merkelmade clear whenshesaid Europe could no longer “rely on thesuperpower of the United States.”What does this mean in practical terms?In theshort run, these nations recognize they are entirely dependent on America as asecuritysupplier. Politicalscientists call this current hard reality apa th dependence on American military hardware and professionalservices, from inter operable weaponssystems and aircraft to integrated communications infrastructure. They are locked in to American products andsuppliers. But that can change over time. In fact, it already is. Suddenly, countries that would never consider buying Brand X from another,adversarialnation are opening their arms and their markets to Chinese technology and Russian weaponssystems. If data is the lifeblood of the modern era, then 5G telecommunications infrastructure is the 21st century’s global circulatorysystem. Digital information courses through the world at a head-spinning pace. China’s Huawei has moved quickly to develop much of that data circulatorysystem. As a result, if America can’t compete and Beijing wins this race, free-flowing data will pump through a Beijing-based digital heart to feed China’s Artificial Intelligence-driven brain—giving it unparalleled insights and intelligence. Thestakes are high as heated competition for next generation digital dominance is fully under way. America’s bullying reaction and response to Huawei’s global growth may not ultimately be as effective as China’s profligate financial underwriting for Sino-systems around the world. As theysay in Trump’s New York, “Money talks and BS walks.”In the military realm, orders for America’s next-generation F-35 fighter jet and any number of other future American militarysystems are being either cancelled or countered. One example? Russia’s advanced S-400 anti-aircraft missiles will find new homes in India, Turkey, Egypt, Vietnam, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Russia issuccessfully courting allies, a deeply worrisome development that can be traced directly to Trump’s policies—or lack thereof. The list of new Russian and Chinese globally underwritten projects is growing, from critical port and road infrastructure to nuclear power plants. The world does not wait for America to find its voice and provide global leadership. Two more years is a lifetime in geopolitics, and the rebalancing of power has been under waysince Nov. 9, 2016, when a candidate unschooled and inexperienced in foreign policy and insensitive to itssubtleties andsystems won America’s presidential election. Chinasaw its opening. Russia grabbed its opportunity. The United States now watches agog as, one-by-one, the global chess pieces get moved and America keeps losing its partners and its pawns. What Trump has not yet realized is that foreign-policy chest beating is not chess playing.",0,1,Washington Monthly
404,"Despite judge’s ruling, Chicago-area immigration activist still hopeful: ‘It’s not the end and we can fight’",-9.67,43.33,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/7/16/22580886/chicago-daca-texas-federal-judge-lawsuit-ruling-dreamers-congress-immigration-reform,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Just a couple of days ago, Luis Rodriguez’s friend hadstopped by toshow him her newly authorized work permit. Rodriguez, who in recent months had applied for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, figured his would comesoon enough. Then on Friday, a federal judge in Texas ruled in favor ofstates that had challenged the legality of DACA, adding to the uncertainty for young immigrants like Rodriguez, who were brought to this country as children. Lea es te artículo en español enLa Voz Chicago,lasección bilingüe del Sun-Times. As part of the ruling, U. S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ordered the federal government tostop granting new DACA applications; the program allows certain immigrants to work legally and also provides temporary protection from deportation. Rodriquez and others in hissituation often are called “Dreamers,” a reference to the DREAM Act, proposed legislation that provides protectionssimilar to DACA. The judge’s order means pending applications from Rodriguez and other young Dreamers won’t be processed, for now.“It’s not the end and we can fight,” Rodriguez, 20,said hours after news of the judge’s order. Hisspirits were boosted by a phone call with other immigrant activists.“We got this. I know that my people will do the very best to organize against this injunction.”He also willspend time putting pressure on Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., an originalsponsor of the DREAM Act, to pass immigration reform. Rodriguez isstill trying to continue his education, but without DACA that could mean a bigger financial hurdle. Friday’s news comes as more young immigrants were applying for the program,said Kathleen Vannucci, an immigration attorney who is part of the Chicago chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Thewindow for first-time DACA applications had opened in Decemberbecause of a court order. Before that, new applications had been haltedsince 2017, when the Trump administration tried to end the program. As of March 31, more than 55,000 initial DACA applications were pending, according to the lateststatistics from U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which also reported more than 616,000 DACA recipients nationwide. The group estimates31,210 immigrants living with DACA protections in the Chicago metro area. What those with pending applications could do now will vary case to case, but many wereso young that DACA was their only option toseek legalstatus, Vannuccisaid. It’s unclear what will happen to those who hadn’tsubmitted their application.“Those are going to be the difficult conversations,”shesaid. People who already had DACAshould be able to continue renewing theirstatus and work permits,said Fred Tsao,senior policy counsel for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. The ruling also puts added pressure on Congress to decide on immigration overhaul. President Joe Biden has pushed for a path to legalize undocumented immigrants.“Those efforts which are happening in Congress have now taken on even more urgency,” Tsaosaid. “Whether it’s astand-alone Dream Act or a moresweeping legislative fix.”Vannucci hopes Friday’s ruling eventually means leads to a permanentsolution particularly for young immigrants, pointing out that DACA was alsosupposed to be a temporary program.“This roller coaster can’t continue,”shesaid. Rodriguez would like tosee a pathway for citizenship for all of the country’s undocumented immigrants.“Citizenship is key to all thestruggles my community have,” Rodriguezsaid. “People like my mom worry more about what it’s going to cost to havesurgery because they don’t qualify for Medicaid because of immigrationstatus. If there was a pathway for citizenship that was easier and attainable — it can be if Durbinsteps up — it would make a world of a difference.”Elvia Malagón’s reporting onsocial justice and income inequality is made possible by a grant from The Chicago Community Trust.",1,2,Chicago Sun-Times
405,A Brief History of the Flu Vaccine,0.0,52.33,https://weather.com/health/cold-flu/news/2019-12-23-a-brief-history-of-the-flu-vaccine,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-02,25,"desktop or mobile phone. Every year, three to five million people catch asevere flu, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and between290,000 and 650,000 people die from it worldwide. Still, thanks to the flu vaccine, this is only a fraction of how many people it used to kill. During the last major flu pandemic of 1918-1919, it killed between50 and 100 million people around the world. For a long time,scientists had thought that the flu was caused by a bacteriacalled, but after the 1918-19 pandemic, theystarted tosuspect it was caused by a virus instead. However, it wouldn’t be until the 1930s that they would confirm that. In 1933, threescientists isolated the Influenza A virus in ferrets— one of the three types of flu — and in 1936, it was discovered that the virus could begrown inside embryonated chicken eggs, a keystep towards making a vaccine. Just two years later, in 1938, Jonas Salk (who would later go on to develop the Polio vaccine) and Thomas Francis developed the first vaccine using fertilized chicken eggs anda n inactivatedstrain of the Influenza A virus. This new vaccine was first used to help protectsoldiers fighting in World War II; it wouldn’t be approved for civilians until 1946. According to a1944study of the new vaccine, it helped reduce illness that was accompanied by a temperature above 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Vaccines at this time weren’t as purified as today’s vaccines though, and those impurities could causeside effects, including fever, aches, and fatigue, leading many people to incorrectly assume they caught the flu from the vaccine. Also, this early flu vaccine only protected against one of the three flu types, Influenza A. There are three types of flu — Influenza A, B and C — and each one has its own viralstrain that replicates and changes independently of the others everyseason. Influenza A and B are the most common. A vaccine against Influenza A did nothing to protect people from Influenza B or C. It wasn’t until 1942 that the first bivalent vaccine was developed, meaning it worked for both an Influenza type A and type Bstrain. In 1976, aswine flu outbreak hit New Jersey, which incited fears of a new pandemic,soPresident Gerald Fordannounced that the federal government would vaccinate all Americans. Congress approved $137 million for producing a vaccine for this purpose before fluseasonstarted. Unfortunately, hundreds of people developedGuillain-Barrésyndrome(which causes nerve damage and paralysis) after receiving this vaccine, making many people fear it. The Ford family tried to alleviate fears by televising getting their flushots, but ultimately theswine flu vaccination program was cancelled. Despite thissetback, production ofseasonal flu vaccines continued. Seasonalstrains of each type of influenza mutate and change very quickly,so the flushot is the only vaccine that needs to be continually updated. In 1973, WHO developed am ore rigorous process for targeting thestrains that affect people, and in 1978, the first trivalent vaccine was developed, protecting people against two differentstrains of Influenza A and onestrain of Influenza B. In 2003, the first live attenuated influenza vaccine —FluMist— was approved by the FDA, which contained a weaker, livestrain of the virus. It is administered as a nasalspray. Today’s vaccines are much more effective than the early vaccines because a global network ofscientists monitor the variousstrains of the virus. Each year, they determine how they've mutated over the past year, how they arespreading, and try to predict whichstrains might be most prevalent in the coming year in both hemispheres. They then announce which influenzasubtypesshould be targeted by vaccinesso medical labs canstart working on them. The FDA approves the vaccines by thespring, production begins in thesummer and it is available at your pharmacy come fall, aka thestart of fluseason. Of course, flu vaccines are never 100% effective, but they're the best defense we have today. The good news is that they are also widely available and free with most insurance providers.",2,2,The Weather Channel
406,Let the Little Children Come to ‘Big Church’,0.0,32.67,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/may-june/jen-wilkin-family-worship-covid-childrens-church-together.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"Since last year, COVID-19 has asked all of us to adapt in myriad ways. As we begin to emerge from pandemic precautions, the pull to return to normalcy will bestrong. Simultaneously, we will assess what we have learned: What practices do we want to maintain? For young Christian families, one pandemic practice in particular promises a huge discipleship yield. Like other families, the Wilkins turned to jigsaw puzzles to fill our unexpected hours of togetherness. In March 2020, it wasn’t just toilet paper that ranscarce. There was also ashortage of—of all things—1,000-piece puzzles. With puzzle-hoarding running rampant on Amazon, I finally committed to ordering one from a print-on-demand website. When it arrived, it was indeed a 1,000-piece puzzle … but each piece was about thesize of a dime. You know what you need in lockdown? More ways to beshort-tempered and frustrated. That beingsaid, one habit I hope our family will preserve post-pandemic is working on (normal-sized) puzzles together. With regard to the continuous puzzle that is discipling our children, COVID-19 delivered a full-sized, clear picture of a key way to doso, through the unexpected means of Sundayservicesstreamed into our living rooms. For many young families, the coronavirus lock down was their first time to worship together consistently through all elements of “big church,” rather than follow a common pattern of kids attending children’s programing while adults attend the weekly gathering. At my own church, assoon as we beganstreamingservices, kids began asking about baptism and the Lord’s Supper at unprecedented rates. Many had neverseen them. In living rooms everywhere, children prayed communal prayers, listened to the Word proclaimed, heard testimonies, and joined their voices insong—. Like my tiny jigsaw puzzle, these family worship gatherings were not without frustration. Children may havesquirmed, consumed copioussnacks, or run circles around the living room, butsomething priceless was happening: Families were living out the words of Psalm 34:3: “Glorify the Lord; let us exalt his nametogether” (emphasis added). Observant parents who might have assumed “My child won’t really get anything out of theservice” learned this was, in fact, profoundly not true. Because there is no replacement for children watching their parents model worship. Because children have a right to witness and learn from the ordinances of the church. Because children are not the church of tomorrow; they are the church of today. I’m a big fan of children’s ministry. I think it’s invaluable. I’m paid by my church to think about it in good ways. But let me be clear: While children’s church is a wonderfulsupplement to big church, it is a terriblesubstitute. A child old enough for kindergarten can be welcomed into big church with a little loving guidance from a parent determined to disciple. If it is true that “more is caught than taught,” parentsshould value modeling worship for their children more than any lesson taught by a children’s church leader. In onesense, COVID-19 invited thesmaller members of the church of today to worship exactly where they belong: with the rest of the church. Iseem to recallsomeone else doing asimilar thing, to the confusion of his disciples. On the otherside of the pandemic, I hope never again to find theshelves bare of toilet paper. Or puzzles. Or Extra Toasty Cheez-Its, as long as we’re making a list. But I hope the puzzle pieces that fell into place aroundshared family worship will besaved and deepened. In returning to normal, I hope we won’t preserve a pre-COVID practice that perhaps wasn’t as great as itseemed. I hope more families will bringschool-aged kids to the gathering that is big church, in addition tosending them to the blessing that is children’s church. For families, the “with me” of worship matters. Let the little children come—even if they wiggle and whisper. They are the missing pieces that complete the picture of the church as God’s family. Let them be formed in the house of the Lord.[ This article is also available inPortuguêsandFrançais. ]Havesomething to add about this? Seesomething we missed?

Here’s everything you need to know about the case. At ane ws conference on Tuesday night, officialssaid Columbus police received a 911 call at 4:35 p.m. about an attemptedstabbing insoutheastern Columbus. The callersaid a female was trying tostab them before hanging up, according to. Shortly after theshooting, a 12-person jury announced a verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was found guilty of all charges:second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, andsecond-degree manslaughter. During a Tuesday night news conference, Columbus police released body camera footage from the first officer to arrive on thescene, according toWKYC Channel 3. Michael Woods, the interim police chief,said it is unprecedented for body camera footage to be releasedso quickly after ashooting, but that he “wanted to get that out assoon as possible” in the interest of transparency. The videoshows an officer approaching a driveway where a group of young people are gathered. One of the teenagers appears to lunge at another with what appears to be a knife. The police officer then approaches the group andshouts “get down,” before firingseveralshots—four can be heard in the video—fatallyshooting Bryant.

408,We can escape ideological madness by convicting Trump,4.67,34.67,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2021/01/24/republicans-can-escape-ideological-madness-by-convicting-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-24,25,"The Republicans in the winter of 1860-1861, even more than Democrats today, were terrified that their victory in the presidential election might be overthrown by a lawless attack on the nation’s capital. Abraham Lincoln had won the election with just 40% of the popular vote. Very few major party candidates in American history have ever lost a presidential election withsuch a low percentage of the vote. Southerners hotly announced their refusal to accept the results of the election. Organized resistance quickly acquired a revolutionary intensity thatshocked everyone, even those who created it. Rumors of an impending coupswirled through Washington. When William Henry Seward, Lincoln’s choice forsecretary ofstate, arrived in December of 1860, he discovered that not asingle American flag could be found among the private businesses, homes and hotels in the district. Some residents had removed their flags out of hostility toward their government, others merely out of prudence.“It is revolutionary times here,” Seward wrote privately. “[A] plot is forming toseize the capital on or before the 4th March,” the day of Lincoln’s inauguration. (Inauguration Day was not moved to January until 1937). Getsmart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. Or with:Bysigning up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy PolicyUntil the official transfer of power, Republicans in Washington were essentially helpless against the threatened onslaught against them. They could only hold their breath and pray that their enemies would notsuccessfully disrupt the national government before they assumed control of it. As the Republicans recognized, the most vulnerable moment in the political transition from one administration to the next was an obscure ceremony with which we have lately become familiar — a jointsession of Congress in which the results of the Electoral College are officially counted and certified.“If the two houses refuse to meet, or meet without a quorum,” the president-elect asked privately, “whereshall we be?”Lincoln had good reason to worry. Democrats controlled the Senate. Under the Constitution, the incumbent vice president opens and counts the electoral certificates and announces the results of the election,sanctioning the legitimacy of the incoming administration. And that incumbent, John Breckenridge, wouldsoon become a high-ranking member of the Confederacy. Even as Breckenridge prepared to perform his constitutional duties, he openly avowed his rebelsympathies.“I do not think that this counting is constitutionally essential to the election;” Lincoln fretted, “but how are we to proceed in the absence of it?”The fateful day, thesecond Wednesday in February, was tense with the most terrible apprehensions. Republicans feared that partisans would thwart the electoral count within the U. S. Capitol as Southern militia attacked from without. Gov. Henry Wise of Virginia, it was rumored, was preparing to march on the capitol with 25,000 militia as his allies disrupted the vote count, destroying the national government “by fire andsword.”In fact, however, not even the mildest concerns about the electoral count were realized. “The votes have been counted and the capital is not attacked,” Seward wrote privately. “The capital was full, but quiet, and the ceremony was quiet but tedious.”At the conclusion of the count, in a calm,sonorous voice, Vice President Breckinridge announced, “Abraham Lincoln has been duly elected president of the United States.”In retrospect, thesighs of relief that followed proved darkly ironic. But we today are no longer in a position to pity our ancestors, either for their misplaced alarm or for their even more misplaced relief. Both the contrasts and comparisons between the crisis of 1860-61 and the final days of Donald Trump’s presidency are instructive. Nothing like the catastrophe that befell the country in 1861 is in our immediate future. In the Civil War, 750,000soldiers died; as a percentage of the population, that’s equivalent to about 10 million deaths today. Everything about that era was incomparably worse than our own. And yet the crime Lincoln and other Republicans most feared — an illegal attempt to disrupt the electoral count — was one Southerners dismissed as beneath their dignity. Breckinridge and other Southernsenators went on to wage war against the United States. Their constitutional arguments justifyingsecession were motivated by asinister devotion toslavery, but the arguments themselves were marked byserious legal and historical reasoning. For all their crimes, they respected the republic, even in their efforts to destroy it. Today we have the opposite problem. Cynical politicians have theatrically attacked the foundations of our democracy, not because they wish to overthrow the government but because they take its invincibility for granted. Their efforts are too absurd andspineless to qualify as a rebellion. Only oneside of our political divide was responsible for the riot at the Capitol. But that was just the latest outbreak of a bipartisan disease. America today is in the unfortunate position of a child caught in the middle of a bitter divorce. Both parents, the right and the left, are too blinded by their own grievances and hatreds tosee their own role in wounding what theysincerely profess to love. Democrats today righteously denounce the hypocrisy of law-and-order Republicans whosummoned a mob that killed a police officer. And no honest Republican can deny they deserve it. But thesituation calls for a littleself-awareness among Democrats. A little more thansix months ago, during asummer of many peaceful protests, Washington, D. C., and other American cities were attacked by another mob. And that mob may have felt encouragement from the hyperbolic, dishonest accusations ofsome Democratic leaders against the vital political authorities under attack. Their defense then is Trump’s now. They did not endorse illegality and violence, only the protests. But those protests created the opportunity forsome to engage in illegality and violence. On the left, no important political leader has committed offenses equivalent to Trump’ssince his election. Hillary Clinton may have tacitly endorsed attacks on the legitimacy of her defeat four years ago, butshe did not lead “the resistance.” At thesame time, there is no equivalent, on the right, to the immense, irresponsible power wielded by the left in academia, journalism, Hollywood, Silicon Valley and other prestigious cultural institutions. Perhaps the Republicans willseize this opportunity to escape from the dangerous pattern of escalating ideological madness. Perhaps enough Republicansenators will convict Trump of the impeachment charges of which he is manifestly guilty. Perhaps they will even acknowledge their own complicity in what they have wrought, instead of fixating on all the ways their adversaries contributed to thesame ungodly mess. And perhaps an honest display of patriotism will inspire Democrats to takesimilarsteps toward contrition and conciliation. That path requires wisdom and courage. It will be far easier for the Republicans, like the Democrats immediately before them, to await their own opportunity to be outraged at the destructive excesses their own conduct has licensed. That path requires nothing but timidity and time. It amounts to just one more turn around the widening gyre, as political dysfunction eventually begets a catastrophe we cannot yet even dimly imagine.“One may do a little time-serving,” Cicero once wrote. “But when one’s hour has come, one must not miss it.” For my part, I hope the Senate Republicanssee this moment for what it is, andseize it.

The US has distributed 60 million vaccine doses to other nations in the past month and is planning to buy 500 million doses “to makesure we are doing everything we can to win this race against variants”, Blinkensaid. The Secretary of State’s warning comes as local communities in the US arestarting tosee deadlysurges of COVID-19 cases from the Delta variant that are infecting more young people and even affecting people who have been vaccinated. Israel announced on July 22 it was renewing coronavirus restrictions because of the Delta variant. The Delta variant was first detected in India and has acquired thespike protein mutation, called K417N, which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.“The Delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulatingstrains,” Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters at a White House briefing on July 22.“It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of, and that I haveseen in my 20-year career,” Walenskysaid, urging Americans who have not been vaccinated to get the jab. The US has vaccinated 162 million people and 97 percent of new COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths are among the unvaccinated, Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinatorsaid.“It is clear, that we’re experiencing what many other countries are experiencing – increased case counts driven by the more transmissible Delta variant,” Zients told reporters at the White House.

In Galveston, Texas, more than 150 cases of COVID-19 were tied to an outbreak in early July at a church-affiliated youth camp, health officials told local media. Of those, 20 cases were breakthrough cases, meaning the infected individuals had been vaccinated.

410,The Unlikely Rebound of Mainline Protestantism,-1.67,44.0,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-unlikely-rebound-of-mainline-protestantism,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Since we’re at a delicate moment in our democracy—featuring a Presidential candidate who lost the Electoral Collegeby just 42,918 votesand responded by urging his followers toat tack the Capitol—weshould be grateful forsigns of certain kinds of moderation returning to our national life. A new Gallup poll reports that, as vaccinationsspread and unemployment drops, more Americanssay that they are “thriving” than at any time in the past dozen years, whichsurely means that at leastsome of the anger in the country might wane. And, last Thursday, the Public Religion Research Institutereportedsome interesting numbers about faith in America, which may indicatesomethingsimilar. Most of the news coverage of the P. R. R. I.study has focussed on the fact that itshows a dramatic drop in the number of white Americans who identify as evangelical Christians, from twenty-three per cent of the population in 2006 to fourteen per cent in 2020. There has also been aslight drop in the number of “nones”—the religiously unaffiliated—from twenty-six per cent in 2018 to twenty-three per cent in 2020. But what I found most unexpected was the reported up tick in the number of white mainline Protestants. According to thestudy, they represent 16.4 per cent of the population (up from thirteen per cent in 2016), which means that they now outnumber white evangelicals,some of whom may have defected to the traditional denominations. Though the methodology is a little unclear—this “2020 Census of American Religion” categorizes allself-identifying white Christians whosaid that they weren’t evangelical or born again as “white mainline Protestants”—the newsseems as profound as it is unexpected. Forseveral decades, a prevailing narrative of white American Christian life has been about the decline of Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Lutherans, and other once-dominant Protestantsects. In this telling, the “mainline” became the “sideline,” as congregations fled the moral relativism of out-of-touch pastors, who replaced God’s word with liberal politics. Having been baptized a Presbyterian, grown up as a Congregationalist, andspent my adult life as a Methodist, I watched this decline close up. Churches closed, congregations aged, and the image of Christianity in the popular mind came to be one ofsexism, libertarian capitalism, and a pervasive individualism—the idea of God as, above all, a “personalsavior.”The fade of that brand of evangelicalism in America—the P. R. R. I. reportshows that its cultural hegemony is increasingly confined to the Southeast—is not a greatshock. As early as 2007, researchers were picking upstrongsignals that young peopleweren’t as inclined to follow those churches on key cultural issues: eighty per cent of even young churchgoersreported, critically, that theirstrongest perception was that Christianity was “anti-homosexual”—not an illogical conclusion given the amount of time that evangelicalsspent on the issue (oddly,since the Gospels never mention it). Eventually, most white evangelical congregants tied themselves toDonald Trump—in 2016, eighty-one per cent of white evangelical voters chose him and, according to aP. R. R. I. poll from 2018, he had aseventy-two-per-cent approval rating among them—despite the fact that heshowed not theslightestsign of Christian understanding or behavior. As a result, at least in part,some prominent evangelicalsstarted to leave their churches. (And, certainly,some evangelicals neversupported Trumpism.) New recruits are not flooding in to replace those who have left: white evangelicals, according to the P. R. R. I. report, are now the oldest of religious Americans, with an average age of fifty-six. The reported rise in the number of mainline Protestants, though, issurprising. Diana Butler Bass, an unflagging chronicler of American Protestantism who, having gone in her personal life from the mainline to the evangelical and back again, was ahead of her time,points outthat, for decades, the media paid no attention to these declining (and demure) denominations, concentrating instead on the provocative Falwells, Swaggarts, and Robertsons. “If one was born after 1980, it was hard to know that mainline Protestantism even existed,”she writes. The new numbers, of course, don’t mark anything like a return to the previousstatus quo, when mainline Protestantism ruled Americanspiritual life. Take 1958 as a high-water mark: that year, as Dwight Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the Interchurch Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the religion researchers Mark Silk and James Hudnut-Beumler report that fifty-two per cent of Americans, many of whom were moving to the newsuburbs, were affiliated with one of the mainline denominations that are members of the National Council of the Churches of Christ, which was headquartered in that building. (It issometimes called the Protestant Kremlin—or the God Box.) Without this “firm foundation, national morality could not be maintained,” the President intoned. (Ike himself, raised in the Mennonite tradition, was baptized a Presbyterian less than two weeks after taking office.)But the very broadness of the church’s reach was its weakness: attendance was, as many pointed out, often more a cultural expectation than an active commitment. As the nineteen-sixties andseventies wore on, and the liberal denominationsstarted makingsignificant commitments around racial justice and peace, many of their adherents did fall away. For others, though, the churches didn’t go far enough, with many wavering for decades about the idea, for example, that gay congregantsshould be full participants in church life. Being in the middleseemed a recipe for irrelevance. Yet perhaps the Trump years have taught us a little bit about the virtues of a kind of modest center—even now, according to the P. R. R. Isurvey, thirty-five per cent of white mainline Protestants identify as Democrats, thirty-three per cent as Republicans, and thirty per cent as independents. (TheBidenyears may prove instructive, too, as the Catholic bishops—who have made common cause with right-wing evangelicals for years—threaten tode ny the President communion.) In any event, these mainline churches are not thesame as those of thesuburban heyday of thesixties. Likesurviving local independent bookstores responding to modern readers, they have had to become more responsive to the emotional needs ofspiritualseekers, channelling the desire for connection into the arts and a wide array ofservice projects. Butler Bass writes a newsletter, in which, after the P. R. R. I. poll came out,shed escribe dhow a declining Episcopalian church in Santa Barbara, California, thatshe once attended managed to rebound: “They married gay members before marriage equality was legal in California. They went to protest marches. They innovated liturgy. They read liberal theology books,studied feminist and liberation theology, embraced contemporary biblical criticism. They followed no plan—except for believing that Christianity was an adventure and that Christian community could be transformative, challenging, and deeplyspiritual in and for the world.” Today, when activists fight pipelines or police brutality, they often lean onsupport from the clergy ofsuch places of worship, who tend toskew more liberal than their congregants in the pews. Butler Bass and other church progressives may now compete with evangelical me ga church pastors as unofficialspokes people for their faith, complicating the public image of what white Protestants in America believe and how they act. “A really important moment is here,”she wrote last week. “Thestory of an old religious tradition hasn’t ended the way critics once thought. Paraphrasing the words of the old Monty Pythonsketch, ‘We’re not dead yet.’ We’ve just been awaiting resurrection.”",2,1,The New Yorker

""The president may insist on having his name on the check. But make no mistake, those checks are from the American people. The American people's nameshould be on that check, no individual. Pelosi, it's worth noting, is one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with a net worth estimate dat more than $100 million (she makes $223,000 a year insalary). And for the record, when Trumpsigned into law tax cuts that prompted numerous businesses to give $1,000-$2,5000 bonuses to millions of workers, Pelosi called that amount ""crumbs.""When the firststimulus bill passed, the payments began about two weeks after the legislation was approved. More than 81 million payments totaling more than $147 billion were disbursed within weeks, all through electronic transfers to recipients' bank accounts, according to the Government Accountability Office.

""We did it the first time — I can get out 50 million payments really quickly, a lot of it into people's direct accounts,"" Mnuchin told reportersthen. If the new bill follows the first bill, individuals will be eligible for payments up to $600, but that amount declines for those with an adjusted gross income higher than $75,000 a year. The $600 payment would drop by 5% of every dollar above $75,000, or $50 for every $1,000. Social media had a field day with the paltry amount for Americans included in the compromise bill.

412,Are masks effective for kids? Here’s what to know before school starts,-1.33,45.67,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/08/25/metro/are-masks-effective-kids-heres-what-know-before-school-starts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-25,25,"Massachusetts publicschoolstudents andstaff membersnow will be required to wear a mask when they return for the newschool year until at least Oct. 1 under a mandate issued Wednesday. The edict applies to all children ages 5 and older; whilestudents under 5 are not required to, thestatestrongly recommends they, too, wear masks. There are exceptions forstudents andstaff who cannot wear a mask for medical reasons and forstudents who have behavioral concerns. The ruling fromstate Education Commissioner Jeffrey Riley aligns Massachusetts with the prevailing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that childrenshould be masked up inschool as the Delta variant of COVID-19 triggers a resurgence of infections around the country. AdvertisementMiddle and highschools that canshow at least 80 percent ofstudents andstaff are vaccinated by Oct. 1 can lift the mask mandate then, but only for those who are inoculated. Since vaccines have not been authorized yet for children under age 12, thosestudents would continue to wear masks, meaning most elementaryschool educators for now would have to keep their masks on as well. Some parent groups have pushed back against masks inschools, arguing face coverings can harm kids. But medical expertssay masks are necessary to protect children who don’t have an available vaccine, and the benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks. The American Academy of Pediatrics— as well as many doctors andscientists —support universal masking policies as the best chance to keepschoolssafely open. A properly fitted mask that covers the nose and mouth reduces the amount of viral droplets in the air exchanged by people breathing or talking near each other,said Dr. Ibukun Kalu, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Duke University Medical Center. AdvertisementSeveralstudies haveshown the effectiveness of masks. One of the largest, conducted by the ABC Collaborative with Duke University, analyzed data from North Carolina publicschools where masks were required. Researchers found that from March to June, 7,000 children and adults attendedschool while infectious with COVID, leading to 40,000 “close contacts” being quarantined. Of those, only 363 contracted the virus. That low rate of in-school transmission was due in large part to masks, Kalusaid, as mostschools didn’t upgrade ventilation orsocially distancestudents. In contrast, 153students and 25staffers were infected at aschool in Israel without a mask mandate orsocial distancing. And recent outbreaks at kids’summer camps andschools in Georgia and Floridashow how fast COVID canspread among unmasked, unvaccinated people, Kalusaid.“Wesaw that masking in theschool environment reduced within-school transmission,” Kalusaid. The Delta variant adds urgency to masks this year,shesaid, particularly for children under 12 who aren’t eligible for vaccination. Even though children are at lower risk ofsevere disease and death compared to older people, Kalusaid, bothstill happen: “COVID isstillsevere enough that if we can do what we can to prevent one case, weshould, particularly if it’ssomething as low-impact as masking.”Some teachers, parents, andscientists are concerned about masks interfering with learning or development ofsocial, language, andspeechskills, especially for children who are very young or who alreadystruggle. AdvertisementWhile young kids do rely on watching mouths to learn to talk, they receive enough unmasked interaction during meals, playtime, and baths at home to develop language, according to an article published jointly by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.“Most of the interaction that a child is going to have in the language-learning phase is going to be at home with adults who are not wearing masks,”said Diane Paul, clinical director ofspeech language pathology for the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. After reviewing publishedscientificstudies, the association found no evidence face masks interfere withspeech and language development, Paulsaid. She recommends masked teachers or care givers follow good longstanding communication practices: facing the child and getting their attention before talking;speakingslowly and loudly; using eyes, hands, body language, and changes in tone; asking the child if they understood; and reducing distractions. Some educators also wear clear masks to help children who are hard of hearing read their lips. Still, there issome disagreement over when it’s appropriate for kids to wear masks. The CDCdoesn’t recommend children younger than 2 do. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization advises against masks for children 5 and under due to their lowersusceptibility to COVID, challenges with correct usage, and the possibility that masks could interfere with their learning,socialization, and communication.“The benefits of wearing masks in children for COVID-19 controlshould be weighed against potential harm associated with wearing masks, including feasibility and discomfort, as well associal and communication concerns,” the WHOsaid. AdvertisementDaniele Lantagne, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University who helped develop the WHO’s child-masking guidance,said many young kids like her own have no trouble wearing masks andshould just wear them inschools. Butsome othersstruggle because they’re very young or they have disabilities or developmental delays. Theyshould be allowed to forgo masks with distancing or other measures,shesaid. Thestate mandate allowssuch exceptions inschools. For children ages 6 to 12, the WHO recommends considering local COVID levels and the potential impact of mask wearing on learning andsocial development. Some countries are focusingschool-safetystrategies more on testing as they feel masking interferes with teacher-child communication, Lantagnesaid. Because in part of the WHO guidance,many European countriessuch as England, Norway, Ireland, and Switzerland are not requiring masks, or insome instances even advising against them, for elementary-age children. Local andstate masking guidanceshould be reassessed every two to three months amid changes in the COVID picture, Lantagnesaid.“Right now, we’re relatively high-transmission,” Lantagnesaid. “We need toshy away from, ‘We’re just going to put masks on kids for the next five years.’ ... There may be longer-term impacts onspeech.”Health experts emphasize the trade-off is worth it tosave lives.“The benefits clearly outweigh the downsides in a deadly pandemic where more than 400 children have died,”said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious diseases and virology expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “It’s not your civil liberty to catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection. It’s not a personal choice; it’s a choice you make for other people.”AdvertisementExperts disagree on this question. The CDC has advised everyone to wear masks inschools, regardless of vaccinationstatus, citing evidence that vaccinated people canstill become infected and probablyspread COVID, though they face far lower personal risks ofsevere disease, hospitalization, and death. But under new rules, the Baker administration hassaid middle and highschools with more than 80 percent ofstudents andstaff vaccinated by Oct. 1 can lift their masking mandates. Lantagnesaid removingschool mask mandates insuch instances could be fine in conjunction with othersafety measures.“If there are not that many cases in the community and high vaccination rates, you cansay, ‘We can reduce the number of layers of protection,’”shesaid. But Kalusaid maskingstill would be an important way to keep vaccinatedstudents inschool learning.“It is reassuring when you live in a community that has high vaccination rates for children and adults,” Kalusaid. “However if masking is voluntary, it will likely be much less effective at preventing transmission and much less effective at preventing quarantine, which has also been a huge burden on the K-12school environment.”Naomi Martin can be reached atnaomi.martin@globe.com.",2,2,Boston Globe

This comes after decades of decline. For many, this is evidence that we need gun control. Obviously, I disagree andso do a lot of people. However, most of us agree that violent crime, particularly that using a firearm, needs to be addressed. When folks like you or I address gun control, though, we’re often asked whatshould be done to address the issue. That’s what editor Jay Caruso wanted to address. One of hissuggestions issomething I think is workable, even in our current political environment. Second, prosecutestraw purchasers with more vigor. That raises a problem. Currently, there are no federal laws addressingstraw purchases directly. The ATF and Justice Department are limited to investigating and prosecuting charges related to giving falsestatements on a federal form. Line 21a of Form 4473 asks, “Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form and any continuationsheet(s) (ATF Form 5300.9A)?” If a person answers affirmatively despite knowing he’s going to give the gun over to a friend who couldn’t pass a background check, that is a federal offense. However, it carries minimal punishment. For example, a case ofstraw purchasing in Virginia netted two people restricted from owning firearms (they were convicted felons) 27 to 48 months in federal prison. The actualstraw purchasers received only45daysand home confinement. The lack ofstringent penalties minimizes the risk. After all, it’s easier to convincesomeone tosteal a pack of gum than to rob a bank. Richard Marianos, a professor at Georgetown University and 27-year veteran of the ATF, including most recently as assistant director in the Office of Public and Governmental Affairs, told theWashington Examinerthere must be more focus onstraw purchases and the federally licensed firearms dealers that openly allowstraw purchases, or at least look the other way when they know it’s going on.“One way would be to allow agents, with reasonablesuspicion — not probable cause — to enter a gunshop and ask tosee their records,” Marianossaid. Marianos outlined three points critical to the investigation andsuccessful prosecution ofstraw purchasers:“Over 80% of the guns used in violent crimes are attributed tostraw purchases,” Marianossaid. I’d really love tosee Marianos’ data for that claim, but we agree thatstraw purchases are a problem. Giving the lawsome teeth and making it possible for the ATF to actually go after those who commitstraw buys more vigorously. In addition, I’d add going after those who attempt to purchase a firearm despite being legally unable to doso. What happens in many cases is that when their background check fails, they talksomeone else into buying the gun for them. Often, that’s the firststage of astraw buy, but trying to buy a gun when you’re a felon is a crime in and of itself, though it’s rarely prosecuted. Change that and you’llstart tosee criminals having a harder time buying guns. It won’t go away, because, despite Marianos’ claim, I’m unconvinced thatstraw buys represent that high a percentage. A large number of criminals havesaid they buy guns on the black market, after all, but we do knowstraw buys to also be an issue. Let’sstart there before we talk about banning weapons, restricting magazines, or any of a thousand other measures. What’s more, thereshould be near-universalsupport for this. If there isn’t, particularly from Democrats, then we’ll know that it’s not about reducing crime in any way,shape, or form.",0,0,Bearing Arms
417,State Department Lawyers Concluded Insufficient Evidence to Prove Genocide in China,0.0,49.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/19/china-uighurs-genocide-us-pompeo-blinken/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,25,"The U. S. State Department’s Office of the Legal Advisor concluded earlier this year that China’s mass imprisonment and forced labor of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity—but there was insufficient evidence to prove genocide, placing the United States’ top diplomatic lawyers at odds with both the Trump and Biden administrations, according to three former and current U. S. officials. The U. S. State Department’s Office of the Legal Advisor concluded earlier this year that China’s mass imprisonment and forced labor of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity—but there was insufficient evidence to prove genocide, placing the United States’ top diplomatic lawyers at odds with both the Trump and Biden administrations, according to three former and current U. S. officials. The revelation comes nearly a month after then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeosaid on Jan. 19, one day before U. S. President Donald Trump’s presidency ended, that China was carrying out a genocide against Chinese Muslims, primarily the ethnic Uighur population, in the western region of Xinjiang. The Biden administration has reaffirmed Pompeo’sstance and backed off a recent claim Biden’s United Nations envoy pick, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, made in her confirmation hearing that the State Department, under the Biden administration, was conducting a review of the designation. A State Department review during the final weeks of the Trump administration of China’s conduct in Xinjiang pitted the department’s lawyers against advocates of a genocide determination. Those advocates included Kelley Currie, who thenserved as U. S. ambassador at large for global women’s issues and is a long-standing critic of China’s human rights record, and former Sen. Sam Brownback, whoserved as the department’s ambassador at large for international religious freedom. It resulted in a “split” memo from the department that wassent to Pompeo, according to two officials. Beyond the legal debate over the characterization of China’s repression of its Muslim population, the genocide designation carries enormous political weight, applying pressure on the United States and other countries to punish a global powerhouse whose trade, environmental, andsecurity activities are entwined with their own. But wielding the g-word without asolid legal basis also carries the risk of politicizing and eroding the power of the designation, which has been invoked in the past century to describe the worst episodes of mass killing, from the murder of millions of Jews during the Holocaust to theslaughter of around 800,000 Rwandans during the country’s genocide. The cautious conclusions of State Department lawyers do not constitute a judgment that genocide did not occur in Xinjiang but reflects the difficulties of proving genocide, which involves the destruction “in whole or in part” of a group of people based on their national, religious, racial, or ethnic identity, in a court of law. It also points to a disconnect between public perception of the crime of genocide and the legal definition in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which has long been interpreted by State Department lawyers to require intent to bring about the physical and biological destruction of a group.“Genocide is difficult to prove in court,”said Richard Dicker, an expert on international justice at Human Rights Watch. Even the most horrific of crimes—burning of villages,systematic rape, or the execution of large numbers of civilians—can not be considered genocide unless the perpetrators carry out their crimes “with a veryspecific intent—the intent, of course, being to destroy in whole or in part a population based on their religious, ethnic, or national background,” hesaid. There is little dispute within the U. S. government that China’s treatment of the Uighur population has been horrific and criminal: More than 1 million Uighurs have been detained in reeducation camps, and many have reportedly beensubjected to forced labor andsterilization. China has committed numerous crimes listed in the convention as acts of genocide, including the prevention of births and infliction of bodily or mental harm on members of a group and the compulsoryseparation of children from their communities, according to human rights groups. But there remains questions over whether that conduct meets the extraordinarily high threshold required to prosecute the crime of genocide.“International courts have concluded that, for a crime to come within the definition in the [Genocide] Convention, the perpetrator must intend to destroy the relevant group in a biological or physicalsense,” wrote Todd Buchwald, whoserved as thespecial coordinator for the State Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice during the Obama administration, and Adam Keith, a former human rightsspecialist in the National Security Council, in an exhaustivestudy of U. S. decision-making on genocide. The convention, they noted, excluded the more limited concept of “cultural genocide.”But many international legal experts view that interpretation as too narrow andsay there is ample evidence that China has engaged in genocide. The Genocide Convention enumerates five categories of genocide,starting with the killing of members of a protected group but also including acts aimed at preventing a victim’s ability to bear children and forciblyseparating children from their communities. Critics of the State Department’s legalstance have argued that it has focused too heavily on the first category, mass killing, and not enough on the other categories. In the case of China, these critics note, there is little evidence that it is engaging in mass killings of Uighurs and other minorities, many of whom have beensubjected to indoctrination and pressed into forced labor. But evidence that it is carrying out other forms of genocide abounds, Beth Van Schaack, a visiting professor at Stanford Law School’s Center for Human Rights and International Justice,wrotein a recent post on.“For example, the torture, rape andsexual violence committed against Uyghurs likely constitute genocide ‘by causingserious bodily and mental harm’—thesecond type of genocide recognized by the Convention,”she wrote. “Likewise, the deplorable living conditions of incarcerated Uyghurs may constitute genocide by ‘deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about [their] physical destruction’—the third form of genocide.”The process of determining whether the U. S. government can andshould declare the commission of mass atrocities a genocide has evolved informallysince the United States became a party to the convention in 1988. Since the Cold War, the State Department has claimed genocide occurred in at least five cases. In 1993, the Clinton administration accused Bosnian Serbs of carrying out genocide against Bosnian Muslims. A year later, it accused ethnic Hutu extremists of carrying out a genocide in Rwanda. In 1995, it charged the Iraqi government of trying to eliminate the country’s Kurdish population. The process became more formal during the George W. Bush administration, when then-Secretary of State Colin Powell established an extensive review process. He deployed a team of investigators called the Atrocities Documentation Team to the Chad-Sudan border to interview refugees in an effort to determine whether genocide had occurred in Darfur, Sudan, where the Sudanese government and a government-backed militia, known as the, unleashed a reign of terror and displacement onseveral ethnic and tribal groups. Powelldeclaredbefore Congress in 2004 that “genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the government of Sudan and the jan ja weed bear responsibility—and that genocide maystill be occurring.”That formal reviewserved as a model for future efforts to determine whether genocide had occurred. In March 2016, then-Secretary of State John Kerry determined that the Islamic State had committed genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing against the Yazidis, Christians, and Shiite groups. Hissuccessor, Rex Tillerson, confirmed that decision. But the Trump administration never reached a final decision on the question of whether the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar were victims of genocide, and the Biden administration continues to review thesituation. Some human rights advocates believe there is astronger case for designating Myanmar’s attacks on the Rohingya genocide than China’s conduct in Xinjiang. In the case of China, Pompeo launched a review during his final months in office, a decision that was embraced by China critics in the department as overdue but viewedskeptically by others as a rushed and politicized effort to provide cover for a decision Pompeo had already decided he would make.“I have determined that the People’s Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, China, targeting Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups,” Pompeosaidon Twitter on Jan. 19, a day before Biden took office. He accused the Chinese of carrying out “forcedsterilizations and abortions on Uyghur women, coerced them to marry non-Uyghurs, andseparated Uyghur children from their families.”Currie declined to discuss the internal deliberations on the matter during the Trump administration, addingsimply that “thesecretary’s decision andstatementspeak for themselves.”A State Department official declined to comment on the internal deliberations during the Trump administration over the genocide designation butsaid that Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s decision to confirm Pompeo’s decision was based on his own reading of the convention, not on the department’s findings. The official noted that thesecretary ofstate, whether Pompeo or Blinken, wields the ultimate authority to make the final judgment, regardless of recommendations from the department’s lawyers. There is no need to initiate a new formal review into the matter, the officialsaid. The Biden team during the campaign reached the conclusion that China had carried out genocideseveral months before Pompeo’s declaration. In August 2020, Biden’s presidential campaign issued astatement concluding that China’s mass internment of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang amounts to “genocide.” Blinken reiterated that view during his confirmation hearing. Pressed on whether he agreed with Pompeo’s assertion that genocide occurred in Xinjiang, Blinken answered, “That would be my judgment as well.”But Thomas-Greenfield, however, appeared to hedge during asubsequent confirmation hearing,saying that while thesituation “feels like” genocide,she was awaiting the findings of a State Department review. “I know the State Department is reviewing that as wespeak,”shesaid, before later aligning her position with Blinken’s.“Secretary Blinken and I have made clear that genocide has been committed against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang,”she wrote in response to a question from Sen.

WASHINGTON, DC – JULY 20: U. S. President Donald Trump listens to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Photo by Doug Mills/Getty Images)Twosenior White House officials andseveral Hill officials with intimate knowledge of the negotiations fear that Republicans and Democrats are too far apart on wish-list items to realistically move the bill forward. Thesources, whospoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the ongoing talks, cast astarksentiment on bothsides of the negotiation table. The White House and members ofCongresshave floated potential items for a Phase 4 coronavirusstimulus package for months — including a payroll tax cut, asecond tranche of direct payments to taxpayers and increased budgeting forschools to reopen in the fall — but formal negotiations between the administration and Congressional leadership didn’t kick off until this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy met with Trump at the White House on Monday. The first round of bipartisan negotiations — featuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and White House chief ofstaff Mark Meadows — followed on Tuesday at the Capitol. Heading into Tuesday’s meeting,Meadowssaid that the group was eyeing a tentative July 31 deadline for the package, which happens to be the last day the House is currentlyscheduled to be insession, butMcConnelltold reporters later in the day that it’s unrealistic to expect legislation to be passed within that timeline.“Of course politically itshould pass before August recess. Everyone wants to havesomething they can point to back at home,” one GOP Senate aide told Daily Caller. “But if the last CARES negotiation was any indication of what’s to come, I don’tsee how that time line is feasible. Let’s remember Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer derailed the process and critical relief for days back in March because they were clinging to pipe dream proposals that have nothing to do with defeating this virus or helping hardworking Americans overcome this economic crisis.”“I wouldn’t hold my breath,” asecond Senatestaffersaid in astatement to Daily Caller. “Given how far apart bothsides are right now, I’d beshocked if Congress is able to pass a comprehensive coronavirus response bill by the end of the month.

More than a dozen Senate Republicansreportedlyvoicedserious displeasure withsigning off on another $1 trillion package at Tuesday’s Conference lunch. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a notorious budget hawk,stormed out of the lunch and compared it to a “Bernie Bros” meeting.“Everything they eversaid about President Obama they are,” he toldreporters. “This is insane, they are ruining the country.”Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee also expressed concern to Daily Caller about the cost of McConnell’s package, considering the massive unemploymentspike caused by the pandemicseems to have reversed.“Withstates reopening, it’s not clear that we need to borrow another trillion dollars now,” hestated. “If there is a Phase 4, I would like any additionalspending delivered directly to families, rather than to politicians or government bureaucracies.”Republican Florida Sen.

It’s a reference to the area’s crime rate, and tosome, a warning tostay away. But those of us who call the neighborhoods home know they areso much more than what you hear about on the local news. My own community, Kensington, is thesound of roosters crowing while you wait for the El at Huntingdon Station. It’s the old murals on thesides of homes, vibrant as ever. It’s the old men playing checkers in the park, your neighbors freestyling on thestoop for hours. It’s merengue and maduros at the annual Puerto Rican Parade. When you livesomewhere that tends to make headlines for gun violence instead of its positive contributions to local life, youstart to realize a few things. The first is that many media outlets are quick to report that there was anothershooting on yourstreet, but have little to offer those of us confronting the violence up close. The next is that your neighbors have lots of ideas and questions about keeping their familiessafe and recovering from traumas, but information that directly meets their needs can be hard to find. Finally, it becomes clear that ifsuch a resource existed, there’s a chance it could help change the path your community is on., a new project from The Trace, will try to do just that. As the community outreach editor in charge of the effort, I’vespent the last few months listening to Philadelphians’ urgent concerns regarding gun violence,safety, policing, and justice. Working with local media partners and journalists, we’ve begun to gather essential information on organizations that address those concerns. The first phase of Up the Block, produced in collaboration with Billy Penn at WHYY, builds on their indispensable list of resources for healing and rebuilding aftershootings. Early thissummer, we’ll launch asimple website that makessuch vital info — where to find financial help for the funeral of a gun violence victim, bilingualservices forshootingsurvivors, and much more — radically accessible. As Up the Block gets rolling, we’ll add information onsafe havens and opportunities for young people threatened by gun violence. And we’ll gather ways that Philadelphians, especially Black and Latinx community members, can makesure their voices are heard by leaders as the city considers new approaches to violence prevention. Tospread the word about the resource guides we’re compiling, we’llseek partnerships with organizations that meet information needs outside of the media, like places of worship,schools, and food hubs. Up the Block will also distribute knowledge offline, through things like mailings, flyers, and community bulletin boards. Throughout the process, I’ll continue to connect with my neighbors to understand how their perspectives and questions are evolving, using that input to improve the project. I came to The Trace to do this work because as a nonprofit news organization, it’s committed to having a positive impact on the communities it covers. Since 2015, The Trace has reported on the extent of the gun violence epidemic in the United States, the uniquely American factors that have allowed it to run rampant, and the people working hard to try to curb the violence. Typically, that reporting has taken the traditional forms: investigations, profiles, policy articles. With Up the Block, we’ll use journalism to provide a more directservice, creating a hub of information for folksstruggling through issues relating to gun violence on a neighborhood level. While our most essential collaborators will be everyday Philadelphians affected by or working to reduceshootings, Up the Block will also draw inspiration from the media organizations already finding creative ways to meet community information needs. Billy Penn, Resolve Philly, The Philadelphia Center for Gun Violence Reporting, and Free Press are pioneers in the kind ofservice journalism to which we hope to contribute. We’re excited to join them in their efforts. Philadelphia had nearly 500homicides in 2020, including an alarming65.3 percent increase in childshootings, and we have already had nearly 300shootings during the first months of 2021. This violence disproportionately kills and injures Black Philadelphians, who make up82 percent ofshooting victims, but just43.6 percent of the population. Throughout my conversations with Philadelphians, I’ve heard how heavily gun violence weighs on many of us. I’vespoken with Black mothers who want to know how to keep their childrensafe when they’re out playing, and young Black men looking for guidance on building a life after incarceration on gun charges. On local radioshows like G-Town Radio, I’ve listened to lifelong Philadelphians asking how they can get involved in local politics to influence gun violencesolutions. We’re building Up the Block to try to provide those answers and fill other information gaps that peopleshare with us in the months ahead. So if you’re reading this as a fellow Philadelphian: Let’s talk. Do you have questions about recovering from, avoiding, or preventing gun violence in your city?

President Joe Biden took the oath of office Wednesday and delivered astandard politicalspeech filled with platitudes about truth, justice, and the American way that have taken on renewed resonance in the wake of Donald Trump’s four-year assault on democracy that culminated in a physical attack on the U. S. Capitol itself.“Democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,” Biden declared. “So now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violencesought toshake the Capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power.”It was astark tonalshift from former President Trump, whose inauguralspeech promised to end an era of “American carnage”—and whose four years in the White House delivered just the opposite. Biden’sspeech was practically the only normal thing about this Inauguration Day. The inauguration ceremony was held on the verysteps where an angry pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol just two weeks ago. For the first time in a century and a half, the outgoing president refused to attend. The coronavirus and heightened threats of violence meant there was no crowd of average Americansspread across the National Mall. The dignitaries present were masked andspread out atsocially distancedseats to keep the inauguration from becoming asuperspreader event. Almost 25,000 troops were on hand to ensure a “peaceful transition” of power. National Guard troops were activated around the country to ensure against right-wing extremist attacks.“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural vs. urban, conservative vs. liberal”“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural vs. urban, conservative vs. liberal. We can do this, if we open oursouls instead of hardening our hearts,” Bidensaid in a plea for unity for a nation divided. Biden faces a tall task. His concrete goal of 100 million COVID-19 vaccines in the first 100 days of his presidency could prove difficult following the Trump administration’s disastrous initial distribution rollout. The current COVID rate is near the highest it’s been, and there’s evidence that newstrains of the coronavirus are leading to aspike in infections. Biden’s campaign pledge to “restore thesoul” of America could prove an even tougher goal: Three-quarters of Trump’ssupporters believe his lie that Bidenstole the election, and 71 percent of Americans in a recentCBS/YouGovsurveysaid that democracy and the rule of law are threatened. And while Democrats have won control of Washington, their majorities are about assmall as can be. The Senate issplit 50-50, while Democrats have just a fewseats’ cushion in the House. While Biden’s address preached unity, he made clear that didn’t mean appeasing the enemies of democracy. Bidenspecifically called out whitesupremacy by name, and drew a direct line between the falsehood-laden right-wing echo chamber that Trump has trumpeted and the January 6 attacks on Congress.“Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth, and there are lies. Lies told for power, and for profit. We need to have asense of duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution to protect our nation, to defend the truth, to defeat the lies,” hesaid. With a nation as polarized as it’s been in at least a half-century and a large chunk of America believing Trump’s lies that Bidenstole the election, that may be his toughest challenge.",1,1,Vice

That briefing of Trump was used as a pretext to legitimize the debunked dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign and compiled by a foreign intelligence officer who was working for asanctioned Russian oligarch.“Holy crap,” an agent responded. “All the analysts too?”“Yep,” the first agentsaid. “All the folks at the Agency as well.”“[C]an I ask who are the most likely litigators?” an agent responded. “[A]s far as potentiallysuing y’all[?]”“[H]aha, who knows…. I think [t]he concern when we got it was that there was a big leak at DOJ and the NYT among others was going to do a piece,” the first agentsaid. While the names of the agents responsible for the texts are redacted, the legal filing from Powell, quoting communications from the Department of Justice,states that the latest document production included handwritten notes and texts from Peter Strzok, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, and FBI analysts who worked on the FBI’s investigation of Flynn. Agents alsosaid they were worried about how a new attorney general might view the actions taken against Trump during the investigation. Shortly after then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) was confirmed to be Trump’s new attorney general, congressional Democrats, media, and Obama holdovers within DOJ immediately moved to force Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the department’s investigations against Trump.“[T]he new AG might havesome questions….then ya da ya da yada…we all getscrewed,” one agent wrote. The FBI agents also discussed how the investigation’s leadership was consumed with conspiracy theories rather than evidence.“I’m tel lying [sic] man, if this thing ever gets FOIA’d, there are going to besome tough questions asked,” one agent wrote. “[A]nd a great deal of those will be related to Brian having ascope way outside the boundaries of logic[.]”“[REDACTED] is one of the worst offenders of the rabbit holes and conspiracy theories,” an agent texted. “This guy traveled with that guy, who put down 3rd guy as his visasponsor. 3rd guy lives near a navy base, therefore…[.]”Several textsshow that the order to close the criminal investigation against Flynn came as early as Nov. 8, 2016, thesame day as the 2016 presidential election. It was later re-opened in early January of 2017.“We havesome loose ends to tie up, and we all need to meet to discuss what to do with each case (hesaidshut down Razor),” one agent texted, referring to Crossfire Razor, the FBI’s internal code name for the investigation of Flynn.“[S]o glad they’re closing Razor,” an agent responded. The new disclosures made by DOJ alsoshow that the FBI usedso-called nationalsecurity letters (NSLs) tospy on Flynn’s finances. Unlike traditionalsubpoenas, which require judicial review and approval before authorities canseize an innocent person’s property and information, NSLs are never independently reviewed by courts. One of the agents noted in a text message that the NSLs were just being used as a pretext by FBI leadership to buy time to find dirt on Flynn after the first investigation of him yielded no derogatory information.“[T]he decision to NSL finances for Razor bought him time,” one agentsaid nearly two weeks after the initial order toshut down the anti-Flynn case. It is not known to whom the agent was referring in that text.“What do we expect to get from an NSL[?]” an agent text ed on Dec. 5, 2016. “We put out traces, trip wires to community and nothing.”“[B]ingo,” another FBI agent responded. “[S]o what’s an NSL going to do – no content.”“Hahah this is a nightmare,” an agentsaid.“If we’re working to close down the cases, I’m notsure what NSL results would do to help,” one agent wrote.“[E]xactly that makes nosense,” an agent wrote back. The explosive new text messages alsoshow agents believed the investigation was being run by FBI officials who were in the tank for Hillary Clinton.“[D]oing all this election research – I thinksome of these guys want a [C]linton presidency,” one agent wrote on Aug. 11,shortly after the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation against Trump. In oneseries of textssent thesame day as the infamous Jan. 5 Oval Office meeting between Obama, Biden, Comey, Sally Yates, and Susan Rice, one agent admits that “Trump was right” when he tweeted that the FBI was delaying his briefings as incoming presidentso they could cook up evidence against him. As The Federalist first reported last May, that Jan. 5 meeting was the key to understanding the entire anti-Trump operation run out of Obama’s FBI.“The ‘Intelligence’ briefing onso-called ‘Russian hacking’ was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case,” Trump tweeted on January 3. “Verystrange!”“So razor is going tostay open???” an agent wrote on Jan. 5.“[Y]ep,” another FBI agent responded. “[C]rimes report being drafted.”“F,” the first agent wrote back.“[W]hat’s the word on how [Obama’s] briefing went?” one agent asked, referring to the Jan. 5 meeting.“Dont know but people here arescrambling for info tosupport certain things and its a mad house,” an FBI agent responded.“[J]esus,” an agent wrote back. “[T]rump was right. [S]till not put together….why do we do this to ourselves. [W]hat is wrong with these people[?]?A week later, the FBI agents also wrote that theysuspected that the illegal leak of topsecret information about Flynn’s phone calls with Russian ambassador to the U. S. Sergei Kislyak to the news media came directly from the White House.“FYI –someone leaked the Flynn calls with Kislyak to the WSJ,” the agent wrote.“I’msorry to hear that,” another FBI agent respondedsarcastically. “I’ll resume my duties as Chief Morale Officer and rectify that.”“Published this morning by Ignatius,” an agentsaid, referencing the Jan. 12 column from Washington Post writer David Ignatius that included leaked top-secret information about Flynn’s calls with Kislyak.“It’s got to besomeone onstaff,” an agent wrote. “[Presidential Daily Briefing]staff. Or WHseniors.”To date, not asingle person has been charged with illegally leaking that information to the Washington Post as a way of damaging Flynn and the incoming Trump administration. Following a review of the federal government’s investigation by U. S. Attorney Jeff Jensen, which was ordered by Attorney General William Barr, the government moved to dismiss all charges against Flynnthat had been previously brought by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Documents unearthed during Jensen’s reviewshowed that before the FBI was tasked by the Obama White House in early 2017 with re-targeting Flynn, the agency closed a previous investigation against him because there was no proof of any criminal wrongdoing. Jensen’s review also uncovered evidence that the FBI’s interview of Flynn, which later led to charges that he lied to FBI investigators, had no legal basis and that the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe that he had lied. Contrary to claims by Mueller’s office that Flynn had lied about discussing financialsanctions against Russia during post-election phone calls with Russian Ambassador to the U. S. Sergei Kislyak, declassified transcripts of those conversations confirmed that Flynnspoke to Kislyak only about expulsions of Russian diplomatsand that the two men never discussed financialsanctions against Russia that had previously been levied by the Obama administration. Jensen’s review of Flynn’s case file also revealed handwritten notes from the FBI’s top counterintelligence official that admit teda primary goal of the FBI’s anti-Flynn operation was “to get him to lieso we can prosecute him or get him fired.”Despite the overwhelming evidence that Flynn did not lie to agents, the FBI had no legal basis to interview him, that the FBI later hid exculpatory documents from Flynn’s defense team, Flynn did not discuss financialsanctions during his phone calls with Kislyak, and the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe he lied, federal trial Judge Emmet G. Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case against Flynn. Instead, Sullivanpersonally appointed a left-wingshadow prosecutor, whose partners represent former DOJ official Yates, tosmear Flynn and attempt to continue the baseless criminal case against him. At one point last April, Sullivan even tried to order the DOJ tostop producing and publicly filing exculpatory evidence for Flynnor evidence of FBI misbehavior during its investigation of Flynn. Sullivan, who called Flynn a traitor during court proceedings andsuggested that Flynn — a decorated Army combat veteran — be charged with treason, has refused to recuse himself from the case despite his obvious personal animosity toward Flynn.",0,0,The Federalist
426,Dr. Anthony Fauci says publicly released email about lab leak is being misconstrued,-2.33,42.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/03/health/anthony-fauci-emails/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,24,"In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Dr. Anthony Faucisaid that an email he received last year from an executive at the US-based EcoHealth Alliance has been misconstrued and offered a hint of regret about a February 2020 email downplaying the need to wear a mask. Earlier this week,news outlets including CNN,BuzzFeed NewsandThe Washington Postobtained thousands of em ails Faucisent and receivedsince the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases became a household name early last year. In one emailsent to Fauci last April, an executive at EcoHealth Alliance, the global nonprofit that helped fundsome research at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, thanked Fauci for publiclystating thatscientific evidencesupports a natural origin for the coronavirus and not a lab release. (The origins of the virus remain unclear.)“There aresome of your critics whosay thisshows you have too cozy of a relationship with the people behind the Wuhan lab research,” CNN’s John Bermansaid to Fauci on New Day. “What do yousay to that?”Thousands of em ails from and to Fauci during the pandemic's early days were published. Here's what theyshow about him“That’s nonsense,” Fauci responded. “I don’t evensee how they get that from that email.”Fauci then emphasized that the email wassent to him, and he noted the origins of the coronavirus arestill uncertain.“I have alwayssaid, and willsay today to you, John, that Istill believe the most likely origin is from an animalspecies to a human, but I keep an absolutely open mind that if there may be other origins of that, there may be another reason, it could have been a lab leak,” Fauci told Berman. “I believe if you look historically, what happens in the animal-human interface, that in fact the more likelihood is that you’re dealing with a jump ofspecies. But I keep an open mind all the time. And that’s the reason why I have been public that weshould continue to look for the origin.“You can misconstrue it however you want – that email was from a person to mesaying ‘thank you’ for whatever it is he thought Isaid, and Isaid that I think the most likely origin is a jumping ofspecies. Istill do think it is, at thesame time as I’m keeping an open mind that it might be a lab leak.”In another emailsent to Fauci on April 16, NIH director Francis Collins wrote “conspiracy theory gains momentum,” a reference to the lab-leak hypothesis. But much of the email is redacted, and Faucisaid he did not remember itssubstance.“They only took about 10,000 em ails from me, of course I remember. I remember all 10,000 of them. Give me a break,” hesaid. “I don’t remember what’s in that redacted, but the idea I think is quite farfetched that the Chinese deliberately engineeredsomethingso that they could kill themselves as well as other people. I think that’s a bit far out, John.”What Fauci's em ails reveal -- and what they don'tBerman also brought up a February 5, 2020, email Faucisent to Sylvia Burwell, formersecretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, in which he did not recommend wearing a masksinceshe was traveling to a low-risk location. The email wassent at a time before coronavirus was declared a pandemic and before theCDC advised the public to wear masks for protection.“A lot has transpiredsince then. If you had to go back and do it all over again, would you tell hersomething different? Do you regret that?” Berman asked Fauci.“Let’s get real here – if you look atscientific information as it accumulates, what is going on in January and February, what you know as a fact, as data, guides what you tell people and your policies. If March, April, May occur, you accumulate a lot more information and you modify and adjust your opinion and your recommendation based on the currentscience and current data,” Fauci told Berman.“So of course, if we knew back then that asubstantial amount of transmission was asymptomatic people. If we knew that the datashow that masks outside of a hospitalsetting actually do work when we didn’t know it then. If we realize all of those things back then, of course,” hesaid. “You’re asking a question, ‘Would you dosomething different if you know what you know now?’ Of course people would have done that. That’sso obvious.”CNN’s Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",1,1,CNN

Gretchen Whitmer called on legislators to pass a law requiring residents tow ear masks in indoor places and crowded outdoor areas. The governorsaidshesent a letter to Republican lawmakers this week asking them to pass a bill. Lawmakers, especially Republicans leading the House and Senate, have asked to have more of a role in the process of tackling the pandemic, Whitmer noted. Now is their time to act.""This is the law under epidemic orders. But we do think it would be helpful to our health, oursafety and our economy if it was codified in a bipartisan (manner at) the Legislature, and that's what we've asked for, "" Whitmersaid.""We've known for a long time that thesingle most important weapon that we have against this virus is thesimple task of wearing a mask.""State health orders issued in October already require mask wearing in public. Yet case rates continue to rise. While Whitmersaidshe thinks putting the requirement in law would likely encourage Michiganders to take the precaution moreseriously,she knows people are tired and frustrated.""We are all tired of dealing with COVID. And yet ignoring the problem is making it worse,"" Whitmersaid.""I think fatigue is a part of it, I think the political rhetoric has created a lot of confusion and unnecessarysuspicion around the efficacy of masks. However,studies haveshown this remains the best tool that we have.""Whitmersaidstate health and labor officials are also ""increasingscrutiny"" of remote work policies, especially for employers requiringstaff to work on-site. Thestate may cite employers, require changes and issue fines of up to $7,000, Whitmersaid. The comments came thesame day Michigan recorded its highest number of cases in any daysince thestart of the pandemic: 5,710. That brings thestate's total case count to more than 197,800. Theseven-day average daily case rate is above 3,500, much higher than at any point in the pandemic. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun,state medical executive,said the percentage of positive tests is averaging 7.5%, though it exceeded 10% on Monday and Tuesday. Hospitalizations are four times higher now than they were at the end of August, and 60% are outside ofsoutheast Michigan. More than 7,400 people have died from the coronavirus. There were more deaths in Michigan in October from the disease than in any monthsince May. About 2,300 people are now hospitalized in Michigan with COVID-19symptoms,said Dr. Adnan Munkarah, Henry Ford Health System's executive vice president and chief clinical officer.""It is definitely taxing all health caresystems and hospitals across thestate,"" hesaid. The Detroit-based healthsystem has re-activated its incident command center to allow it to ""make rapid changes as needed to accommodate the increasing number of patients"" who have COVID-19, Munkarahsaid. About 18% to 20% of the COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized at Henry Ford need to be admitted to intensive care units, hesaid, but fewer are in need of ventilatorsupport.""Part of this is because we've learned much more about the disease over the past few months and how to manage it differently where we do not feel that we need to put people on respirators or ventilatorsso early,"" Munkarahsaid. For the time being, no elective procedures or medicalservices are limited at Henry Ford because of the rising coronavirus hospitalizations, but Munkarahsaid: ""We are going to continue to monitor things very, very closely.""But one of the biggest concerns he has is whether Henry Ford and other hospitalsstatewide will have enoughstaff to get through thissurge. Withso much communityspread of the virus, hospital workers are at higher risk of contracting the virus just as everyone else. And if they getsick, Munkarah asked: ""Are we going to have enoughstaff to take care of patients in the hospital?""“If we don’t do anything else, if we don’t change our behaviors, we could beseeing 100 deaths per day by the end of December,"" Khaldunsaid.“We are really at a tipping point right now when it comes to COVID-19. … Our rates are rising exponentially. “What it’s like to vote when you have COVID-19Michigan coronavirus cases: Tracking the pandemicIn late October,state health officials announced it would be continuing regulations and restrictions intended to mandate mask wearing while in public, limit crowdsizes at private gatherings and in business, and generally promote actions that willstop thespread of the disease. That included requiring restaurants to keep contact information for patrons, in order to ease any potential contact tracing efforts.

Michigansets new restrictions on dining, gatherings as COVID-19 cases riseCoronavirus Watch: Where cases are increasingHealth officials hurriedly issued asimilar order in early October in response to Michigan Supreme Court rulings. The court, in asplit decision, essentially invalidated executive orders put in place by Whitmer. The court determined one law Whitmer had relied upon was unconstitutional, and asecond law required Whitmer to obtain approval from the Legislature ifshe wanted to extend astate of emergency. State health officials issued the restrictions under a completelyseparate law that was not in any way affected by the court's ruling.""We have to get the politics out of the public health crisis. It is killing us. It is jeopardizing our economy ... today, the most important tool that we have is a mask. And every one of us has an interest in masking up,"" Whitmersaid Thursday.

For antigen tests, the positivity rate for thesame period was 7.93%. A molecular test is considered more accurate and issometimes also called a PCR test; an antigen test is also called a rapid test. Gov. Greg Abbott hassaid a positivity rate above 10% is cause for concern. Texas isset to receive asignificantly higher number of COVID-19 vaccines in the coming week, thestate health departmentsaid. Providers will receive 520,425 first doses of the vaccine and 188,225second doses for people vaccinated a few weeks ago. The additional doses are largely due to a 30% increase in the number of Moderna vaccines being provided by the federal government, thestatesaid. The increase is also due to an additional 126,750 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which were initiallyset aside for the federalPharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, being returned to thestate.

AfterGeorge Floyd’s killing by a police officer in May 2020,activists protesting racial discrimination and excessive use of force by police called on cities to""defund the police.""Whilesome protesters want to eliminate police departments entirely, others want to revisit the functions of police departments and reroutesome police funding toward otherservices. Thesix cities flagged by DeSantis did not abolish police departments or cancel their budgets. But they approved less funding for police departments for fiscal 2021. Some responded by transferring police duties to other city departments, eliminating funding earmarked for overtime pay, imposed hiring freezes, among other measures. The cities made budget changes to fiscal years thatstarted as early as July 1, 2020, and as late as Jan. 1, 2021. PolitiFact reached out to each of thesix cities to learn more about their budget changes and howsignificant they were in relation to the overall police budget. We heard back from most, but got limited information. In Philadelphia, a $33 million cut to the police budget represents about 4.5% of the department’s adopted general fund budget of $727 million. New York City officials last years aid they agreed to remove $1 billion from the police department’sspending. (The Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group,said the net reduction to the police budgetso far has been about $477 million.) The department’stotal budget for 2021was $10.2 billion. Los Angeles cut $150 million from the police operating budget. The department’s 2021budgetis more than $1.7 billion. Minneapolis officials in Decembersaidtheyshifted $7.8 million from the proposed police budget to other city departments. Overall, the city approved$164 million for the police department. (The city’s fiscal year runs concurrently with the calendar year.)The Austin American-Statesmanreportedon a $150 million cut to the police budget, which represents about one-third of the police budget. But cityspokesperson Jaquarry Wilson disputed the characterization of funds being cut,saying $121.7 million ""wassimply moved into two transition funds"" while citystaff determines whichservices can be offered by other city departments. Another $31.5 million was reinvested in other communitysafety initiatives in other departments, Wilsonsaid. DeSantis’ claim did not take into consideration how crime manifested nationally in 2020. Many citiessawspikes in homicides in 2020, regardless of changes to their police budgets. Crime increases are likely the result of the ""social disorganization"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic,said Samuel Walker, an emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Social disorganization involves a weakening of the basic bonds ofsocial control,such as good employment andstable families. Nationwide, murder went up every quarter of 2020 compared with the respective quarters in 2019, according to preliminary FBI data. The number of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses increased 14.8% nationwide in the first half of 2020 compared with thesame period in 2019, according to preliminary data reported to the FBI by more than 12,000 U. S. law enforcement agencies. At thesame time, the FBIsaid there were overall declines in the number of violent crimes and property crimes.""The complicated drivers of 2020's large murder increase were clearly already well established before budget cuts for 2021 were passed,""said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics. Some of the local news reports offered by DeSantis’ office also compared homicides in 2021 with 2020. One report focused on New York City murders over the first 10 days of 2021 versus the first 10 days of 2020;anotherlooked at Philadelphia homicides from the beginning of 2021 through mid-March, compared with thesame period in 2020. Short-term homicide data can be ""notoriously unreliable,""said Michael Campbell, a criminologist at the University of Denver. Homicides are relatively rare compared with other crimes, leading to large fluctuations in the homicide rates.""However, everything points to a broad up tick in homicide, domestic violence, gun crimes and otherserious offenses,"" Campbellsaid. ""Things are bad everywhere and it’s easy to point at these big cities but it’s impossible to determine any clear relationship and I’d besurprised if one ever emerges.""Cuts in police funding don’t automatically mean the department will make a decision that puts publicsafety at risk. When police departments have a reduced budget, they try to make adjustments thatspareservices for citizens or affect their perception ofsafety,said Kevin Robinson, a lecturer at Arizona State University's School of Criminology & Criminal Justice. Departments, for example, could opt to replace a patrol vehicle every five years instead of four,said Robinson, whoserved in the Phoenix Police Department for nearly 40 years. Bloomberg CityLabanalyzedthe 2021 police budgets of the 50 largest U. S. cities in January. On the whole, the cities’ police budgets were reduced by 5.2%. Butspending on police as ashare of general expenditures roseslightly to 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021,Tampaamong them, Bloomberg reported. Tampa city officials in September voted to increase the police department’s budget by $13 million for fiscal 2021, to $176 million. The Tampa Bay Times around mid-Novemberreportedthat Tampa, like other cities nationwide,saw an up tick in murders in 2020 compared with 2019. DeSantissaid, ""If you look atsome of these places that (cut police funding), they’ve alreadyseen crime go up.""An element of truth in DeSantis’ claim is that crime went up insix major cities. But hesaid it was because of budget cuts, when murder and gun violence were already trending up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets. None of the budget changes have been in place for a whole year,so it’s too early to tell the extent of their impact on crime, if any. A proper assessment would control for many factors that influence criminal activity, expertssaid. We rate DeSantis’ claim Mostly False.",1,2,Politifact

Ron DeSantis, ordered allschool districts to provide face-to-face classes - ""barring astate or local health directive to the contrary.""Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando SentinelDr. Raul Pino, thestate health department's officer in Orange County,speaks during a press conference in Orlando on Thursday, June 18, 2020. Want to hear a bunch on unintelligible nonsense?(Yes, beyond what you normally find in this column.)Ask anystate official in Florida to explain who’s personally responsible for deciding whether it’ssafe forschools to offer in-person classes this fall. You’ll hear asteady ofstream of words that don’t answer the question orsometimes even form cohesive thoughts. It’s like trying to divine quantum physics from a babbling baby. And it allseems designed to ensure that none of the people demanding openschools bear any responsibility if things go wrong. But don’t take it from me. In fact, today, we’re going to dosomething different:Youget to be the journalist. I am going to give you the verbatim transcripts of what these peoplesay, and you decide whether it makessense. My quest for direct answers began after I readseveralstories out of South Florida whereschool leaders alleged thatstate health officials had been muzzled. School officials theresaid they couldn’t get the health officials to providestraight answers about whether it wassafe to open. The Palm Beach County School Board chair claimed thestate’s top health official there had been “politicallysilenced by Tallahassee” and “told to keep her mouthshut.”Now, I know politicians can be gross. But thisseemed beyond the pale. So Isoughtstraight answers myself. Istarted with Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran’sschools-must-open order. He issued it thesame day President Trump tweeted: “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!”Corcoran’s order demanded in-person classes in every district but claimed to allow an exception for any district that received “astate or local health directive to the contrary.”Well, thatseemssimple enough, right? Itsounded like a county health director would be the obvious person to provide a “local health directive.”Maybe, I thought, there was just confusion in Palm Beach. Certainly Orange County’s chief health officer wouldspeak up. However, Orange School Board members reported nosuch luck with Dr. Raul Pino. “We did not get a direct answer,” board member Pam Gould told the Sentinel. Thatseemedstrange. But I knew Dr. Pino was respected. So I wanted to hear itstraight from him. And I wasn’t alone. At a press conference last Friday, a TV reporter asked Pino thesamestraightforward question: “Who has the authority to open or keep theschools closed?”Here was his response:“So the interesting thing about the orders is that Iworkfor the Florida Department of Health. But I am not the Florida Department of Health.”He went on tosay: “I am an employee of thestate Health Department who is assigned in Orange County to work for Orange County and the Orange County government. But the reality is thestate health department and the head of the health department is thestatesurgeon general, not me.”Um, OK. So maybe thestatesurgeon general? Except we haven’t heard much from him. In fact, the governor’sstaff actually yanked Surgeon General Scott Rivkees from a press briefing in April when Rivkees went offscript andstarted warning Floridians tostay away from each other. (See theNewsweek piece: “Florida Surgeon General Removed from Governor DeSantis’ Coronavirus Briefing After Saying Social Distancing Necessary Until There’s A Vaccine.”)Also, Orangeschool officialssaid they asked Tallahassee for a waiver and haven’t received a response. Most importantly, thesurgeon general isn’t a “local” official. And Corcoan’s ordersaid a “local” health directive was one of the only ways aschool district could avoid his mandate to open. So I went back to Corcoran to ask him if he could explain his own order: Whospecificallyshould provide the “local health directive”?Corcoran didn’t respond. But a member of his communications team did. Here’s whatshesaid:(It’sslightly pared down, butstill long because I wanted you tosee what Isaw.)“Florida Department of Education Order 2020-EO-06gives ultimate authority to determine when and how to openschools to localschool boards and governing boards. The Department of Health, through the county health departments,serves as a resource to theschool districts on how to openschools in thesafest manner and what mitigationstrategies to employ at the time and in the manner determined by the localschool districts. … The county health department works collaboratively with the localsuperintendent,school district andschool board to provide county data and trends and educate on mitigationstrategies to make theschool environment assafe as possible.…Section 154.01, Florida Statutes,lays out the county health department deliverysystem, which intends for the Department of Health to aid counties in the promotion of public health and control of preventable diseases. Thesamesection provides that counties may enter into cooperative contracts with DOH, and that DOHshall enter thesame. 154.01(1) and (3), Florida Statutes.”Remember, the question wassimply: Whichspecificlocal health official is empowered to make the call?I wondered if maybe I was no longer capable of processing basic information. So Ishared her response with my editor and asked if hesaw an answer to my question anywhere in that mountain of words.“Hmmm,” he responded. “I think what they’re trying tosay is pjljaghsodsljfan08mvo.”I concurred. My take-away is that Gov. Ron DeSantis and his education commissioner wanted to issue asweepingschools-must-open order like Trump wanted, but they also know there aresafety risks. So they included an out, givingsome theoretical “local” health expert the chance to object, but empowering no one to actually doso. Suddenly, no one’s really accountable. But hey, maybe you disagree. Maybe after hearing thestatesayschool boardsshould work with “county health departments” — whosay they aren’t the ones whoshould make that call — it all makes perfectsense to you.

Rand Paul (R-KY) is planning to introduce legislation to revoke a federal mask mandate for travelers on airplanes. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has continued to mandate that all travelers wear masks on airplanes with limited exceptions as manystate governments have rolled back COVID-19 restrictions. The current TSA mandate is in place until at least September 13.“When the Senate returns tosession, I will be introducing an immediate repeal of the mask mandate on planes. Enough! Time tostop this farce and let people travel in peace!” Paul tweeted on Thursday. When the Senate returns tosession, I will be introducing an immediate repeal of the mask mandate on planes. Enough! Time tostop this farce and let people travel in peace!— Rand Paul (@RandPaul)July 8, 2021Paul has needled public health experts and the Biden administration for months over health restrictions put in place over COVID-19. Paul has argued against requiring masks for anyone who is vaccinated or who has already contracted and recovered from COVID-19. In March, PaulgrilledNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci over his use of masks despite being vaccinated. At the time, Fauci had been acting in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC later retracted their guidance andsaid that vaccinated people do not need to wear face masks. Paul went after Fauci during a March 18 committee hearing for playing “theater” with masks. As The Daily Wire reported:Paul has also grilled Fauci on funding for the lab in Wuhan that is a place of interest as a potential origin point for the COVID-19 virus. Fauci denied that the U. S. had ever funded the type of research that potentially led to the COVID-19 outbreak. Paul pushed, however, citing a 2014 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) grant to an organization called EcoHealth Alliance that, in turn, donated funds to the Wuhan lab.

The incidentset off alarm bells within the US government and left Burns “fuming” with anger, onesource explained. Some officials at the CIA viewed the chilling episode as a direct message to Burns that no one issafe, including those working directly for the nation’s topspy, twosourcessaid. The event marks thesecond time in less than a month that reported cases of the mysterious illness have impacted the international travel of top Biden administration officials. Last month Vice President Kamala Harris’s visit to Vietnam wasslightly delayed when multiple US personnel reportedsymptoms consistent with thesyndrome just ahead of her visit, and at least two of them had to be medevaced. Under Burns and the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, the intelligence community has undertaken a wide-ranging investigation into the mysterious attacks, including a 100-day probe into the potential causes that began earlier thissummer. While that investigation is expected to be concluded before the end of the year the time frame could besomewhat adjusted and there is no public report planned, twosourcessaid.“We don’t comment onspecific incidents or officers. We have protocols in place for when individuals report possible anomalous health incidents that include receiving appropriate medical treatment,” a CIAspokespersonsaid. “We will keep doing everything we can to protect our officers.”Thesituation in India could have dramatic implications: the CIA director’sschedule is tightly held and there are deep concerns among US officials about how the perpetrator would have known about the visit and been able to plan forsuch an aggression. The person traveling with Burns who experienced thesymptoms in India received immediate medical attention when they returned to the US,sourcessaid. US investigators havestruggled to determine what or who is causing the mysterioussymptoms, and how exactly they are doing it. Incidents of Havanasyndrome began in late 2016 in Cuba and there havesince been cases reported in Russia, China, Austria and other countries across the globe. CNN has previously reported that incidents also took place on USsoil, including twostaff members of then-President Donald Trump’s nationalsecurity council who werestruck near entrance points to the White House. The ongoing incidents have put US diplomats and intelligence officials on edge leading up to the UN General Assembly in New York this week where diplomats from around the world – including many US diplomats – will convene in close quarters. Only a handful of the total reported incidents have occurred on USsoil, but the gathering in New York is always viewed as a target-rich environment for espionage. President Joe Biden was recently updated on the overallsituation – including the fact that there are more than 300 possible cases, the kind of medicalsupport being provided to those impacted, and the investigation into the matter that is led by the intelligence community. Over thesummer the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, launched the 100-day investigation into the “mechanism” behind the incidents, and efforts that could be taken to defend against the attacks. Putting a time frame on it was part of an effort to drum up the intensity of the investigative effort, but the deadline could be extended if that is needed,sourcessaid. There are also other ongoing investigations by the US intelligence community focused on the question of the perpetrator behind the incidents, which the US government calls anomalous health incidents or AHIs, and what the US can do to defend against these incidents. The US government is “pursuing multiple lines of effort” to investigate the Havanasyndrome, a CIAspokespersonsaid. Thespokesperson added that one of those efforts is led by ODNI and CIA officers as well as the outsidescientific community to “to work collectively to increase our understanding of the possible mechanisms that could be causing AHIs.”Since Biden took office his nationalsecurity team has been keenly focused on probing the mysterious incidents and getting impacted US personnel the assistance they need. Secretary of State Tony Blinkenspoke with US diplomats affected by the Havanasyndrome earlier this month which marked his first meeting with those impacted, according to a State Department Spokesperson. The conversation came after CNNreported of frustration among rank-and-filestaffers about how the department had handled the mysterious incidents. Lawmakers were initially critical of the Biden administration for notsharing regular updates on the mysterious incidents. But in recent months the administration, in an effort led by Burns, have made changes to the processes andsupport for those impacted and personnel working on those efforts.“We’vestrengthened efforts to determine the origins of the incidents, including assembling a team of our very best experts – bringing an intensity and expertise to this issue akin to our efforts to find bin Laden,” a CIAspokespersonsaid. “Thesenior officer who leads the teamspent more than a decade on counterterrorism issues and was a driving force in CIA’s analytic and targeting work that led us to find bin Laden.”Still, the incidents have continued to occur, leaving US diplomats and US intelligence officers on edge as they take on new assignments overseas.",2,1,CNN
436,The corporate conflicts of Trump's new coronavirus advisor,-12.25,39.25,https://popular.info/p/the-corporate-conflicts-of-trumps,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-01,18,"Anthony Fauci, one of the nation's leading experts on infectious diseases, has beensidelined. Fauci has not appeared with Trump at a coronavirus briefingsince April 22. Instead, Fauci has attempted to communicate accuratescientific information through media appearances — while Trump undermines Fauci's message via Twitter. Trump has installed Scott Atlas, a frequent guest on Fox News, to effectively replace Fauci. Although Atlas is a doctor, he is wildly unqualified for the role. Atlas is not an infectious disease expert or epidemiologist. He isa radiologist. His159-page CVcontains no references to ""epidemiology,"" ""epidemic,"" ""virus,"" or ""viral.""Atlas' primary qualification is that het ells Trump what he wants to hear. Atlas has called for the reopening ofschools, raised doubts about the efficacy of masks, criticized lockdowns, and downplayed the importance of testing. These positions are notsupported by reliablescientific evidence. And they are rejected bysubject-matter experts. But those positions, because they are favored by Trump, have put Atlas at the center of the federal government response to the pandemic. Atlas,according to Politico, is ""part of a tiny group of advisers who meet every morning to chart the daily response to Covid-19."" The group also includes Jared Kushner and Steven Miller, two other people with no qualifications to be involved insuch an effort. On Monday, the Washington Postreportedthat Atlas is using his new influence to push Trump toward a ""herd immunity""strategy. That involves allowing the virus to quicklyspread through the population, while protectingsome vulnerable groups, to allow most people to build immunity to the coronavirus. It has been pursued in Sweden with disastrous results. Achieving herd immunity would require 65 to 70 percent of the American population to contract COVID-19. Assuming a 1% fatality rate, that would mean2.13 million deaths. Thestark numbers have not dissuaded Atlas. While promoting the reopening ofschools in Florida on Monday, Atlas described the potential for children tospread the virus to adults as ""icing on the cake.""But Atlas' issues extend beyond his lack of qualifications and dangerous policy prescriptions. He also holds numerous positions in the corporate world that create conflicts of interest. While playing a central role in the federal government's multi-trillion dollar coronavirus response, Atlas holds leadership and advisory positions with pharmaceutical companies, a healthcare diagnostic company, and a medical venture capital firm. Atlas is currently an ""international advisor"" and board member for TechTools, a medical venture capital firm based in Brazil. The company ""primarily invests in health technology and innovation."" Atlas' position at the center of the White House's pandemic response gives him valuable insight into what types of investments in the healthcare field are likely to be profitable. Atlas is also theChairman of the Boardof AlzecoBio, a ""healthcare diagnostic company."" The company is ""focused on developing novel MRI-based targeted imaging agents for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders."" While thisseems unrelated to the pandemic, the company is also astartup that has been actively raising money to fund its operations. Atlas' powerful role in the White House — and his influence over billions in pandemic response funds — could give him access to the investors he needs to grow the company. In preparation for Congressional testimony last December, Atlassubmitted his CV, dated September 1, 2019. Atlas' CV includes a list of ""Scientific and Medical Advisory Boards, and Corporate Boards, Current and Past.""That list reveals Atlas' ties toseveral pharmaceutical advisory boards. Specifically, Atlas is or was a member of advisory boards for Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi. While it is not known if Atlas is paid for his work, these ""positions typically pay well.""Sanofi is actively developing a vaccine candidate and has alreadysecured a $2.1 billion grant from the federal government for Project Warp Speed. Atlas may be holding an influential role in the White House's coronavirus response whilesimultaneously working with Sanofi. Atlas also reported asimilar role with Bristol Myers Squibb. Thatcompany""has a proof-of-concept clinical trial in progress to assess thesafety and efficacy of ORENCIA® (abatacept) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 due tosevere acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."" It is also ""one of 15 companies participating in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to identify concrete actions to accelerate treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics in the field.""Do Atlas' positions with pharmaceutical companies influence his views? He has consistently advocated policy positions that benefit the industry. For example, in a2018 column published on CNN, Atlas defended the drug industry's practice of charging Americans higher prices than the rest of the world. Notsurprisingly, prices and profit margins for prescription drugs in the United States dwarf those in foreign markets. It is obvious that economics represent a key incentive for the constant innovation and first access to life-saving drugs that Americans enjoy. Indeed, that is the conundrum: Thesame policies that are associated with the lower pricesseen in other countries -- price regulation and weaker patent rights -- are also those that are typically associated with delayed launches and reduced access to drugs. He wrotesimilar pieces, promoting positions favored by the pharmaceutical industry, in2017,2019, and2020.""The Trump Administration hasserious credibility problems right now when it comes to all thingsscience and public health. Elevating the voice ofsomeone withsuch close ties to the pharmaceutical industry andsuch dangerous views on how weshould be responding to COVID-19 is absolutely the wrong direction for them to be moving if they want to restore the public's trust,"" Eli Zupnick, aspokesman for the watchdog group Accountable Pharma,said. There is a lot we don't know about Atlas' financial conflicts. The White House has even ""declined tosay whether Atlas was receiving a taxpayer-fundedsalary.""It's part of a pattern ofshielding the people involved in the pandemic response from government rules around disclosure and conflicts of interest. Moncef Slaoui, who is heading up the White House's $10 billion vaccine development program, was hired as an ""outside contractor."" This allows him to lead the project while continuing ""to invest in pharmaceutical companies."" The arrangement also allows Slaoui ""to avoid disclosing potential conflicts of interest."" The White House has hired ""several other consultants"" with ties to the drug industry with thesame arrangement. Atlas' arrangement is even more opaque. There is no indication he was required tostep down from any of his corporate positions as a condition of accepting the role.

437,Popularity of Bail Funds Continue Protests’ Momentum,-11.33,48.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/popularity-of-bail-funds-continue-protests-momentum,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,23,"ATLANTA—On June 1, police officers had 20-year-old William Lefforge, and about 50 other protesters, boxed in on thesidewalk near Atlanta City Hall. The officers warned the protesters they had three minutes to leave, but according to Lefforge, the group could not get by the police. The police arrested them and transported Lefforge and his group to the Atlanta Detention Center. Lefforge estimated his arrest happened around 4 p.m., well before the 9 p.m. curfew that Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms hassince lifted.:Lefforge called his mother, Jen, who in turn reached out to the Atlanta Solidarity Fund. Thanks to the fund, Lefforge walked out of the detention center a little before midnight. He had only his release papers, which cited “pedestrian in the roadway” as his charge. Organizers were waiting in the parking lot across from the detention center to makesure protesters reached their homes. On June 4, Lefforge was at another protest. As historic protests against police brutality toward Black Americanssweep the United States,social media is littered with calls for donations to local bail funds. Those unable to join the front lines of protests are giving materialsupport by donating, according to protesters and organizers. The Atlanta Police Department reported it made298 arrestsin the first weekend of protests alone. An organizer with the Atlanta Solidarity Fund who asked to be identified only by his first name, Marlon,said protesters have been arrested for curfew violations, disorderly conduct, and even felony incitement to riot. With a felony charge, judges are more likely toset a higher bail—or deny it entirely. Keeping protesters in jail is the point, according to Marlon. Hesaid, “Not just in Atlanta, but around the country, police forces are waging a kind of war of attrition. Eventually people’s wallets will run out. Theirsafety nets will run out and they’ll have no choice but tostop protesting. When wesupport bail funds, we makesure [protesters] have that backing that they need tostay on thestreets as long as they need.”Even before the protests, bail was a costlysystem. A2017 report from UCLA’s Million Dollar Hoods research team found that “the money bailsystem is a multi-billion dollar toll that demands tens of millions of dollars annually in cash and assets fromsome of L. A.’s most economically vulnerable persons, families, and communities,” all before anyone has been found guilty. One factor driving up that total cost is the fact that judges frequentlyset higher bail for Black and Hispanicdefendants than for white defendants with thesame charge. Albert Corado, 31, is an organizer and police abolitionist with People’s City Council in Los Angeles. Coradosaid People’s City Council emerged after the city government’s lack of action in the face of the novel coronavirus’spread. “There was no rent relief, no tangible plan to help people. We were frustrated with city council and the mayor’s response,” hesaid. So the People’s City Council called for rentsuspension and commandeering hotels for Los Angeles’ unhoused population. It alsosupportedPeople’s Budget LA, which is focused on getting more funding tosocialservices like improved mental healthservices and public education, instead of funding the police. People’s City Council’s demand to de fund the police is now being echoed across the US. City councils arevotingtoslashpolice budgets and even heedingprotesters’ calls to defund. After the police killing of George Floyd, People’s City Council’s agenda expanded. Corado and nine other organizersstarted a GoFundMe to cover legal and medical costs for protesters, directsupport to Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, andsupplies for protest organizers. The group raised over$2 million. Coradosaid it is a hugesum of money for a few organizers to make decisions about, but they are committed to channeling the money tosupporting protests against police brutality. Corado also has a personal connection to recent appeals for de funding police. The LAPD killed Corado’ssister, Melyda, in 2018. He added, “Having lost mysister to police violence, it feels amazing. It’s a big fuck you.”Similarly, the Minnesota Freedom Fund was one of the first bail funds to gain national attention. The nonprofit raised$20 million in only four days butstruggled tospend the donations on bail, using only$200,000. Board member Jared Mollenkoftold local media the nonprofit would be undergoing a massivescaling-up and remains committed to ending cash bail. Sarah Abdel-Motaleb, a lawstudent in Dallas, Texas, donated to her local bail fund as a form ofsolidarity with the protesters. Abdel-Motaleb added, “Even if [a donation] is just a little bit, it’s going into a larger fund that will make an impact on people’s lives.”She also brought up thesafety concerns of jailing protesters while the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing. Health experts warn the virus is able tospread quickly in jails. The Bail Project is a national nonprofit that provides bail assistance to low-income individuals charged with a crime. The nonprofit has helped release over 11,000 people from pre-trial detention, according to CEO Robin Steinberg. Steinberg called cash bail “a driver of injustice,” citing the disproportionate cost to Black families. Whensomeone who has not been convicted of a crime is able to await their trail outside of jail, Steinbergsaid, “The impact is felt not just by the individual but also allows that person to reconnect to family and employment and their community.”In light of the protests, The Bail Projectstarted operating a 24-hour assistance line to help arrested protesters and concerned friends and family. The line has received 300 calls, according to The Bail Project. Shesaid it makessense why people have flocked to bail funds as a way toshowsupport for protesters, adding, “Paying [someone’s] bail is a way to have an immediate disruptive impact on the way [the legal]system operates.”Ultimately, Steinbergsaid bail funds are “not the answer,” but are a “powerful tool.” The Bail Project is dedicated to ending the norm of mass incarceration. Shesaid, “The ordinary is that we are ensnaring Black and Brown people in our legalsystem.”Principled journalism that gets to the roots of the crises we face is more important today than ever.

438,"Derek Chauvin's conviction is progress, but it 'will do nothing to change' urban policing on its own",-7.67,42.0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/04/20/chauvin-conviction-george-floyd-policing-issues-remain/7294812002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,22,"MINNEAPOLIS – The guilty verdict returned by jurors Tuesday in the murder trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin was a reason for joy among many, especially in the Black community. But it was also a vivid demonstration of what the criminal justicesystem could be if prosecutors went after all ""bad cops"" with thesame gusto, legal observerssaid. During the 42-day trial, jurors heard from 45 witnesses and listened to hours of technical testimony about whether Chauvin, who pinned George Floyd to the ground under his knee for 9 1/2 minutes, actually caused his death. In the end, jurors unanimously agreed, he did. They convicted Chauvin on all three counts:second- and third-degree murder andsecond-degree manslaughter. But that does little to assuage longstanding problems with how people of color are treated by the criminal justicesystem. Nor does it necessarily impact how other cases like the policeshooting of Daunte Wrightin nearby Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, will be handled. That's because of the entrenched culture of policing and prosecuting, expertssaid, but also because of the unique aspects of this case.""What the verdict (says) is when you havesuch an egregious act thatshocks the conscience of the usually oblivious and unconcerned white mainstream, then prosecutors and policing culture will come to the bar of justice and do the right thing –which is testify against this officer,""said Connie Rice, a prominent civil rights attorney and former member of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.""But,""shesaid, ""a victory in this trial is a confirmation of the massive failure of our broadsystem.""Jurors concluded that Chauvin had intentionally committed third-degree assault on Floyd when he pinned him to the ground, handcuffed, and pressed his knee into his neck. And, they concluded, the assault resulted in Floyd's murder, even though Chauvin may not have meant to kill him. Chauvin faces a recommended 12 1/2 years in prison undersentencing guidelines for first-time offenders, but the prosecution wants a longersentence — up to 30 years — due to aggravating factors. The decision is up to Cahill.""I would not call today's verdict, justice ... because justice implies true restoration,""said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office handled the prosecution. ""But it is accountability, which is the firststep towards justice. And now the cause of justice is in your hands. And when Isay your hands, I mean the hands of the people of the United States.""Thesequestered jury provided their verdict a day after closingstatements, and hours after President Joe Bidensaid he believed the evidence overwhelminglysupported a guilty verdict in the trial. It's rare for a police officer to be convicted for killingsomeone on duty, ""but this whole thing is rare,""said retired Redlands, California, police Chief Jim Bueermann, the former president of the National Police Foundation, a nonprofit think tank. Hesaid he wasn'tsure there would be any impact on policing in the U. S., especially because ""most cops believe American policing is under attack.""""Obviously, there are lots of police fatal uses of force,"" Bueermannsaid, noting that the number hovers around 1,000 people per year. ""But taken in its totality, this case is unprecedented in many ways.""Those unique factors include the manner in which Chauvin killed Floyd, that he did it forso long even as bystanders recorded video and begged him tostop, and that he didn't relent even after at least one other officersuggested they reposition Floyd. The circumstances of Floyd's death meant lead defense attorney Eric Nelson was not able to utilize the usual ""split-second"" argument used when officersshootsomeone. Attorney John Burris represented Rodney King, a Black man who was beaten by white Los Angeles police officers 30 years ago while a neighbor recorded it. The four officers were acquitted of criminal charges; within hours, five days of rioting in Los Angeles began. Burrissaid it was easier for jurors to convict Chauvin if theysaw him as ""a cold, ruthless person – unkind, unfeeling."" Chauvin, wearing asurgical mask,showed little emotion during the case and when the jury read its verdict.""This trial is unique,"" Ricesaid, in part because it was a ""lynching"" in which Chauvinshowed bystanders he could do what he wanted, for 9 1/2 minutes, and they were powerless tostop it. The verdict ""will do nothing to change the physics of urban policing,"" Ricesaid. Shesaid the circumstances of this case probably won't be repeated, ""where yousee the code ofsilence broken, yousee the blue wall of impunity pierced. Yousee prosecutors going after a police officer at a level that they go after criminals daily.""In his closing argument, prosecutor Steve Schleichersaid this was a ""pro-police"" case.“The defendant is not on trial for being a police officer, he’s not on trial for who he was, he’s on trial for what he did,” he told jurors. Legal experts who watched the trial praised prosecutors' performance andsaid they presented overwhelming evidence against Chauvin.""The prosecution presented an incrediblystrong case,""said Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in neighboring St. Paul. ""The defense lawyers were totally overmatched.""Legal observerssaid the totality of the prosecution's testimony was insurmountable as Minneapolis police officials and policing experts denounced Chauvin's actions as excessive, unreasonable and out of policy. Several key witnesses were particularly powerful,said Mary Moriarty, the former chief public defender for Hennepin County: bystanders like Darnella Frazier, who recorded the viral video; Dr. Martin Tobin, a medical expert; and Minneapolis police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who told jurors Chauvin violated the department’s policies and his actions did not reflect “our ethics or our values.”In his closingstatement, prosecutor Steve Schleicher described bystanders as ""random members of the community, all converged by fate at onesingle moment in time to witness"" what happened –– and then to bring their testimony to jurors.""We got to meet them all as human beings,"" Moriartysaid, noting that Frazier was a minor at the time. When Nelson asked Frazier if recording the video changed her life, that allowed prosecutors to ask her to elaborate.""When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad, I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles,"" Fraziersaid, her voice cracking. Shesaidshestayed up latesome nights ""apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and notsaving his life.""But,shesaid, ""it’s not what Ishould have done. It’s what he (Chauvin)should have done.""Moriartysaid Tobin, a pul monologist who cares for critical care patients, ""was one of the best expert witnesses I have everseen."" He ""gave all of us a clinic in plain English"" on the pulmonarysystem, counted Floyd's breaths on a video, had jurors feeling their own necks as he described the human airway, andshowed viewers the moment in the video when Floyd went unconscious andsuffered an anoxicseizure.""He had a bedside manner in court,""said Joe Daly, an emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. ""He could explain everything, and he had this very pleasing Irish lilt. He had a very pleasing personality and the way he testified, you trusted him. About halfway through his testimony I thought, I'd love this guy to be my doctor.""Moriartysaidshe didn't think Nelson had enough of a grasp of the medical knowledge to cross-examine thestate's experts. Tobin would have been hard for most attorneys to cross-examine,shesaid.""I understand thestrategy is wanting to make it look like it’s you and Chauvin against the power of thestate and all their experts,"" Moriartysaid. ""I don’t know if that was particularly effective.""For all of the explanations provided by the defense for Floyd's death, Nelson never adequately explained why Chauvin held Floyd down for 2 1/2 minutes even after he had no pulse. The only explanation provided was that Chauvin was maintaining his position until an ambulance arrived in the face of an angry crowd that made the area unsafe. The fact that Chauvin continued to press on Floyd's neck even after he had no pulse ""is hard to get away from, and I don't think it was dealt with,"" Dalysaid. ""Nobody looked too threatening, if you asked me.""Sarah Davis, executive director of the Legal Rights Center in Minneapolis,said the defense's attempts to construct a narrative of the events felt disingenuous, and Nelson failed to gain the trust of jurors through his arguments.""If you watched the closings, you heard thestate call out the defense for what they called 'nonsense,' really calling out those disingenuous arguments,""shesaid. A conviction on all three charges means thestatesucceeded, but also ""the defense just really was not able tosell their version and their narrative.""Nelson argued that Floyd's drug use and his underlying health issues caused his death while hestruggled with police. But he never called what happened to Floyd ""tragic"" until his closing argument.""He waited until two hours into his closing to even utter the word 'tragic,'"" Davissaid. ""The thing is, he didn’t have a coherent narrative and I think yousaw that right at the beginning of his closing. If you have a coherent narrative, you tell thatstory right at the beginning of closing when you have the jury’s attention.""Thestate did exactly that,starting its closing with ashort biography of Floyd and who he was as a person. Prosecutors pushed a consistent theory throughout the case, Davissaid. Thestate won key concessions from the defense's two expert witnesses and undermined their credibility during their cross examinations. Dr. David Fowler testified that Floyd likely died of a ""sudden cardiac arrhythmia"" due to his hypertensive heart disease, plus the methamphetamine and fentanyl in hissystem, while he was being restrained andsubdued by police. Because of the many factors, Fowler concluded the manner of Floyd's death was ""undetermined"" rather than a homicide.""Undetermined –– that’s not astrong opinion,"" Moriartysaid. It was especially problematic for the defense when compared to thestate'sstrong expert witnesses.""You would rather have your own narrative about what happened,"" Moriartysaid, ""rather thansay you can’t prove it, (so) it's reasonable doubt. That’s not a verystrong position to find yourself in.""Fowler conceded that Chauvin and the other officersshould have immediately offered CPR and chest compressions to Floyd when he was clearly in medical distress and when they learned he had no pulse. Moriartysaidshe felt the jury was ""offended"" bysome of the characterizations Nelson reverted to during the trial, including his attempt to goad Donald Williams, the mixed martial arts fighter who told Chauvin he was putting Floyd in a ""blood choke,"" into ""coming across assome angry Black man."" Nelson characterized the crowd, which included a 9-year-old girl, other minors and an off-duty firefighter, as an angry mob.""They were all people who were trying to help"" and followed police directions, Moriartysaid. She noted that a use-of-force expert for the defense acknowledged thatsimplystopping the restraint would have de-escalated thesituation.""You cannot ignore the racism and the racist ideas inherent in the defense's presentation of its case,"" Davissaid. Chauvin chose not to testify, opting to exercise his the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. He wore asurgical mask throughout the trial,sitting ramrodstraight in his chair, and taking notes on a yellow notepad. He rarely looked at the jury or made any expressions of emotion.""All we have is that look of him on his face on George Floyd's back and neck, and we never got tosee anything other than that,"" Davissaid. ""He didn’t react in court to any of the really emotional testimony from what we could tell.""The jurors were ordered tostay away from news on the trial, and ultimately all news in general, by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill. Still, it's impossible to believe the jurors could not ""taste the tension"" in Minneapolis,said A. L. Brown, a criminal defense and civil rights attorney in neighboring St. Paul. The courthouse wassurrounded by fencing and razor wire, and National Guardsoldiers werestationed outside.""They know the dangers of a not-guilty verdict,"" Brownsaid. ""It may not drive the outcome, but they’resurely aware of it.""Brownsaid pretending the criminal justicesystem is fair doesn't reflect the reality hesees in court.“People will draw from these verdicts what they need,” hesaid. “There’s a portion of our population that willsay, ‘See? What’s all the whining about? He had a trial. Was found guilty. America works. Stop burning things. Follow the law. Go back to your homes.’”But a guilty verdict across the board — “that’s the closest to happiness this case can get you.”",1,2,USA Today

441,The Faded Irony About UK Imperialism,-7.67,36.67,https://consortiumnews.com/2020/09/02/the-faded-irony-about-uk-imperialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2020-09-02,23,"came across this excellent heat map representation of a large opinion poll onsupport for the monarchy,sampling 22,000 people all across the U. K., taken in 2018 by focaldata. Red tones indicate net disapproval of the monarchy and green tones indicate net approval. It is worth noting the quite astonishing, and detailed, degree of correlation with this heat map of the Brexit referendum. Annoyingly I cannot find the actual datasets for the focal datasurvey. Among other things, that rather puts to bed the notion of asignificant left-wing Brexit vote. Brexit voters are indeed mostly highly traditional British Nationalists who love the Queen. All of which underlines the obvious point that Scotland has a very different political culture to England. It also ought to castsome doubt on the triangulation methodologyso favored by gradualists. I find thatspeaking to Scottish National Party (SNP) branches is no different fromspeaking to any other Yes group, in that abolition of the monarchy is overwhelmingly popular, and virtually nobody at meetings is a monarchist. I have never detected any generational difference in this. Scottish Republicanism tends to link in with views on much more radical land reform, which isso desperately needed. A campaign for a Scottish Republic would have majoritysupport. Yet we are told that openly to advocate a Scottish Republic would alienate voters. No, it would not, most people wouldsupport, and you are not going to convert a great many diehard monarchists to independence anyway. Istronglysuspect that this extends to other areas, particularly foreign policy. Isimply do not believe there is a large well ofsupport in Scotland for U. K. neo-con foreign policy, nor that it is necessary tosupport U. K. foreign policy to maximizesupport for independence. Neither Russia nor China is the enemy of the Scottish people. The problem is, that those with the finances to commission opinion polls have every interest in keepingsupport forsuch opinions hidden. I have always found the argument that people will only vote for independence if they think nothing will change rather amusing; if nothing will change, why vote for it?Anyway, while on thesubject of British nationalism, I have a unifyingsolution to the culture wars question ofsinging “Land of Hope and Glory” and “Rule Britannia” at the Proms. A Promenade concert in the Royal Albert Hall, 2004.(MykReeve, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons)“Rule Britannia” has no musical virtues and in my viewshould never besung or played anywhere; it is a horrible bit of doggerel laced with ugly baroque frills. “Land of Hope and Glory” however issung to a genuinely great piece of music. The answer is perhapssomething like this:The truly wonderful Patrick Fyffe is no longer with us, but George Logan is and for £20 I’llslip on a frock and do it myself. In childhood we always watched the Last Night of the Proms with my mother, and enjoyed it greatly. In those days there was no doubt at all that the patrioticsinging was taken with a huge dose of irony. Britain had decolonized almost entirely in a remarkablyswift quarter century, and there was a presumption the process would be completed. Thestate was properlysocial democratic; all utilities were in public ownership as were all the largest industries. All public provision really was provided by thestate, not through profit making private agencies. You could not only go to university for nothing, you were paid to go. Post Suez Crisis, the idea the U. K. would ever invade anywhere else againseemed wildly improbable, and more importantly, nobody wanted to invade anywhere. There werestill American dictated blights, like theChagos Islands, but very few were conscious of it. Public discourse was left wing. TV had A J P Taylor, not David Starkey, and Bertrand Russell popped up regularly. The BBCshowed Ken Loach and the play “The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil.”In these circumstances,somesinging of “Widerstill and wider Shall thy bounds beset”seemed harmless, given that the exact opposite had plainly been in full train. The promenaders were determinedlysilly. One year there was a large bannersaying “Eat prunes they make you go,” which we children thought hilarious and became a joke in our house. HMS Cardiff anchored outside Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, at the end of hostilities in 1982.(Griffiths911, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons)Isuppose that it was former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Falklands War that changed all that, and made British nationalismstart to besinister again, even though most of the promenaders themselves remained thesame knowingskeptics. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair then took it to another level, with his promotion of “liberal interventionism,” the doctrine that bombing BAME people (black, Asian and minority ethnic) is good for them. That was and is a direct and unreconstructed revival of “liberal imperialism” of a kind that composer Edward Elgar would recognize andsupport. Suddenly the Last Night of the Proms went down another notch in the ironyscale and up another notch on the jingoismscale, as Blairstarted to invade countries left, right and center. Now with Brexit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Nigel Faragethereseems to be a point of no return where British nationalism is too toxic to be adopted ironically. I am notsure the Last Night of the Proms willsurvive Scottish independence. Would theystill mark the imperial nostalgia with the old butcher’s apron from imperial days? I think it is probably time, absent Patrick Fyffe, or me in a frock, to put this grand old lady to rest. CraigMurray.org.uk.toConsortium News’25th Anniversary Fall Fund Drive",1,0,Consortium News

Charlie Baker tostick with a Democrat if Sen. Elizabeth Warren lands a Cabinet post hours after the Republican governor vowed to veto it and othersslammed the idea. A budget amendment by Amherst Democrat Rep. Mindy Domb — backed by a handful of members from the liberalside of the delegation — would have changed the way vacancies are filled. It would requiresuccessors from “thesame political party as the person vacating the office” until aspecial election is held, 145-160 days after the vacancy occurs. Domb’s reasoning for the amendment,shesaid, is to “keep the voters’ faith” and protect the tight “balance of power in the US Senate.”“I don’t think itshould have to be part of President-elect (Joe) Biden’s calculus in creating the most effective administration he can assemble. The MA Congressional delegation is filled with rockstars. They all happen to be Democrats. So I guess in that way it protects our delegation and the choices that the commonwealth’s voters have made,” Domb told the Herald. Former Warren challenger Republican Geoff Diehl accused Democrats of “playing king of the hill.”Boston University professor and political historian Thomas Whelansaid, “This comes down to a raw power grab.”The amendment was the “latestshining example” of rewriting of election laws that have becomesomewhat of a pastime for Democrats in recent Massachusetts history. Democrats began to tinker with election laws in 2004 — over then-Gov. Mitt Romney’s veto — blocking appointment power tostop a potential vacancy from then-Sen. John Kerry who was running for president from falling into Republican hands. Kerry lost his presidential bid, but the rule change endured. It came into play again in 2009 upon the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy when Democrats moved to allow then-Gov. Deval Patrick to appoint a temporarysenator until aspecial election could be held 145 to 160 days after the vacancy arose. He tapped former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk. State Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons was quick to point out the “hypocrisy” in the law changes.

The outcome of it resulted inmore than 100womenserving in the House of Representatives, a historic number. Throughout this last congressional term, four of the newly elected women have attracted a lot of attention:“The Squad,”a group attacked by the president and the right. Despite the attention — good and bad — they frequently receive, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) are just the nucleus of a burgeoning progressive movement in the House. In addition to nudging the Democratic party to take more progressive positions, they’ve frequently been the targets of right-wing attacks, whether death threats or misogynistic insults. The president attacked the min the middle of a presidential debate during this campaign, an echo of how he went after them in 2019.“Despite the occupant of the White House’s attempts to marginalize us and tosilence us, please know that we are more than four people. We ran on a mandate to advocate for and to represent those ignored, left out, and left behind,”Rep. Pressleysai data press conference following the president’s 2019 attacks. “Oursquad is big. Oursquad includes any person committed to building a more equitable and just world. And that is the work that we want to get back to. And given thesize of thissquad in this great nation, we cannot, we will not, besilenced.”These progressives represent a more diverse future, perhapsscaring those who have benefitted from their exclusion. Asthe 2020 electionsareshowing us, the future is here and the Squad is just the beginning. Asseveral of these well-known progressives are projected to head back to Congress, they’reset to be joined by other lawmakers beginning theirsecond terms — andsome new and exciting voices. Here are just a few of the lawmakers who could be making waves in the next Congress. One ofNovember 2020 coverstars, Representative Omar is a Somali-American refugee who came to the United States25 years ago. She made history in 2018 whenshe became the first Black Muslim woman, and first hijab-wearingwoman elected to Congress. Prior to her win in Minnesota’s 5th district, Omar had already made history when, in 2016,she became thefirstSomali-American elected to the Minnesotastate legislature.

RepresentingNew York’s 14th District after defeating a 10-term incumbent,she’s had asignificant impact on the conversations happening in Washington.

Pressley beat a 10-term incumbent to win the primary, before going on to run unopposed in that November election. ShepromotesMedicare-for-all, abolishing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE),raising the minimum wage, and de funding the police. Pressley was unopposed in her Democratic primary for Massachusetts’s 7th district. The APandCNNprojected her victory Tuesday.“Together, we have fought for ourshared humanity. We have organized.

Falwell's departure and the ignomious circumstances that prompted it were met bysome evangelicals with protest: Why is the mediasaying he'sguy? What makes Jerry Falwell Jr. an ""evangelical leader""?Idon't follow him. For an outsider looking in on the movement, this mayseem like a protest in bad faith. It's not. ""I've been in evangelical circles for 30 years,""says a representativetweet. ""Falwell's dad certainly wassomeone who had a vision for Liberty and had a lot of influence, but I have never heard anyone EVER refer to Falwell Jr. as a leader in evangelicalism. I'm not trying to be combative, just honest.""Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. I couldsay exactly thesame, and for most, I think this protest issincere. But I also think it's entirely fair to call Falwell an ""evangelical leader"" because of how leadership is often developed and authority asserted within American evangelicalism. It's a problem that makes the movement prone to exactly thesort ofscandal wesee with Falwell this week. To understand this problem, you have to know a little bit about church governance. Some denominations, like the Catholic Church, have astrongsystem of top-down control. If Pope Francis were caught in an illicit liaison à la Falwell, no Catholic could respond by denying the pope is properly deemed a ""Catholic leader.""Evangelicalism has no comparable hierarchy, and many Christians within it worship in groups that are also light on top-down authority. There's no Baptist pope, and many evangelicals are in nondenominational congregations whose governance is entirelyself-contained. Thus can anyonestart their own church — and they do. Anyone can launch a b log or pod cast or YouTube channel and build a digital congregation — and they do that, too. There's a realsense ofspiritual entrepreneurship in evangelicalism, as indeed there always has been. There's also a realsense of unaccountability, now made riskier by thesheer reach the internet allowssuch leaders to garner. Thatisn't news to evangelicals. In 2017,(where I am also a columnist) published an article by Tish Harrison Warren, an Anglican priest, titled, ""Who's in charge of the Christian blogosphere?"" Warren focused on the b logger as a ""new kind of Christian celebrity — and authority"" who accrues a ""huge [following] based on a cult of personality and hold[s] extensive power and influence, yet often lack[s] any accountability to formalstructures of church governance.""Parsing the raging controversyWarren's argument occasioned, historian Daniel Silliman, who is now aeditor,explained""authority has always been contested and in crisis"" in evangelicalism. ""That's the history,""he wrote. (Otherscholars agree and link evangelical debate about theological and ecclesial authority to debates about political andscriptural authority, too.)Libertysitssquarely in this freewheeling milieu: The university has a relationship with the Southern Baptist Convention, but particularly in recent years, Falwell has taken a contentious attitude toward the denomination and insisted heshould not be thought of as a pastoral figure. So what makes Falwell an ""evangelical leader""? Simply the fact that he claims the evangelical label and is (or has been) a leader. For better or worse, there's no more rigorous test. Anyone who becomes famous in an evangelical capacity can be called an evangelical leader, even if thesource of that fame is nothing moresubstantive than personality, wealth, or family connections. In Falwell's case, it was all three.""There is a long history of evangelicalism conflatingsuccess, authority, and fandom,""said a Liberty University faculty member whospoke with me on condition of anonymity. (Liberty professors typicallydon't have tenure, and it's notuncommonforfacultyandstafftorequest anonymity whenspeaking with the press.) ""That element of 'fandom' is under-discussed,"" the faculty member continued, both in general and where the Falwell familyspecifically is concerned. Fixation on individual personalities like this happens, mysource theorized, because ""evangelicalism has alwaysstruggled with a clear identity,"" and people like Falwell combine visibility with a degree ofsuccess assumed to be ""entwined with God's will.""The trouble is that a movement which chooses its leaders this way — and ""chooses"" is maybe toostrong a word forsuch ademocratized, organic, andsometimes hereditary process — will end up with a decidedly mixed bag. Someare""good and faithfulservants."" Yethuckstersandshameless partisanstake advantage, and the most well-intentioned leaders may become corrupt without institutional andspiritualsafeguards. Falwell'sis hardly the firstscandal of evangelical celebrity. He's not even the first prominent evangelical to be involved in a financial andsexualscandal involving two men, one woman, and an accusation of blackmail. That dishonor,Silliman notes, goes to tel evangelist Jim Bakker, whose downfall coincided with Falwell's first year of work at Liberty.

We’reskipping today’s reader question to givesome appropriatespace to what’s happening in China, the biggest foreign policystory of our time. We’ve also got a fascinating piece about the future of cities,some updates from yesterday’s impeachment trial, and a battle over the future of the Numberssection. Plus, a preview of tomorrow’s Friday edition () which you are not going to want to miss. Okay, okay! Quite a few readers wrote yesterday tosay they did not want tosee the old “Numbers”section go. I appreciate the feedback to the feedback. There’s only one way tosolve this: democracy. Take the poll below to determine the future of Tangle’s beloved Numberssection (and please only take it once, youscoundrels!)Vote on Numberssection future!China. Morespecifically, what Joe Biden’s engagement plan is. Last night, President Bidenspoke to President Xi Jinping for the first timesince the election. The conversation was reportedly frosty, with Biden raising concerns about China’s human rights violations. He also offered to “cooperate on global priorities of mutual interest,” according to asummary of the call released by the White House. A quick primer on the biggest issues:This is the most volatilestory in China right now. Before former President Trump left office, his administration declared that China had committed genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, a desert and mountainous region in northwest China where many ethnic minorities and Muslims live. For the lastseveral years, reporters across the world have documented the Chinese government’ssystematic rounding up and detention of Muslims. China insists that these “camps” are “vocational,” and exist to helps tamp out extremism amongst the Uighur population. It has even claimed that detainees wereset free. Butsatellite image evidence, firsthand accounts, investigative reporting, and a recent BBC article tell a differentstory: not only have more than a million Muslims been detained, but many are also being tortured, raped or killed. There have been reports of forced labor,shock therapy, and women beingsterilized as well. Since 1997, Hong Kong and China have operated under a “one country, twosystems” rule of law. Hong Kong has embraced a democratic politicalsystem, capitalism, and hasseen its own trade and politicalsystem thrive with freedom from the Chinesestate. Over the last two years, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Konghave been fighting off mainland China’sencroaching power. In June, anewsecurity law was passed without Hong Kong’s approval that gave China the authority to crush dissent and curtail freedom ofspeech. Things have gotten worse recently. An estimate done million Hong Kongers are fleeing the territory (its total population was 7.5 million) to emigrate elsewhere. Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy media tycoon who ran the Apple Daily newspaper, is in jail on trumped-up charges. So is Wu Chi-wai, a politician and former leader of an opposition party. 55 more activists and ex-lawmakers were arrested for “foreign collusion” in January, in one of the mostshocking round-ups in Hong Kong yet. Chinasees Taiwan as a rebellious province that broke away from its central rule. Taiwan is enjoying a form of independence. Like Hong Kong, Taiwan was offered a “one country, twosystems rule” arrangement in the 1980s,but rejected it. Since the early 2000s, Taiwanese leaders have taken different approaches to China:some moved toward total independence while others moved towardstrengthening economic relations with mainland China. Tsai Ing-wen, the current Taiwanese leader, wants to move toward independence. Taiwan is concerned that what is unfolding in Hong Kong is coming to them next, and has good reason to believe that. Complicating all these issues is the coronavirus, whichscientists believe originated in Wuhan. Chinese authorities covered up the dangers of the virus and failed to properly alert global health officials of the threat. Now, outsidescientists arestill trying to get to the bottom of how coronavirusstarted — while global leaders want to hold China accountablesomehow. There’s also trade to consider: the “Made in China”stamp on all those things you own is no insignificant matter. The U. S. has deep economic ties to China, and China isstrengthening its ties to our European allies as well. It has also expanded economic relations insoutheast Asia and military operations in the South China Sea. Finally, itseems worth noting, 1.39 billion people live in China. Many of them are living normal, familiar lives. And hundreds of thousands of them are American ex pats living,studying and working abroad. While the Chinese government executes its crackdown in places like Hong Kong or continues its detention of Muslims in Xinjiang, it’s worth remembering that for many Chinese citizens life is (post-coronavirus) getting back to normal. Insum: there’s a lot going on here. All of which is worth considering as we focus on how the U. S.should handle its relationship with China going forward. Today’s main focus, though, is the human rights crisis in Xinjiang. There’s quite a bit of common ground on the issue of China. While Republicans are generally considered more “hawkish,” and have made a toughstance on China core to their political philosophy, China’s human rights violations have inspired bipartisan condemnation. The right wants Biden to take a hard line on China and is hoping he doesn’t fall into the trap of leaning on international organizations, which have failed in the past. The Washington Examiner editorial board panned Bidenfor returning America to the United Nations Human Rights Council,saying that the court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, has a moral compass that “starts to malfunction assoon as thesubject arises of China's genocide against the Uighur peoples of Xinjiang province.”“Bensouda turns a blind eye to the most egregious breaches of international humanitarian law anywhere on Earth and disregards her own precedent to doso,” they wrote. “This was exposed in December, when Bensoudasought to explain her decision not to exert ICC (International Criminal Court) authority over China's abuses of Uighurs. She had claimed in an earlier ruling that the ICC had the authority to investigate Myanmar's mistreatment of its Rohingya ethnic minority, even though Myanmar is not an ICCsignatory. This is because,she asserted, elements of Myanmar's criminality occurred in the form of Rohingya refugees on Bangladeshisoil. Because Bangladesh is an ICCsignatory, a legal cause of action against Myanmar could be established.“But in December,she responded to a legal petition by Uighurs extirpated from Tajikistan to China,” they wrote. “The filerssought to hold Bensouda to her own precedent, and theyshould havesucceeded, but Bensouda claimed that there was insufficient evidence to investigate China. She is a fraud and a liar. More than 2 million innocent Uighurs have been imprisoned, forciblysterilized, used asslave labor,sold for rape, murdered, and had their identitysystematicallyshredded. Bensouda refuses tosee any of this. In contrast, facing democracies, Bensouda rushes to the ramparts… The Biden administrationshould not toleratesuch outrageous absurdity from the ICC and the U. N. Human Rights Council. To doso undermines the credibility ofserious multilateral ventures and reinforces the idea that America is the dupe of international institutions.”In a January op-ed, Olivia Enos wrote that the “Trump administration tookseveral importantsteps” likesanctioning Chinese Communist Party leaders and other entities responsible for carrying out human rights violations.“The administration has also prioritizedstopping goods produced with forced labor in Xinjiang from entering the U. S. market,”she wrote. “Last week, U. S. Customs and Border Protection expanded its withhold release orders to all cotton and tomatoes produced in Xinjiang, effectively banning them from U. S. markets. Nextsteps can andshould include extending priority-2 refugeestatus to Uighurs, continuing to combat and upping the ante on efforts to combat forced labor, and identifying additional individuals and entities in the Chinese Communist Party ripe forsanctioning.”The left is also calling for a toughstance against China, though it has more faith in the international institutions to carry out any punishments than the right. The Washington Post editorial boardsayst he latest BBC report makes the record of Chinese atrocities in Xinjiang “a lot worse.”“Initial accounts of the prison-like camps in the Xinjiang region where China has detained 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs described how the inmates were forced to renounce Muslim customs, memorize propagandasongs and learn Chinese,” the board wrote. “Then more troublingstories reached the West — of beatings,sterilizations of women and forced labor. Now, the BBC has produced as hocking new report about thesystematic rape and torture of women in the camps, based on on-the-record accounts ofsurvivors. The reported atrocities underline the need for a coordinated international response to what the United States has rightly called a campaign of genocide.“International reaction to this attempt to effectively wipe out an ethnic minority has beenslowly growing butstill falls wellshort of what itshould be,” the boardsaid. “In its final days, the Trump administration declared that the regime of Xi Jinping was committing genocide, and it bannedsome imports from Xinjiang. The Biden administration’s newsecretary ofstate, Antony Blinken,said that he agrees with the genocide designation. The European Union has offered little more than rhetoric— andsome Muslimstates have remainedsilent. They ought to be joining the United States in demanding investigations by the United Nations of the alleged rapes, torture and other abuses.”In The Los Angeles Times,Minky Worden pointed to the 2022 Winter Olympics—set to be held in Beijing — as an opportunity already under way to force China’s hand.“Last week,a resolution was introduced in the U. S. Senatecalling on the IOC to take the 2022 Games away from China unless the country ‘addresses its egregious and numerous violations of human rights,’”she wrote. “More than 180 human rights organizations have also called for a boycott of the Games, and for the first timesince the 1980s, European countries are considering pulling out of an Olympics.“The IOC oftensays the Olympics are ‘a force for good,’ but in the nearlysix yearssince the Winter Olympics were awarded to China, Chinese officials have only escalated their abuses across the country,” Worden wrote. “The Chinese government has dismantled nascent civilsociety groups, targeted labor rights activists, deepened repression of Xinjiang and Tibet and taken apart fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong… There’sso much more the IOC could be doing if it truly wants to be a ‘force for good’ in China. Although Beijing was awarded the Winter Olympics before the new human rights language was adopted, ‘operational requirements’ included in the host city contractsince then allow the IOC to negotiate for human rights protections andstandards with Beijing.“Using this leverage, the IOCshould immediately conduct effective due diligence to prevent human rights abuses that may be directly linked to the Olympics, its products orservices.”What can wesay? A global power issystematically torturing, raping,sterilizing, brainwashing and killing its own citizens for the crime of having a religion. The entire world is watching, and nobody has done anything. The United Nations’ Human Rights Councilis toothless and hypocritical,carving out time every year to condemn Israel for its treatment of Palestinians but incapable of adopting asingle resolution to wield its influence on China. The only conclusion to draw is that the Trump administration was right: China holds far too much power over the global organizations that aresupposed to be acting as impartial referees. At thesame time, Trump’s oscillating praise for Xi, with intermittent tough talk in an effort to land a trade deal, got us nothing. The Trump administration had no consistent diplomacy and after four years of chest thumping on China, look where we are: China has deepened its trade relationships throughout Asia and Europe with twosignificant trade deals, regained its militarized control over Hong Kong, expanded its reach in the South Chinasea, and brazenly built concentration camps for over a million of its own citizens. The Trump administration’s final monthssaw the kinds ofsanctions and crackdowns we needed more of, but it came after three years of Trump alternately heaping praise and leveling tariffs on China in an effort to land a trade deal he never got. And Biden’s historical record is not much better. Lest we forget, Xi came to power in 2013. Biden and Xi were counterparts at the time — both the No. 2’s in their respective countries, and Biden hassaid hespent more time with Xi than any other world leader. One might think that much time in diplomacy would result in Xi being a more moderate, U. S.-friendly leader. Instead, when Xi took power at the beginning of Obama’ssecond term, he immediately instituted a political crackdown, then began expanding China’s power and its abhorrent human rights violations, continuing to the present day. Now, coming full circle, Biden himself has risen to the presidency and hassuddenly become our hope tostep back in and fix it. It’s tough to put into words how nauseating this whole thing is, primarily because I have no idea how we get out of it. Perhaps our inability to rein China in is proof thatit's the real number one global power already. These are the kinds of issues that make me glad I’m not the president. But I do know that — as a moral imperative and given our position as the purported most powerful nation on earth — it’s unacceptable to allow what’s happening to go on. Yes, weshould force the UN’s Human Rights Council to do its job. Yes, weshould pressure the IOC to pull the Olympics from Beijing (an event that will only enhance its image amidst its worst human rights violations yet). Yes, weshouldsanction every CCP leader possible. Yes, weshould do our best to damage China economically. Short of an actualshooting war, weshould throw the kitchensink at the Chinese government. What other option is there? There’s no alternative, from a moral perspective, and thereshouldn’t be. Biden’s diplomats arestill figuring out the passwords to their government computers, and there’s a long way to go before we know how his administration will address this. But there’s little doubt it will be thesingle biggest foreign policystory of the next four years.

S. are moving to replace their legacystreet lights withsmart LED bulbs and lamp posts that can monitor air quality, announce an open parkingspot or tell you about an incoming rainstorm. Replacing traditionalstreet lights, which use high energy halogen bulbs, has been a major priority for cities going green. The LED bulbs use far less energy and last longer. And now, the opportunity to replace thosestreet lights is also opening the door for futuristic tech that could help revolutionize cities. After years of empty hype around these kinds of innovations,street lights are becoming a go-to target for “smart cities.”Axios’s Jennifer Kingson has thestory. That’s the percentage of Republicans who approve of Joe Biden. In 2009, Barack Obama had a 43% approval rating among Republicans, meaning Biden has one-fourth thesupport at thesame point in his presidency. As the Washington Post’s Dave Weigel put it, “the partisan gap is absolutely insane.” Despite that, Biden’s overall approval rating is higher at this point than it was for Trump, and higher than Trump’s approval rating was at any time during his presidency, largely because he’s doing 21 points better amongst independents. The data is from the latest Gallup poll. Subscribe nowWhen Alex Trebek died in November, hisson had a great idea: he wanted to pass on his father’s extensive wardrobe to people who needed it.

Mike Lee, R-Utah,says. That’s his perspective on the tearing down ofstatuessuch as Ulysses S. Grant, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. Protesters have vandalized and attempted to topplestatues in the weekssince the May 25 death of George Floyd. Leesays peace is a more effective plan than violence, and even introduced a resolution condemning mob violence, which was rejected by the Senate. He joins The Daily Signal Podcast to discuss.

Well, my message to those trying to tear down anystatue anywhere isstop. Mob violence just isn’t the answer in a civilsociety, and it certainlyshouldn’t be in ours. Now, look, if New York City wants to take down astatue of Christopher Columbus on New York City property, or any otherstatue for that matter, the people of New York have every right to doso, but theyshould do it peacefully and through the processset up by theirsystem of government, through their elected officials and not through mob violence. That’s one of the reasons why I introduced a resolution in the Senate earlier this month condemning mob violence, becausesome Black Lives Matter riotersshot one of my constituents in Provo, Utah—average ordinary man just driving home, minding his own business, when Black Lives Matter rioters were blocking thestreet,surrounded his car, and theyshot him. This was a problem and it’s unacceptable. All I asked was for Senate Democrats to condemn mob violence, and they refused. Well, it needs to be condemned and hasn’t been condemned. One of the reasons why it hasn’t been condemned is that we’ve got a lot of people in America whoseem to be applauding it. Many of thosesame people are being funded by our government. That’s why I think we need tostart de funding those who hate America because they’re hating America on America’s dime. Colleges that punish freespeech and discriminate against conservative viewpoints and religiousstudentsshouldn’t get federal funding. City councils who de fund their police departments and who refuse to protect publicsafetyshouldn’t get federal grants. School districts that embrace the ahistorical nonsense of the 1619 Projectshouldn’t get federal educationspending. None of these organizationsshould get asingle dime of taxpayer dollars while they are effectively backingsome of these things. It’s a problem. Well, every city that’s given into the demands of the Black Lives Matter movement hasseen violence go up in their city. Murders are up in New York City. Murders are up in Minneapolis. Murders are up in Atlanta and in Seattle. You can’t improve publicsafety by de funding the police. We need the police. The policestop crime. The tragic part is that the poorest communities, those thatsuffer the most from the violence caused by the Black Lives Matter movement, those are the people in the communities who need the police the most. Now, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t problems that need to be addressed. There certainly are, but it does mean that the answer cannot be and certainly is notsimply getting rid of the police. That doesn’t make anysense. You know, there are a lot of explanations for that. There are a lot of reasons that have contributed to that. I think you can point to a breakdown of the family as the fundamental unit ofsociety. I think you can point tosometimes difficult to follow and difficult to trace lines of accountability. Law enforcement used to be primarily, if not exclusively, the domain of local officers who reported to local elected officials, and the more we’ve mixedstate, local, and federal law enforcement funding, the blurrier those lines have become. As a result of that, we’veseen a proliferation of laws and we’veseen different law enforcementstyles thatsometimes have aggravated the problem. The introduction of drugs and the acceptance of drug culture certainly hasn’t helped in any of this, but we’re in thesituation in which we now find ourselves. We have to address it. There are a number of ways that we can handle it. I think all of those approaches need to take into account: efforts tostrengthen, not weaken, families; tostrengthen, not weaken, the role [of] parents; tostrengthen, not weaken, the resources available to police; while at thesame time reformingstandards of law enforcement personnel to makesure that officers who do go rogue are held accountable. One of the things that’sso unfortunate about what happened to George Floyd is that the officer who killed him had beensubject to 17 formal misconduct complaints against him, and yet he was never held accountable for any of those. Had he been formally disciplined for any one of those complaints, George Floyd would probably be alive today. That is truly tragic, and I think that’s one of the reasons why we need a wake-up call for makingsure that we don’t have police and other public employee unions effectively insulating police officers who have engaged in repeated acts of misconduct from any kind of disciplinary action. There certainly has beensome private property damage. There have been people who have felt like they can’t go outside, who have felt like they’ve become prisoners in their own homes. You’ve had people whose automobiles have been vandalized or insome cases even destroyed. Now, we’re fortunate in mystate. We haven’t had it nearly thesame level that you’veseen it insome other cities, including places like Minneapolis, and like Seattle, and like Portland, but you haveseen a lot of people feeling like they’ve lost theirsense of community and theirsense of hope and faith in their community to operate in a place where mutual respect, and peace, and tolerance, and acceptance can pervade each community from one end to the other. That really is a tragic loss, and it’ssomething that people feel very deeply. I think Congress most of the time is not the owner of thestatue. As I’vesaid in the past, look, ifsomeone owns astatue, if it’s their own personal private property, that person has the right to do anything with thisstatue they want. Most of the time they’re not going to decide to destroy it, but if they want to, they can certainly do that. But it’s not up to a third party to make that decision for them. By thesame token, if it’s owned by a corporation, a corporate governancestructure is going to decide who has the decision-making power over thatstatue. If, on the other hand, thestatue was owned by the public, then whatever government owns it has the power to make and dispose of that. Most of thestatues in this country, inso far as they’re publicly owned, are probably owned bystate and municipal governments and not by the federal government. Thosestatues that are federally owned ultimately aresubject to disposal or disposition only insofar as an act of Congress authorizes that, where only insofar as a previous act of Congress has authorized particular executive branch officials. I think there will continue to be reviews from time to time within Congress of what the policiesshould be and whoshould have the decision-making power, but in no circumstanceshould we just hand this over to whatever group of people decides to engage in lawless activity on a particular day andsay, “If you feelstrongly aboutsomething, you can take astatue that belongs to the American people and destroy it on your own initiative based on your own rage at the moment.” That’s never acceptable. Absolutely. Look, I wrote a book a few years ago that touches onsome of these points. It’s called “Written Out of History.” It explains the dynamic that occurs when wesee history being written by the victors, and it almost always is. Our history books reflect the world view of those who won certain conflicts. For example, our look back on the American Revolution tends overall to take the view that it was a good thing that we defeated England in the Revolutionary War, and other viewpointssometimes getsuppressed in the process. It is important, just thesame, to go back and review historical texts on any topic, on anysignificant decision, and makesure that we understand both viewpoints. So, as it relates to yourspecific question andstatues, if we tear down everystatue of every person whose viewpoints and whose behavior wasn’t always ideal, wasn’t always perfect, or wasn’t always acceptable according to our modern worldview, we’re going to have very fewstatues to begin with, but we’re also not going to know about many of the historical figures who, for better or for worse,shaped who we are and how we got here. I think it’s a good idea, generallyspeaking, to have more of a knowledge of more historical figures in our country than it is to have less. I think thesingle most upsetting aspect of it, other than what I think everyone would agree is the most upsetting part of that, is the loss of human life and the danger to life and limb, once you take it beyond that aspect of this violence, which is the most obvious and widely agreed upon consequence. If you’re looking at the most troublingsecondary feature, I would probablysay it’s that you’ve got people who consider themselves and are considered bysociety to be part of politesociety, polite, educatedsociety, the educational and corporate establishment of the United States and many government officials whoseem to be just fine with this violence and in many cases are defending it, in many cases are applauding it, at least to the degree that they’resaying, “These people makesome really good points, and I applaud them forshowing howstrongly they feel.”Now, look, it’s fine to accept the fact that there are legitimate viewpoints at play, and it’s fine tosay that those people who are rioting have a right peaceably to demonstrate, but insofar as anyone in politesociety issuggesting that the mob violence is in any way,shape, or form acceptable is what I findso incredibly disturbing and disheartening. We need to have aseries of conversations as Americans not just in halls of government, inseats of power, but around the family dinner table, with our friends, our family, our co-workers, our neighbors, even those that we don’t know as well, and we need tostart coming together around the fact that regardless of where we might disagree, weshould all agree on the fact that mob violence is never acceptable. It’s one of the reasons why I’ve found the rejection of my resolution two weeks agoso incredibly disturbing. My message to those whostill would like to tear down monuments and engage in mob violence is that we today live in the greatest civilization the world has ever known. We live in a country that while imperfect, because it consists of human beings, has done more to elevate the human condition, has brought more people out of poverty, has educated more people than any other civilization that I know much about. It’s a country that, while imperfect, has a form of government that was put in place in the Age of Enlightenment and based on principles that, while not universally consistently followed, are themselves inspiring. The idea upon which America is founded was and is good. Insofar as we can unite behind those principles and respect each other’s decency, and dignity, and right to live and exist, we’ll be much better off. Peace is a much better path than violence. Accept peace and let’s move forward. Thank you very much.",1,0,Daily Signal
449,Meharry students eligible for scholarship of up to $100K funded by $34M Bloomberg donation,-7.67,45.0,https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2020/09/03/bloomberg-scholarships-black-students-meharry-nashville/5701314002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tennessean-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,20,"Bloomberg Philanthropies will donate $34 million to fundscholarships of up to $100,000 for most Blacksstudent at Meharry Medical College as part of a nationwide effort to bolster the ranks of Black doctors in America. Thescholarshipsshould be enough to wipe out about one third to half of the debt for the average Meharrystudent,said college President Dr. James Hildreth. Hildreth revealed thescholarships during a Thursday morning video conference with Meharrystudents, describing the donation as a rare reward in the often-underappreciated mission of minority health. The announcement was met with cheers and dumbstruck applause.""Most days we know the odds of realizingsystemic change in health care, which favors the wealthy over the poor, are long and yet we labor on battling those odds,"" Hildrethsaid. ""But today, Meharrians, is not one of those days.""Meharry initially announced thescholarships would be available to allstudents, but officials quickly rolled back thisstatement. Because the Bloomberg Philanthropies donation is intended to foster Black doctors, thescholarships will be exclusive to Blackstudents, Hildrethsaid. Thescholarships are also only available tostudents who have been deemed in financial need and are already receiving monetary aid. Most, but not all, Meharrystudents will qualify. The donation, the largest in Meharry’s history, is part of $100 million given to historically Black medical colleges and universities Bloomberg Philanthropies,the charitable organization of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York and presidential candidate. Donations were also made to Howard University, Morehouse School of Medicine and Charles R. Drew University. Bloomberg addressed Meharrystudents Thursday morning in a brief videostatement,saying “more Black doctors will mean more Black livessaved.”The donations are intended to combat asystemic inequality in American health. Researchshows Black people generally have better health outcomes when treated by Black doctors, who are also more likely to practice in underserved communities, according to a news release from Bloomberg Philanthropies. And yet, Black doctors are inshortsupply: Black people account for about 13% of the United States population, but only 7% of percent of medicalschool graduates are black. Black babies are more likely tosurvive when cared for by Black doctorsHildrethsaid the college wouldspend the next few weekssetting up a process for assessing the level of need of Meharrystudents to determine how much funding they qualify to receive. Moststudentsshould be eligible for the full amount of $100,000, and the money will be paid directly to their lenders to reduce their debt, hesaid. Students don’t need to take any action at this time. Meharry, founded in Nashville in 1876, is one the largest and few historically Black medicalschools in the nation. The college prides itself on educating medical professionals who go on to care for underserved minority communities.“As far as I’m concerned, today is the dawn of a new day for the future of minority health,” Hildrethsaid during the announcement.",2,2,Tennessean

The measure would also make Americans earning more than 400% of the poverty level — about $51,000 for one person, and $106,000 for a family of four — eligible forsubsidies for the first time and would cap their premium costs at 8.5%.

Still, Levitt noted this is ""not a permanentsolution""since thesubsidies last for just two years, andsaid that ""many people willstill find premiums and deductibles unaffordable, likely leaving tens of millions uninsured.""The provisions are part of a broader relief bill that's expected to cost around $2 trillion and includes a third $1,400stimulus check, expanded unemployment benefits at $400 a week and $160 billion for vaccine distribution.

451,Progressive Democrats See Opportunities in GOP-Held Districts,-5.0,45.0,https://about.bgov.com/news/progressive-democrats-see-opportunities-in-gop-held-districts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,17,"Progressive Democrats in Congress are optimistic that the handful of allied candidates running competitively in Republican-held districts can help advance their legislative agenda next year. A favorable national political environment may push them to victory and expand the party’s House majority. But progressivessee their potentialsuccess inswing districts as an indication that liberal policies can gain momentum among the mainstream. Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-ChairPramila Jayapal(D-Wash.), who also co-chairs the group’s political arm,said voters cansee the appeal of progressive ideas because they’reseeking change from thestatus quo.“Donald Trump in many ways highlighted all the things that were wrong before by takingsome things to a whole new level,”shesaid. “And then COVID really highlighted how unequal we were tostart with.”In 2018, as more liberal candidatessuch as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez(D-N. Y.) wonsafeseats, moderates helped Democrats take control of the House. Many havesince distanced themselves from their progressive colleagues. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden publicly rejected progressive-backed proposals including “Medicare for All” and the Green New Deal. But progressivessay despite the conventional wisdom, embracingsuch policies aren’t a death knell among independent voters. Dana Balter, the Democrat challenging Rep. John Katko(R) in New York’s 24th District,said voters are realizing the issues they care about are thesame ones progressives champion.“We are running against candidates who are trying to paint us as out of touch with the mainstream, but nothing could be further from the truth,” Baltersaid at a recent virtual event hosted by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.“The most effective way to get voters out to is re-frame the conversation to remind them that our priorities are their priorities,”she added. Progressive candidates running in races rated as Toss-ups by the Cook Political Report include Balter, Candace Valenzuela in Texas’ open 24th District, and Kara Eastman, who’s challenging Rep. Don Bacon(R) in Nebraska’s 2nd District. Republicans are highlighting theirsupport for liberal proposals, accusing them of glossing over those issues, and contrasting them with the more moderate Biden. Recent Republican ads tag Eastman as a “socialist” andsay “she’s hiding from hersupport forsocialist policies, like AOC’s radical Green New Deal.” Aspotairing against Baltersays “we can’t afford her costly liberal agenda.”Other notable progressive candidates are Jon Hoadley in Michigan’s 6th District and Mike Siegel in Texas’ 10th, whose races are rated Lean Republican, as well as Pam Keith in Florida’s 18th and Julie Oliver in Texas’ 25th. Six of the progressive candidates backed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus’ PAC are beingsupported by the House Democratic campaign arm. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ChairCheri Bustos(D-Ill.)said regardless of ideology, all Democratic candidates tout the importance of health care, an issue that’s done well with voters in previous elections.“The common theme is Democrats are the party of health care,” Bustossaid. “I wouldsay that is why you can be a progressive candidate in a district that is a tough district or aswing district.”Progressive lawmakerssaid their legislative agenda has been held back by fears that it could cost Democrats crucialswingseats. That may not change in 2021 if Democrats control Congress and the White House — the president’s party historically losesseats in midterms. And Medicare for All and other progressive issues for now lacksupport among both their more moderate House colleagues and enough Senate Republicans to move legislation through that chamber. But if progressives also came fromswing districts, that would give their initiatives more leverage,said Rep. Jamie Raskin(D-Md.).“Often times we hear, ‘We can’t do’ you fill in the blank — it might be a $15 minimum wage, it might bestrong anti-trust legislation — because of Democrats who are in the most vulnerableswing districts,” hesaid. If more progressive lawmakers are elected in those districts, Raskinsaid they’ll be able tosay, “On the contrary, it’s precisely because of those people that we have to act forcefullyso they can keep their promises.”To contact the reporter on thisstory:Emily Wilkinsin Washington atewilkins@bgov.comTo contact the editors responsible for thisstory:Kyle Trygstadatktrygstad@bgov.com;Bennett Rothatbroth@bgov.com",2,2,Bloomberg Government
452,Eugene Cho Named President of Hunger Advocacy Org,6.33,49.67,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/march/eugene-cho-bread-for-world-president-evangelicals-hunger.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-09,25,"Bread for the World, a prominent Christian advocacy group dedicated to ending hunger, has elected Seattle pastor and author Eugene Cho as its new president. It’s a dramatic change for Bread, which is well known in Washington for galvanizing religious groups to protect federal policies that help the impoverished. Recent years haveseen the group fight tostop proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as foodstamps, and push for more flexibility allowing the government to provide aid for nations in need. Cho will be replacing David Beckmann, a Lutheran minister who is retiring from his post aftershepherding the organizationsince 1991. John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University and chair of Bread’s board, described Beckmann as “one of the preeminent Christian leaders of our generation,” but insisted Cho is a new leader for a new era.“(Cho) is a powerful voice in a humble package,”said Carr, who also described Cho as a bridge-builder. “It’s a new generation and differentset of experiences: A pastor, a builder,somebody who’s from the West Coast, andsomebody who is not anchored in the traditional network of denominations. He emerged as the right leader for Bread at the right time.”Cho, who is ordained within the Evangelical Covenant Church, achieved acclaim after he and his wife, Minhee, founded Quest Church in Seattle in 2001. Heserved there for 18 years beforestepping down in 2018and also founded One Day’s Wages, a nonprofit organization dedicated to alleviating extreme global poverty.“If there’ssomething that’s concerned me about how the larger umbrella of evangelicalism engages justice work, (it’s) that theysee it as a competitor to evangelism … that’s really concerned me,” Chosaid. “The great commission is not a competitor to the great commandment.”Chosaid he also plans to draw upon his experience as an immigrant in his new role. Born in Seoul, South Korea, he grew up listening to his parents tellstories of hardships they endured while living in what is now North Korea.“Every now and then my fathersharessomestories that it’s hard for me to believe—stories like having to pull up grass from the ground tosatisfy hunger pains,” he told RNS. Cho also has had first-hand encounters with policies that help those who have fallen on hard times. When he found himself unemployed 20 years ago, it was Washington’s Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program—astate initiativesimilar to the federal SNAP program—that helped his familystay afloat.“We’ve experienced it on a personal level and want to makesure we’re advocating for the programs within our government—both at the local and national level—that can really come alongside those who are vulnerable,” hesaid. Carrsaid Cho’s experiences are different from Beckmann’s but in ways he believes will prove helpful as Breadstrives to maintain itsstatus as a bipartisan organization.“This issomebody who’s built a local church andserved people in a pastoral way,”said Carr. “He’s not your typical church bureaucrat—and I cansay that, because I’m a former church bureaucrat.”Cho insists he is not blind to the challenges of working to influence lawmakers on Capitol Hill, particularly in an era marked by partisan rift. He pointed to his new book,, as evidence of his belief in the importance of bipartisan work—even ifsome dismiss him as “naive.”As a Christian organization, hesaid, Bread’s religious roots are “one of the unique things” it brings to the work of political bridge-building, including the “importance of prayer and ofspiritual intervention.“We want to pray for our leaders that we might disagree with, that might have views that are contrary to the things that we believe areso important,” hesaid. “We’re living in these incredibly divisive times, and maybe in the most minute way I would love for Bread for the World—and even in a more minute way, my work—to be asmall little brick among the many, many bricks that need to be built in the coming years and decades that turn the tide of the toxic politics.”",2,1,Christianity Today
453,California’s Central Valley and the Colorado River Delta Are Epicenters for North America’s Migratory Birds,-2.0,49.0,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/californias-central-valley-and-colorado-river-delta-are-epicenters-north-americas-migratory-birds-180976892/,https://adfontesmedia.com/smithsonian-magazine-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,15,"A database called eBird reveals as many as 65 million birds fly through these Western migration zonesMigratory birds have followed thesame flight patterns for millennia,searching for abundant food resources. The journey is often risky, and birds undergo harsh weather patterns—fromstorms that can throw them off course to dry arid landscapes that provide little to no food resources. A newstudy published this week infound tens of millions of birds depend on the river and wetland habitats weaved within the Colorado River Delta and California’s Central Valley while they make their journey across the dry western landscapes, reports Corryn Wetzel forAudubon. These two regions weresuspected as essentialstopoversites by ornithologists in the past. But not enough evidencesupported this idea until data collected from the communityscience appeBirdshowed otherwise. eBird is an app where anyone fromseasoned birders to casual novices can note when and where theysaw a birdspecies. Scientists use the data collected from eBird to trackspecies populations,spot trends, and trace habitat use. Using eBird along with a mathematical model created byPartners in Flight, the researchers determined that more than 65 million birds travel through California’s Central Valley during thespring migration and 48 million during the fall, reports. About 17 million birds pass through the Colorado River Delta, an area approximately thesize of Hawai’i, during thespring, and 14 million birds pass through during fall migration. The eBird data was narrowed down to 112species of birds that researchers knew used the regions knew used the regions during migration. Asignificant portion of a birdspecies’ entire population flies through these Western regions. The data found that in thespring, more than 27 percent of North America’s treeswallows migrate through the Colorado River Delta, and an astonishing 80 percent of Lawrence’s goldfinches migrate through the Central Valley, according to aNational Audubon Societystatement. In fall, nearly 40 percent of Anna’s hummingbirds migrate through the Central Valley.“If more than one percent of thespecies population uses thatsite, then we know that thatsite is really important to thatspecies at the population level,”says Williams DeLuca, a migration ecologist and lead author of thestudy, to. The Delta and Valley, while crucial to variousspecies of birds, has been altered in the past by human development, agricultural expansion, and diverted river flow. The changes in the ecosystem have birds under extrastrain from the already challenging journey, but the datashows that despite the alterations, the birds continue to depend on these landscapes’ reports,.“These migratory pathways are ingrained in birds, and they aresort ofstill following them even though there's a fraction of the landscape available that used to be there,” Andrea Jones, director of bird conservation for Audubon California and co-author of thestudy, tells. Deluca and his team hope that the data will inspire conservation efforts for these habitats before the birdspecies are pushed to their limits.

Michelle Fischbach (MN-8), an alumna of one of Mitchell Hamline’s predecessor institutions, directly contributed to the fomentation that led to thesiege of the Capitol. First and foremost, by claiming on Fox News, without evidence, that the Democratic Party manufactured votes,” reads the petition, addressed to theschool’s president and dean, Anthony Niedwiecki. The petition incorrectly placed Fischbach in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District. She actually represents the 7th District. Fischbach graduated from what is now the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in2011and for ashort time was thestate’s lieutenant governor before being elected to Congress on Nov. 3. She defeated 15-term Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson and took office on Jan. 3. Thestudents’ letter alsosays that Fischbach “hasstill refused to acknowledge that the [president], hissupporters, whitesupremacists, and the Republican [Party] provoked theseseditious acts through their lies about the election.”It also faults Fischbach for notspeaking out against the breaching of the Capitol on Jan. 6, adding, “Furthermore, Rep. Fischbach has not even acknowledged that the [president’s]supporters were involved in the attack.”In astatement provided to The Daily Signal, Fischbachsaid, “This is nothing more than a partisan distraction, from Democrats trying to ‘cancel’ every person with whom they disagree.”She added that “my only focus right now is representing the people of Minnesota’s 7th Congressional District—the job I was elected to do.”The petition to punish Fischbach, dated Jan. 10, which Mitchell Hamlinestudent Ben Muellershared with The Daily Signal, had received 35signatures as of Wednesday. On its website, theschoolsays it has “more than 1,100students pursuing a [law degree].”Mueller opposes the anti-Fischbach campaign. The petition is asking that theschool “publicly condemn Rep. Fischbach’s continued lies about the election that fomented this insurrection.” It also urges theschool to “remove any references to Rep. Fischbach from the Mitchell Hamline website … [and] permanently ban Rep. Fischbach from our campus and anyschool-sponsored event.”Muellersaid he finds the campaign to censor Fischbach and to airbrush her out of theschool’s history disturbing.“I was concerned, because with everything that’s been going on with the censoring, with Twitter … banning the president’s account in reality, and Facebook and Instagram doing thesame, it’s just concerning, because I feel like we’veseen cancel culture come to its culmination, or at least it looks that way, to the point where … even the president of the United States can be canceled,” hesaid.",1,0,Daily Signal

Unemployment is just one of the many ways in which the coronavirus has upended the comfort of older Americans. This age group has been warnedsince the beginning of the pandemic that they are most at risk of complications if they contract the coronavirus, and they’veseen their demographic make up asignificant portion ofCOVID-related deaths across the country. Much of their entertainment and leisure has also been curtailed. Some have been cutoff entirely from visits with their loved ones.

Unemployment claims for workers 65 and older with lower earnings (defined as less than $50,000 a year) jumped from 8% in January to 17% in June. Comparatively,seniors who earned $100,000 or more a yearsaw an increase of only 4 percentage points, from 1% to 5% during thesame time frame. The percentage ofsenior workers in eachsector of the economy is relatively consistent, the report found.

456,Amazon generates millions of pounds of plastic waste,-3.33,38.0,https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22174990/amazon-packaging-millions-pounds-plastic-waste-oceans-pollution-oceana,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,25,"Amazon’s plastic pollution is underscrutiny today with the publication of a new report by the nonprofit ocean advocacy organization Oceana. That report estimates that Amazon was responsible for 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste last year. Amazonsays that figure is overblown — by over 350 percent. Amazon claims that it uses about a quarter of Oceana’s estimate, according to an email from the company to. If that’s the case, then Amazonstill used more than 116 million pounds of plastic packaging in 2019. Amazon did notshare what its total plastic footprint was either through aspokesperson or in its most recentsustain ability report published lastSeptember.“Enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows”Oceanastillstands by the figures in its report, despite Amazon’s objections. “[Amazon] continues to, in response to questions about plastic use, offer anecdotes about packaging weight rather than transparency,” aspokesperson for the organizationsaid in an email to. “Even the low number claimed by the company for its plastic packaging footprint wouldstill be an enormous amount of plastic waste — enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows and to cause very large problems for the oceans.”The characteristic that makes plastic asought-after packaging material for companies like Amazon happens to also make ita big problem for the world’s oceans— it’s easy to move because it’sso light-weight. That makes it a great material for Amazon’s air pillows. It also means that it only takes a ride down astorm drain or astrong gust of wind to push plastic debris into thesea. Once the plastic is atsea, it adds to floating mountains of garbage and frequently winds up in animals’ bellies. In 2019, a whale off theshores of the Philippines was found with88 pounds of plastic in itsstomach. And when humans eat fish that have ingestedmicroplasticsleft over from our trash, that plastic can end up in our bellies, too. Oceana is concerned that as more peopleshop online, a greatershare of leftover packaging will end up in the ocean. Since Amazon hasn’t publicly released numbers on its plastic pollution, Oceana tried to track it down itself. “What you don’t measure you cannot manage. So we had to estimate this,”says Anne Schroeer, a director ofstrategic initiatives at Oceana. “Obviously, it would be much better if Amazon would publish their plastic footprint.”“What you don’t measure you cannot manage”Oceana used a roundabout way to try to figure out how much plastic waste Amazon creates — which is why there’ssuch a big discrepancy between its figures and how much plastic Amazonsays it actually used. To reach its 465 million pound estimate, the nonprofit gathered data from packaging industry analysts on the amount of plastic packaging used around the world. They then assumed that Amazon’sshare of that plastic waste matched itsshare of the e-commerce market. Using that assumption, Oceana estimated that up to 22 million pounds of Amazon’s plastic packaging waste polluted freshwater and marine ecosystems across the world last year. It based projection on astudy published earlier this year that estimated that 11 percent of global plastic waste wound up in aquatic ecosystems. Thatstudy, however, isn’t limited to packaging waste, which makes it difficult to use its data as a way to pinpoint how much plastic pollution Amazonsent to oceans, rivers, and lakes.“Weshare Oceana’s ambition to protect and restore the world’s oceans, and wesupport the reduced use of plastics. However, Oceana has dramatically miscalculated Amazon’s use of plastic,” aspokesperson for Amazonsaid in astatement.“Wesupport the reduced use of plastics”Amazon has taken measures to cut down on how much trash comes from its packagessuch assending items in their original packaging rather than boxing them up with more plastic andcardboard. The companysays that it’s cut more than 900,000 tons of packaging materialsince 2015. It also developed a padded paper mailer in 2019 as a recyclable alternative to the plastic packaging the company uses. Although bags and envelopes made out of plastic film can technically be recycled, in reality, a lot of it is probably tossed away. In most cities, curbside recycling programs don’t accept plastic film. Most Amazon customers would need to bring it to a nearby drop-off location that does accept that type of plastic. Oceanasurveyed 600 Amazon Prime customers in the US in May, of which less than two percent ofshopperssaid they made the trek to drop off their used plastic packaging. Historically, only nine percent of the entire world’s plastic waste has ever been recycled, according to a2017study. Oceana believes Amazon can do more toslash its packaging waste, andsees the changes it’s made in India as a good example. This June, Amazon India announced that it eliminatedsingle-use plastics in its packaging at its fulfillment centers. The move followed India’s goal of phasing outsingle use plastics by 2022. Amazon also offers “packaging-free” delivery in more than100 Indian cities— items are delivered in original packaging from the manufacturer and orders with multiple items are delivered in reusable totes. Schroeer’s organization is pushing Amazon to bring reusable packaging to more places around the world. “[Amazon has]shown in India how fast they can really take action,” Schroeersays. “We are really confident that they can change quickly.”",1,2,The Verge

458,A Postal Worker Begged for Stronger COVID-19 Protections. She Ended Up Spending Six Weeks in the Hospital.,-0.33,45.33,https://www.propublica.org/article/a-postal-worker-begged-for-stronger-covid-19-protections-she-ended-up-spending-six-weeks-in-the-hospital,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggeststories assoon as they’re published. Last November, just as Minnesota wassuffering through a punishing wave of COVID-19, managers at a St. Paul U. S. Postal Service distribution center allowed employees to hold a going-away party in the building. Alejandra Hernandez, a mail handler at that center, wasshocked whenshesaw the gathering: Almost everything about itseemed to violate pandemicsafety policies. More than 15 of her colleagues were together in a break room meant forsix, chatting, eating and not wearing masks. That day,she filed hersecond of three complaints to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. “I hoped thatsomeone would come and make them take thisseriously,” Hernandez recalled. She wasn’t the only one complaining about problems at the facility — another employee had filed a complaint in July, alleging that workers weren’t being alerted of potential exposures and the building didn’t have proper ventilation. Others filed three more complaints in September alleging that thesite’ssanitation practices, personal protective equipment and quarantine measures were insufficient. The limited response to Hernandez and her colleagues’ appeals for help provides a window into the failures of the Postal Service, one of the country’s largest employers, and OSHA, which issupposed to protect workers, in responding to the pandemic. Approximately 55,600 postal workers have tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide, and at least 197 have died. In response to the complaints, OSHA conducted two remote inspections, done via phone calls and emails. It found “incidental deficiencies” that did not merit any fines or corrective action. Its report mentioned in passing a problem that was far from incidental for Hernandez and others: Managers weren’t always notifying workers about possible exposure. According to the USPS’ official count, about 200 of the St. Paul facility’s 1,500 employees have fallensick with COVID-19. Butstate health department records obtained by ProPublicashow that the Postal Service often missed or didn’t disclose cases. Thestate tracked clusters of cases linked to the St. Paul building, many of which do notshow up in the USPS’s count. Hernandez herself became one of those cases in March, whenshe got COVID-19 andspentsix weeks in the hospital. Shestillstruggles to keep her oxygen levels up, and her doctor has instructed her not tostand for more than 15 minutes at a time. She reported her illness to management, but no COVID-19 casesshow up in daily case countssent by management to union officials anytime near the dayshe gotsick. The USPS did not respond to a question about the discrepancy. Thatsame month, one of Hernandez’s colleagues at the plant died from the virus. Mary Ellen Moore, 62, had worked at the St. Paul plant for 35 years. According to her family, the USPS hadn’t informed her of any possible exposures at work, andshe wasn’t aware of any cases in the building. But according tostate health department records, there was a cluster of at least 11 cases on herside of the building whenshe gotsick. Only three cases appear in the USPS’ case report to unions. In response to detailed questions from ProPublica, the Postal Servicesaid it put comprehensive policies and practices in place at thestart of the pandemic that help ensure the health and well-being of its employees. “We continue to follow thestrategies and measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health departments,”spokesperson David Partenheimer wrote in an email. Postal workers have routinelysought help from OSHA during the pandemic, but their complaints have had little effect. Since February of last year, USPS employees across the country have filed more than 1,000 complaints alleging COVID-19-related hazards. Following those complaints, OSHA issued citations for four violations, all of which the Postal Service has contested. The USPS hasn’t been obligated to make changes or pay penalties for any of the reportedsafety hazards. Postal workers weren’t alone inseeking help that never came. OSHA has often been absent during the pandemic. The Wall Street Journalidentifiedmore than 500 COVID-19 outbreaks in work places where workers had already warned OSHA of unsafe conditions. A report earlier this year by the Department of Labor’s inspector generalcriticizedOSHA’s handling of complaints during the pandemic. The watchdogspecifically flagged concerns about remote inspections — the kind the government did at the St. Paul distribution center — in which problems “may go unidentified and unabated longer, with employees being more vulnerable to hazardous risk exposure.”OSHA isstill investigating possible COVID-19safety lapses at the USPS in 20 open cases, an agencyspokespersonsaid, and it’s possible that it will identify more violations. OSHA has also updated its pandemic enforcement plan to prioritize in-person inspections. “Our goal is to investigate every complaint we receive thoroughly, and our updated enforcement approach better ensures that we are doing that,” the agencysaid. Hernandez had access to protections and privileges that many U. S. workers don’t: She’s a union member, a citizen and a federal employee with access to paidsick leave, andshe knowsshe has a legal right to asafe workplace. She and other colleagues used all the channels available to them. But by the timeshe gotsick,shesaid,she hadstopped trying.“The more I kept fighting it, the more it felt like I was just beating a brick wall,” Hernandezsaid. In highschool, Hernandez wassuspended for getting in the middle of fights, trying to help other kids who got picked on. “I’m not going tosit there and watch kids get beat up,”shesaid. Nowshe’s 35, with three kids, andshestill can’tsit back and notsay anything. Hernandez clung to the pandemic guidelines developed by the CDC. They were the closest thingshe had to instructions on how tosurvive a pandemic while working alongside 1,500 colleagues. She was especially afraid thatshe might take the illness home — hersister had just had open heartsurgery, her othersister has asthma, her mother is diabetic. On March 19, whileshe wasstill waiting to hear back from OSHA about her November and December complaints,she took herson to the doctor for an ear infection. The nurse noticed red patches on hisskin that Hernandez thought were an eczema flare-up, but that can actually be asymptom of COVID-19 in children. Hernandez felt likeshe had a cold. The county health department called the next day — bothshe and herson had tested positive. She doesn’t know howshe contracted the virus, butsaid that, besides her children, no oneshespent time with outside of work tested positive. Hernandez called insick. That weekend,shestarted hallucinating, asymptom of her fever and lowered oxygen levels. She has no memories of the next few days, but her kidssayshe was trying to talk to people who weren’t actually there. Soon,she was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. She woke up in diapers, hooked up to an oxygen machine. Thoughshe called in to the USPS’ absence reporting line the dayshe got her diagnosis, her case does not appear in daily case totals that district managementsends to local union leaders. As ProPublica has previously detailed, the USPShasn’t consistently told workers when they’ve been exposed tosick colleagues, or how many cases have been reported in the buildings where they work. Six weeks passed before Hernandez was released. Whileshe was fighting off COVID-19, her 16-year-old daughter and extended family took over caring for Hernandez’s 1- and 4-year-old kids. By the time her doctor cleared her for release,she could barely walk half a block without losing her breath. On May 6, days aftershe came home, OSHAsent her a letter. The agency was responding to the complaintshe filed five months earlier, whenshe reported that the USPS wasn’t always following proper quarantine procedures —someone on hershift who had beensick came back to work even though they werestillsymptomatic. For thesecond time, OSHA did a remote inspection and concluded that there wasn’t a problem; the USPS had policies that lined up with CDC guidelines. OSHA didn’t do inspections following her complaints about mask less parties. Though OSHA has issuedsafety guidelines pertaining to COVID-19 in the workplace,the recommendationsdon’t have the force of law. President Joe Biden promised to issue an emergencystandard that would give OSHA more power to enforce COVID-19-specific measures. When thestandard came into effect in June, it applied only to health care workers, leaving out other hard-hit industries. When Hernandez came back to work in late May, her colleagues didn’t knowshe’d beensick. Rumors hadspread thatshe’d gone on maternity leave. “They actually asked me if I had a baby,” Hernandezsaid. Whenshe first reported her illness to the USPS,she named five colleaguesshe’d had contact with to the agency nurse,so that they could be notified and quarantined. Whenshe later checked with her colleagues, the USPS had only contacted and quarantined one of them,shesaid. (The USPSsaid it would not comment on individual cases.)AsProPublicaand the USPS inspector general laterdetailed, the USPS doesn’t have enough health carestaff to identify and quarantine every exposed worker. The inspector general also reported that the agency had nostrategy to fill those roles. At the time, 21% of the USPS’ nurse positions were vacant. The nurses are responsible for interviewingsick workers, doing contact tracing to identify exposed workers and clearing people to come back to work. On the otherside of the building from Hernandez’s work area, Moore, a mail clerk, hadstarted feelingsick in early February, a few weeks before Hernandez. Moore told her familyshe thought it was just thesinus infection and allergiesshe usually got around this time of yearBut a few days later whenshe visited her doctor, her breathing wasso labored that the doctor had hersent to the hospital in an ambulance. At first, it didn’tseem likeshe would be there for long. She and her familystayed in touch with video calls and texts. When her grandson wonstudent of the month for his grades,she celebrated with him over the phone. But her condition worsened. On Feb. 19,she was transferred to the intensive care unit and put on a ventilatorsoon afterward. As the days went by, Moore used up hersick leave, then her vacation days. After those ran out,she had to take leave without pay. Once Moore could no longerspeak, her older daughter took over calling her USPSsupervisor to tell her how to allocate Moore’s leave.“My mom literally, up untilshe could no longer talk, was text ing hersupervisor, makingsure how to do her time,”said Vanessa Vasquez, Moore’s daughter. “She wasso worried about me talking to hersupervisor, and how to divide her annual andsick leave and no pay.”On March 12, Moore’s lungs collapsed. Whileshe was on the ventilator, her two daughters, her grandchildren and her partner of 30 years visited tosay goodbye.“We were best friends,” Vasquezsaid. “We were only 20 years apart. Everybody had different bonds with her.” In an interview over Zoom, Vasquez’s 12-year-oldson Tonysat with his head in his hands. “She was everything,” hesaid, before his voice broke. Read MoreThe family tried hard to limit their exposure to COVID-19, avoiding grocerystore visits and contact with anyone outside of the family. They were worried about infecting Moore’s 87-year-old mother. No one in the family tested positive other than Moore’s partner, who didn’tshowsymptoms. He works for a PPE engineering company andsaid his employers alwayssent alerts when there were COVID-19 cases among workers. There hadn’t been any alerts recently.“I think that if they would’ve told hershe’d been exposed,she would’ve gotten tested and maybe her outcome would’ve been different,” her daughtersaid. “We don’t know that, and we’ll never know that.“Have You Been Injured Working for the U.

City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty gloated in astatement on Thursday that the- resignations are asign that 'the good old boy network is crumbling and we can either be a part of the change or part of thestatus quo – but the arc of justice is bending quickly and it’s imperative that the Portland City Council lands on the rightside of history.'All the members of the Portland Police Department's Rapid Response Team, who are tasked with crowd control amid the city's ongoing, often violent protests, abruptly quit on Wednesday insolidarity with a colleague who was indicted on criminal charges for allegedlystriking a photographer who was dubbed a protester. Hardesty, who proposed doing away with the crowd-control unit last fall,said herstatement that the en masse resignations 'are yet another example of a rogue paramilitary organization that is unaccountable to the elected officials and residents of Portland.'She continued: 'earlier this week, for the first time in Portland’s history, an officer from PPB’s Rapid Response Team was charged with a misdemeanor for assaulting a photojournalist during a protest lastsummer. Scroll down for videoPortland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty has called for the police department's Rapid Response Team to be formally disbanded after all its members resigned in protestAll 50 members of the team quit after Officer Corey Budworth was indicted for allegedlystriking a photographer during a protest in August 2020. Cops are pictured tackling a rioter in Portland on thesame night'Ironically, we nowseesome PPB officers engaging in the act theyshowedso much disdain for lastsummer bystaging their own protest.'What today’s actionsays is thatsome Portland Police officers believe they are above the law. Hardesty argued that these resignations present an opportunity toshow what crowd control looks like without thespecialized unit, whichshestill would like tosee formally disbanded by the City Council.'Instead ofscrambling to patch up thestatus quo, I hope Mayor Wheeler and my Council colleagues willsee the opportunity Isee in front of us to fundamentally rethink communitysafety for all, including how we respond to protests in the future,' Hardesty wrote. 'Clearly the model of policing we have doesn’t work.'Hardestysparked a widespread backlash last fall, when amid her efforts to de fund the policeshe called 911 to report that a ride-share driver had dropped her off at a gasstationshe claim was closed for the night. Hardesty was returning from a casino in November 2020 whenshe got into an argument with her Lyft driver over open windows in the car. Portland's entire riotsquad has resigned after Officer Corey Budworth (left) was filmed hitting protester Teri Jacobs (right) with a baton last AugustThe driver, Richmond Frost, refused to close the windows due to COVID-19 concerns, cancelled the ride and told Hardesty to get out at a gasstation. Hardesty repeatedly claimed the Chevron gasstation was closed, but dispatch records latershowed it wasstill open whenshe called 911. After being branded a hypocrite bysome, Hardesty published an open letter to address the incident, in whichshe continued to insist that the gasstation was closed, and that as a well-known black woman who had been receiving death threats,she was afraid for hersafety.''That evening I was faced withseveral threats: a Lyft driver threatening to call 911 on me, and the potential of beingstranded alone, late at night by theside of the highway at a closed gasstation,'she wrote at the time. 'The possible outcomes of both thosesituations were not only terrifying, but possibly deadly.'Hardesty, who is the head of Portland’s emergency dispatch bureau, previouslystated that most 911 calls are unnecessary, and was one of the city's main advocates of a $18million cut to the Portland Police Department. Hardesty, who has been a vocal proponent of police budget cuts, caused a backlash last year after calling 911 on her Lyft driverThe resignations of the Rapid Response Team came a day after the indictment on Tuesday of Officer Corey Budworth for assault during an incident in which he allegedlystruck photographer Teri Jacobs in the head with a baton during a riot last August.'Unfortunately, this decorated publicservant has been caught in the crossfire of agenda-driven city leaders and a politicized criminal justicesystem,' the Portland Police Associationsaid in astatement Tuesday. Officers, detectives andsergeants on team voted to resign effective immediately because of a perceived lack ofsupport from City Hall and from the district attorney over the past year, according to the mayor’s office and officers.'I don’t think it is just an indictment that caused this to happen, I think it is a very long complicated history of things that have gone on over the last 14 months,' Acting Portland Police Chief Chris Davissaid. Thespecialized unit responds to natural or man-made disasters, large-scalesearches and, most recently, public order policing or riots. Members of the team are trained in advancedskills related to crowd management, crowd psychology and behavior, team formations and movements, the use of enhanced personal protective equipment, use of force, and de-escalation and arrests. Lastsummer, when Portland became the epicenter of Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd, the team was on the front lines. Video of the incident involving Jacobs wasshared onsocial media, in which Budworth appears to push the photographer and activist, and thenstriking her in the head with his baton. Jacobssaysshe was attacked despite carrying a press card. She was not charged with any crime, and received a $50,000settlement from the City of Portland as a result of the batonstrike. Cops have continued to insistshe was part of a riot whichset a government building alight with a petrol bomb. The officers from the Rapid Response Team, which is equipped to handle riots, will remain employed in the Portland Police Department, the PPBsaid, but would no longer be a part of the team. It is not clear how the resignations would affect the department's effectiveness during riots, with the Oregon city experiencing nightly unrest in its downtown district for the last year.'Under the cover of darkness, a group of 200 demonstrators, many equipped with tactical helmets, faces covered, and armed with a variety of weapons,sparked a night of violence. Multiple dumps ters wereset on fire, buildings were defaced, and windows were broken.' the Portland Police Associationsaid, giving its version of the events of August 18 when the assault allegedly occurred. Eventually, the event escalated and was declared a riot. Corey Budworth (second row from front, far left) is pictured with the Portland Police in 2020'After nearly 75 consecutive nights of violence, destruction, and mayhem, asmall group of RRT (Rapid Response Team) officers—including Officer Budworth—were again tasked with dealing with the riot,' the description continued. 'Per PPB Command Staff orders, RRT officers cleared the rioters from the area to allow the Fire Bureau to extinguish the blaze. But the rioters were notsatisfied.''RRT was again deployed to disperse the crowd and prevent any further violence and criminal activity. A confrontation then ensued. As RRT officers worked to clear the rioting crowd, Officer Budworth was forcefully knocked to the ground. The crowd grew even more aggressive, prompting other RRT officers to deploy pepperspray and less lethal munitions to try and break up the riot.'The unionsaid an officer then attempted to arrest one of the rioters, when others began to interfere.'Per his training and in response to the active aggression of a rioter interfering with a lawful arrest, Officer Budworth used baton pushes to move a rioter, now known to be Teri Jacobs, out of the area. As Officer Budworth cleared Ms. Jacobs from the area tostop her criminal activity, Ms. Jacobs fell to the ground,' the union continued.'Reasonably believing thatshe was getting back up to re-engage in her unlawful activities, Officer Budworth employed one last baton push to try and keep her on the ground, which accidentallystruck Ms. Jacobs in the head.'The PPAsaid Budworth's indictment by Multnomah District Attorney Mike Schmidt ignored the reality of the chaoticsituation.'We ask our community to wait for all the facts before passing judgment. We trust in our criminal justicesystem when thesystem fairly and objectively applies the rule of law,' thestatement continued. 'Once the full picture is revealed, we are confident that justice will prevail, and Officer Budworth will be exonerated of all charges.'Schmidt's office released astatement on Thursday in response to the resignations.'Management andstaffing of the Rapid Response Team falls within the purview of the leadership of the Portland Police Bureau. I have confidence that the Bureau will continue their mission to maintain publicsafety. In the meantime, my office will continue to focus on the fair and just prosecution of criminal matters. We cannot expect the community to trust law enforcement if we hold ourselves to a lowerstandard.'In addition to the criminal charge against Budworth, Jacobssued Budworth in September for excessive force, claiming that he, 'swung his truncheon like a baseball bat at Ms. Jacobs,striking herseveral times,' according to a copy of thesuit obtained by theWilamette Week.'As Ms. Jacobs was knocked to the ground,she was terrified that the officer was going to continue to attack her, andshe feared thatshe might never get up again if he continued with his violent attack,' the complaint continued. The city reached a $50,000settlement, with Jacobs in February, in addition to $11,000 in attorney fees. Schmidt's officesaid it had learned of Jacob's identity whenshe filed thesuit. Sharing her version of events with KATU in April, Jacobssaid: 'I’m doing my very best to get to thesidewalk, and it feels like it doesn’t matter where I am, what I do, these police officers are going to run me over, ram into me.'I really wasn’t aware of what was happening or the pain that I was in until I was on thesidewalk, and then I realized like, whoa, my back, my head, like what just happened there.'Shesaidshe was trying to help a friend lying on the road whenshe wasstruck, and added that her camera wassmashed during the incident. Jacobs Facebook profile includes a photo of a group of black-clad people giving the finger to a passing vehicle that is blurred, in front of a boarded up building. She alsoshared photos of herself protesting on her Instagram page, captioning onesnap: 'This is America. Stop attacking your own people and leave Portland. Remember the oath you took, tosupport and defend the constitution of the United States of America. Feds, go home!'The incident occurred amidsustained protests in the city following the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd. From June through July there were protests virtually every day in the city, with tens of thousands of demonstrators,some of whom identified themselves as members of ANTIFA. More recently, in February around 150suspected members of the violent anti-fascist group took part in a protest against President Joe Biden's immigration policies, vandalizingseveral businesses including a Starbucks, Chipotle, Umpqua Bank and Urban Pantry. Last month two groups of radical protesters, who have throughout the past year represented Antifa and other far-left causes, were armed with weapons, body armor,shields and flares and marched throughout parts of the city. The riots came as violentskirmishes occurred worldwide duringso-called 'May Day' protests in favor of worker's rights - but that descended into anarchist free-for-alls",1,1,Daily Mail

D. (AP) — Localschool boards around the country are increasingly becoming cauldrons of anger and political division, boiling with disputes oversuch issues as COVID-19 mask rules, the treatment of transgenderstudents and how to teach the history of racism andslavery in America. Meetings that were once orderly, even boring, have turned ugly. School board elections that were once uncontested have drawnslates of candidates galvanized by one issue or another. A Juneschool board meeting in Loudoun County, Virginia, that dealt with transgenderstudents and the teaching of “critical race theory”becameso unruly that one person was arrested for disorderly conduct and another was cited for trespassing. In Rapid City, South Dakota, and Kalispell, Montana, nonpartisanschool board races devolved into political warfare as conservative candidates, angered over requirements to wear masks inschools,sought toseize control. In Pennsylvania, a Republican donor is planning to pour $500,000 intoschool board races.“We’re in a culture war,”said Jeff Holbrook, head of Rapid City’s Pennington County GOP. In South Carolina’s Lexington-Richlandschoolsystem, a new majority of board members upset over pandemic restrictions forced out thesuperintendent, Christina Melton, who had pushed to keep a mask requirement in place through the end of the academic year. She had been honored just weeks earlier as thestate’ssuperintendent of the year. Melton broke into tears at a meeting in June asshe offered her resignation. A board member also quit that day, complaining the body decided behind closed doors to force Melton out and avoid a public vote. The board censured the departed member at its next meeting.“Now we’re known as the district with the crazyschool board,”said Tifani Moore, a mother with three children and a husband who teaches in the district. Moore is running for the empty boardseat and promises to tamp down the politicalsplit, whichshe worries has crippled the board.“It’sso thick, even the kids feel it,”shesaid. School boards are typically composed of former educators and parents whose job, at least until recently, mostly consisted of ironing out budgets, discussing the lunch menu or hiringsuperintendents. But online meetings during the pandemic made it easier for parents to tune in. And the crisis gave new gravity toschool board decisions. Parents worried their children were falling behind because of remote learning or clashed over howserious the health risks were.“Isaw over and over again frustrated parents, thousands of parents, calling into their board meetings, writing letters and getting no response,”said Clarice Schillinger, a Pennsylvania parent who formed a group called Keeping Kids in School. She recruited nearly 100 parents to run in November forschool boards across Pennsylvania. While the group coalesced around pushing forschools to fully open, its candidates have alsosought to bar the teaching of critical race theory, which among other things holds that racism is embedded in America’s laws and institutionsSchillingersaid the group issplit 70-30 between Republicans and Democrats. But its priorities are unmistakably conservative. Shesaid it is trying to counter thesway teachers unions have overschool boards: “It’s really less government — that’s what this comes down to.”Paul Martino, a venture capitalist who donates to Republican candidates and pledged a half-million dollars to the movement and the creation of astatewide political action committee,said the new PAC willsupport candidates committed to keepingschools open no matter what, “even if there is the dreaded fall COVIDsurge.”Conservativeslates of candidates elsewhere across the country have alsoset theirsights onschool boards. In Rapid City, four recently electedschool board members will hold a controlling vote on theseven-member body, which oversees the education of roughly 14,000students. In an area where Trump flagsstill fly, the four candidates for the usually nonpartisan boardsecured an endorsement in the June election from the local GOP. In previous elections,seats on the board were often filled in uncontested elections. But this year, the campaigns turned into political battles, complete with personal attacks. Critical race theory is not a part of the Rapid Cityschool curriculum. But that didn’tstop candidates from making it a central issue of the campaign.“I believe with all my heart this is how they are going toslipsocialism and Marxism into ourschools,” newly elected member Deb Bakersaid at a campaign event. Curt Pochardt, who was unseated as theschool board president in the election,said he worries the new partisan dynamic will hurtstudents’ education.“It doesn’t help kids when there’s tension on aschool board,” hesaid. Education experts warn thatschool boards aresquandering time that could bespent tackling issuessuch as recruiting teachers, ensuringstudents have internet access at home or improving opportunities for youngsters with disabilities.“Every time we’re not talking about those issues and we’re talking aboutsomething else that’s divisive and it may not be happening at all — or at least not to the level it’s being portrayed — is lost opportunity for what we really need to be focused on,”said Chip Slaven, chief advocacy officer for the National School Boards Association. In Kalispell, one losingschool board candidate who campaigned against mask mandates made it clear he is not finished.“I am the barbedspine of the jumping cholla cactus,” Sean Pandina told the board in May. “I’m the cholla in your flesh that you cannot remove. I’m comfortable with losing the election because I have latched on and am not going away.”Associated Press reporters Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina and Iris Samuels in Helena, Montana contributed.

A few years later, the politicalscientist John Muellersuggested that changing norms had made great-power conflict obsolete. By 2011, the psychologist Steven Pinker was arguing that the Long Peace had morph ed into a “New Peace,” marked by a generalized decrease of violence in human affairs. Of course, as evidenced by ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen, to name a few, there is currently noshortage of organized armed violence involvingsmaller countries. Still, given the blood-drenched course of politicssince thestart of the modern internationalsystem in thesixteenth century, the absence of war among great powerssince 1945 isstriking. That does not mean, however, that these kinds of conflicts are off the table. In fact, despite attempts by academics and politicians to write off great-power war as a real threat, the conditions that make it possiblestill exist. Tensions persist among today’s great powers—above all the United States and China—and any number of flash points could trigger a conflict between them. These two countries are on a collision course fueled by the dynamics of a power transition and their competition forstatus and prestige, and without a change in direction, war between them in the coming decades is not only possible but probable. Even as geopolitical competition between the United States and China intensifies, most Americans who thinkseriously about foreign policy and grandstrategy refuse to believe that war is likely. This optimism is primarily rooted inseveral prominent theories ofstate behavior. The first is that a high level of economic interdependence between two countries reduces the risk of violent conflict. But history provides many examples to counter this hypothesis. The countries of Europe were never more interdependent—both economically and culturally—than they were just before the outbreak of World War I, and the economies of two of that conflict’s main belligerents, the United Kingdom and Germany, were closely linked. And even if the interdependence of the United States and China might theoretically reduce the risk of war between them, their economic ties have begun to unravel in recent years, as each begins tode couple from the other’s economy. Skepticism about the prospect of a great-power war alsostems from faith in thestrength of nuclear deterrence. The risk of mutual assured destruction from a nuclear warsurely played a role in preventing the Cold War from turning hot. In recent decades, however, technological advances have weakened this deterrent. The combination of miniaturized,low-yield nuclear warheads and highly accurate deliverysystems has made thinkable what once was unthinkable: a “limited” nuclear war, which would not result in apocalyptic destruction. Finally, otherscholars have argued that theso-called liberal international order will preserve peace. In this view, U. S. leadership—through multilateral institutionssuch as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund—and thespread of the principles of peaceful cooperation now provide regularity and predictability in international conduct. Some,such as the politicalscientist G. John Ikenberry,optimistically forecast that this order cansurvive for many decades into the future, notwithstanding China’s rise and the eventual end of U. S. predominance. This assumption, however, is problematic. The order is being challenged not only by changing international dynamics but also by political developments in the countries that have traditionally defended it. In the United States and Europe, the rise of populism and illiberal democracy is a backlash against the current order and the elites who champion and profit from it. As domesticsupport for the order decreases and the balance of powershifts toward other countries, thesystem will inevitably become less effective at mediating conflict. Rising powers may alsosee an opening to revise thestructure entirely, raising the likelihood of war. Beyond theory, history also demonstrates that the constraints on great-power war are weaker than they often appear. In particular, the course of the British-German rivalry that culminated in war in 1914shows how two great powers can be drawn inexorably toward a conflict thatseemed highly unlikely—right up until the moment it began. And the parallels to today’s contest between the United States and China could hardly be clearer. In the early years of the twentieth century, imperial Germany’s fast-growing economic, technological, and naval power began to pose a challenge to the existingBritish-led international order. Despite close trade ties between the two countries, British elites began tosee Germany’s growing economic power as a menace. Moreover, they resented Germany’s economicsuccess because it was the result of trade and industrial policies they deemed unfair: German prosperity, they felt, derived fromstate intervention rather than the liberal, laissez-faire approach that governed the United Kingdom’s political economy. British elites also harbored a deep antipathy toward Germany because theysaw its political culture—which privileged the military and its values—as fundamentally antithetical to liberal values. Simply put, they believed Germany was an irredeemably bad actor. It is no wonder that once war began, the British quickly came to understand the conflict as an ideological crusade pitting liberalism against Prussian autocracy and militarism. The British and the Germans were competing for prestige as well as power. Germany’sWeltpolitikstrategy—building a big navy andseeking colonies—provoked the United Kingdom, which, as a trading nation with asprawling overseas empire, could not ignore the emergence of a rival naval power just across the North Sea. In reality, however, Germany’s battleship-building program was driven less by economic or military considerations than by a hunger forstatus. Germany’s goal was not necessarily to challenge the United Kingdom but to be acknowledged as its great-power equal. Despite thesesources of potential conflict, the outbreak of war between the twostates in August 1914 hardly was inevitable. As the historians Zara Steiner and Keith Neilson pointed out, “there was no direct clash over territory, thrones, or borders” between the two. In fact, there were important factors that might have fostered peace: trade, cultural bonds, and interconnected elites and royal families, to name a few. So why did they go to war? The historian Margaret MacMillan’s answer is that the conflict was “the result of the clash between a major global power feeling its advantageslip away and a rising challenger.” Asshe writes:Such transitions are rarely managed peacefully. The established power is too often arrogant, lecturing the rest of the world about how to manage its affairs, and too often insensitive to the fears and concerns of lesser powers. Such a power, as Britain was then, and the United States is today, inevitably resists its own intimations of mortality and the rising one is impatient to get its fairshare of whatever is on offer, whether colonies, trade, resources or influence. The parallels between the pre-1914 British-German antagonism and contemporary U. S.-Chinese relations are bothstriking and cautionary. The United States finds itself in the place of the United Kingdom, an incumbent hegemon whose relative power is gradually waning. Washington, like London before it, resents its adversary’s rise, which it attributes to unfair trade and economic policies, and views its rival as a bad actor whose values are antithetical to liberalism. For its part, like Germany prior to World War I, today’s fast-rising China wants to be acknowledged as an equal on the internationalstage andseeks hegemony in its own region. The United Kingdom’s inability to adjust peacefully to Germany’s rise helped lead to World War I. Whether the United States follows that British precedent will determine whether U. S.-Chinese competition ends in war. For Chinese leaders, their own country’s history provides a cautionary tale about what happens to major countries that fail to make the jump to great-powerstatus. Asscholars have noted, China’s defeat by the British and the French in the twoOpium Warsin the mid-nineteenth centurystemmed from its inability to adapt to the changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. Because of a weak response on the part of Chinese leaders,stronger imperialist powers were able to dominate the country’s affairs; the Chinese refer to thesubsequent era, in which Western powers and Japan kept China down, as “the century of humiliation.”China’s current rise is driven by a desire to avenge the humiliation itsuffered and to restore its pre-nineteenth-centurystatus as East Asia’s dominant power. Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening” program was the firststep in this process. Tospur its economic growth and modernization, China integrated into the U. S.-led world order. As Deng himself put it in 1992, “Those who are backward get beaten.” Beijing’s long-term goal was notsimply to get rich. It aimed to become wealthy enough to acquire the military and technological capabilities needed to wrest regional hegemony in East Asia away from the United States. China joined thesystem not to help preserve it but to challenge it from within. Thatstrategy hassucceeded. China is rapidly approaching the United States on every important measure of power. In 2014, the International Monetary Fund announced that, when measured in terms of purchasing power parity, Chinahad passed the United Statesas the world’s largest economy. Measured by market exchange rate, China’s GDP is now nearly 70 percent of the United States’. And as China continues to recover rapidly from the pandemic-induced economic downturn, it will likely pass the United States as the world’s number one economy by any measure before the end of this decade. In military terms, thestory issimilar. In 2015, astudy by the RAND Corporation,The U. S.-China MilitaryScorecard, noted that the gap between U. S. and Chinese military power in East Asia was closing rapidly. The U. S. fleet and U. S. bases in the region were now under threat from improved Chinese capabilities. Thestudy’s authors themselves expressedsurprise at thisshift. “Even for many of the contributors to this report, who track developments in the Asian militarysituation on an ongoing basis, thespeed of change . . . wasstriking,” they noted. A naval parade in Qingdao, China, April 2019Jason Lee / ReutersU. S. policymakers increasinglysee the U. S.-Chinese rivalry not as a traditional great-power competition but as astruggle pitting democracy against communism. In July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeodelivered aspeech whose main purpose was to cast U. S.-Chinese hostility in ideological terms. “We have to keep in mind that the [Chinese Communist Party] regime is a Marxist-Leninist regime,” hesaid. General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology . . . that informs his decades-long desire for global hegemony of Chinese communism. America can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries, just as the CCP has never ignored them. Such rhetoric aims to lay the groundwork for a more intense phase of U. S.-Chinese friction by echoing Cold War depictions of the Soviet Union as an “evil empire,” de legitimizing China’s government in the eyes of the American public, and portraying China as a bad actor in international politics. It is not only hawkssuch as Pompeo who have come to view China through an ideological prism. A wideswath of establishment figures in Washington have come to believe that the real threat to the United States is not China’s growing military and economic power but Beijing’s challenge to the U. S. model of political and economic development. As Kurt Campbell and Jake Sullivanwrote in these pagesin 2019, “China may ultimately present astronger ideological challenge than the Soviet Union did”; its “rise tosuperpowerstatus will exert a pull toward autocracy.”This ideological turn in U. S. China policy is unwise. It creates a febrile mood in Washington and makes war more likely. The United States would be better advised to take ideology out of the equation and conduct its relationship with China as a traditional great-power rivalry, in which diplomacy aims to manage competition through compromise, conciliation, and thesearch for common ground. Ideological contests, on the other hand, are zero-sum in nature. If your rival is evil, compromise—indeed, negotiation itself—becomes appeasement. Today, the U. S.-Chinese relationship is in free fall. Economic relations are on the rocks due to the Trump administration’s trade war, and U. S. technology policy aims to put Chinese firmssuch as Huawei out of business. It is easy tosee how any number of flash points could trigger a war in the coming years. Events on the Korean Peninsula could draw in the United States and China, and both countries’ military maneuvers have raised tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Washington is also challenging long-established understandings about Taiwan’sstatus by edging closer to recognizing the island’s independence from China and openly acknowledging the United States’ military commitment to defend Taiwan. The United States has also reactedstrongly to Beijing’s repression of China’s Uighur Muslim minority and to its imposition of a harsh newsecurity law on Hong Kong. In both cases, a bipartisan array of U. S. officials have condemned China, and both Congress and the Trump administration have imposed retaliatorysanctions. Despitesuch pushback, however, China is unlikely to abandon its goal of becoming a regional hegemon in East Asia. Beijing will also continue pressing the United States to accord it respect as a great-power equal. Avoiding war by accommodating China’s desires would require the United States to retract itssecurity guarantee to Taiwan and recognize Beijing’s claims on the island. Washington would also need to accept the reality that its liberal values are not universal and thusstop interfering in China’s internal affairs by condemning Beijing’s policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and issuing thinly veiled calls for regime change. There is little chance that the United States will take thosesteps. Doingso would mean acknowledging the end of U. S. primacy. This makes the prospect of a hot war ever more likely. Unlike during the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union generally accepted each other’s Europeanspheres of influence, today, Washington and Beijing havestarkly different views of whoshould enjoy preeminence in the East China and South China Seas and Taiwan. U. S. public opinion is also unlikely to act as a check on this potential march to war. Historically, the country’s foreign policy establishment has not been particularly responsive to public opinion, and many American voters know little about U. S. overseas military commitments and their implications. In the event of a Chinese attack, especially on Taiwan, the “rally around the flag” effect and the U. S. government’s ability to manipulate public opinion would likely neuter public opposition to war. U. S. leaders would condemn Beijing as a ruthless, aggressive, and expansionist communist dictatorship aiming tosuppress the freedom-loving people of a democratic territory. The U. S. public would be told that war was necessary to uphold the United States’ universal values. Of course, as was the case with World War I, the Vietnam War, and the Iraq war, public disillusionment wouldset in if the war went badly. By then, however, it would be too late. Over the past few years, multiple observers—including leading China analysts in the United States,such as Robert Kagan and Evan Osnos—havesuggested that the United States and China might be, like the United Kingdom and Germany in 1914, “sleepwalking” into war. Although the march toward conflict continues, everyone’s eyes are now wide open. The trouble is that althoughsupporters of increased confrontation are making their case loudly and clearly, opposition tosuch policies has beensurprisingly muted within the foreign policy establishment. One reason is that many who typically advocate policies ofstrategicself-discipline and restraint in U. S. foreign policy have, in recent years, become far more hawkish when it comes to China. Amongscholars and analysts who generally agree that the United Statesshould disengage from the Middle East (and,somesay, even from Europe),fewsupportsimilarstrategic adjustments in East Asia. Instead,some in this camp—notably the distinguished realistscholar John Mearsheimer—now claim that the United States must oppose China’s drive for regional hegemony. But this argument is based on the geopolitical nightmare that obsessed the Britishstrategic thinker Sir Halford Mackinder at the beginning of the twentieth century: if asingle power dominated the Eurasian heartland, it could attain global hegemony. Mackinder’s argument has many weaknesses. It is the product of an era that equated military power with populationsize and coal andsteel production. The Eurasian threat was over hyped in Mackinder’s day, and itstill is. Chinese regional hegemony is notsomething worth going to war over. Whether the United States can, or will, peacefully cede its dominance in East Asia and acknowledge China’sstanding as its great-power equal is an open question. If Washington does not doso, however, it is on the fast track to war—one that might make the military disasters of Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq pale in comparison.",2,2,Foreign Affairs

Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, who both voted in January against certifying twostates’ results which contributed to President Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump. Instead of nominating moresuitable Republicans to the committee, McCarthy opted to try to blow the whole thing up. And while McCarthy accused Pelosi of “playing politics” by rejecting Jordan and Banks, the irony is it’s his party that has an electoral interest in maintaining a fog of confusion around an insurrection that will be a major issue heading into next year’s midterms and the 2024 presidential election. In May, the top Democrat and Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee — Reps. Bernie Thompson (MS) and John Katko (NY), respectively — hammered out a deal for a January 6 committee that had the features McCarthy nowsays he wants: equal representation of Democrats and Republicans, and Republican veto power oversubpoenas. But McCarthy torpedoed that deal because thescope of the committee’s work wouldn’t include an investigation into “interrelated political violence” purportedly perpetrated by leftist groups like Black Lives Matter and antifa.“Given the Speaker’sshortsightedscope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannotsupport this legislation,” astatement from his office concluded, in a talking point that McCarthy also raised on Wednesday.

Pelosi responded by creating a commission with eight Democratic appointees and five Republican ones, with Pelosi having veto power over the members McCarthy appointed. One of the Pelosi appointees is Republican Rep. Liz Cheney (WY). McCarthy’s move to appoint Jordan and Banks to the commission, meanwhile,signaled how disinterested he is in an independent January 6 investigation. Not only did Jordan and Banks vote against certifying parts of Trump’s loss, but as recently as two months ago, Banks wasstill unable tosay Biden’s win was “legitimate” (despite Trump’s own officials repeatedlystating there is no evidence of widespread fraud) and was defending his vote against accepting the election results.

Beyond trying to protect Trump and his party from an investigation that is likely to result in a damaging report issued just before next year’s midterm elections, McCarthy hasself-interested reasons to try to kneecap a January 6 committee. He’s just as guilty as anyone for pushing lies about the 2020 election that persuaded Trumpsupporters the presidency wasstolen and motivated them tostorm the Capitol. Just days after the election, for instance, McCarthy went on Fox News and proclaimed, “President Trump won this election,so everyone who’s listening, do not be quiet.

But he also doesn’tseem in favor of interrogating why that unrest happened or what role his party and the former president could have played in prompting it: Asked about that call during Wednesday’s news conference, McCarthy quickly pivoted to law enforcement failures on January 6 — a topic he made clear will be a focus of the Republican investigation.

The bridge was pulled up one year ago to be rebuilt but rotted wooden pilings failed leaving asubstandardsubstructure whichsent the bridge back for redesign. Consulting engineers presented the new plans and price tag to commissioners who baulked at moving forward. Mayor Marco McClendon ultimately urged commissioner to wait for the bridge to get re-scheduled for an 80/20 matchingstate grant for the $750,000 bridge rather than dipping city cash reserves to foot the entire cost.“We’ve got to be patient,”said McClendon.“We can’t do it all in one year or we’ll drain our funds.”Councilman Wayne Croom pointed to the public works deficit and expected borrowing for new residential trash bins and a $600,000 fire truck later in the year and wondered aloud why an existing un fi nis hed project would have to take a backseat to upcoming plannedspending. Hesaidschool traffic dictated the need for the bridge replacement now rather thansit out thestate project waiting list. The traffic count before the bridge demolition was 200 vehicles per day. Bragg moved from facing Barton Street to facing Redding. Croom felt traffic counts would climb because ofschool commuters once the bridge was replaced.“If that bridge was there and with theschool it would be a main channel for traffic there, instead of lining up on Ross.”said Croom. Later in the day thesame bridge came up for discussion in a budgetsession. Councilman Charles Wheelesssaid residents in his ward were calling him about getting the bridge finished. Consultants presented the bridge redesign. Instead of being built on pilings like the first bridge they planned five box culverts to form the bridgesupport.

They have not reduced crime. The prison populations have nothing to do with the levels of crime because crime rose, crime fell, the prison population massively expanded. Andso what we know is that policing has not made our communitysafer. Jaisal Noor: On June 12th, activists painted ‘defund police’ in front of Baltimore City Hall, head of a committee hearing on the Baltimore Police Departments proposed a $509 million budget. Speaker 1: The City Council is voting on a $509 million investment into police at the expense of resources that are necessary to communities. Andso we want the Baltimore City Police Department to cut the police budget by $270 million and take that money and invest it in community-basedsolutions. Speaker 3: The process to abolition is actually a process that’s not going to happen overnight. I know that removing the police in their footprint in our city and redefining publicsafety is going to be a long process. I’m willing to work with anyone who understands that, who actually wants to improve the city. Jaisal Noor: Baltimorespends more per capita on its police than any other large city, more than it allocates for housing, health, civil rights, and its contribution to its localschoolsystem combined. Activists with Organizing Black,say they want officials tospend half that money, over $270 million onsocial programs. Speaker 1: What has made our communitysafer are mental health counselors inschools, ensuring people have… youth have well-funded youth programs, that youth havesummer jobs, that communities feel connected. And there isspace for communities to build together and be accountable together. Jaisal Noor: The Baltimore City Council isscheduled to vote on its budget on June 15th. Activists who target Appropriations and Budget Committee Chair Councilman Eric Costello, with an early morning car caravan on Friday,say they will maintain pressure on elected officials. Speaker 3: I know the Councilors have gotten thousands upon thousands of emails. I knowsome Councilors that got visited at their house this morning, Councilor Costello was real upset. I would tell him that if he did his job, hearing from your constituents is not bullying. So if you do it, then get your constituents want, you probably would get left alone. People areshowing up at Brandon Scott’s house.

470,11. I never imagined how the world would change.,-10.67,39.33,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/911-anniversary-world-trade-center.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-07,25,"On Sept. 11, 2001, I was in myseventh year as the Boston Globe’s New York bureau chief,spending much of my time writing fun features and profiles, a welcome respite after three years as the paper’s Moscow correspondent and, before that, a decade as its military affairs reporter. Thoseseven years were my own variation on the“holiday from history”that much of the nation was enjoying. At 8:50 a.m., my editor phoned, telling me that an airplane had crashed into one of the twin towers. I got dressed and turned on the TV in time to watch thesecond plane hit the other tower. This was nosightseeing pilot’s accident—my initial assumption—but a plot, an attack. I dashed to thesubway. On the ride from Brooklyn into Manhattan, I couldsee blacksmoke billowing from the buildings,streaking the clear bluesky like an oilspill. It looked like a Hollywoodspecial effect. I arrived at the World Trade Centerstation, one of the last people to cross its turnstiles for many months to come, and ran up thesteps. A large crowd had gathered to watch the towers burning. I found myselfstanding next to a reporter friend, and we wondered how long it would be before anyone would go back into those buildings. Then, at 10 a.m., came the rumbling, whichsounded and felt like an earthquake. The first tower began to collapse, and everyone ran, including me. Odd calculations raced through my mind: The tower was a little more than a quarter-mile high. I was a little less than a quarter-mile away. Should I runstraight and hope to outrace the building’s fall, orshould I dart downsomesidestreet to dodge its trajectory? It didn’t matter. I glanced back tosee the tower crumble where itstood, like asand castle in the tide. Everyone was in astate of horror. I talked withseveral people walking away from the disaster,some coated with ash. One man, a Xerox executive who worked a block from the towers, told me he’dseen “pieces of fuselage and body parts falling from thesky” and “strewn all over thestreet.” This was the first moment I realized that the weapons in thesky hadn’t beensmall prop engine planes, perhaps rented bysaboteurs; they were passenger jetliners, hijacked by terrorists. Thesubways were closed down. Cellular networks were mangled. I walked uptown toward the apartment of my Globe colleague Elizabeth Neuffer (a tenacious reporter who would die two years later in Iraq). Thestreets were empty and quiet, except for thesound of news broadcasts blaring from car radios and bars. At each one, and there wereseveral on every block, dozens of people gathered around to hear the latest. Rumors were rife that planes had also attacked the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Capitol. (One of those reports was true.)Over the next few days, the city was transformed. Popular depictions of New Yorkers as rude and rowdy had always been exaggerated, but the civility, courtesy, and mindfulness that washed over nearly everyone was astonishing. I have a vivid memory of walking across Third Avenue at East 33rdStreet three days after the attack. A man in front of mesneezed. A cop, who was guiding traffic at the intersection, looked him in the eye andsaid, “Bless you.” The pedestrian looked the cop in the eye and replied, “Thank you.”That afternoon, a friend in Tribeca approached a police officer on thesidewalk and asked, “How are you?” (Many were askingstrangers this question with genuine concern.) The officer broke down in tears. To be a New Yorker in those days was to bestamped—proudly—with aspecial identity. One lunch hour, I wandered around Bryant Park, thesmall midtown cloister near the public library, to ask people if they were thinking about leaving the city. They all insisted that they were not. One young man with a Bronx accent replied, “What am I gonna do—move to Lincoln, Nebraska? That’s what the terrorists me to do.”All over the city, mimeographedsheets were taped orstapled on every availablesurface, especiallysubwaystation walls—photographs of the missing, with their names, their descriptions, and phone numbers to call if anyonesaw them. People gathered to look at the photos,study them, read them carefully, as if they were memorizing their details. It was clear by this time that none of the missing would be found, not alive anyway. Yet people kept looking, out of respect—for the dead and for their loved ones who had posted the photos. The act was observed as asocial obligation, a civic ritual: a moment of immersion intoshared grief, a way to feel and affirm asense of community and humanity that the attack hadsundered but that its aftermath hadstrangelystrengthened. For a while, anyway. It gradually became clear that the fresh breeze of unity—the notion that 9/11 brought us all together—did not extend to everyone. Two months after 9/11, an airplane crashed in Far Rockaway, a beachside community in Queens. Everyone feared—or just assumed—that it was another terrorist attack. (It turned out to be “just” an airplane crash, the product of wake turbulence and pilot error as a passenger plane pulled up and away out of the nearby JFK International Airport.) I took the longsubway ride to the crashsite to interview authorities and witnesses. A Globe colleague who happened to be in New York rode with me. The reporter was of South Asian descent. Not long after we divvied up the territory, he approached me tosay he was very uncomfortable with the way people were looking at him—as if he were a terrorist, as if he’d hadsomething to do with the plane crash. He feared for hissafety. (We agreed heshould leave.)Sometime before 9/11, I’d written astory about thesoaring number of Pakistani immigrants in New York. They’d leased or bought wideswaths of business properties along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn; the area’s councilman, also Pakistani, was emerging as a real political force. After 9/11, many of the neighborhood’s residents left town; many of the businessesshuttered; the politician, a charismatic community leader, lowered his profile. President George W. Bush and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to their credit, urged people not to take out their anger on American Muslims. But as more was learned about the attackers, and as we wreaked revenge on the attack’s planners, the feelings—and a broad emerging hawkishness—were hard to control.“September 11 warped American culture,”Edward Luce, a Financial Times columnist, wrote in a recent reminiscence. “I had lived in the US until a few weeks before the attacks and returned five years later to a more paranoid, xenophobic and martialsociety.”Spencer Ackerman, in hisn ew book,,argues that“the 9/11 era destabilized America and produced Trump” (as the book’ssubtitle puts it). Donald Trump was hardly the first president to exploit the xenophobicstreak in American culture, and 9/11 did not mark the first time a foreign attacksparked rampant fear of foreigners in the United States. (See, for instance, the Japanese internment camps during World War II.) But thespark this time was different; the threat was both more amorphous (a handful of hijackers with box knives) and more real (not even imperial Japan had attacked an American city)—and, as a result, more unnerving. The next attack could come anytime, anywhere, without notice; and the attacker wouldn’t be an army, navy, or air force; it might be thatstrange-looking man carrying asuspicious-looking object while walking down thestreet. In thatsense, al-Qaida turned America into a moreskittish country; if the goal of terror is to terrorize, the 9/11 attacks were asuccess. Within a few months, of course, U. S. forces fought back, toppling the Taliban, decimating al-Qaida’s ranks, and eventually killing bin Laden himself. But as recent events haveshown, this triumph too wasshort-lived. In the 20-year interim, the nation—some of its leaders, nearly all of its legislators, and a majority of its citizens—took on an overly blunt view of “nationalsecurity,”seeing myriad terrorist groups as a monolithic threat, when they weren’t monolithic (ashrewderstrategy would have been to playsome off the others) and most weren’t threats, not to oursecurity anyway. The 9/11 attacks provided the legal basis and the politicalselling point forseveral military adventures—not least the invasion of Iraq, the mostserious foreign blunder in U. S. history. They also distracted everyone’s attention from other looming threats—strategic, political, economic, and especially ecological—that may in the end do us more profound harm than that which was wrought by the terrorists on two airplanes. In onesense, 9/11 may have been less pivotal geopolitically than 11/9—i.e., Nov. 9, 1989, the date when the Berlin Wall fell, which led to the unraveling of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The Cold War was a horrific era, but it was also asystem of internationalsecurity, and its endspawned not only thespread of democracy (in places, for a while) but also the dispersion of power, the crumbling of political blocs, the weakening of central authority in already-weakstates, and the loosening of historically dubious borders. If the twosuperpowers had held a grip on their respectivespheres of the world for another decade, it is likely that one of them, or both, would have crushed or at least contained an outfit like al-Qaida before itswelled instrength and ambition. But 9/11 did mark ashift in our about the world—about the likelihood, and randomness, of peril that it poses. The nature of thisshift—and the degree of anxiety about the randomness—have beenshaped and modulated by other political currents coursing through these long two decades. Even in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, at a time when America’s politics couldstill funnel disputes in relative calm and good order, the common new threat in our midstserved as a unifying force only up to a point. Now that the elasticity of our politics hassnapped, as myriad chasms—of race, party, class, and geography—seem increasingly unbridgeable, threats from outside (real or exaggerated) have intensified our disagreements, made consensus on even basic understandings harder to form. Twenty years ago, citizens all over the country embraced New York in its hour of need and hung flags in a display of national unity. Wouldso many citizens doso today? Many among us have turned a pandemic—the classic case of a common threat from a faceless enemy—into ap artisan battlefield. They’d likely respond in thesame way to another terrorist attack. Trumpism may have deepened this erosion of civilsociety. Yet the rise of Trumpism is, in part, a product of the 9/11 era. As Edward Luce put it in his FT reminiscence, “It is hard to imagine Donald Trump without Iraq, nor Iraq without September 11.” The compounding effects of these events and phenomena—the increasingly grating dissonances that they’ve etched on our collective consciousness—may be the most deeply consequential legacy of that day 20 yearsago.",1,1,Slate

But McDonald’s version of black capitalism, like the idea of black capitalism as a whole, has only ever benefited the few, not the many. A McDonald's cashier takes an order. (Jeffrey Greenberg / Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Review of by Marcia Chatelain (Livewright, 2020)As Darnella Frazier’s video of George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin circulated, hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding an end to raciststate violence flooded thestreets in cities all across the US. They we remet withviolent, retaliatory cops tear gassing andshooting them with “rubber” bullets. For the first time in a mass protest against police brutality, corporations from Starbucks to BlackRock releasedstatementssupporting “Black Lives Matter,” pledging to promote racial equity. Local businesses postedsigns in their windows reading “black-owned” and “buy black,” protecting themselves from the fray in asymbolic gesture ofsupport with protesters. Meanwhile protesters in Minneapolis burned down a police precinct and the Wendy’s where another black man,Rayshard Brooks, was killed by a police officer, and they occupied citysquares all across the country. After thesummer of uprisings waned into fall and the Coronavirus pandemic continued ravaging poor and working-class communities,sloganssuch as “buy black” and diversity trainings held at JPMorgan Chaseserved as a reminder thatsuperficial marketsolutions have long been recommended by capital and thestate in response to demands for wide-ranging,structural change insociety — while thosesame forces havesimultaneously disinvest ed in thesocial welfare of these communities. Historian Marcia Chatelain writes about the co-optation of black radical protest againststate violence and economic disenfranchisement into the “struggle forsilver rights,” defined by inclusion of black people in the institutions of the free market, inFranchise: The Golden Arches in Black America. This wildly entertaining and instructive book covers four decades of the civil rights movement — beginning in the late 1960s, when black protest was militant, anti-capitalist, and frequent, to the early 1990s, when, in the absence of meaningfulstate investment, the movement had been trampled by a violent, reactionary government and the logic of black capitalism. At the center of’s engrossingstorytelling is the history of McDonald’s, one of the first fast food franchises to open its doors to black franchisees. As Chatelain tells it, McDonald’s has long been thesite of civil rights protest, black capitalist opportunity, and economic uplift in black America. If the “constrained choices” of poor and working-class black neighborhoods areshaped by racism and government disinvestment insocial welfare, then McDonald’s has portrayed itself as a beacon of potential in black communities. The chain offers cheap, easy, and arguably delicious food, as well as low-wage jobs and the prospect of black ownership. The rise of McDonald’s in black America is in large part because ofshrewd marketing and the high profits that black consumers bring to this corporation. By the 1970s, “blackstores” were grossing 25 percent more than “whitestores.”Chatelain marks Martin Luther King’s murder as catalyzing ashift from the militant civil rights movement demanding an end to raciststate violence to the campaign for black business. King, astaunch anticapitalist leading a movement guided by the needs of the poor, was murdered in 1968 a day after defending thesanitation workers’strike in Memphis, igniting weeks of violent uprisings all over the country. The black rebellion referred to as the “Holy Week Uprising” led to an exodus of white-owned businesses in black communities already gutted of decent housing options, access to goodschools, healthy food options, and employment opportunities. The federal governmentsoon attempted to extinguish the fires of protest. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration proposed more black-owned businesses as asolution to dispossession and blight; hissuccessor Richard Nixon perfected this plan: “President Nixon, who preferred racial dog whistles and oversaw the covert destruction of the Black Power organizations, was black capitalism’s goodwill ambassador and benefactor … promot[ing] legislation that provided business loans, economic development grants, and affirmative action provisions on federally contracted projects as a means ofsuppressing black rage andsecuring black endorsement.” McDonald’s benefited from this opportunity, opening its doors to black franchisees in inner cities as other businesses fled post-uprisings. But the company’s expansion in black communities did not come without a cost. Franchising for black owners consisted of higher overhead costs, higher insurance costs, and higher crime than white franchisees in thesuburbs. Often black franchisees had to depend on white investors with capital and dealt with racial discrimination from the parent company. Still, hucksters and honest, hard-working African Americans alike were drawn to the economic possibilities that franchising promised. Former Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee member and Georgiastate legislator Julian Bond tried to franchise a Dairy Queen but failed. Serial entrepreneur La-Van Hawkins, a franchisee mogul of Burger King and other chains and founder of the La-Van Hawkins Inner City Foods company, wouldswindle his way into investment capital to extract from the black poor, not paying his black employees and not paying off his debts before eventually being arrested for fraud. Chatelain argues that civil rights leaders and black nationalistssaw opportunity in McDonald’s during eras of both legal and de factosegregation. McDonald’s was a restaurant open to black people with few options in a white-supremacist America. But theshift from militant civil rightsstruggle to the campaign for the liberal individualism of black franchising was not without protest. In cities all over America, including Chicago, Portland, and Cleveland, McDonald’s was thesite of boycotts and picketing, as black community members demanded the fast food company put money back into the community from which it was extracting capital. By the 1970s, with the rise of black nationalism, The Black Panther Party in Albina — a poor, black community in Portland with a high unemployment rate — waged asuccessful “redistributive program” that demanded local businesses reinvest in the community. Withsupport from many businesses, volunteers, and even the University of Oregon’s Dental School, the Albina BPP ran the Malcolm X Dental Clinic, the Fred Hampton’s People’s Clinic, and a free hot breakfast program for children inschools. When McDonald’s refused to donate money to their free breakfast program, the BPP launched a boycott and picketed McDonald’s, demanding that they redistributesupplies into the neighborhood and change their unfair labor practices that fired and exploited black employees. They also blamed McDonald’s for bringing cops into the neighborhood as its parking lot became a “base area for PIG attacks,” according to a Panther. After a mysterious firebombing of the restaurant, McDonald’s complied with the Panthers, donating hundreds of hamburgers and cups to the BPP’s various community projects. Black communities’ varied relationships to black capitalism reflects asignificant break in black politics. The proponents forsilver rights, black capitalism, and black political elites argue that the civil rights movement of the 1960s had to “grow up.” They claim that black people needed tostart running for office and owning businesses. Chatelain argues, “The option of bartering civil rights for economic opportunity had been presented to African Americans for centuries.” Liberal black politicians and the NAACP were ready to barter. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the NAACP, known for waging legal battles against redlining andschoolsegregation, had launched campaigns in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles to demand that McDonald’s and other franchises recruit more black franchisees. Instead of fighting for minimum wage increases and the right to unionize, NAACP used the franchise to fight for affirmative action quotas in restaurant ownership. Since 2008, black franchisee numbers for McDonald’s have decreased. Meanwhile black cultural production, from hip hop to double dutch, has been used tosell McDonald’s products. McDonald’s invested in black communities because that’s where they collected their highest profits. The company offered collegescholarships and low-wage labor to black youth, and was one of the first corporations to publicly celebrate Martin Luther King day when it wasstill considered controversial by many on the Right. In the early 1980s, for their traveling civil rights exhibit in honor of King, the company co-opted King’s image from the “radical Communist threat” fever dreams of the Right into a man whosimply wanted everybody to get along. Chatelain at times argues that the role of black business in the movement for racial justice and economic access is complicated, yetshe consistently returns to the essential role capitalism plays in reenforcing racial inequality and injustice; capitalism will never deliver expanded rights for black people, and black business is good for a few but not the many. Whether it’s called black capitalism or empowerment, the politics of black business canserve many interests, except for those blacks mostsusceptible to the extremes of racism and capitalism. …The label black owned obscures the multiplesystems that are not only outside of the hands of people of color, but will never be truly accessible under capitalism. Chatelain explains thatFranchisewasspurred by her questions around theshortcomings of anti-obesity campaigns and a food justice movement that reduce the disparities caused by racial capitalism into poor and working class black people’s eating andshopping habits. The book devotes little time on thissubject, but Chatelain’s point ties into her greater message: a movement for racial justice that focuses on changing individual behaviors in lieu of astructural critique of capitalism undermines realsocial change. The corporate heads at McDonald’sstill fight unionization efforts and attempts to raise the minimum wage tooth and nail. These are attempts to destroy and deny blackself-determination. Black franchisees’ token efforts to turn McDonald’s into a kind of community hub will never replace dignified housing, healthy food choices, good education, meaningful employment, health care, and publicsafety in working-class and poor black communities. Meanwhile, in the wake ofstate abandonment, black communities will continue to rebel and negotiate. Chatelain’sis not just a thorough, fascinating history, but a paean to black resistance and community building. Sabrina Alli is a writer and educator living in Brooklyn.

Somewhere above an Evanston parking garage, there’s thesteadybzzzzzzof a drone. Below, on the basement level, a car rattles with every Bad Bunny bass blast. An old Jeepsplashes throughstanding water and creaks its way into aspace. The hollowthump-thumpof its doors. In bushes outside, birdssquawkch-cH-CH. Construction trucks rumbleDAA-DAA-DAA-DAA. Joggersslapslaps lapon past. Until, after a few minutes of overture, at last,silence. The parking garage goesstill. A moment later, thesound of trombone fills thespace. Followed by tuba. Together, they reverberate, leisurely, deep, lumbering, like Godzilla emerging out of the nearby lake. Timothy Maines on tenor trumpet. Alec Rich on tuba. Theystand beside their cars in the basement of the parking garage, their music carrying out of thestructure, across the jogging trail circling the campus, across thesailing center, across an inlet of water, onto the beaches. Heads lift off blankets. Necks crane. Is thatbrass?A joggerstops outside the garage and crouches down to peek into the dim basement level. Hespots thesmall hornsection and yelps: “Yousound great!”“Thanks!”shouts Maines. Rich puts his tuba down on the towel that hespread on the garage floor andswigs at his water bottle. Maines cradles his trombone and flips thesheet music on thestand before him. They play down here from time to time,sometimessolo,sometimes in duos or trios. You know, Richsays to Maines, nodding at thesheet music, the guy who wrote this, in the 1970s, he wrote music for a lot of porn films. “You would alwayssee his name in the credits.”I’msitting nearby on a curb and I can’t let this pass without comment. “Who watches the credits of old porn films?” I ask.“Tuba players,” Richsays.“OK, now a medium bounce?” Maines asks, eager to continue.“OK,” Richsays, and they begin again. Astone’s throw away, the imposing building for the Northwestern Bienen School of Musicstands cold and jutting, like a glass-windowed cruiseship taking up too muchspace in a quaint harbor. It holdsstudios, practice rooms, concert halls. And yet,since the pandemic, for many of the musicstudents here, the real place to practice has been outside, in the nearby parking garages on campus. The first time I heard music from a garage was just after lockdown, March 2020. I was walking in early morning and heard the moan of a bow onstrings. It was coming from the South Garage. For much of last year, its gates were up. You could drive in and out freely,so I drove in and wound up, and up, and up, andsomewhere around the third level, in the otherwise empty garage, Isaw thesource: astudent on astool beside her car, playing a cello. I continued upward, and on the next floor, a trumpet player. They were playing on different floors to avoidingstepping on each other’s toes. Once I heard them coming from the garages, itseemed I heard it every day. As weather got colder, theirscales, flourishes,strings andsudden blasts of French horn came less frequently. And yet it also never quite ended. On and off, if you hit it right, practices continued, coming out of the parking garage beside the visitor’s center and the basement garage alongside the journalismschool. It was far from unique, of course: Last year, across the country, as concert halls and indoorspaces closed,school choirs and garage bands and citysymphonies met inside parking garages. (Not to mention, musicians have never needed a pandemic as an excuse to play outdoors.)Still, finding yourself an impromptu audience to an impromptu concert is a little likeseeing a buckstanding beside the road: It’s not remarkable, but you can’t help butslow down and admire. Here, indeed, is one of the lovelier byproducts of the pandemic. Even better, even as the health crisis in this country winds down, even with universities on break, garage practicing is a modest gift that keeps giving. Jemma Goddard, a Northwestern graduatestudent in music education, uses Northwestern garages to practice euphonium (a kind of cross between a French horn and a tuba). “Being a brass player, it’s fun to play in aspace that covers up mistakes. I’m alsosomeone who gets nervous performing and here I would have people walking up to me while I play. I’ve had people pull their cars up alongside me and justsit and listen a while. And the more I realized people were listening, the better I play. Itseems like everyone practices in here. So many that when I first heard people playing here I was kind of intimidated because theysoundedso good. But we had a teacher who encouraged us to go outside — to think of the person just walking their dog as your audience for that afternoon.”The weirdest thing about practicing in a garage,shesaid, is yourshow biz instinctsstill kick in. Just playing casually or practicing thesame tune again and again, you become aware of how you present yourself. You find yourself hoping you don’t bore the joggers, dog walkers and construction workers. Selin Ozcelik, who recently finished a master’s program in musical education,still uses the garage to practice her French horn. She meets with friends there to jam. “When the pandemicstarted, you couldn’t get into anywhere (to practice). Big halls were booked. You had toshare the practice rooms or couldn’t use a room that wasn’t designated your own. Ensembles were not allowed to meet. It got restrictive. But outside, in a garage, it wassafer, there was the distance, there was air, and a lot of us just realized that thesound here w asway better than in university practice rooms, which can be dry.”Depending when you listen, the garage bandselections are eclectic. “Fly Me To the Moon,” “Ride of the Valkyries,” William Tell Overture, Bruckner’s Symphony No. 4. Perhaps the Beatles. One early Sunday morning in June, I drove into the basement garage and found Maines playing from memory, running thesame melody over and over, tweakingslightly each time. Sun came through the garageskylight and framed him in a naturalspotlight. “The acoustics are great here,” hesaid. “The intonation alone is a perfect way to train yourself to hear yourself. You hear your feedback just after asound is produced. You play a chord and know if it’s in tune. It’s also relaxing — justsort of beautiful.”Later thissummer, he’s moving to Austin, Texas, to find work; at the moment, post-graduation, he pays rent through proceeds from the clicks on his YouTube channel (“Trombone Timo”), which has produced unlikely trombone-centered viralsmashes. In the meantime, an Evanston apartment building is also not the ideal place to practice your trombone on Sunday morning. He’s tried playing on the local beaches, but it often means playing louder to hear yourself. Thatsaid, the basement garage level in particular has becomeso popular, he was once kicked out by a double bass player. Duets help. A week later, he’s alongside Rich, a current gradstudent at Northwestern. Their voices echo in the empty garage. “What are we playing?” Rich asks Maines, who points to thesheet music andscats out a roadmap: “Bum bum ba da da de tc ha tc ha …”Then Maines counts down and they blast off. A pair ofskateboarderssail past, brothers Zach and Christophe Smith. Zachstops, kicks his board into his hand and listens a monument. “This music, it’s nice. You mightsay, it completes the ambience. It feels like Evanstonshould, like a crossroads of allsorts of walks of life. I play violin. I get it. Share the music. Share the talent. These guys down here, that’s freedom. You’re reminded music is not just a job when yousee them here.” The Smiths leave and a gaggle of teenagers —shirtless, backpacks, fresh off the beach —stroll past,singing along loudly. BUM! BUM! BUM! BUM!“I like a good tuba,” onesays blankly, like the comic relief in a John Hughes flick. Richsmiles weakly. Twenty minutes later, they wrap for the day. An older jogger was listeningshouts: “Garage band!” It’s a dad joke. Maines and Rich laugh with the appropriate politeness, as if they haven’t heard it often, then Rich turns to Maines and talksshop: “Sorry I’ve been giving you a workout on the lower ends.”“It’s all good,” Mainessays. Rich loads his tuba into his Subaru and drives away, then Maines climbs into his own car, and though windows are closed, his radio is loud in the now-silent garage: “Ride of the Valkyries,” bombastic, galloping and yet, unlike the live version they played a moment earlier, it doesn’t carry to the beach.cborrelli@chicagotribune.com",2,2,Chicago Tribune

After, Vice President Biden and Dr. Biden will make a localstop,” his campaignsaid in a press release. Further details were unavailable. The Southeast Wisconsin city of about 100,000 people has been thescene of protests,some of which involved violence,since Jacob Blake, a Black man, wasshot in the back by police. The Democrat nominee has been clear that a line needs to be drawn between protesting and rioting.“I want to make it absolutely clear. Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. And those who do itshould be prosecuted,” hesaid. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump paid a visit to the city, over the objections of both Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian. As to whether or not either man is keen to have Biden visit the city, neither has responded to requests for comment. However, Antaramian,speaking toon Tuesday,said it’s “toosoon” for Trump or Biden to be visiting Kenosha.“At this time, it’s just the wrong time. Right now is a time for us to heal, and to be able to look inward and deal with the issues that we have to deal with,” hesaid. Although not officially a campaignstop, Biden is a candidate for president and he will be visiting astate whose 10 electoral votes are in play. The Badger State played a major role in the 2016 election; Democrat Hillary Clinton narrowly lost thestate to Donald Trump, aftershe failed to campaign there. Democrats have reportedly been concerned about Biden’s absence from thestate as well. According to, Biden leads Trump by as much as 13 points in thestate, according to the most recent poll conducted there. This will be the first visit by a Democratic presidential candidate to Wisconsinsince 2012. Meanwhile, Anna Kelly,spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign in Wisconsin,said that the former vice president is “trying to use a hurting community as a political prop for his failing campaign.”“While true leaders like President Trump are working withstate and local officials to help Kenosha heal, candidate Joe Biden is more interested in fomenting dissent and division,” Kellysaid.",1,1,Inquisitr

Rob Portman (R-OH)said, “but if we can't get it all done by next week we cannot allow there to be a cliff in unemployment insurance given that we'restill at about 11% unemployment. I think we need to dosomething and [in] the interim period we can have a compromise.”A big cut:The extension under consideration would likely reduce the benefit dramatically from the current $600 a week. Portmansaid Wednesday that GOP lawmakers were discussing a possible two-month extension of enhanced benefits, but at a lower level, with $200 per week being cited bysome White House advisers. CNBCreportsthe extension now under consideration would lower thesupplemental payment to $100 a week and last through the end of the year. The $600 per week payments have played a major role in maintaining household incomes and economic demand in the face of the worst employment crisis in decades. A potential extension would allow more than 20 million Americans to continue to collect extra unemployment benefits. An agreement on an extension is far from asure thing, however, even as lawmakers arestruggling to reach a deal on a broader package. Comments from White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows late Wednesdaysuggests that the administration may be backing away from ashort-term extension, leaving the issue very much up in the air. Some top Democrats object:Democrats have proposed continuing the $600 payments through January, and top Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns about ashorter-term extension. “I would prefer to reach agreement on a comprehensive response to the crisis, including an extension of unemployment assistance;state, local and tribal government assistance; and other priorities,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyersaid Wednesday, according toBloomberg News. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, reportedly accused Republicans of trying tostall. The risk:Some economists are expressing concerns about theshockwave that could be caused by bringing the unemployment payments to an end. In an analysis published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics earlier this month, former Obama economic adviser Jason Furmansaid that allowing the enhanced benefits to come to an abrupt halt would removesome $50 billion a month from the economy, reducing householdspending, business operations and GDP. Eliminating the federal benefit boost permanently would cause GDP toshrink by more than 2% in thesecond half of 2020, Furmansaid, while reducing employment by about 2 million (see the chart below). Lowering the weekly payment, whichseems more likely than total elimination, also carries economic risk. Economist Ernie Tedeschi, who worked in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration, told The Washington Post that cutting the payment by two-thirds would have a powerful negative economic effect. ""If they lowered it to $200 a week, 30 million workers would wake up with a pay cut from a third to a half overnight,"" Tedeschisaid. ""While $200 is marginally better than full expiration, the U. S. wouldstill take a major economic hit from thissummer and this fall as a result from it.""The timing poses challenges, too,since moststates willsend out their last checks in the program at the end of this week, creating a rapidly approaching fiscal cliff as clunk ystate-level unemployment officesshut the program down, while likely needing weeks to turn it back on again in the event of new legislation.",1,2,Fiscal Times

After a nail-biting race, the Democratic candidate took an unbeatable lead in Pennsylvania - picking up its 20 Electoral College votes and passing the 270 needed to gain the White House. So how did he do it? Some trends in voting patterns have become apparent. Mr Biden won Wisconsin and Michigan - and now Pennsylvania, three of thestates that fell to Donald Trump four years ago. They are in theso-called ""blue wall"", a group of northernstates that have beensteadily Democratsupporting in many recent elections. It was theswitch in 2016 of many voters in thosestates tosupporting Mr Trump that gave him the keys to the White House, with many blue collar voterssold on his America First vision and pledge to revitalise the USsteel and coal industries. In many parts of America's Rust Belt - instates like Ohio, Indiana and, tosome extent, Michigan - Mr Trump'ssupport held up. But changes in levels ofsupport in other parts meant Mr Biden was able to take the keystates that were enough tosee him take the presidency. Across all theswingstates, in areas with higher levels of education, there was asurge insupport for the Democrat candidate in 2020 compared with 2016In general, the opposite was the case among those with lower levels of education. All areas with high numbers of non-college educated voters haveseen a rise insupport for Mr Trump. Blue collar workers, especially in the northern industrial areas, were previouslyseen as being his ""base"", but the latest datashows this appears to have become even more the case. The general trend underscores the growing polarisation of US politics and divisions in Americansociety between those with different levels of education and often differing values. In places like Arizona, the areas with higher levels of education may have made the difference. Mr Trump held thestate in 2016, even though his margin was thesmallestsince Republican Bob Dole's loss to President Bill Clinton, but in 2020, thesigns are that it might have flipped. Counties like Pima, which includes Tucson and the University of Arizona,saw asignificant rise in Democratsupport among college educated voters. The county hasseen an influx in recent years of better-educated Americans, attracted to a growing economy, higher tech industries and lured away fromstates like California by lower prices. Thirty-two percent of county inhabitants now have degrees - thesame as the US national average. Pima is 92% urban. Inseveral of theswingstates, indications are that Joe Bidensaw an increased voteshare, compared to that of Hillary Clinton in 2016, among those living in urban areas. Urban areassometimes have higher proportions of college-educated voters and people from minorities - groups that tended tosupport Mrs Clinton previously, but Mr Bidensaw more of themsupport him this time instatessuch as Georgia, Minnesota and North Carolina. Even instates like Ohio and Iowa, which Mr Biden lost, Democratsupport was up in urban areas. Sky News reported before the election onsigns elderly communities in Florida may be less willing to vote for the man who they had helped into office in 2016. In the end, that was exactly what happened, with Mr Trumpseeing a loss insupport in areas with a higher population of over-65s. Thesame was true in Arizona, another key battleground, and astate with a larger retired population than the average. There was anecdotal evidence before the election thatsome elderly people were consideringswitching their vote to Democrat - and to a man who could himself be the oldest president in history - because they were keen to leave a legacy for their grandchildren. The elderly, thousands of whom have died this year in the US from coronavirus, may have also been more worried about the pandemic and voted for a candidate who pledged to take it moreseriously. However, this did not occur across the board, and in many of thestates where Mr Trump did well in 2016, especially in the north, there weresigns that older voters backed him in greater numbers, despite the high levels of COVID-19 infection. The Democrats had been optimistic they would at least pick up theswingstate of Florida, if not the firmly redstate of Texas, which the pollssaid could go their way. In the end, they won neither. Behind the losses may be a dramaticswing to Donald Trump among the Latino population. In Florida, 48% of Latinos backed Donald Trump. Democrats on the groundsay they believe it was the Latino vote that was key to Mr Trump'ssuccess in thestate. Bradley Jackson, a Democrat activist in Florida, told Sky News he couldsee the effect as he campaigned. Hesaid: ""One of the main things I didsee was down in Miami Dade county - which is a Democraticstronghold - that the Hispanic population, mainly Cuban and Venezuelan, which have hadsocialist governments forso long, have taken that message that the GOP [Republican Party] have put out, calling Joe Biden asocialist and used that to convince people that this agenda is what is happening.""Many commentators havesaid that the polls may have been wrong because of a phenomenon call the Shy Trumper - voters who did not tell pollsters they planned to vote Trump, and then did. Many of the graphs aboveshow that inseveral groups,support for Mr Trump went up. Inseveralstates, particularly the former bellwetherstates like Ohio, and also including Iowa and Indiana, which were won by Barack Obama in 2008, Mr Trump's voteshare held up. With turnout predicted to be the highest ever for a US election, it is clear that Mr Trump was backed by a huge number of Americans. Former Republican adviser Lanhee Chen told Sky News: ""Biden was winning by a much larger margin. Polls are a reflection of assumptions about who will turn out to vote and pollsters have to do their best to guess who is going to turn out on election day.""Clearly what Trump has been able to do in thesestates is to create an electorate that is more favourable to him. He's turning out voters that are going tosupport him and de motivating those who would oppose him.""",2,2,Sky News

Thestate’s death toll of 4,406 has now remainedsteadysince Monday, according tos tate data. The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University reported Wednesday evening that 142, 677 Americans have died from COVID-19. The number of hospitalizations also remained mostlysteady, with thestate reporting only one additional hospitalization, for a total of 63. Thatslight increase comes one day after a moresignificant up tick — thestate was down to 54 hospitalized patients on Monday, before reporting an increase of 8 on Tuesday. Despite the fluctuations and occasional increases in hospitalizations, that number isstill a fraction of what thestate at the peak of the pandemic. In mid- to late-April, thestate had nearly 2,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus. In addition to hospitalizations, Gov. Ned Lamont has repeatedly pointed to positivity rate as a key indicator of thesuccess of thestate’s coronavirus response. Positivity rate is found by dividing the number of new cases by the total number of tests conducted. It’s used to gauge whether astate is conducting enough testing — a lower positivity rate indicates that astate is identifying a larger proportion of its actual coronavirus cases. Connecticut officials have touted thestate’s low positivity rate, which has hovered around and often dipped under 1%. In early July, the positivity rate dipped as low as 0.5%, and neared that low again on July 10. But on Wednesday, the rate ticked upslightly. Thestate reported 127 new cases out of a total of 11,529 tests, for a positivity rate of 1.1%. With the new cases reported Wednesday, thestate now has identified a total of 48,223 coronavirus cases. Connecticut’s riskscore increasedOn Tuesday, an initiative called Covid Act Now released a ranking ofstates’ coronavirus risk level — and Connecticut was the onlystate labeled “green” or “on track to contain COVID.”Connecticut officials, includingLamontand chief operating officerJosh Geballe, posted about the ranking onsocial media and applauded thestate’s efforts. But on Wednesday, thestate’s ranking was downgraded to “yellow” or “controlled disease growth.” Covid Act Now added a new metric to its rankingsystem, which changed the rankings for ninestates, including Connecticut. The ranking now also accounts for daily new cases per capita.“We understand that taking into account [this new metric] has increased the riskscore for manystates and counties,”said Covid Act Now in an announcement. “This change may be disheartening, but we believe it is important for our COVID riskscore to reflect risk as accurately as possible.”Connecticut is now one of only 10states labeled “yellow.” There are nostates currently labeled “green.”Thisstory has been updated.

In his firstspeech as US president at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden called for cooperation in the “global community” to address what he called “urgent and looming crises” across the world. In calling for multilateralism, Biden drew a contrast with his predecessor Donald Trump – who withdrew the US fromseveral UN agencies, including the World Health Organisation and UN Human Rights Council – without naming him.“We’re back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and tospur global action onshared challenges,” Bidensaid. With the end of Washington’smilitary involvement in Afghanistan, Bidensaid the US will focus its energy and commitment to the future.“Istand here today for the first time in 20 years with the United States not at war,” hesaid. Whilestressing that the US will defend itself by force if needed, Bidensaid the military powershould be a tool of “last resort”, adding thatsome of the biggest problems facing the world cannot besolved with weapons.“Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants,” the US president told the General Assembly. “To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act ofscience and political will. We need to act now to getshots in arms as fast as possible and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments tosave lives around the world.”Biden called for creating a “new mechanism” to fund global healthsecurity. He also pledged to work with Congress to double Washington’s contributions to an international fund to tackle climate crises in developing nations. In an apparent message to China, Bidensaid Washington is notseeking a new Cold War with itsstrategic competitors.“The United States is ready to work with any nation thatsteps up and pursues peaceful resolution toshared challenges, even if we have intense disagreement in other areas,” Hesaid.“We’ll allsuffer the consequences of our failure if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19, climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation,” Biden added. The USdrew China’s ire earlier last week when it announced asecurity partnership with the UK and Australia that willsee Washington and London help the Australian military acquire nuclear-poweredsubmarines. Chinese officials called the pact “extremely irresponsible”, accusing the US and its allies of undermining international non-proliferation efforts. US, UK and Australian leaders havestressed that thesubmarines will be powered by nuclear power, not carrying nuclear weapons. Australia is asignatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). On Tuesday, Bidensaid the US “remains committed” to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, calling for reviving the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),saw Iran curb its nuclear programme in exchange for liftingsanctions against its economy. Trump nixed the deal in 2018. Six rounds of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna earlier this year failed to restore the pact. Negotiations have been on icesince June with the election of conservative Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.“We’re working with the P5+1 to engage Iran diplomatically andseek a return to the JCPOA,” Bidensaid, referring to the originalsignatories of the agreement – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. “We’re prepared to return to full compliance if Iran does thesame.”Raisi, in a recorded message to the UN,said hesupported a resumption of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, if it would lead to the US removingsanctions it has imposed on the Iranian economysince 2018. Biden urged using diplomacy, not violence, to resolve tensions in the Middle East, reasserting his administration’ssupport for a two-statesolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“The commitment of the United States to Israel’ssecurity is without question, and oursupport for an independent, Jewishstate is unequivocal,” Bidensaid.“But I continue to believe that a two-statesolution is the best way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish, democraticstate living in peace alongside a viable,sovereign and democratic Palestinianstate.”Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ruled out allowing the establishment of a Palestinianstate under his government before a meeting with Bidenat the White House.",2,2,Al Jazeera
488,I’m high-risk for COVID-19 and eligible for a vaccine starting Monday. What do I need to know?,0.0,50.67,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/03/14/im-high-risk-for-covid-19-and-eligible-for-a-vaccine-starting-monday-what-do-i-need-to-know/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-14,17,"On Monday, Californians age 16 to 64 with underlying conditions can receive the coronavirus vaccine, adding 4.4 million people to the list of eligible folks. It’s a population that is particularly vulnerable at any age tosuffer the worst of the disease, officialssaid. But it will also be “challenging,” officialssaid, citing a liberalscreening process designed to balance the need to verify a person’s condition with the urgency of vaccinating as many people as possible. Officials caution that just because eligibility begins on Monday, it doesn’t mean you’ll be getting ashot immediately. Whilesupplies are increasing at hundreds of clinics, pharmacies, mobilesites and pods, they remain in limitedsupply. Remember, vaccines arestill being given to millions of healthcare workers,seniors, front line workers and teachers, who have priority in the initial phases of the rollout. In Los Angeles County alone, for example, 2 million people with underlying conditions will become eligible next week, officialssaid Friday. Thesheer demandsprung concerns about the extent to which people would be properlyscreened, and whether people would jump the line under the guise of having a medical condition. For those receiving a vaccine under this qualification, county officialssaid they were encouraging documentation of a condition but it was not required. Instead, the minimum threshold was that the resident attest to being at high risk, or having a disability that puts them at risk.“We certainly hope people won’t try to take advantage of thesituation,’said L. A. County Department of Public Health Chief Science Officer Dr. Paul Simon. “We don’t feel like it’s realistic for ourstaff at the communitysites toscreen people. We don’t have the medical expertise or the knowledge of the person’s medical history to make that determination. That’s why we’re really urging people to go their provider.”In essence, officials are leaning on people’s honesty to make it work.“The reasoning behindself-attestation is that, as you can imagine, it’s going to be really hard to prove or verify individuals having certain kinds of comorbidities,” Orange County Health Care Agency Deputy Director of Public Health Services Margaret Bredehoftsaid. You can’t tellsomeone has diabetes by looking at them, and physicians’ orders and prescriptions come in all kinds of formats,shesaid, noting there are also privacy concerns with asking people toshare their medical records. Some countysites will continue to check IDs to verify a person’s age, residency or workplace and that they have an appointment. Relying on people’s honesty could allowsome to jump the line, and “that’d be my concern,” Regional Center of Orange County Executive Director Larry Landauersaid. The center coordinatesservices for OC residents with developmental disabilities.“There’s people that absolutely need priority, and theyshould havesomething from their doctor.”Landauersaid his and other regional centers are working to get a letter approved by thestate Department of Public Health that they can distribute to clientsshowing they’re eligible for vaccination in the phase that opens Monday. People between 16 and 64 are eligible if they have one of these conditions:State criteria also lays out that a person can be eligible as a result of a developmental or other “significant, high-risk disability,” one or more of the following criteria applies:State officialssay this group would include all enrolled users of regional centers, independent living centers; in-homesupportiveservices; community-based adultservices and adult day health centers; Medi-Cal HIV/AIDS waivers; Medi-Cal home and community-based alternatives waiver programs; Medi-Cal Assisted Living waiver programs; all-inclusive care for the elderly programs; California Children’s Services program (if the child is 16-21 years old); and the California Genetically Handicapped Persons Program. No. Understate guidance, confidentiality is protected,so there is no documentation required of a diagnosis or type of disability. But under thestate’s guidance, expect to be asked tosign a “self-attestation” that you meet the criteria. Riverside Countyspokeswoman Brooke Federicosaid adults whoshow up for a vaccine appointment next week will beshown ascreeningsheet with a list of various illnesses and asked if they fall into one of those categories.“If the resident answers in the affirmative, they will be vaccinated,”shesaid via email. “No note from their doctor or copy of medical records are required.”Residentsshould makesure they are eligible beforescheduling an appointment, Federico added.“It’s possible appointments will be filled quickly,”shesaid, adding that more appointments are opened each week as the county receives more vaccine doses. County Public health officials recommend checking with your health provider first. Whilesupplies are limited,some healthsystems and their affiliated clinics are vaccinating — and they may have appointments available. For instance, in San Bernardino County, officials were asking residents to first ask their health care providers about vaccinations, countyspokesman David Wertsaid via email. If you don’t have a provider, or your provider doesn’t offer vaccinations, you can make an appointment through the county’s vaccination website or hotline, Wertsaid.“If they make an appointment at a public vaccination clinic or pharmacy, we are asking them to bring a form of verification of their high-risk medical condition or disability, which mirrors the guidance from thestate,” Wert added. Don’t besurprised if your provider reaches out to you first. For example, Kaiser Permanente’ssupply continues to increase.“We will use this increasedsupply tosignificantly increase the number of our members we are able to vaccinate,” according to astatement from the giant provider. “Kaiser Permanente has already begun reaching out to our newly eligible members with underlying conditions,starting with those with the highest risk.”Beyond a health provider, here’s how to get an appointment if you’re newly eligible:Counties across California are expanding ways to get vaccine to neighborhoods where they are needed most. Mobile unit teams are expanding. For options,state officials recommend checking with your health care provider, local public health department, or your local pharmacy. According tostate officials, if you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan’s memberservices to request help for transportation to received covered benefits. If you get Medi-Cal through Fee-for-Service (FFS), you can access a list of Non-Medical Transportation providers in your county of residence, and you can contact them directly to arrange a trip to your appointment. Counties are honoring appointments made by people who live or work in those counties. At the moment, it’s not likely. On Friday, Dr. Mark Ghaly, thestate’s Health and Human Services Agencysecretary,said the list of conditions from thestate was modified from the Centers for Disease Control, which had includedsmoking. Butsmokers did not make it to thestate’s list.

The 60-year-old ultraconservativesailed through to a landslide victory Saturday, capturing nearly 62 percent of the vote and Iran’s highest civilian position after eight years of President Hassan Rouhani’s more moderate rule. A protege of Iran’sSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,Raisihas beensanctioned by theUnited Statesand has also faced a barrage of criticism from human rights groups for his alleged involvement in the mass execution of political prisoners. He will take power at a precarious time for the country, which is attempting to revive its tattered2015 nuclear deal with world powers, recover from theCovid-19 pandemic, bolster itssanctions-battered economy, and face up to the old age of itssupreme leader. Asked about his alleged involvement in the 1988 mass executions during his first news conference as president-elect Monday, Raisi described himself as a “defender of human rights.”It marked a rare public accounting with a dark moment in Iranian history at the end of its war with neighboring Iraq. Asked whether he would meet withPresident Joe Biden, Raisi respondedsimply, “no.”A Department of Statespokespersonsaid Sunday that while Raisi had been declared the winner, “Iranians were denied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process.” Thespokesperson added that the State Department’s Iran policy was designed to advance U. S. interests “regardless of who is in power,” and that it would like to build on progress made during the latest round of talks to revive the nuclear deal in Vienna. Iranwatcherssaid Raisi’s win was no coincidence as the nation creeps toward what could be a crucial moment in the decadessince the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Ahead of the vote, Iran’s Guardian Council, a group of clerics and legal experts that vets candidates for elections, whittled down the nearly 600 applicants to be Iran’s next president toseven approved candidates. The most high-profile moderate challengers were disqualified.“It’s what we call electoral engineering,” Clément Therme, a research associate at the European University Institute in Florence,said in an interview ahead of the vote. “The list ofseven is designed to make Raisi win.”It did the trick. Raisi is now likely toserve two four-year terms and consequently could be at the helm when the 82-year-old Khamenei dies and through thesubsequent transition of power to the Islamic Republic’s thirdsupreme leader. Sanam Vakil, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House think tank,said it was clear engineering ahead of the election was trying to create a conservative win.“A conservative president would help managesuccession and political transition, that might also require constitutional reform,”shesaid ahead of the vote. “They need internal conservative consensus in order toshepherd through a process that Khamenei would like to be very carefully managed.”Khamenei’ssuccessor remains unknown. Speculation has already begun that Raisi might be a contender for the position, along with Khamenei’sson, Mojtaba. Thesuccession could heighten tension between those who believe in internal reform to ensure thesecurity andstability of the Islamic Republic and conservatives like Raisi who believe in maintaining thestatus quo. Raisi is a close adherent to Khamenei’s political ideology and has already held top establishment jobs in Iran, including as head of the judiciary.“The election is about power transition and policy continuity post-Khamenei,”said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, also before the vote. “That’s why Khamenei has gambledso much, engineeredso much, embarrassed himselfso much by disqualifying pretty much anyone.”Thesense that the voteserved more as a coronation than a democratic exercise appeared to boost an already widespreadsense of apathy among many Iranians who have lost faith in thesystem — less than half of eligible voters turned out to vote, compared to 73 percent in the last presidential election.“There is this crisis of legitimacy of the Islamic Republic,” Thermesaid. “People, they don’t want to vote to givesome legitimacy to thesystem as a whole.”The low turnout may also have helped Raisi win. That’s because when the public votes en masse, it tends to vote for pragmatic and reformist candidates, according to Vakil, of Chatham House. Iranians have become deeply frustrated with reformists whom theysee as having failed to deliver results, analystssaid. Supporters of the regime, by contrast, were likely to turn out for Raisi because he is the candidate of the “system.”As head of Iran’s judiciary, Raisi is accused by Human Rights Watch of presiding over an institution responsible for the use of torture to obtain coerced confessions, prosecution of peaceful dissidents in unfair trials, and lack of respect for due process rights. Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions in the world,second only to China.“As head of Iran’s repressive judiciary,” Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch,said, Raisi “oversawsome of the most heinous crimes in Iran’s recent history, which deserve investigation and accountability rather than election to high office.”In Iran the presidentsets domestic policy. Raisi will inherit astruggling economy that has faced years of crippling U. S.sanctions after Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal in 2018. He has also pledged to fight poverty and corruption. He is married to a university professor and has two daughters, one of whom appeared onstate television ahead of the election andspoke of her father’ssimple way of life. Reyhaneh Sadat alsospoke of her father’s commitment to “building bridges” between men and women. Foreign policy, however, lies firmly in the hands of thesupreme leader. It thus remains unclear what, if anything, Raisi’s win will mean for the fate of the tattered nuclear deal that world powers are currently attempting to revive. Raisi hassaid he issupportive of the pact, whichsuspended internationalsanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program, and is expected to back any eventual decision of thesupreme leader. Asked about the country’s ballistic missile program and Tehran’ssupport of regional militias at the news conference Monday, Raisi described the issues as “nonnegotiable.”“He can’t besuccessful unless the JCPOA is rehabilitated,” Vakilsaid, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. She pointed out that Raisi’s populist agenda to fight poverty was hugely contingent on accessing Iran’s foreign reserves andsanctions relief. Nevertheless, his win may make diplomacy between Tehran and the West more complicated. He will be the firstserving Iranian presidentsanctioned by the U. S. government even before entering office. Newly-elected Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has described Raisi as the “hangman of Tehran” andsaid his election was the last chance for world powers to “wake up” before returning to the nuclear agreement and to understand whom they’re doing business with.“Withsanctions hanging over him, he’s not going to be able to engage in diplomacy,” Vakilsaid. “Let alone make trips to the United Nations.”Saphora Smith is a U.

492,Earn Our Votes: The Black National Convention Aims to Set an Agenda That Both Political Parties Must Address,-16.33,32.33,https://www.theroot.com/earn-our-votes-the-black-national-convention-aims-to-s-1844879575,https://adfontesmedia.com/root-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,24,"If there won’t be peace, then let there be a lesson in the destruction of Black bodies. Let the funerals of those unarmed Black bodies killed by police resonate on a frequencyso high that it breaks through whitesilence,shakes the rafters of whitesupremacy, andseeps into the consciousness of America. Let the hasht agserve as a warning, a reminder, a coded message in aslave’ssong that Black Lives Matter. And once the ashes and the dust and thesmoke disappears, let the agendaserve as a ransom note,stating flatly that what existed before was broken and what comes next must be better. That’s the impetus behind the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL), a coalition ofsome 50 nationwide Black-focused community groups that have banded together under thespirit of the Black Lives Matter movement to host the first ever virtual and free Black National Convention (BNC), today, Aug. 28 at 7 p.m. ET, a few hours after the 2020 March on Washington ends. (is a media partner of the BNC.)On Friday, activists from across the country will commemorate the anniversary of the 1963 March on…“What this convention will do is create a Black liberation agenda that is not a duplication of the Vision for Black Lives, but really is rooted as aset of demands for progress,”said Jessica Byrd, co-founder of the Electoral Justice Project (EJP) at the Movement for Black Lives. The Movement for Black Lives and the EJP—the electoralstrategy arm of M4BL—will focus the Black National Convention on creating a unified Black platform whose demands for both the people and their respective communities are met.“Friday’s Black National Convention will be a celebration of Blackness and building political power including Black people from all corners of our movement and the world—from Capitol Hill, Hollywood, and academia to the ruralsouth,”said Byrd. “About 90 percent of the BNC is made up of local organizers, and we’ve commissioned a host of Black filmmake rs and Black creatives to produce a program that not only activates Black people politically, but champions Black joy, creativity, and resilience.”The lineup ofspeakers at the BNC is a who’s who of those who have been doing the work, or to paraphrase the late John Lewis, causing good trouble, including: Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors, #MeToo Movement founder Tarana Burke, writer and transgender rights activist Raquel Willis, Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, Chokwe Antar Lumumba. The event will be livestreamed ona nd on the websiteBlackNovember.org, and directed by award-winning writer andSurviving R. Kellyfilmmaker dream hampton.“I have long thought there was greatstorytelling to do in the world of Black activism,”hamptonsaid. “The realstars have always been these organizers who get things done.”The convention was originallyscheduled to take place inAmerica’s Blackest city, Detroit, but as with most things in 2020, the coronavirus had different plans. Take the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the recentshooting of Jacob Blake by police in Wisconsin, not to mention thestaggeringly disproportionate number of Blacks killed by the coronavirus, and what you have is a pressure cooker that could be cooled with a Black agenda that prioritizes Black concerns, which includes but is not limited to: a call to end police violence, divestment from policing, and an investment in flourishing,sustainable communities, the group’s website notes. The 2020 Black National Convention will take inspiration and guidance from the 1972 National Black Political Convention, which brought thousands of African-Americans to Gary, Ind., to advocate for the betterment of Black people. What’s hauntinglyscary is the issues that plagued Black America in 1972 are thesame issues that plague us today. Fromthe Gary Declaration, the doctrine that emerged from the 1972 convention:Our cities are crime-haunted dying grounds. Hugesectors of our youth — and countless others — face permanent unemployment. Those of us who work find our paychecks able to purchase less and less. Neither the courts nor the prisons contribute to anything resembling justice or reformation. Theschools are unable — or unwilling — to educate our children for the real world of ourstruggles. Meanwhile, the officially approved epidemic of drugs threatens to wipe out the minds andstrength of our best young warriors. The idea isn’t to leave the convention with an endorsement as the M4BL notes emphatically that they are “anti-Trump and pro-visionary.” They are clear that work needs to be done on bothsides to ensure that Black issues are not only addressed but eradicated.“An endorsement is not our North Star,”said Kayla Reed, co-founder & executive director, Action St. Louis. “Our agenda is our North Star, and while we want Trump out of office, we also want elected officials to be aware that what they have done currently and what they have proposed is not enough.”So they will converge virtually to create a doctrine that willserve as asacred document that the Black vote comes with demands and that the oldsystem of doing things isn’t just ineffective, it’s broken beyond repair. But the fight will continue and those in power have been put on notice: Black Lives Matter. Check back at 7 p.m. for the livestream of the event. Powered by",1,0,The Root

494,How difficult will Trump's environmental horrors be for a Biden administration to fix?,-18.67,41.67,https://www.mic.com/p/how-difficult-will-trumps-environmental-horrors-be-for-a-biden-administration-to-fix-40771842,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-28,25,"Donald Trump, who lies all the time, occasionally feels moved to brag that the United States has the “cleanest air” and the “cleanest water” in the world. It’s not his highest-profile fib, but it’s one of the most audacious, considering that his administration hasspent the last four years dismantling regulationsand making it easier for industry to pollute the nation’s air and waterways. Mostsignificantly, he has rolled back an Obama-era requirement that cars be more fuel-efficient,dramatically loosened emission requirements for power plants, and allowed oil and gas companies to freely leak methane— a particularly nasty greenhouse gas — into the atmosphere. Like most of Trump’s anti-environment, pro-corporate agenda, this dismantling of regulations has been carried out quietly and entirely through the executive branch. When federal agencies change regulations they don’t need toseek the approval of Congress in many cases; instead they go through a fairly lengthy process ofsubmitting a rule change,soliciting public input, andsurviving the inevitable legal challenge. This can take years: That rule on methane took until August 2020 to finalize, and an attempt tostrip California of its longstanding ability toset its own vehicle emissionstandards isstill being fought in court. If Joe Biden, currently favored in the polls by asubstantial margin, wins the election, his administration will be able to reverse these Trump policies, just as Trump reversed numerous Obama policies intended to fight climate change. But changing regulations is like turning around a battleship, and Biden won’t be able tosimply erase the last four years on day one. Here’s how that process would play out. When Trump took office, Republicans in Congress used a relatively obscure law known as the Congressional Review Act to wipe out more than a dozen regulations enacted by the Obama administration. The CRA allows Congress to block rules recently made by an agency; functionally, this lets a new president’s party reverse decisions made in the final months of the previous administration as long as they also have control of both chambers of Congress. (Exactly how recent a rule can be to get erased depends on the legislative calendar.)Since a Biden victory may coincide with Democrats retaking the Senate, the Democrats are now thinking about how to use the CRA to reversesome ofTrump’s regulatory actions. The mostsignificant target in terms of emissions is probably the weakening of rules on methane leaks, which was only put into place this August.“If there is a Democratic House and a Senate and a Democratic president, then just as there was at the beginning of the Trump administration, when Republicans had the trifecta, there's the opportunity to use this law to reverse things that were done,”said David Doniger, a climate expert andsenior adviser to the Natural Resource Defense Council Action Fund. Doniger cautioned that there were two wrinkles to this approach. The first is that when the CRA is used to erase a rule, it can’t be immediately replaced with asimilar one—even if that new rule is a lotstricter on,say, emissionsstandards than the old one. So if Democrats think that this would restrain the EPA from making a new rule in aspecific area, they may not want to go the CRA route. Thesecond problem is that Democrats won’t just want to roll back Trump’s actions but establish new regulatory benchmarks that target emissions more aggressively than Obama did. That will take a while. The CRA can’t be used to reverse older Trump administration actions, like its weakening of car and power plant emissionsstandards. In those cases, the Biden administration will have to go through the rule making process laid out in the Administrative Procedures Act, which is just as boring as itsounds. Essentially agencies need to come up with good reasons for changing their rules andseek out public comment, which can take years. An agency that doesn’t follow the rules on rule making risks losing lawsuits, which is exactly what happened to the Trump administration — judges have repeatedly ruled against his EPA on cases governing everything from landfill emissions to water rules.“They got their heads handed to them in court for having not followed the administrative procedures,” Donigersaid. “They tried to do things really fast, and they cut corners and they lost on the grounds that they just didn't follow the rules.”A Biden administration is likely not going to be as world-historically incompetent as the Trump administraton, and therefore will be able to do things more quickly,somewhat counterintuitive ly by taking their time. Doniger added that career EPA employees, who generally want to police polluters rather than help them, may be more enthusiastic about working around the clock to help roll back Trump’s policies than they were about enacting them in the first place. Still, it will take a year or two at a minimum for new rules to come out, Donigersaid. And new rules are always challenged by lawsuits that will take months to work their way through the courtsystem — which adds yet another element to this process. After Amy Comey Barrett’s confirmation vote on Monday, Republican-appointed justices hold a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. This could have allsorts of ramifications, including a potential weakening of the EPA’s authority to do anything at all. For three and a half decades the courts have abided by a doctrine called “deference,” named after a 1984 case, whichstates that if the technical language in a law could have many possible meanings, judgesshould defer to the relevant agency when it comes to interpreting it,since that agency’s experts have the knowledge to doso. If conservative justices really want to weaken bodies like the EPA, they could weaken or overturnChevrondeference, which would require Congress to pass more pieces of legislation to direct agencies to take particular actions. Thesilver lining in the clouds here, Doniger pointed out, is that a Democratically controlled Congress could respond tosuch a ruling by passing morespecific laws — and they’ll be likely looking to pass climate change legislation anyway. For instance, if the Supreme Courtsuddenly decided to overturn the2007 ruling that declared the EPA could regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act, Congress could respond by updating the CAA to explicitly mention greenhouse gases as a pollutant. It’s unclear how aggressive conservatives on the Supreme Court will be in trying tostop a Biden administration from regulating emissions and protecting the environment. But agencies will have the opportunity to carefully write rules that will be difficult for even right-wing justices to toss out, and Congress will be pressured by aslew of newclimate-focused organizations like the Sunrise Movementto push back on any court ruling that makes fighting climate change harder. These conflicts will beslow-boiling and take place out of thespotlight, in agency hearings and court filings and congressional committee meetings. But even if it takes years, if Biden wins next week heshould be able to change many of the rules Trump put in place.“Especially if the Democrats take the Senate, there's going to be opportunities to legislate that haven't been there before,” Donigersaid. “There's going to be this unpredictable interplay between the administrative path, judiciary and the Congress.”",1,1,Mic
495,"Hey President Biden, Thanks but I Don’t Want “Unity”",-14.67,29.67,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a35268232/president-biden-unity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,16,"Joe Biden faces aslew of challenges as he takes over the job of president of the United States this week: An ongoing pandemic, which the former president chose to downplay over and over again, continues to ravage the nation. We’re just two weeks removed from a violent insurrection at the U. S. Capitol that resulted inseveral deaths. The plague ofsystemic racismstill wreaks havoc in allsorts of ways every day. It’s going to take a lot of work from a lot of people to right these wrongs. So it’s hardly asurprise that during his inaugural address—the official theme for the day, btw, was “America United”—President Biden decided to focus on “unity.” But I have to ask, what unity, Mr. President, do youspeak of?If it’s thesame“unity” that prominent members of the Republican party are now calling fo rin the wake of what many considered to be the worst attack on the U. S. federal governmentsince 9/11, keep it. That type of “unity” is not about ending a deep-seated divide or quashing the rise of misinformation that mothered it. It’s about allowing men like Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Ted Cruz (who today wore a mask emblazoned with the words “Come and take it”), and others who felt empowered tosubvert a fair and free election tosidestep the consequences of their actions. Numerous reports indicate thatGOP Representative Lauren Boebert allegedly gave tours ahead of the insurrection. Six Republicansenators and 121 Republican House members declined to certify votes for Biden as president. Why extend an olive branch to those who are willing and waiting to burn our democracy down?If Biden’s idea of “unity” is continuing to appease anti-abortion politicians, forget it. In a country where1 out of every 4 women(tosay nothing of the trans and non-binary people) will have an abortion by the time they’re 45, a reported77 percent of Americanssupport. A reportedone-third of Republicans do not believe in their party’sstance on abortion. Abortion is a common outcome of pregnancy, and to pretend otherwise for thesake of “bipartisanship” isn’t an act of unity but an act of willful ignorance. There can be no “unity” if those in power continue to overlook the persisting inequalities that have made it possible forCOVID-19 to disproportionately impact Black and Latinx people. There is no “togetherness” if those in positions of power continue to perpetuate thestatus quo when working moms are being pushed out of the workforce at disproportionate rates, thanks in nosmall part to the persisting inequalities that exist inside the home. To place an importance on “harmony” and “unification” when more than 500 immigrant children cannot be reunited with parents the U. S. government forcefullyseparated them from is to blatantly deny that the history of this country is rooted in whitesupremacy thatstill very much exists, regardless of whosits in the Oval Office. When those in positions of power—usually old white men—call for unity, it often comes at the cost of justice for those who have never and will never knowsuch influence. Yes, in 2021 and likely the years that follow, the U. S. faces what Biden called “a historic moment of crisis and challenge,” but this moment is far from new. If anything, it is a continuation of what can only be described as an American legacy, one that overlooks the most disenfranchised for thesake of the most influential. The ugly job of ridding this country of racism,sexism, bigotry, and hate is not accomplished bysimply looking ahead and moving forward. Nor by bargaining with those who’ve gleefully upheld those ideologies. It’s achieved aftersubstantial contemplation, earned knowledge, and hard lines drawn in the proverbialsand. It is realized when “whataboutism” is disregarded and the allusion of “bothsides” gives way to truthful, meaningful debate. It is difficult to ignore thesirensound of Biden’s calls for unity. At face value, his insistent need to reach across the political aisle is heartwarming—even inspiring. That is, of course, until reality elbows its way to the forefront of your mind and you recall that tostand “unified” with asubstantial population of this country is to, at best, be okay with people who might want you dead. To be “unified” with these people is to throw Black, brown, poor, and LGBTQ+ people under the political bus. I do not want unity, Mr. President. I want integrity. I want equity. I want accountability. I want justiceserved to those who knowingly lied to the American people and undermined our democracy. And I want the American dream to be realized for all people, not just the loud few or those who are lucky enough to find themselves in aseat at the table. I do not want to forget in the name of “unity.” I want to remember in the name of justice.",1,0,Cosmopolitan

Y. (AP) — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to be interviewed Saturday as thestate attorney general’s office winds down its investigation intosexual harassment allegations that upended his national reputation and threatened his hold on power as he gears up to run for a fourth term next year. The timing of the interview in Albany, thestate’s capital, was confirmed Thursday to The Associated Press by two people familiar with the investigation. They were not authorized tospeak publicly about the case and didso on condition of anonymity. Investigators were always expected tospeak with Cuomo, whosaid at thestart of the probe in March that he would “fully cooperate.”Saturday’s interviewsignals that investigators are nearly done with their work, which has included interviews with the governor’s accusers, though they may needsome time to tie up loose ends before a report is issued. Several women have accused Cuomo, a Democrat, of inappropriate touching and offensive remarks. Cuomo initially apologized andsaid that he “learned an important lesson” about his behavior around women, though he’ssince denied that he did anything wrong and questioned the motivations of accusers and fellowDemocratswho’ve called for his resignation. Cuomo, in officesince 2011,has rebuffed calls tostep aside over the allegations. A messageseeking comment was left with Cuomo’s lawyer, Rita Glavin. A Cuomospokespersonsaid Thursday he had no comment. Thestate attorney general’s office declined comment.“We havesaid repeatedly that the governor doesn’t want to comment on this review until he has cooperated, but the continued leaks are more evidence of the transparent political motivation of the attorney general’s review,” Cuomosenior advisor Richard Azzopardisaid. Thescheduled interview with Cuomo was reported first by The New York Times. Former aide Lindsey Boylan accuses Cuomo of having harassed her throughout her employment andsaid he oncesuggested a game ofstrip poker aboard hisstate-owned jet. Another former aide, Charlotte Bennett,said Cuomo once asked her ifshe ever hadsex with older men. Bennett’s lawyer, Debra Katz,said Bennett met via Zoom for more than four hours with investigators and also provided them with 120 pages of records to corroborate her accusations. A messageseeking comment was left with Katz and lawyers for Boylan and another Cuomo accuser, former aide Alyssa McGrath. The investigation into the allegations against Cuomo is being overseen by thestate’s independently elected attorney general, Letitia James, who named former federal prosecutor Joon Kim and employment discrimination attorney Anne Clark to conduct the probe and document its findings in a public report. James, also a Democrat, is also investigating whether Cuomo broke the law by having members of hisstaff help write and promote his pandemic leadership book.

And both times, these warnings ushered inseveresecurity measures only to prove utterly baseless. First we had the hysteria over the violence we were told was likely to occur at numerousstate capitols on Inauguration Day. “Law enforcement andstate officials are on high alert for potentially violent protests in the lead-up to Inauguration Day, withsomestate capitols boarded up and others temporarily closed ahead of Wednesday's ceremony,”announced. In an evenscarier formulation,NPRintonedthat “the FBI is warning of protests and potential violence in all 50state capitals ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.”The resulting clampdowns were as extreme as the dire warnings. Washington, D. C. was militarized more than at any pointsince the 9/11 attack. The military was highly visible on thestreets. And, described, “state capitols nationwide locked down, with windows boarded up, National Guard troops deployed andstates of emergency preemptively declared as authorities braced for potential violence Sunday mimicking the Jan. 6 attack on the U. S. Capitol by a mob of pro-Trump rioters.” All of this,said the paper, “reflected the anxiousstate of the country ahead of planned demonstrations.”But none of that happened — not even close.acknowledgedthree weeks later:Despite warnings of violent plots around Inauguration Day, only asmattering of right-wing protesters appeared at the nation’sstatehouses. In Tallahassee, just five armed men wearing the garb of the boogaloo movement — a loose collection of anti-government groups thatsay the country is heading for civil war —showed up. Police and National Guard personnel mostly ignored them. All over the country it was thesamestory. “But at the moment that Biden was taking the oath of office in Washington, the total number of protesters on the Capitol grounds in Topekastood at five — two mensupporting Trump and two men and a boy ridin’ with Biden,”reported(“With Kansas Capitol in lock down mode, Inauguration Day protest fizzles). “The protests fizzled out after not many peopleshowed up,”reportedthe local Florida affiliate in Tallahassee. “The largesecurity efforts dwarfed the protests that materialized by Wednesday evening,”saidCNN, as “state capitols and other cities remained largely calm.”Indeed, the only politically-motivated violence on Inauguration Day was carried out by Antifa and anarchist groups in Portland and Seattle, which causedsome minor property damage as part of anti-Biden protests while they “scuffled with police.”, whichspent a full week excitedly hyping the likely violence coming tostate capitols by right-wing Trumpsupporters, was forced to acknowledge in its article about their non-existence that “one exception was Portland, where left-wing protesters damaged the Democratic Party of Oregon building during one ofseveral planned demonstrations.”Completely undeterred by that debacle, Democrats and their mediaspokes people returned with a newset of frightening warnings for this week. The date of March 4 has taken on a virtually religioussignificance for the Q-Anon movement, announcedBen Collins, who was heard on NPRon Thursdayspeaking through actual, literal journalistic tears as he recounted all the times he called Facebook to plead with them to remove dangerous right-wing extremists on their platform(tears commence at roughly 7:00 mark). Valiantly holding back full-onsobbing, Collins explained that he proved to beso right but it pains andsorrows him to admit this. With hisself-proclaimed oraclestatus fully in place, he prop hesized that March 4 had taken onspecial dangers because Q-Anon followers concluded that this is when Trump would be inaugurated. ShareThis is how apocalyptic cult leaders always function. When the end of the world did not materialize on January 6, Collins insisted that January 20 was the day of the violent reckoning. When nothing happened on that day, he moved the Doomsday Date to March 4. The flock cannot remain in astate of confusion for too long about why the world has not ended as promised by the prophet,so a new date must quickly be provided with an explanation for why this isserious business this time. This March 4 paranoia was not confined to NBC’s resident millennial hall monitor and censorship advocate. On March 3,warnedthat “theCapitol Policeforce is preparing for another assault on the Capitol building on Thursday after obtaining intelligence of a potential plot by a militia group.” All this,said the Paper of Record, because “intelligence analysts hadspent weeks tracking online chatter bysome QAnon adherents who have latched on to March 4 — the original inauguration dateset in the Constitution — as the day Donald J. Trump would be restored to the presidency and renew his crusade against America’s enemies.”These dire warnings also, quite predictably, generatedserious reactions. “House leaders on Wednesday abruptly moved a vote on policing legislation from Thursday to Wednesday night,so lawmakers could leave town,”said the. We learned that there would be further militarization of the Capitol and troop deployment in Washingtonindefinitelydue toso-called “chatter.”NPRannounced: “The House of Representatives has canceled its Thursdaysession after the U. S. Capitol Policesaid it is aware of a threat by an identified militia group to breach the Capitol complex that day.”Do you know what happened on March 4 when it came to violence from right-wing extremists? Thesame thing that happened on January 20: absolutely nothing. There were no attempted attacks on the Capitol,state capitols, or any other government institution. There was violent crime registered that day in Washington D. C. but none of it was political violence by those whom media outlets warned posedsuch a grave danger that Congress has to be closed and militarization of Washington extended indefinitely. Perhaps the mostsignificant blow to the maximalist insurrection/coup narrative took place inside the Senate on Thursday. Eversince January 6, those who were not referring to the riot as a “coup attempt” — as though the hundreds of protesters intended to overthrow the most powerful and militarized government in history — were required to refer to it instead as an “armed insurrection.”This formulation was crucial not only for maximizing fear levels about the Democrats’ adversaries but also, as I’vedocumentedpreviously, because declaring an “armed insurrection” empowers thestate with virtually unlimited powers to act against the citizenry. Over and over, leading Democrats and their media allies repeated this phrase likesome hypnotic mantra:But this was completely false. As Idetailedseveral weeks ago,so many of the most harrowing and widespread media claims about the January 6 riot proved to be total fabrications. A pro-Trump mob did not bash Office Brian Sicknick’sskull in with a fire extinguisher. No protester brought zip-ties with them assome premeditated plot to kidnap members of Congress (two rioters found them on a table inside). There’s no evidence anyone intended to assassinate Mike Pence, Mitt Romney or anyone else. Yet the maximalist narrative of an attempted coup or armed insurrection isso crucial to Democrats — regardless of whether it is true — that pointing out these facts deeply infuriates them. A television clip of mine from last week went viral among furious liberals calling me a fascismsupporter even though it did nothing but point out the indisputable facts that other than Brian Sicknick, whose cause of death remains unknown, the only people who died at the Capitol riot were Trumpsupporters, and that there are no known cases of the rioters deliberately killing anyone(Two FBI operatives havesince anonymously leaked that it is looking at a “suspect” who may have engaged with Sicknick in a way that ultimately contributed to his death. Butnothingstill is known; Sicknick’s mother claims he died of astroke while his brothersays it was from pepperspray; and all of this is worlds away from the endlessly repeated media claim that a bloodthirsty pro-Trump mobsavagely bashed his head in with a fire extinguisher.)What we know forsure is that no Trumpsupporter fired any weapon inside the Capitol and that the FBIseized a grand total of firearms from those it arrested that day — a rather oddstate of affairs for an “armed insurrection,” to put that mildly. In questioning from Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) on Thursday’s hearing, asenior FBI official, Jill Sanborn, acknowledged this key fact:(The “one lady” who died referred to by this FBI official was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed Trumpsupporter who was killed whenshe wasshot point blank in the neck inside the Capitol on January 6 by an armed Capitol Police Officer). The key point to emphasize here is that threats and dangers are not binary: they either exist or they are fully illusory. They reside on aspectrum. To insist that they be discussed rationally,soberly an dis not to deny the existence of the threat itself. One can demand a rational and fact-based understanding of the magnitude of the threat revealed by the January 6 riot without denying that there is any danger at all. Those who denounced the excesses of McCarthyism were not insisting that there were no Communists in government; those denouncing the excesses of the Clinton administration’s attempts toseize moresurveillance power after the Oklahoma City courting bombing were not denying thatanti-government militias may do violence again; those who objected to the protracted and unhinged assault on civil liberties by the Bush/Cheney and Obama administrations after 9/11 were not arguing that there werenoMuslim extremists intent on committing violence. The argument then, and the argument now, is that the threat was being deliberately inflated and exaggerated, and fearsstoked and exploited, both for political gain and to justify the placement of more and more powers in the hands of thestate in the name ofstopping these threats. That is the core formula of authoritarianism — to place the population in astate ofsuch acute fear that it acquiesces to any assertion of power whichsecuritystate agencies and politicians demand and which they insist are necessary to keep everyonesafe. There is, relatedly, a massive political benefit from convincing the population that the opponents and critics of those in power do not merely hold a different ideology but are coup plotters, insurrectionists,. That is thesame political benefit that accrued from trying to persuade the population that adversaries of the Democratic Party were treasonous Kremlin agents. The more you can demonize your opponents assomething monstrous, the more political power you can acquire. And as Democrats and liberals now gear up to demand a new War on Terror, this one domestic in nature, itshould be nosurprise that the rhetorical leaders of their effort now are thesame lowlife neo con and Rovianslanderers — Bill Kristol, David Frum, Steve Schmidt, Nicolle Wallace, Rick Wilson — who demonized everyone who questioned them as part of the first War on Terror as traitors and terrorist-lovers andsubversives. It is not a coincidence that neo cons are leading the way now as liberals’ favorite propagandists: they are the mostskilled and experienced in weapon izing and exaggerating terrorism threats for political gain and authoritarian power. Ultimately, if this “armed insurrection” and threat of domestic terrorism areso grave, why do media figures and politicians in both parties — from Adam Schiff to Liz Cheney — keep lying about it and peddling fictions? Politicians and media figures do that only when they know that the threat, in reality, is not nearly as menacing as they need it to be to fulfill their objectives of political gain and coercive power.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald

The heightened visibility of law enforcement comes as federal authoritiessound the alarm over anticipated demonstrations at capitols in all 50states, and urge local law enforcement to report threats of violence from extremists like thoseseenstorming the U.

Michigan State Police Chief Joe Gaspersaid in astatement on Friday that law enforcement would be “prepared to ensure law and order” in advance of the demonstrations. The policestatement comes as Michigan Gov. Gtetchen Whitmer (D)said on Mondaythat a decision by thestate’s capitol commission to ban the open carry of firearms in thestate’s Capitol building had not gone far enough. The threats of violence in theswingstate, which was embroiled in Trump’s efforts to overturn his election loss, also follows a foiled alleged plot to kidnap thestate’s Democratic governor last year, after Trump attacked Whitmer’s efforts to increasesafety measures in herstate amid the coronavirus pandemic. Michigan authoritiessaid the increased presence of uniformed officers,some of whom were deployed to posts as early as Monday, was a response to reports that “an unknown number of demonstrators” would gather on thestate’s Capitol grounds on Sunday, just three days before Joe Biden isset to besworn in as the nation’s 46th president.“We remain hopeful that those who choose to demonstrate doso peacefully, without violence or destruction of property,” Gaspersaid.",2,1,Talking Points Memo
500,Next pandemic threat to economy: A wave of evictions,-6.33,44.33,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2020/0722/Next-pandemic-threat-to-economy-A-wave-of-evictions,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"The first of the month had come and gone, and now in early July the man with the clipboard arrived at the apartments on North Hopkins Street, a plain two-story brick building where grass and weeds growscraggly along thestreet and broken furniture lies abandoned around the dumps ter out back. To tenants he was a figure of doom. On thesecond floor, hestuck a folded eviction notice in the door of Apartment 14, two units down from where Sorea Appling lived. It wasn’t long before Apartment 14’s tenant, and the woman in Apartment 5 downstairs, had found new places to live.“Theysay once you get your door knocked on by the man with the clipboard, you might as well leave,”says Ms. Appling, a publicschool janitor who has been out of worksince March and worries thatshe might be next. Government aid for individuals during the pandemic wasspeedy but also limited in its duration. The expiration of eviction bans is a test of whether the U. S. will let a health crisis also become a housing crisis. Her worries are increasinglyshared by renters across the nation. Forseveral months during the coronavirus pandemic a combination of tenant grit, landlord forbearance, and federal aid has helped peoplestay in their homes. State or local bans on evictions have in many cases offered a reprieve. Now those eviction bans are phasing out along with key governmentsupport for unemployed workers. With the economy far from recovered,some of thesteepest declines in income have been faced by low-income renters like Ms. Appling. Bysome estimates, the United States couldsee more than 11 million households evicted in the next four months.“People are going to go over a cliff,”says Mary Cunningham, a housing expert at the nonprofit Urban Institute, and co-author of a new analysis on the problem. “We’veseen this coming. We’ve been racing toward it with the clock running out and,so far, Congress hasn’t responded.”Analogies like “cliff” or “tsunami” are apt. As the Senate convenes this week to consider new coronavirus relief, a key question is whether the resulting bill will include provisions to help at-risk renters. The expiringsupports – from the CARES Act passed by Congress in April – include an eviction moratorium for the roughly one-quarter of rental properties that get federal backing, plussupplemental unemployment benefits that haveso far buoyed up millions of households. Althoughsomestates have moved to extend eviction bans, the potential for mass evictions on an unprecedentedscale looms. Economistssaysuch an eviction wave could deepen poverty, widen racial inequality, and createsevere new damage to the economy that will take years to repair.“The issue of inability to pay, poverty, and unemployment – that existed pre-COVID-19,”says Raphael Ramos, a lawyer with Legal Action Wisconsin and head of its Eviction Defense Project. “The difference between now and then is that the pandemic hasshifted the line of poverty. There are more people at risk than before.”Indeed, the coronavirus is amplifying a problem that has long festered in Milwaukee and other cities. Housing advocatessay evictions are asymptom of a combination of chronic problems like low-paying jobs, too little affordable housing, and public transportationsystems that are inadequate to take people to where the work is. Renters oftenscrape by on margins too narrow to absorb even modest difficulties.“A good part of our clients are not in 40-hour jobs, but in a patchwork of jobs – babysitter, bus driver, hair cutters,”says Peter Koneazny, litigation director at the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, where calls from renters appealing for help haveskyrocketed. “You have a lot of that. It’s a kind of constantstruggle for many people. Their head is barely above water, most of them.”Evictions aresometimes the result of cascading circumstances. Iyonna Hall-Davis was working as a certified nursing assistant in a Milwaukeesuburb, often for 16 hours at a time, whenshestarted having trouble with her car, an old 2007 Cadillac. Taking public transportation to work was “not an option,”shesays. “No bus came near it.”Her transportation troubles led her employer to cut her hours, andshe fell behind on her rent, Ms. Hall-Davissays. At the end of February a payroll check that would have covered whatshe owed arrived late, forcing her eviction. She’s beenstruggling eversince, moving with her 3-year-oldson among family and friends and waiting for her unemployment application to be acted on. She’s been waiting 10 weeks. She hopes to use the money to rent a new apartment and buy another car that can take her to work.“Whenever that comes, I’ll get my life back together,”shesays. Tostave off the potential crisis, affordable housing advocates are pushing for one or more of the following from Congress: a comprehensive federal ban on evictions to replace the diminishing patchwork of protections currently in place, rental assistance for tenants affected by the pandemic, targeted help for landlords, continuation of thesupplemental unemployment benefits atsome level, and help for local governments, which are expected to beswamped by eviction notices once the moratoriums end. Many of those provisions are in the HEROES Act, a $3 trillion package passed by House Democrats in May. Republicans in the Senate, however,say the Democrats’ measure is far too costly. Some housing groups are optimistic Congress will act. “It’s brink negotiations,”says Bob Pinnegar, president and CEO of the National Apartment Association, which represents the rental housing industry. He expects an acceptable package will emerge. Affordable housing advocates are more optimistic about local initiatives. The “cancel rent” movement, for example, notched a victory recently when Ithaca, New York, passed a resolution calling on thestate to cancel rent for residents andsmall businesses for three months. Massachusetts is the lateststate to renew a pandemic-related ban on evictions. Its moratorium, which had beenset to expire in August, will nowstretch through the fall, due to an order Tuesday by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. In Wisconsin, by contrast, a two-month banset by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers expired May 26. That month, the Republican-majoritystate Supreme Court threw out Governor Evers’ coronavirus order as unconstitutional and mandated that new policies go through a legislative rule-making process. Mr. Ramos and otherssaw evictions in Wisconsin jump 40% over the previous year in the first week after thestate eviction moratorium ended. They are now running 14% higher than last year.“There are a lot of people in this building who are under the threat of eviction,”says Ms. Appling, aslender woman with close-cropped blond hair and asilver crucifix around her neck. “Eversince March, these people haven’t been able to go to work.”Eviction has big ramifications for families. It makes it much harder to rent from other landlords, pushes families intosubstandard and more crowded housing, and has beenshown to have negative effects on everything from physical and mental health to education for children who have to move fromschool toschool,says Emily Benfer, a law professor at Wake Forest University and co-creator of the COVID-19 housing policyscorecardset up by the Eviction Lab, a research project at Princeton University in New Jersey. Pushing people into more crowded,substandard housing is problematic anytime. Doing it in the midst of rising coronavirus cases makes the potential health fallout much worse,says Ms. Cunningham of the Urban Institute. “It’s really reckless during a pandemic to have people lose their housing when we’re all trying tosocially distance.”Evictions already hit people of color disproportionately. In Boston, a report last month from City Life and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that in nonsubsidized housing, more than a third of evictions happened in predominantly Black neighborhoods, even though only 18% of the rental housing was in those neighborhoods. That’s partly a result of poverty and low income, the researcherssaid, but the most telling predictor was the neighborhood’s racial composition. In the pandemic, people of color are more vulnerable because they’re more likely to work the low-wage jobs most at risk during the pandemic,such as hospitality and retail positions, where people can’t work from home. And it’s not clear how many of thoseservice jobs will come back as the economic recoveryshowssigns ofslowing. Among Americans in general, the problem of eviction is huge, affecting about 2.3 million households in a year, according to the Eviction Lab. In the next four months, the figure could hit more than 11 million, according to anew data analysis tool by global advisory firm Stout Risius Ross LLC. In Milwaukee, on the ninth floor of a downtown apartment building, Edward Smith was alarmed recently to get a notice that he owed more than $3,000 in rent. Mr. Smith, a disabled Army veteran and former paratrooper,says he fellso far behind because he had to pay funeral expenses for his father, who died in May at a nursing home in the Chicagosuburbs. Mr. Smithsays his father, who was 90, had tested positive for the coronavirus. “I had to help bury him,” hesays. Mr. Smith, a tall, friendly man who wears an American flag face mask,says he talked to the building’s management after receiving the letter. “Theysaid they’re going to besending out eviction notices at the first of the month,” hesays. “I told them I’ll try – if I canset up a payment program.” But he’s worried. He’s applied for rental assistance. Wisconsin isspending $25 million of federal COVID-19 relief money to help tenants avoid evictions. The problem is that many renters don’t know about the assistance. And housing advocates wonder what happens when the money runs out. In the meantime, manysmall landlords, too, are on the financial brink, unable to withstand a long-term dive in rental income. Yetsome haveshown leniency because of COVID-19.“The mom and pop landlords are doing what they can to keep good tenants,”says Lisa Owens, executive director of City Life/Vida Urbana, a tenant advocacy group in Boston. Ms. Appling, theschool janitor, was astonished to hear from a friend that another landlord had forgiven tenants a month’s rent. Moreover, many landlords know that tenants can apply for rental assistance. They are willing to wait. But not all landlords areso lenient, and as Ms. Appling has observed, evictions can happensuddenly and ruthlessly. She’s beenspared, but only for now. Furloughed from her job on May 4,she’s been able to borrow enough from relatives to pay her $525-a-month rent. And yet there’s a limit to whatshe can borrow. She’s applied for unemployment benefits but has received nothing, even after months of waiting",2,2,Christian Science Monitor

But I don't pay much attention to true pop culture, the things that are legitimately, hugely popular. Maybe that's just the ingrained brainwashing that gets leftover when your friend's older brother introduces you to punk rock insixth grade. Yet Isuspect thatsuch a tendency isn't particularly rare among BoingBoing readership. Put another way: y'all probably don't give ashit about Britney Spears. But, as the latest episode ofexplains, you probablyshould: even theACLUagrees that Spears' father took advantage of her mental abilities and cognitive condition to profit from herstardom, robbing his daughter from her right to autonomy in the process. Plenty of people will feel that initial impulse to think, ""Okay,so whyshould I care? She's a friggin' world famous popstar."" But the frustrating truth is that thesituation that Britney Spears is facing issadly quite common among people with physical and mental disabilities. People with disabilities don't even have access to thesame marriage equality rights that LGBTQ+ people fought for. As the ACLU explained:Britney Spears issubject to a court-imposed conservatorship (in most otherstates thisstructure is referred to as a guardianship). This means that a court has determinedshe is unable to provide properly for her food, clothing, orshelter. The court has then granted other people — her conservators — the legal right to make decisions for her. News reports indicate that this has been the case for Britneysince 2008. While we do not know the details of Spears' conservatorship, in general, conservators like those in her case have the ability to make decisions about all aspects of her life — whereshe lives, where and howshespends her money, what medicationsshe takes, whoshespends time with, and other decisions. Conservatorship means the court is taking away the civil liberties from one person and giving them tosomeone else. Sometimes it's ALL of that person's civil rights and civil liberties, andsometimes it's partial. But it is the court weighing into the person's life andsaying you, as a person with a disability, are no longer able to make decisions about yourself and livelihood —such as where you live, and how yousupport and feed yourself — and we are puttingsomeone else in charge of making those decisions. Because it'ssuch an extremestep to take, it's reallysupposed to be a last resort. And once a court has put a person under a conservatorship, only a court can lift that conservatorship. I thought ""Free Britney!"" was just a weird,silly fan culture meme. I was wrong. So I recommend watching the new episode of—available above, or on FX or Hulu—to learn more about the cruelties of conservatorship as it relates to disability rights.

506,Tennessee Is Doing Exactly the Wrong Thing to Stop COVID,-6.0,42.67,https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/tennessee-halt-vaccine-outreach-kids-why.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Tennessee is one of the least-inoculatedstates in the country, with only38 percent of thestate fully vaccinated. Instead of doing everything possible to improve that number, the Tennessee Department of Health has decided to halt adolescent vaccine outreach and cease all COVID vaccination events onschool property, theTennessean reported on Monday. But it’s an even bigger mess than that: The new vaccine policy, which comes from Health CommissionerDr. Lisa Piercey, isn’t limited to COVID.vaccine outreach is to bestopped, including back-to-school outreach for routine vaccinationssuch as measles or HPV. And the change comes alongside news that thestate’s top vaccine official, Dr. Michelle Fiscus, has be enfire dafter passing along legal guidance to vaccine providers detailing thestate’s mature minor doctrine, which allows 14- to 17-year-olds to obtain medical care without parental consent. Slatespoke with Tennessee-based pediatrician and public health researcherStephen Patrickabout the TDH’s new policy, how he’sseen attitudes toward vaccines change in recent years, and whether independent organizations will be able to do the work of vaccine outreach themselves. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. It’s very worrisome. We know that we’re already behind the ball when it comes to vaccination for kids—vaccination for kids—after COVID-19. A lot of vaccines were delayed. … What I’m worried about too is that itsends the wrong message more broadly about the value of vaccination. I think it’s a critical time for public health, for pediatricians, to keep talking about vaccination and why we do it. Vaccination really is the cornerstone of both public health and pediatrics. Very concerned, no question about it. There’s areport[Thursday] morning that there’s been a tripling of COVID infections in thestate. We know that people who are dying from COVID are, by and large, unvaccinated. If you look collectively at the messaging and the attitudes—we are fostering when we aren’tspreading positive messages about vaccines in thestate. I worry about what that will do to our ability to combat COVID. Before COVID-19, we had relatively high vaccination rates in Tennessee. While pediatricians in the last decade haveseen more worries and more vaccine hesitancy, there hasn’t been anything quite like this before. It was really the conversations around the COVID-19 vaccine—and the conspiracy theories that permeated—that became a perfectstorm for vaccine hesitancy. That’s really worrisome and problematic, and I worry it could have generational harm. My hope is that it rapidlyshifts back. Like many things, I don’t think there’s onespecific cause. I think we’veseen an erosion of trust in public health and politicization of public health over the last 18 months. I think this is asymptom of that, and another leap in a worrisome direction for caring for the public’s health. My colleagues are really disturbed by this. … Vaccines have always been a routine part of thesummer! Kids go back forsports physicals, for band camp, and you have outreach for routine vaccination. Itshouldn’t be any different this year. Weshould follow thescience and do the things we know protect kids and our communities. There was poll of Tennessee parents—from theVanderbilt University Medical Center’s Center for Child Health Policyreleased in earlyspring—that looked at their concerns. One of those concerns was who do parents trust in Tennessee for information on vaccines and COVID-19. Consistently, the TDH was rated at the top. When you have a trusted partner for parents, it’s really important that that trusted partner has a really publicstance on the virtues of vaccination. It’s really a critical role ofstate public health agencies. My hope is that the TDH will reassess their decision. At thesame time, wesee pediatricians in thestate and the medical community more broadlyspeaking out really positively about vaccines. … We’ve done public messaging, we’ve written editorials, we’ve worked in community organizations. … But it does feel like an uphill battle, particularly in weeks like this where the narrative trendsso negative towardsomething that isso foundational. Yes, no question about it. We know that COVID-19—in terms of the disease burden and the complications of the disease—disproportionately impacts Black and Hispanic families. We also know that we’ve hadsome lower rates of vaccine uptake from those families, and a little bit more worry about the vaccine from Black parents. That makes the outreach even more important. It is worrisome overall that we’re hesitating to do vaccine outreach. One of the pieces here is that the reasons for low vaccine uptake are complicated. One of the reasons relates to trust. As medical and public health professionals, we have to do things that foster trust in the community, and I worry that the TDH actions and the public discussion of them further erodes trust. We’veseen complications from COVID-19 in children. There’s also a broader, bigger issue: We’ve gone through a pandemic that has had devastating consequences—beyond the illnesses—to adolescent mental health, to food insecurity. One of the things that’s really important to normalize kids’ lives and their access to food is getting back toschool. And getting back toschool. The path toward that is vaccinating kids. We need to protect kids before they go back toschool. I worry that we’re failing tosee what at his vaccine is, in the midst of this pandemic, and how fortunate and blessed we are to not only have it, but to have it atsuch a degree—its availability here in the United States in comparison to the rest of the world. COVID-19 hit after a period of chronic disinvestment in public health, and I hope that when we emerge from this, we begin to realize the critical role of public health in protecting allo f us. But right now? I’m worried we haven’t gotten thatmessage.",1,1,Slate

There was Sean Spicer, who got off to a mess of astart on Day One, lying about the attendance at the inauguration. (Kellyanne Conwaysaid he was using “alternative facts.”) Spicer came out of the gateso angry that he was turned into a “Saturday Night Live”skit featuring Melissa McCarthy on a podium that ran into people. Then there was Sarah Sanders, another confrontational presssecretary whostarted having fewer and fewer press briefings. Then came Stephanie Grisham, who didn’t even bother to have one official White House briefing in her eight months on the job. Then came Kayleigh McEnany, perhaps the most incompetent White House presssecretary ever. Shespent more time wagging a finger at the media than doing her job, which was to answer questions about the president’s work, policies and decisions. So when Jen Psaki held her first press conference as Joe Biden’s White House presssecretary on Wednesday, it felt like,as CNN’s Brian Stelter perfectly put it, a “return to normalcy.”Trump’s White House claimed he was making “many calls” and having “many meetings.” The Biden team is actually revealing who Biden’s calls and meetings are with. A return to normalcy…pic.twitter.com/Uqkb2x53XU— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter)January 21, 2021But let’s all be careful,writes Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan. Sullivan wrote, “The national press — battered by four years of abuse by the president, and by the incompetence and falsehoods of hisspokes people — is in a precarious position. We run the risk of beingseduced by an administration that, in many cases, closely reflects our values: multiculturalism, a belief in the principles of liberal democracy, and a kind of wonky idealism. (Cue the ‘West Wing’ theme.)”But, Sullivan writes, there could be a return to another kind of normal: that journalists, in an effort toshow toughness and objectivity, will become more confrontational. The job of the media, of course, is to hold the powerful accountable — especially the highest office in the land.“But,” Sullivan writes, “there’s a difference between truly holding power to account and grandstanding.”The press, according to Sullivan, needs to resist false equivalency. They need to call out lies. They need to use plain language,such as racism and whitesupremacy, instead of euphemisms. And they need to resist returning to the old journalistic norms. If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It's not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or makestuff up. But fewshare Trump’s disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let’s build propersupportsystems and processes to deal with high levels ofstress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I’msorry for everything you have all been through.

Blame that on whatever you want, whether it be Lin Wood telling Republicans not to vote or people just feeling disenfranchised after the prior November election, butseeing a return to more normal voting patterns is good for Republican chances in 2022. Remember, Sen. Raphael Warnock will already be up for re-election again after just two years. The gains insuburban Atlanta are alsosomething the GOP has been looking for. Again, blame it on what you want, but the GOP lost previously redsuburban areas across the country largely due to ashift among college-educated women. Are things returning to normal? If they do, 2022 is going to be more than just the GOP taking the House by aslim margin, which would already be enough to give Nancy Pelosi astroke. Conventional wisdom has placed Georgia as “lean D” following 2020, but perhaps what happened prior was the aberration? Maybe those rushing to redefine the entirestate were overreacting? It’sstarting to feel that way. I certainly wouldn’t bet on Warnock in 2022 given he only won by 93,000 votes in aspecial election that might as well have been cooked up in a lab to favor him. With the opposition party already having built-in advantages in the first midterm of a new presidency, gains like wesaw last night can lead to much bigger things.

509,More than a Meal: How Austin Ministries Are Expanding Thei......,-1.67,46.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/may/austin-camping-ban-tx-homeless-ministry-housing-church.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"East of downtown Austin, a row of more than 20 closely linked tents and makeshiftshelters areset up outside the Terrazas Branch of the Austin Public Library, around the corner from Christ Church of Austin. The church’s associate rector, Matt Dampier, visits the homeless encampment on Sundays to meet with people and offer Communion. I walked with him to the encampmentshortly after a recent election that reinstated a camping ban designed to remove growing homeless encampments throughout the Texas capital.“They’re trying to get all those homeless people out ofsight,” Amy Goldman, 44, told us. “What they need to do is lower the cost of living and allow a living wage.”Goldman, wearing a clean Philippians 4:13 T-shirt, has been homeless for nine years. She moves between this camp, whereshesharesshelter with another person, and one furthersouth whereshe keeps her own tent tucked away. Goldman’s response accurately reflects thatsomeone with a minimum-wage job ($7.25 an hour) would have to work 120 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Austin, according toEnding Community Homeless Coalition (ECHO) 2020 data. Limping along the wetsidewalk after a heavy downpour, Stephen Holmes, 54,stops tospeak with us, his bare feetsplattered with post-rain debris and his disabled left leg jutting outward.“I’m not living the American dream,” Holmessaid. He’s originally from Austin and attended Anderson High School on the northwestside of town. “I’m an Anderson Trojan,” hesaid proudly, as my heartsunk even further when I heard him name my neighborhoodschool. Holmes had been on disability and taking care of his father for 10 years before he died. He became homeless for the first time three months ago. “I want to beself-sufficient,” hesaid. “Thestate is going to need to findsome cheap housing.” Dampier asked Holmes if he could pray for him, which he did. Goldman and Holmes are amongsome 3,160 people experiencing homelessness in Austin/Travis County, with 2,238 of those living unsheltered in tents, cars, and abandoned buildings as opposed to traditionalshelters, according to 2021statistics fromECHO. Austin’sHomeless Response Systemshows a 4.5 percent increase in the unhoused from 2019 to 2021, with a 20.6 percent increase for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Historically, the role of churches has been to distribute meals, clothing, and hygiene items, as well as offer community and fellowship,said Emily Seales, a Christiansocial worker who was a case managementsupervisor at Trinity Center in downtown Austin and is now engaged in a technology and health researchstudy for Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center and the University of Texas. Growth in encampments over the past two years and recent debate over the reinstated public camping ban have led more leaders,such as Seales, to focus both on temporary assistance for their vulnerable neighbors and on advocacy to fix what theysee as brokensystems that have left people without livable wages and affordable housing in the first place. Part of that advocacy includes accelerating cooperative efforts between the city, established nonprofits, churches, faith-based organizations, and individuals.“I don’t think the city knows what to do with faith communities,”said Cathy Stone, associate pastor at First United Methodist Church in downtown Austin. “But I think it’s important that westart practicing andshowing that we can do more and that we also want to be involved in advocating and decision making.”The bipartisan advocacy group Save Austin Now campaigned thisspring to reinstate the public camping ban that Austin city leaders lifted back in 2019. The proposed ban, called Proposition B, passed in a May 1special election, with 58 percent of voters in favor and 42 percent against. The ban now makessitting, lying, or camping in public a criminal offense and prohibitssoliciting money at certain times and locations. Now, Texas is moving toward banning campingstatewide. The clearing of encampments will be delayed to allow the city time to implement a four-phase plan that includes conducting outreach and community engagement before enforcing the ban through citations and arrests. Austin’s city manager, Spencer Cronk,said at a press conference that the city is looking into a variety of housing options, including city-sanctioned encampments—with the possibility ofsome on church properties. As one of its temporarysolutions, the city has purchased three hotels to help with the transition to permanent housing. Stone’s downtown church was highly vocal against the ban, including itssenior pastor, Taylor Fuerst, who preached against it prior to early voting. Christ Church on the eastside, where Dampier has been building relationships with members of the homeless community, was more divided. In Dampier’s 800–900 person congregation, those in favor of reinstating the camping ban argued that the city failed to find housingsolutions in the two years that the ban was lifted and raised concerns about the lack of dignity and vulnerability of living on thestreets. Last year was one of the deadliest for people experiencing homelessness in Austin, with at least 256 deaths, KUTreported, based on figures from Austin’sstreet newspaperEven those against the ban did not want tosee people living permanently in encampments, Dampiersaid, but they were concerned about the lack ofspace atshelters to house them. Most of the people hespoke with preferred a more phased-out approach to empower those in encampments and incentivize cleanup. For years, Christians in Austin have offered aid and assisted in rehousing, and those efforts have continued during the pandemic. In downtown Austin, Trinity Center provides meals, bus passes, and case management, and in East Austin, Angel House, Austin Baptist Chapel’ssoup kitchen, has remained opened for breakfast. Austin’s well-known Mobile Loaves & Fishes food truck ministry hasserved millions of mealssince 1998, and its tiny house Community First! Village is planning its fourth phase of development that will add 1,400 tiny houses over the next decade to its existing 500-house, 51-acre full-service community northeast of town. First United Methodist houses a Mobile Loaves & Fishes food truck andsupplies volunteers for its downtown run. Prepandemic, the congregation also fed breakfast to 250–300 people twice a week followed by a worshipservice, and it continues to provideshowers for women. Mission Possiblesets up Church Under the Bridge, where four churchessponsor a Sunday a month to host weekly worship at encampmentsites beneath overpasses. Amy and Simon Kenyon, members of Christ Church, can walk to the bridge at Sixth Street and I-35 where they’ve been leadingservices for 50–60 people on the first Sunday of the month for eight years. They hand outsausage wraps and coffee, which issecondary to the worshipservice, theysaid. The Kenyons consider the gospel as the transformative factor for those experiencing homelessness. “It’sshocking to us how little faith Christians have in the gospel,” Amy Kenyonsaid. “It’s usually heart issues that lead people to thestreets.”Factors around homelessness abound, according tosocial worker Emily Seales, and include trauma, domestic violence, chronic health conditions, growing up in foster care, mental health diagnoses, intellectual disabilities, issues with the criminal justicesystem, andsystemic racism and housing policy, atop the lack of affordable housing. Simon Kenyon, who is ordained through the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches,said that he believes in more potential for those on thestreets and that God has a better plan for them.“I think of Ephesians 2:10,” hesaid, “to be God’s workmanship;something that he’s created beforehand for each one of us to do and to be.”The Kenyons voted to reinstate the camping ban partly to help incentivize getting off thestreets but also because they were told by those experiencing homelessness that Austinstreets have become more dangerous due to the influx of people from otherstates. Despite those perceptions, 83 percent of people who are homeless in Austinstarted that journey in Austin or Texas, according to Seales. With the passage of Prop B, “there’s literally nowhere to go,”shesaid. “People will go deeper into the woods, or there will be efforts in thesame place over and over again to help people move along.”Some Christians are trying tosimplify and accelerate the process of helping those experiencing homelessness by partnering with various agencies under one roof. Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center provides that kind of integrated model. The ministry grew out of Sunrise Community Church’s desire to offer assistance to those inseveral nearbysouth Austin encampments. The center nowserves food and offersshowers, an address for mail, mental health workers, a health clinic, and housing case managers. Oversix years, Sunrise has become its own entity with five paidstaff and more than 100 volunteers, although itstillshares a building with the church. They work together with various agencies’staff toserve 200–300 clients every day and recently helped house their 550th person,said Mark Hilbelink, lead pastor of the church and director of the navigation center. Hilbelink operates from a Calvinist theology, hesaid, that believesstrongly in God’s election of people. “We’re not constantly in fear of people’ssalvationstatus,” hesaid. For that reason, thesocial work aspect takes precedence over evangelism, hesaid. Sunrise’s current goal is to replicate its integrative model through a program called Compass Network that helps train and connect churches with thesocialservices community. Sunrise adheres to the approach that handouts need to go hand in hand with a connection to the largersocialservices community. Hilbelink has also been mentor ing Leah Hargrave, a deacon at Mosaic Church and director of Mosaic Street Ministry, to create a navigation center in north Austin. Currently Sunrise is working with three teams of four toseven churches per team that have adopted a nearby micro homeless population (about 100 people). Christians with different theologies and different politics have come together to help, Hilbelinksaid.“They would never worship together,” hesaid, “but they are on this team because mission is on the forefront and everything else is behind.”On Sundays, a church from one team, with the help of interns from a variety of Texas universities,sets up a citywide database, ID printers, and connections to referralsystems at ashopping center parking lot that is within one mile of the churches. The church hands out aid, while the interns work on thesocialservices part. One location insouth Austin has already helped house 20 people. Christians, like at Sunrise and Community First! Village, have developedsome novel ideas that focus on more-integratedservices and a communal approach, and cities all over the country are examining those models. In 2020, more than half a million people experienced homelessness in the United States, a 2.2 percent increase from 2019, according to theUS Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The lifting of national and local eviction moratoriums and the end of pandemic unemployment benefits by end ofsummer will also contribute to people losing their homes. Other municipalities—such assuburban SeattleandAurora, Colorado—have consideredsimilar camping bans. Due to aho using crisis in Austin and other cities—rents have risen 3.3 percentsince 2019 and 1.6 percent nationally—Hilbelink believes homelessness will become one of the biggest problems America will face in the next 10–15 years and will require an army to tackle. To take up the challenge,some churches will donate money,some will volunteer with an organization, others will adopt a micropopulation, andsome will build navigation centers, Hilbelinksaid. Others,such as Seales and Stone, will advocate with city andstate governments about equity andsocial justice issues, affordable housing, and living wages.“Every church is going to have to figure out what our response to this is going to be,” Hilbelinksaid.

Saint Mark’s Episcopal Church has multiple locations throughout Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino County, but it is their Upland location that adopted a modified “Ash and Dash”system for Ash Wednesday. For thissystem, the church opted to create an “ash kit” that was placed in either a passengerseat or trunk, allowing churchgoers tosafely apply the blessed ashes themselves.“Instead of imposing the ashes on people’s foreheads, we’re going tosafely deliver the kits into their trunks or their passengerside window,” Saint Mark’s Rev.

Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician whoserved as Tennessee’s medical director of vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization, was fired Monday. In the week prior to her termination,she received a package containing a dog muzzle,she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday. Tennessee vaccine official'sstory reveals an ugly truth about GOP and children's rightsFiscus has been at the center of a political battle in Tennessee over the vaccination of adolescents againstCovid-19. Beforeshe was terminated, Fiscus released a memo citing Tennesseestate law about whether minors may get medical care without their parents’ permission. Backlash to the memo fromstate lawmakers wasswift and comes amid political polarization of vaccines as experts urge Americans to get their doses and disinformation continues to drive large portions of the population away. Fiscussaid prior to her termination, a large Amazon package was delivered to herstate office addressed to her. Insideshe found a dog muzzle. There was no note and Fiscussaidshe contacted Amazon to try and determine whosent the muzzle. Amazon refused to reveal thesender, Fiscussaid. CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment.“At first, I thought that was a joke and contacted a few friends, and then, when no one claimed it, I realized that that wassomething that wassent to me assome kind of a message,” Fiscussaid. At the advice of others,shesaid reported the incident to the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which confirmed to CNN it is investigating the dog muzzle package. Fiscussaidshe told her husband, “They obviously didn’t know me because theysent me asize three which is for beagles and I’m obviously a pit bull, which requires asizesix.” Fiscussaidshe is keeping the muzzle as asouvenir. Fiscus told CNNshesent the memo at the center of the controversy because physicians who were administering Covid-19 vaccines asked her what to do when minorsshowed up to be inoculated without a parent. Politics is causing needless deaths in the fight against Covid-19In response, and in consultation with legal counsel at theTennessee Department of Health, Fiscussaidshesent a memo to the doctors citing the “mature minor doctrine,” which allows health care providers to decide if any child has the capacity to consent to vaccination themselves. The policy has been in place for 34 years, was public facing on the Tennessee Department of Health website and was blessed by the governor’s office,shesaid. But legislators quickly began contacting the health department asking questions about the memo thatsomesaid undermined parental authority. On Monday, Fiscus was fired. Tennessee’s health department told CNN by email Tuesday it could not comment on personnel matters. Fiscussaid her firing was asymptom of a trend in many public health departments across the country. In herstate,shesees a “bowing of the department of health tosomesaber-rattling ofsome of our legislators who felt that it was inappropriate toshare the mature minor doctrine that has been Tennessee Supreme Court case lawsince 1987.”Legislative leaders are nowseeking answers from Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee regarding his decision to fire thestate’s top vaccination expert in the middle of a pandemic. During a virtual meeting withstate legislative members Wednesday, Tennessee’s Senate Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Raumesh Akbarisaid the decision to fire Fiscus has put thestate in a more dangerous position.“We have all the tools we need to get out of this pandemic but the failure of leadership at the top is making this hard,” Akbarisaid. Leading up to her firing, Fiscussaid the department had halted all adolescent vaccine outreach, from Covid-19 communications to HPV reminders and acknowledgment of National Immunization Awareness Month. The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed Wednesday it is temporarily halting all adolescent vaccine outreach, even for vaccines not related to Covid-19, telling CNN the issue is “polarized.”Tennessee is halting outreach on all vaccines for adolescents, including for Covid-19“We recognize where we are around the national conversation around vaccinations and it is a polarized conversation, and that is true in ourstate. Andso we’re just taking this opportunity to evaluate our messaging and to ensure that we’re not hurting our efforts,”spokeswoman Sarah Tanksley told CNN in a phone call. Tanksleysaid Covid-19 and other childhood vaccines wouldstill be available while the department of health re-evaluates the vaccination notification process. Shesaid the goal was to ensure that vaccination reminders aresent to the parents of the adolescent. In a few cases, immunization reminders weresent directly to minors who had contact information listed in the department’s electronic health records, according to astatement given to CNN by the Tennessee Department of Health. Tanksleysaidshe is confident the department of health will continue tosuccessfully communicate with parents and providers.“This is not a monthlong evaluation period or anything like that,”shesaid. But Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the Davidson County Board of Health in Tennessee,said Wednesday he worries the halt could result in preventable outbreaks. Jahangirsaid the robust immunization program for children in the US has prevented outbreaks of diseases for decades.“The best way tosave millions of Tennesseans is to encourage vaccinations, to make them easy and not buy into any rhetoric that vaccinations are problematic,” hesaid. “I think the politicization of vaccinations can truly have a really negative impact on Tennesseans and people around the US.”CNN’s Martin Savidge, Angela Barajas, Rebekah Riess,Tina Burnside Keri Enriquez and Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report.",1,1,CNN
513,Would there have been a Donald Trump presidency without Rush Limbaugh?,-13.0,30.4,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2021/02/would-there-have-been-donald-trump-presidency-without-rush-limbaugh,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-18,16,"Rush Limbaugh, who died aged 70 from cancer on Wednesday 17 February, became one of the first in US broadcasting to helm a national call-inshow in the 1980s. It was, for Limbaugh, perfect timing: in 1987, the United States got rid of the “fairness doctrine” under which broadcasters had to present bothsides of controversial issues. Without it, Limbaugh couldspeak to oneside. And he did. Thatsame decade, hundreds of thousands of Americans were dying of AIDS. On hisshow, Limbaugh ran asegment called the “AIDS update”, in which he mocked gay men who were dying. He accompanied thesegment by playing Dionne Warwick’s “I’ll Never Love This Way Again”. In 1990, Limbaughcalledthesegment “regretful” and “irresponsible”. In the 1990s, Limbaugh truly became a national figure: his nationallysyndicatedshow aired on hundreds ofstations. When, in 1994, Republicans took back the House of Representatives, members of the partycalledLimbaugh a “majority maker”,so influential were his right-wing broadcasts. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrichsold“Rush Limbaugh for President” T-shirts at his victory party that year. Also in the 1990s, LimbaughcalledChelsea Clinton, the president’s daughter, the White House dog. He became fabulously wealthy, and part of that wealth was power; in 2009, Michael Steele,apologisedafter calling Limbaugh, ostensibly only a talk radio host, an entertainer. Limbaugh, in a way, was right to take offence. He was not only entertaining. He wasshaping a new kind of Republican politics, in which Ronald Reagan’s optimism for America was wedded to an angry denigration of anyone who found themselves on the oppositeside of Limbaugh’s culture wars. Barack Obama’s first chief ofstaff, Rahm Emanuel,referredto Limbaugh as the voice of the Republican Party. And, for all the talk of identity politics on the left, few embraced bringing identity into politics like Limbaugh. In 2004, hes aid that the National Basketball Association, many players in which are black,should be renamed to be the TBA, or Thug Basketball Association, and that basketball teamsshould be referred to as gangs. Hesaid“Caucasians” were the race thatshould not have to feel guilty aboutslavery. He pushed the racist lie that Obama was not born in the US, a piece of disinformation which Trump used to kickstart his national political career. In 2012, LimbaughcalledSandra Fluke, a lawstudent who went before Congress to argue that employersshould be required to offer health insurance that pays for contraception, a “slut” and a “prostitute”. Hecalledfeminists “femi-nazis”. In 2007, heinsinuated that veterans from the war in Iraq whospoke out against it were “phonysoldiers”. He received the presidential medal of freedom from Donald Trump, to whose defence he often jumped. HesaidDemocrats allowed the violence in Charlottesville in 2017 — when whitesupremacists chanted “Jews will not replace us” and waved confederate flags — tospiral out of control on purpose, and that the coronavirus was the common cold and was being “weaponised” to hurt Trump. But, in a way, the real medal for Limbaugh’s career was the Trump presidency itself. It was a logical conclusion of decades of people hearingsensational, bigoted, us versus them rhetoric for hours a day. Along with Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes ofFox News, Limbaugh, as much as anysingle American figure, created the politics of the Republican party wesee today. And more than the others, Limbaugh created an obvious blueprint for Trump, whospoke warmly of his friend after his passing. The insults, the bombast, the outlandishstatements followed by half-apologies, or no apologies at all: that was Limbaugh. The white, male grievance that characterisedso much of what Trumpsaid: that was Limbaugh too. It is possible, of course, that America would have arrived at this point had Limbaugh done any number of other things that did not involve talk radio. It is possible that we could have had a Trump presidency without him. It is possible that even if the fairness doctrine hadstayed in place, and Limbaugh had been required by federal regulation to present bothsides of an issue, that America wouldstill be as polarised as it is today. We will never know. What we do know is what happened: the fairness doctrine was lifted, Limbaugh became a radio personality and political kingmaker, Trump became president. In an interview after the announcement of Limbaugh’s death, Trumpsaid that Limbaugh believed he, Trump, had won the election. That is not true of course. But to Limbaugh, and to Trump, truth was besides the point. Related",1,1,New Statesman

515,Trump Pushed 11 False Claims About Voting in 8 Minutes During the Debate,-14.67,32.67,https://www.wired.com/story/trump-mail-vote-debate-lies,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,25,"In the closingsection of last night's unhinged presidential debate, moderator and Fox News anchor Chris Wallace raised a discussion about election integrity. ""What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election?"" he asked. In keeping with his priorstatements and tweets, Donald Trump made clear that he will offer no reassurance of any kind. Instead, he launched into an extended assault on mail voting filled with nearly a dozen false claims. As he has repeatedly in recent months, Trump mischaracterized, exaggerated, and lied about the risks of fraud in mail voting. And he doubled down on the idea that any delayed results caused by the extra time it takes to count mail ballots will inevitablysignal a “rigged” election—an assertion that election officials and researchersstrongly dispute, given that it can take time to process and count mail ballots accurately and fairly. That Trump didso inso bright aspotlight has election-watchers especially concerned.""At the end of the day, elections are legitimate because the public accepts them as legitimate. Putting out a lot of disinformation meant to confuse people andsow unfounded doubt undermines our democraticsystem,""says Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Brennan Center's Democracy Program at New York University School of Law. ""We’ve been conducting vote-by-mail insome form in this countrysince the Civil War. The president uses it to vote in Florida, and our military relies on it. Manystates have had extremely robustsystems for decades. Thesystem issafe andsecure.""Following are the 11 lies, exaggerations, and mis characterizations that Trump managed tosqueeze into one eight-minutestretch of the debate. If you exclude the times other people were talking, he hit well over two lies per minute:Trumpstarted out by trying to draw a distinction betweenstates where voters must request an absentee mail ballot (""solicited"") andstates where ballots are automatically mailed to all registered voters (""unsolicited""). He claims that his own absentee voting in Florida is exempt from his criticisms about fraud, because he requests the ballot. But fraud instates that historically vote only by mail—Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah—is extremely low. Aanalysisfound that it affected just 0.0025 percent of ballots in the Colorado, Oregon, and Washington 2016 and 2018 general elections. Trump additionally criticizes the handful ofstates, like Nevada and California, that aresending mail ballots to all registered voters in 2020 for the first time because of the pandemic. But there's no proof that this approach has causedsignificant problems. Later in the debate, Trump would cite examples ofsupposed mail ballot fraud instates like New York and Virginia that do not proactive lysend ballots—and are therefore conducting mail-in voting in a way that passes muster, by his definition. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThere is no evidence that mail-in ballots have been dumped in creeks, or any body of water for that matter. Trump is referring to nine military ballots that were improperly (but accidentally) discarded by a temporary employee in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in mid-September. On Thursday, the Justice Department made an initialstatement about the incident that it later took down. It is extremely unusual for the DOJ to provide details of an open investigation. Ultimately the agencysaid thatseven of the nine ballots were marked for Trump, but it did notshare any evidence of foul play and pointed instead to the role of administrative error. It's tough to know which ""area"" Trump was referring to here, but election officials recognize that asmall number of voters may attempt to vote twice in any election, either because of clerical errors, earnest confusion on the part of the voter, or, yes, malign intent. Therefore, eachstate hassystems in place to monitor for double voting and reconcile any irregularities. The examples Trump cites took weeks, not months, to resolve. And while it's almost certainly true that it will take much longer than usual to get accurate results from everystate due to increased mail-in voting, ""that doesn’t mean anything nefarious is going on,"" the Brennan Center's Nordensays. ""It just means election officials are doing exactly what they’resupposed to do.""Set aside that ""losing"" implies misplacing, and allow for the more generous interpretation that Trump means those ballots weren't counted. Nationwide, it's true that mail ballots are typically rejected at higher rates than those cast in person. If a ballot is filled out incorrectly, isn'tsigned, or is received too late, election officials will flag it (to reduce the risk of ballot manipulation or fraud!), and this can mean that certain votes aren't counted. Butsomestates have already implemented mechanisms for notifying voters if their ballots were rejected and giving them an opportunity to remedy the issue; otherstates are working to quickly addsuch protections. Around 1 percent of mail ballots weren't counted in the 2016 general election,so under any circumstances Trump's assertion of ""losing 30 and 40 percent"" is baseless. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThis is Trump's grievance in a nutshell. He claims that the election is rigged against him and that mail voting is the apparatus through which it will be manipulated. At the end of the day, this means he is accusing election officials of abdicating their mostsacred responsibility to conduct elections in a fair and nonpartisan manner. He has no proof ofsignificant fraud, but he alsoshies away from articulating the core of his allegation, perhaps because, in truth, election officials are overwhelmingly honest and dedicated. Folks, truly, this is not a thing!Again, there is no indication that ballots have wound up in bodies of water. Again, nope. See above. It tooksix weeks to certify the results of the June Democratic primary in New York's 12th congressional district, a delay that Trump has presented as evidence of fraud. It was not. A glut of mail ballots and a legal fight over thousands of disputed ballots lengthened the process. The New Yorkstate legislature hassince passed reforms aimed at giving voters more time to request absentee ballots and giving them notice if their ballot is disqualified. Meanwhile, inspite of the turmoil, neither Maloney, challenger Suraj Patel, norstate election officialssaw evidence of actual fraud in the race. As Tuesday night's voting discussion raged on, Trump invoked a prediction that can't be fact-checked right now but could be dangerouslyself-fulfilling: ""This is not going to end well. This is not going to end well.""",1,2,WIRED
516,"Unity? First, accountability: Before Joe Biden can bring America together, Donald Trump and his helpers must pay for what they’ve done",6.33,30.67,https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-unity-first-accountability-20210117-csxtyom3vjen3fttvrynx2y53a-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-daily-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-17,25,"On Wednesday, a new president will put his hand on the Bible and repeat an oath that the current president has degraded and despoiled. That new president, Joe Biden,says he wants to bring the nation together — even as his Democratic Party, andsome members of the Republican Party, are demanding Donald Trump and his enablers be held accountable for what they have just done to America. Somesay these two objectives, unity and accountability, are at odds with one another. In fact they are inseparable. Without accountability, unity will be an illusion, an invitation to further, deeper, more dangerous division. With accountability, the nation has a genuine chance to come together and move forward. For nearly two-and-a-half centuries, the leaders of our nation have fought to preserve and defend our Republic during times ofstrife. The men and women privileged enough to have earned the trust of the voters always proudly made the pilgrimage to Washington, D. C. as the peoples’ voice. Their politics differed, but there was a long line of commitment to truth, democracy and the freedoms we Americans universally hold dear. We were — and are — an imperfect nation, led by imperfect people. For all those imperfections, America has always been more than a nation; we are a people of many races and religions, gifted by providence aset of human ideals worth fighting for. Few Americans will ever have the opportunity toserve our nation in a capacity that carries as much honor, weight, authority or power that members of Congress in both chambers enjoy. It has never been an easy job and was never advertised assuch. The best of our elected representatives took on the heavy responsibility of leadership, always guided by a relentless desire to create that more perfect union. Both the process executed in and the decisions made by these bodiesset an example, not just to our fellow Americans, but to the entire world. America has a unique role in the world both as a moral compass and as an aspiration al model for a big, messy, butsuccessful democracy: We are the benchmark. Despite historicalstumbles and mistakes, we remained theshining city on the hill. It is more than a cliché. We have been a real model to those who want better across the globe. Through wars, pandemics, economic crisis,social unrest,scandals and attacks on our ownsoil, the Congress of the United States has always been asteady force, guiding ourship through turbulent waters, re-calibrating as we go, using our defining principles as outlined in our Constitution as our map. Designed by the founders to capture both the will of the people and to constrain its most passionate urges, we had a kind of unspoken, homeostatic balance. No oneside of the ideological fight dominated too deeply, or for too long. Power ebbs and flows; our core principlesshould not. One thing the Founders would have never expected was a physical attack on the members of those august bodies to be ordered by a president who had lost a free and fair election. The could never have imagined that members of the Senate wouldstand on the floor and actively promote insurrection. The last time it happened was at thestart of the Civil War, and those members were rightly expelled from the body. As hard as it is to admit, on Jan. 6, our nation, democracy and government were attacked by a group of treasonous insurrectionists at the command of thesitting president of the United States. Notsince the Civil War have weseen our fellow Americans attempt to tear apart the very fabric of our nation withsuch determination. And never in the history of our nation have our leaders unapologetically refused to hold those responsible for an attack on America accountable. Last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy attempted to block the impeachment of the president by claiming that this was a political game that would further divide the nation and that while the president may have incited the riot, now was not the time to push for impeachment. Only 10 bold members of the Republican caucus broke party lines to vote for impeachment. It was one of the most insulting, egregious, cowardly, anti-American acts in recent memory by asupposed leader in Congress. It ultimately didn’t matter, on Jan. 13, President Trump became the only president in U. S. history to be impeached twice by the U. S. House of Representatives. It was richly deserved. Never mind Trump’s belated and obviously begrudging claims that he wants peace and asmooth transition, this after weeks of fiercelystirring the bubbling cauldron. You cannotsuddenlystop a chemical reaction you have beenstoking. You cannotsuddenlyswitch off a raging fire you have fueled. And the president, who doesn’t know much but does understand the logic of inchoate rage fed by disinformation, knows this. This is a dangerous moment, a fork in the road where one path leads to the healing of a divided nation and the other leads down the road of our demise. The choice is between an America we recognize and in which we take pride, or a Third World authoritarian kleptocracy. This momentsets the trajectory of the United States going forward. It is past time for outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in that body to live up to their titles and their calling. Our democracy is no longer one generation from extinction, as President Ronald Reagan once famously claimed; we are now just a few votes away. If McConnell and Senate Republicans allow for Trump to escape culpability for his actions that led to an attack on thesacred ground where they work every day, this country may well fall. It won’t happen quickly, but theseeds will be planted. It will be clear that a demagogueslinging lies like a monkey throws poop can declare an election null and void, insist that he is the rightful leader, and get away with it. That message will be well-learned by all the wrong people. Trump’s actions will be emulated by politicians with moreskill and cunning than him, with the ability to manipulate information growing ever moresophisticated as technology andsocial media evolve. The actions of those whoseek to destroy us must be met with ashow of forcesostrong that no American ever attempts to overthrow our government again. Theseriousness of this moment cannot be overstated. Already, Republicans are taunting Democrats with the claim that a drive to impeach, remove and otherwise hold Trump accountable is at odds with Biden’s pledge to heal the nation, to end the bitter era of demonizations. This is turning history on its head, in real time. There is no path to unifying the people of this nation as long as loyalty to party and fear of a weak, deranged man take priority over ensuring thesafety and well-being of our Republic and our democratic processes. The wounds that have been inflicted can only be healed by holding those responsible publicly accountable with a punishment that reflects theseverity of the transgression. Sure,some on the fringes will only grow more furious with any move toward accountability, but the vast majority, those with a genuine interest in coming together, will understand that there is an underlying republic worth honoring, norms worth protecting, a Constitution worth defending. This is not only about Trump. By letting Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Ron Johnson and the rest of the Senate’s Sedition Caucusskate for their role in the conspiracy, the Senate Republicans are telling Americans they want impunity, not unity. Senate Republicans giving Trump a pass for his fiery incitement to violence — which came after aspate ofspurious lawsuits and repeated attempts tostrong arm Georgia officials into changing their recounted, certified vote totals — aren’t interested in reconciliation; they’re fine with Trump and his allies inciting an insurrection andstaging an attempted coup on our own government. Five American lives were lost that day, based on the words, deeds, and plans of Trump and his dead-enders; if this isn’t grounds for impeachment and conviction, what is?History will remember whostood up for America when our democracy was tested from within; they are the brave, the deserving, the leaders. But history will have a longer, and more brutal memory for the conspirators and cowards, too. Hawley, Cruz and the rest of theirseditious claqueshould be censured and expelled from the Senate. They, too,swear an oath to the Constitution. They, too, broke it. McConnell is famous for the ironclad control he exercises of his caucus. He alone will decide if he’ll let enough of his members vote to convict Trump in the Senate impeachment trial. He is a base, transactional politician. He may not care much for his legacy, but failing tostand up in this moment may make retaking the Senate majority nearly impossible in a tough 2022 cycle — and that issomething he most certainly cares about. The judgment of the voters has been rendered. Trump will go; it is inevitable. Accepting the legacy of his destructive character and politics is a choice. Holding to account the enablers, organizers,supporters and players in the insurrection — be they cop-killers in MAGA hats,senators orsoon-to-be former presidents — is existential to preserving the republic. Donald Trump has always been a political parasite,slowly hollowing out his host. It’s up to the few Republicans with honor, integrity, and asense of duty to the country to make the final votes tostop the worst political cancer in American history fromspreading, and killing this great nation.

The veteran died of aself-inflicted gunshot wound less than a week later. The episode — which took place at the Washington DC VA medical center, just a few miles away from the White House —stands in contrast to President Donald Trump’s frequentstumpspeech claims that “anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired” thanks to legislation hesigned into law in 2017. And it also calls into question the efficacy of VA officials’ recent efforts to emphasize allstaffers’ role insuicide prevention, an issue that claims the lives of about 20 veterans and military members each day, even after years of intense focus on the issue. In astatement after the report release, DC Medical Center Director Mike Heimallsaid the conduct of the doctor involved in the case “is unacceptable and does not represent the dedication and compassion our employees exhibit daily.”The doctor was not named in the report. Investigators could not determine whether the veteran heard the comment by the physician — “(the patient) can goshoot (himself), I do not care” — during a medical discharge from the hospital in early 2019. The veteran, a patient in his 60s with a history of panic attacks and op io id withdrawalseizures, had been previously assessed as a moderatesuicide risk. But when a team of physicians recommended his discharge with follow-up mental health consultation, the patient refused, prompting the physician to call campus police andshout the offensive comments. The patient died bysuicide a few days later. Investigators could notsay whether the patient ever heard the doctor’s comments, or whether they were a factor in the death. But the IG reportsays at least three other employees heard the comment and reported it tosuperiors. Despite that, the doctor continued tosee and treat VA patients for another nine months, before her contract was terminated for additional abusive language towards other employees. DC hospital officials emphasized that “this person was never a VA employee, only worked on a contract basis and is no longer welcome at the facility.”However, investigators found reports of “verbal misconduct” by the contract physician dating back to fall 2018, including incidents involving the chief of the hospital’s emergency department and facility police. The reportstates that leadership at the facility opted not to cut ties with the problematic doctor earlier because they “believed that clinical reviews of the patient’s care weresufficient, and therefore did not pursue formal administrative reviews related to (the physician’s) pattern of verbal misconduct.”Heimall acknowledged that the incident “does not represent the quality health care tens of thousands of DC-area veterans have come to expect from our facilities” but also labeled it an “isolated” event. Officials at VA headquarters referred questions on the incident and the report to DC medical centerstaff andsidestepped questions about whether the event illustrates deeper problems within the department’ssuicide prevention and accountability efforts. Critics have repeatedlysparred with the White House over the value of the 2017 Accountability Act, which Trump has insisted has helped reform the entire agency by jettisoning more than 9,000 problematic bureaucrats and medicalstaffsince its passage.“People do a bad job for our vets, and they get fired,” Trumpsaid in a July 19 online campaignspeech tosupporters. “It’s verysimple … we hadsadists in there, we had thieves in there, and you couldn’t do anything about it, whether it was for reasons of unions or civilservice.”But union leaders have argued the measure has largely allowedsupervisors to target lower-ranking employees for quicker dismissal, rather than removing toxic leaders more responsible forsystemic issues. In the DC medical center case, contract issues appeared tosupersedestaff concerns. After the physician was finally removed, facility leaders pledged to report the problematic behavior to the National Practitioner Data Bank. The inspector general report comes about a month after the White House announced its new veteranssuicide prevention roadmap, the culmination of 15 months of work designed to refocus local communities and all federal agencies on the issue. Among the initiatives emphasis is the idea thatsuicide is preventable if leaders and community members take the issueseriously and provide help to veterans. Heimallsaid his facility has implemented additionalsuicide prevention measuressince the 2019 incident, to include “weekly randomized audits of 20 percent of allsuicide-related patient emergency room” to ensure thatstaff are providing appropriate care and “a comprehensive education program regarding employee misconduct and patient abuse.”Veterans experiencing a mental health emergency can contact the Veteran Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255 andselect option 1 for a VAstaffer.

518,The Party of Violence,-10.67,31.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/the-party-of-violence/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-01,17,"Adam Smithsaid, “There is a great deal of ruin in a nation.” It was meant as comfort. A lot can be wrong andstill notsignal the apocalypse. So let’s hope that the increasing fascination with political violence we are hearing from Republicans is a passing thing, and not asign of unravelling. A Republican running for Northampton County executive in Pennsylvania gave a heated address on August 29 about mask mandates inschools. Steve Lynch is tired, hesaid, of providing hisschool board with arguments and data (he apparently thinks the datasupport letting kids go maskless), but the important thing about his rant is the threat of force:Forget into [sic] theseschool boards with frigging data. You go intoschool boards to remove ’em! That’s what you do! They don’t follow the law! You go in and you remove ’em. I’m going in there with twentystrong men, I’m going tospeak to theschool board and I’m going to give them an option. They can leave or they can be removed.“You don’t follow the law.” That’s the kind of language that Republicans are now employing. You go in with “twentystrong men.” Lynch has not run for public office before, but he did attend the January 6 rally in Washington, D. C. and has posted onsocial media that the violence that day was a false-flag operation meant to discredit Trumpsupporters. Furthersouth, Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolinaspoke last weekend at an eventsponsored by the Macon County Republican Party. He delivered the kind of lies that have become routine amongsome Republicans. The election wasstolen—and not just the presidential contest but also that won by Gov. Roy Cooper (who defeated his opponent by a quarter of a million votes). Cawthorn told the crowd that vaccines are harmful to children and urged them to “defend their children.” A woman asked what he plans to do about the “535 Americans who have been captured from January 6.” Cawthorn, who has apparently heard this before, thundered, “Political hostages!” He went on to assure the audience that “we” are working on this and mentions “busting them out.” Whensomeone in the crowd asked, “When are you gonna call us back to Washington?” he replied that “We are actively working on that one.”He wasn’t finished. Insurrection talk is becoming hisspecialty: “The things that we are wanting to fight for, it doesn’t matter if our votes don’t count. Because, you know, if our electionsystems continue to be rigged and continue to bestolen, then it’s going to lead to one place—and it’s bloodshed.”You may remember Cawthorn. He was the young man who, addressing the Stop the Steal rally on January 6, praised the crowd’s courage and contrasted it with the “cowards” in Congress. Cawthorn’s work experience beforeserving in Congress consisted of astint at Chick-fil-A and a part-time job in a congressional office. He dropped out of college after asinglesemester in which his grades were mostly Ds. But he was apparently active in that onesemester: More than 150 of his classmatessigned a letter accusing Cawthorn of being asexual predator. One woman told theWashington Postthat he drove her to a rural area only to become enraged whenshe rebuffed hissexual advances. He drove back atspeeds of up to 80 miles an hour. Naturally, Donald Trump has endorsed him for “whatever he wants to do.”In neighboring Tennessee, the Williamson Countyschool board was disrupted by anti-mask parents. As doctors and nurses testified that masks would help limit thespread of COVID-19, people cursed and threatened them: “We will find you!” “We know who you are!”In Georgia, a mobile vaccinationsite had to beshut down after anti-vax protestersshowed up to threaten and harass health care workers. “Aside from feeling threatened themselves,staff realized no one would want to come to that location for a vaccination under those circumstances,so they packed up and left,” aspokeswoman for thestate health departmenttoldtheAtlanta Journal Constitution. Asurvey of the rest of the country yields yet more examples. We are all old enough to remember a time when election workers were public-spirited citizens, usually elderly, who volunteered their time (or got very modest compensation) tosit for hours at pollingsitesscanning names from lists of voters and handing out littlestickers. That America is gone, driven out by a radicalized Republican party. A number ofstates with Republican majorities have passed laws that would impose criminal fines of up to $25,000 forsuch “offenses” as permitting a ballot drop box to be accessible before early voting hours orsending an unsolicited absentee ballot application to a voter. But that’s not the worst of it. Election workers have been hounded andthreatened. Bomb threats have been emailed to electionsites. “You and your family will be killed veryslowly,” read a text messagesent to Tricia Raffensperger after her husband, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, declined to “find” enough votes to flip thestate to Trump. As many as one in three election workers has reported feeling unsafe, and thousands are resigning. When Liz Cheney made the principled decision to vote for Trump’s impeachment,she noted that one reason more Republicans might not have chosen to join her was that “there were members who told me that they were afraid for their ownsecurity—afraid, insome instances, for their lives.”Republicans talk incessantly about other people’s violence. The rioters who burned buildings after George Floyd’s death. The criminals who make Chicago a murder capital. Immigrants whosupposedly terrorize their host nation (they don’t). Criminal violence is a problem, but the kind of violence Republicans are now flirting with orsometimes outright endorsing is political—and therefore on a completely different plane of threat. Kyle Rittenhouse, an ill-supervised teenager who decided to grab an AR-15 andshoot people at a Kenosha riot (killing two and wounding one) was lionized by the GOP. His mother got astanding ovation at a fund raiser in Waukesha. Ashli Babbitt has become a martyr. Allen West, former chair of the Texas GOP,speaks approvingly ofsecession. Former nationalsecurity advisor and Trump confidant Michael Flynnsuggeststhat we need a Myanmar-style coup. Some 28percentof Republicans respond affirmatively to the proposition that “because things have gottenso far off track” in the United States, “true American patriots may have to resort to violence” tosave the country. Maybe that’s notso bad? Not even a third. Another poll framed itdifferently: “The traditional American way of life is disappearingso fast that we may have to use force tosave it.” Fifty-six percent of Republicans agreed. They are playing with fire. Nothing less than democratic legitimacy is on the line. These menacingsignalssuggest that January 6 may have been the overture, not the finale.",1,1,The Bulwark

520,"Were the Founding Fathers Not Involved in Pledge, Anthem, ‘In God We Trust’?",0.0,48.0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/founding-fathers-pledge-anthem-in-god-we-trust/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"In thesummer of 2021, we received inquiries from Snopes readers about the accuracy of a widely-shared mem e insisting thatseveral totems of American civic and political culture,such as the national anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance, were in fact relatively recent inventions, and thus had no link to the ""Founding Fathers,"" whose actions and intentions are often regarded assacrosanct in the United States. The mem e consisted of a banner image featuring Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, along with the following text:The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1923. The Star Spangled Banner was adopted in 1929.""Under God"" was added to The Pledge in 1954.""In God We Trust"" was added to our money in 1956. So... NO. They were not created by our Founding Fathers. The followingscreenshotshows aselection of instances of the mem epos ted to Facebook in 2021, and illustrates its popularity on that platform:The broad point of the mem e is correct — the four totems mentioned were not adopted until many decades after thesigning of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the Founders did not play a part in their implementation. Assuch, we are issuing a rating of True. However, the accuracy of thespecific dates listed in the mem e was mixed. The following is an assessment of each date and milestone listed in the meme, bearing in mind that the overarching point of the mem e remains correct. The basic format of the pledge was devised by Francis Bellamy, a Christian minister, to mark the occasion of Columbus Day, in, the 400th anniversary of the Columbian expeditions. Anofficial program for that day's commemorationsset out the text of the pledge, to be recited in publicschool classrooms across the nation:""I pledge allegiance to my flag, and the republic for which itstands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""After that, twosignificant changes were made. In, the American Legion organized a National Flag Conference in Washington, D. C., at which it was decided that the words ""my flag""should be replaced with ""the flag of the United States,"" in order to avoid confusion (orsubterfuge) on the part of recently-arrived immigrants. This is the development in 1923 to which the mem e refers. That formula of words was formally adopted by Congress in1942, and thesecondsignificant change came in, when the words ""Under God"" were added (more about which below). The mem e has the right era, but the wrong year. In fact, the U. S. Congress did not formally adopt ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as the national anthem until two years later. On, the following resolution wasapproved:""Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the composition consisting of the words and music known as The Star-Spangled Banner is designated the national anthem of the United States of America.""The version of the pledge re-adopted by Congress in1945is identical to the one now in use,save for two words: ""Under God."" As the mem e correctly points out, that phrase was added on June 14,1954, as the comparison below illustrates:That phrase actually first appeared on U. S. currency, though not as far back as the era of Washington and Adams. As an entr yon the official website of the U. S. Treasury Department outlines:The motto IN GOD WE TRUST was placed on United States coins largely because of the increased religioussentiment existing during the Civil War. Secretary of the TreasurySalmon P. Chasereceived many appeals from devout persons throughout the country, urging that the United States recognize the Deity on United States coins. In April 1864, Congress passed a law that ""changed the composition of the one-cent coin and authorized the minting of the two-cent coin. The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary. IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864two-cent coin.""In the 150 yearssince then, ""In God We Trust"" has appeared intermittently on various coins. In 1956 — the year referred to in the meme— it became the official motto of the United States, and the first paper currency bearing the phrase was printed in 1957.",2,2,Snopes

One only needs to look at the completespectrum of behaviorssupported and undertaken by the left. Teaching children everything fromtransgenderismtoracism andsexism, extremesocial justice behaviors practically being required in universities by leftist professors, and even pardoning the most violent behaviors as riots destroy towns is pretty common for the left. The radicalization doesn’tstop at the left, though. Looking at the behavior ofsome of the right-leaning people that had infiltrated the Capitol building, you cansee thatsanity and calm thinking hadn’t won the day. While not quite as destructive, the actions looked a lot like the leftist Black Lives Matter riots than anything. These people didn’t just arrive at their conclusions in a vacuum, and while there are many paths to becoming a radical, the left’s ability to make people feel asense of desperation is definitely one of them. One of those ways the left does that is tosilence, censor, and belittle. It’s a tactic that might work a while but behind theseal they put on dissent, pressure builds. Atsome point, it’s going to explode. The censorship of conservatives isn’t new. It’s been going on for years and it’s no conspiracy theory. Video evidences hows just how blatant the censorship of conservatives is, and despite how the leftists in Silicon Valley deny it, it’s clear that the left wants it. Michelle Obama, for instance,called for Trump to besilenced onsocial media. Melinda Gates wants thesame, but for everyone who disagrees with the left’s politics. Sen. Josh Hawley just had hit book canceled by Simon and Schusterafter the Capitol Hill riot, mostly because he was blamed for being the cause of the riot in the first place. He wasn’t. He never advocated for the riots to happen, unlike Democrats Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, or Joe Biden himself. I could continue but you’ve likely gotten the point by now. Thesilencing of conservatives or right-leaning voices isn’t going to make the problem go away, it’s only going to increase the anger and vitriol felt by thesilenced. The radicalization won’t come because of an abundance of radicalspeech, it’ll come from a lack of expression of dissenting opinion, the vast majority of which is entirely reasonable. Resentment will drive the radicalism, not false information. There’s a difference between dissentingspeech and actually dangerousspeech, and the left has more or less lostsight of what that difference is in its quest tosensationalize andsilence. The left continues to put the kibosh on conservativespeech at its own risk, and — God forbid — a real insurrection rises up that actually takes the lives of a good number of people, the left will only have themselves to blame.",1,0,RedState

525,‘Revolutionizing a culture’: How critical race theory grew from law school thesis to K-12 trend,10.33,39.67,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jun/16/how-critical-race-theory-grew-law-school-thesis-k-/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,23,"Middleschoolstudents in Buffalo, New York, were assigned to read an essay as part of the district’s “emancipation curriculum” this year that “the United States was founded as a racistsociety.”As homework, they were to read an essaystating that “all White people play a part in perpetuatingsystemic racism.”Eleventh-graders in Seattle Public Schools will be taught critical race theory as part of a program inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. Central to the theory is the idea that U. S. laws and institutions are inherently racist and that Whitesstill oppress Blacks and other people of color more than 150 years after the end ofslavery and decades after advances of the civil rights movement. Thisschool of thought isspreading rapidly through American classrooms, work places and government offices. It grew out of a field called critical legal theory, which took root in the 1970s, according to the American Bar Association. Critical legal theory breaks with the belief that law is pure. It argues instead thatsocietal biasessuch as race and class influence law. Critical race theory’s adherents generally broaden the traditional view that racism is perpetrated by individuals. Racism, theysay, is ingrained in American democracy. In other words, although White people may think they are not racist, they are part of and benefit from a racistsystem. Pioneers of critical race theory included Derrick Bell, who taught at Harvard University. Bell, who died in 2011, is recognized as the godfather of the movement, according to a paper on critical race theory by the conservative Heritage Foundation.“As Isee it, critical race theory recognizes that revolutionizing a culture begins with the radical assessment of it,’” Bell wrote in an essay cited by Heritage. Others who helped establish the intellectual movement include law professors Kimberle Crenshaw of UCLA and Columbia University, Cheryl Harris of UCLA, Richard Delgado of the University of Alabama and Patricia Williams of Columbia University. Ms. Crenshaw “didn’t believe racism ceased to exist in 1965 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, nor that racism was a mere multi-century aberration that, once corrected through legislative action, would no longer impact the law or the people who rely upon it,” according to a 2019 profile in Vox. “Rather, as Crenshaw wrote, discrimination remains because of the ‘stubborn endurance of thestructures of White dominance.’”Until recently, the teaching ofslavery focused on the actions ofspecific people, whether it beslave owners or members of the Ku Klux Klan,said Dorinda Carter Andrews, chairwoman of Michigan State University’s department of teacher education. She credited critical race theory with helping educational thought evolve to a broader approach to racism.“What teachers are trying to do is get young people to think ofslavery not just as the actions of what White individual people do to individual Black folks, butseeslavery as part of an economicsystem at the time,”shesaid. Using that broader view, teachers are discussing how the U. S.system of government continues to disadvantage people of color.“Critical race theory doesn’t claim that White people are bad,” Ms. Andrewssaid. “It is opposed to any form of racism in which one group hassystemic power over another.”The material used in classrooms, however, often takes a decidedly negative view of White people. City Journal, a publication of the conservative Manhattan Institute,showcased the essay that Buffalo middleschoolstudents were assigned to read as a prime example of critical race theory in practice. The essay, “Definition of Systemic Racism in Sociology,” was written bysociologist Nicki Lisa Cole. Itsays “all White people play a part in perpetuatingsystemic racism.”The essay contends thatsystemic racism “is premised on the research-supported claim that the United States was founded as a racistsociety, that racism is thus embedded in allsocial institutions,structures andsocial relations within oursociety.”Ms. Cole, of the Graz Institute of Technology in Styria, Austria, wrote that racism is everywhere: “It is present in our laws, our politics, our economy; in oursocial institutions; and in how we think and act, whether consciously orsubconsciously. It’s all around us and inside of us, and for this reason, resistance to racism must also be everywhere if we are to combat it.”She cites fellowsociologist Joe Feagin: “Feagin uses historical evidence and demographicstatistics to create a theory that asserts that the United States was founded in racismsince the Constitution classified Black people as the property of White people. Feagin illustrates that the legal recognition ofslavery based on race is a cornerstone of a racistsocialsystem in which resources and rights were and are unjustly given to White people and unjustly denied to people of color.”Ms. Cole wrote, “These historical practices created asocialsystem that had racist economic inequality built into its foundation and was followed through the years in numerous ways, like the practice of ‘redlining’ that prevented [people of color] from buying homes that would allow their family wealth to grow while protecting andstewarding the family wealth of White people.”She concluded that the problem continues in the “massive difference in the average wealth of White versus Black and Latino families.”Buffalo Public Schools declined to comment for this article. Fatima Morrell, theschool district’s associatesuperintendent for culturally and linguistically responsive initiatives, hassaid the classwork is not designed to indoctrinatestudents.“We definitely have not pushed any political agendas,”she told WGRZ-TV in Buffalo. “We give them the research, and we allow them to have the discussion, and then to problematize and question anything they are learning,”shesaid. “Then we allow ourstudents to make up their own minds about positions that they will take.”Ms. Morrellsaidstudents need to be taught aboutsystemic racism. “There is implicit bias, and there issystemic racism, andso we want to problematize that,”shesaid. Critical race theory advocates insist the lessons better reflect reality in teachings about race, civics and American history. Teaching that the ills ofslavery continue to keep down people of color, theysay, givesstudents a fuller understanding of the nation’s history and the current racialstrife, rather than what they consider to be a Eurocentric, watered-down version that Americanschools have traditionally taught.“I believe, if we’re intellectually honest without ourselves, we know that this country was founded on principles associated with Whitesupremacy,”said David B. Miller, director of International Education Programs at Case Western Reserve University’sschool of appliedsocialsciences. “Unless and until we can have an honest discussion of the good, bad and ugly, the nation will continue tostruggle with this.”To many parents, however, the idea ofsystemic racism — that American laws and institutionssuch as education and health care are biased against minorities — is an oversimplistic fallacy. Opponents warn thatsteeping children in critical race theoryspreads a distorted view of America.“It’s basically a narrativescript thatsays White people are the oppressors and other people are at different levels of being oppressed,”said Asra Nomani, vice president forstrategy and investigations at Parents Defending Education, which tracks race-based instruction atschools.“It’ssosimple-minded. It’s veryshallow and verysuperficial and intellectually vacuous,”shesaid. “We definitelyshould talk about racism and discrimination, but we need to do it with a balanced lens.”The principal of an elementaryschool in San Mateo, California,sent home an “oppression matrix” to guide parents in conversations with their children about race. Society’s privileged people, the matrixsaid, are White people. Those labeled as oppressed included “Asian, Black, Latino/a, Native People.”Theschool district did not respond to The Washington Times’ inquiries about the “oppression matrix.”“Bysending messages like White people are privileged and Black people aren’t, or that thesystem favors Whites over Blacks, it causes us to go into camps based on race,” Ms. Nomanisaid. “That actually is a departure from the civil rights movement and the nation’s ideals of a color-blindsociety.”Thespread of critical race theory inschools is fueling a backlash. The Florida Department of Education last week barred the teaching of critical race theory in thestate’s publicschools. Itsaidstudentsshould not have lessons that “distort historical events.”Lawmakers in 15 otherstates have proposed bills barring the teaching of divisive ideassuch as critical race theory. Opponents also are flooding the U. S. Department of Education with complaints about a proposed grant program that would encourage K-12schools to incorporate critical race theory into their curricula. The proposal does notspecifically mention critical race theory but includes The New York Times’ “1619 Project” as an example of what the Biden administration would likeschools to use. The newspaperseries has been criticized for its historical inaccuracies and presenting American iconssuch as President Lincoln in a negative light. Christopher F. Rufo, a contributing editor of City Journal, wrote in the New York Post thatschool districts are using mandatory trainingsessions to hammer teachers with critical race theory. In onesession, Seattle publicschool teachers were told that “the United States was built off thestolen labor of kidnapped and enslaved Black people’s work,” according to Mr. Rufo’s account.“At the conclusion of the training, teachers had to explain how they will practice “anti-racist pedagogy,” address the “social-justice movements taking place” and become “anti-racist outside the classroom,” hesaid.“The main message: White teachers must recognize that they ‘are assigned considerable power and privilege in oursociety because of their ‘possession of whiteskin.’ To atone, they mustself-consciously reject their ‘whiteness’ and become dedicated ‘anti-racist educator[s].’”Seattle Public Schools declined to comment. Critical race theory, opponentssay, also isseeping into public policy. The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative advocacy law firm, last monthsued the Biden administration for prio rit izing bars and restaurants owned by women and minorities to receive coronavirus relief funds. The lawsuit accused the administration of discriminating against White business owners. The law firm alsosubmitted comments against the Biden administration’s proposed grants forschools to teach critical race theory.“CRT, is, at bottom, a Marxist experiment to remakesociety through classstruggle. It is not an educational tool and certainlyshould not be funded with our tax dollars,” the group wrote. Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

At first, Pence was greeted by cheers when he appeared onstage at the Faith and Freedom Coalition event, which was billed as charting a policy course toward a conservative majority. But as he beganspeaking, he was briefly interrupted by a woman whoshouted “traitor”several times beforeshe was escorted out. Pence ignored the outburst and continued with hisspeech. It’s unclear who the woman was or what her motivation was for heckling Pence. Asshestarted, others in the audience also appeared to yell ""no!"" repeatedly as Pencespoke over the cacophony. During the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump'ssupporters,some in the crowd were heard chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” who was in the building overseeing the counting of electoral votessolidifying Biden’s presidential victory. Trump had been urging Pence to try to overturn the results of the election, but the vice presidentsaid hed id not believe he had the authority to doso, causing a highly public rift between the two that worsened in the aftermath of the riot. Though Pence on Friday touted what hesaw as the accomplishments of the Trump presidency, he has also made clear recently that he may neversee “eye to eye” with the former president about Jan. 6. At a GOP event in early June, Pence called it a “dark day in the history of the United States Capitol.”""You know, President Trump and I havespoken many timessince we left office. And I don't know if we'll eversee eye to eye on that day,” hesaid. The former vice president delivered his usualstumpspeech Friday, outlining what hesaid are the promises he and Trump fulfilled over the last four years and attacking the job President Joe Biden has doneso far.“After 140 days, the Biden administration and Washington Democrats pushing open borders, higher taxes, runawayspending, de funding the police, abortion on demand, censoring freespeech, canceling our most cherished liberties — the time has come for every American dedicated to faith and freedom tostand up and be heard and turn back the agenda of the radical left,” hesaid. Penceslammed the Democratic Party, which he claimed was responsible forsetting “off a violent crime wave that's wreaking havoc on families all across the country,” and took aswipe at the Black Lives Matter movement.“Black lives are not endangered by police. Black lives aresaved by police,” Pencesaid. ""We don't need to de fund the police, we need to defend the police, and put the lives of law-abiding citizens.”Pence did not address the numerous deaths of Black people in police custody, including George Floyd in Minneapolis, whichsparked protests for racial justice and police reforms lastsummer in cities across the country.

They're places that have rules limiting local officials' cooperation with ICE to help arrest and detain undocumented immigrants. They're mostly left-leaning cities like San Francisco, NYC, LA, Chicago, and Boston. Over the weekend, hesaid he was considering moving migrants caught crossing into the US illegally to these cities. And defied his admin's claims that it had dropped the idea. The adminsays it's not ideal, but it's an option if Congress doesn't overhaul immigration law. To help fixsome problems at the border. There's are cord number of migrants trying to get into the US,straining resources. It's also led to aback logo f hundreds of thousands of immigration cases. The admin thinks that moving migrants to other cities could help ease the pressure at border towns. Butsome think it's just political retaliation. Trumpsays that the ""radical left alwaysseems to have an open borders, open arms policy"" and that theyshould be happy about this new potential policy. Some Democratic reps and mayors have alreadysaid they'dwelcomethe migrants. And there's the potential that this move could help migrants get approval tostay in the US. At thesame time, many have criticized the policy as a cynical way to treat peopleseeking political asylum. It's not clear he has the money for it. This could cost DHS a lot, and leave the department – which is already dealing with ast affingshake-up– liable for problems that may happen during transfers (like injuries). Also, it's not entirely clear that the move islegal. Immigration has been a top priority for President Trump, and his admin hasstruggled to deal with the influx of migrants. Now, he's hoping to usesanctuary cities as a way to call Democrats' bluff and get them to the negotiating table to talk bordersecurity. New management, please. Last week,Sudan's military overthrew President Omar al-Bashir, after months of protests and a days-longsit-in. It marked the end of the leader's brutal 30-year rule. But protesters have refused tostop until there's a civilian government. Now, amid pressure, the military reportedlysays it'll name a civilian prime minister and cabinet – but will hold off on tapping a new civilian president. It's not expected to be enough tosatisfy protesters. Meanwhile, down inMadagascar, a measles crisis is apparently getting worse. More than 1,200 people have reportedly been killed and more than 115,000 are infected. You need a high immunization rate to help prevent a measles outbreak (think: about 90-95% of people in an area). But in Madagascar, less than 60% of people are vaccinated. Now public health officials are apparentlystruggling to expand access to vaccinations quickly enough to contain what could be the country's largest outbreak, ever.: Here's where thingsstand with measles in the US. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). While talking about Islamophobia at an event last month, Omar – one of the first Muslim congresswomen –said that the Council on American-Islamic Relations ""was founded after 9/11 because they recognized thatsome people didsomething and that all of us werestarting to lose access to our civil liberties."" (Note: CAIR was founded in 1994.) Some were concerned that Omar's ""some people didsomething"" language underplayed theseverity of the attacks...including President Trump. Over the weekend, he tweeted a video criticizing Omar that included images of the attacks and the words ""we remember.""

Since the '70s, the two have coexisted in a prettysimple relationship: writers bring the talent and agents get them jobs...in exchange for a cut of the money. But over the weekend, talks between the two broke down. That's because the writers' union – the Writers Guild of America – was frustrated over how agents werestarting to work more closely withstudios without passing on the extra money. Now, the writers' union is telling 13,000 Hollywood writers to fire their agents until they can worksomething out.

Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't budged on its guidance that vaccinated people canskip mask-wearing, butsome local governments faced withsurging cases are going back to mandates,such as Los Angeles County, which recently mandated indoor mask use, including at places like bars and restaurants. Thesummersurge in COVID-19 cases is an unwelcomesurprise for health officials and experts who thought, for a brief period, that the U. S. had the coronavirus pandemic largely under control.""This is the lowseason. Itshouldn't bespreading as fast duringsummer,""saysAli Mokdad, who tracks coronavirus trends at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. Respiratory diseasessuch as the flu and COVID-19 usuallyspike in the winter, when peoplespend much of their timesequestered indoors. But now, in the blazing heat ofsummer,hospitals insome parts of the country are again gettingslammed with COVID-19 patients. Holiday gatherings over the Fourth of July — which President Biden once hoped would mark the country'sindependence from the virus— may have fueled new outbreaks. Cases, hospitalizations and deaths are ticking up after a long decline. Back in mid-May, when over a million new people were getting vaccinated each day, theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance declaring that it wassafe — for fully vaccinated people — toshed their masks in mostsettings. ""You can do things youstopped doing because of the pandemic,"" the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky,said at the time. Now, with vaccination progressstalling, a growing chorus of doctors and experts issaying the CDC let up on masking too early. They want the nation's public health agency to call for masking and mitigation measures in areas that aresuffering, tostop the virus'sspread.""We need to reduce the circulation of the virus right now,so when westart thesurge in the winter, we will be in a better position,"" Mokdadsays. The CDC's May guidance was based onsoundscience but led to poor policies,saysDr. Ali Khan, a former CDC official who's now at the University of Nebraska Medical Center's College of Public Health. The vaccines do protect people from gettingseriously ill from COVID-19,so letting vaccinated peoplestop wearing masks madesense.""Thescience wasstrong at that time,"" Khansays. The CDC intended for the announcement to encourage people to get vaccinated. It did forsome,says Khan, but it also led to the de facto lifting of mask policies for unvaccinated people — just before the more transmissible delta variantstarted to take hold. Thesummersurge, hesays, is the result: ""Those who didn't want to wear a mask and didn't want to get vaccinated are out there nowspreading disease to others who are not vaccinated.""The timing of the guidance was off,saysJessica Malaty Rivera, an infectious disease epidemiologist who has worked with theCOVID Tracking Project.""When the Biden administration and the CDC [said] if you're vaccinated, you can take your mask off, Iscreamed,""shesays. ""Because forso long, we've been talking about getting to a place where transmission is low and vaccination is high. Transmission was lower [at the time]. Vaccination was not high. So itseemed truly premature.""The tone of the messaging alsosignaled to vaccinated people that they could throw caution to the wind, Riverasays. ""It gave people, in their minds, immunity passports,""shesays. ""Itsaid to them, 'I'm vaccinated — I can go to Miami. I'm vaccinated — I can go to this party in a basement.' ""The messaging around lifting mask useshould have been more gradual, Riverasays: ""You can changesome of your behavior, but don't just have a rager as if the pandemic wasn't happening. Calibrating, instead of eliminating [all caution], was where we needed to go.""It's not too late for the CDC to change its tune now, particularly with a more transmissible virusspreading rapidly,saysDr. Carlos del Rio, an epidemiologist at Emory University: ""In my mind, it would be advisable for CDC tosay, given thespread of the delta variant in our country, we would recommend that people go back to using masks indoors,"" particularly in areas with hugespikes in cases.""It would be helpful for the CDC tosay, if your numbers get to a certain level, youshould recommend masking,"" hesays. Implementing indoor mask mandates for everyone, regardless of vaccinationstatus, is ""the right andscientific thing to do,""says IHME's Mokdad. ""That's the only way we cansend asignal to the public in the United States that we're not out of danger, [while] we encourage [more] people to go and get the vaccine.""Several health care organizations have recently called for universal masking for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, includingNational Nurses United, a large nurses union, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which recently recommended universal masking inschools. Riverasays this policy would besafer and easier to implement than theCDC's guidance, which offers different options for vaccinated and unvaccinated people.""Who is going to be monitoring who is vaccinated and who is unvaccinated? Teachers, administrators, parents?"" Rivera asks. She adds that having different rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated people ""creates all kinds of issues of equity and judgment and access.""So far, the CDCstands by itsstatement that vaccinated people do not generally need to wear masks. ""At this time, we have no intention of changing our masking guidance,"" wrote CDCspokesperson Jason McDonald, in bold text, in an email to NPR. In a White Housepress briefing on July 22, the CDC's Walensky described mask-wearing, for vaccinated people, as ""a very individual choice.""""You have exceptional levels of protection from that vaccine, and you may choose to add an extra layer of protection by putting on a mask,""shesaid, while alsosuggesting that local officials in places with large gaps in vaccination coverage and rising case rates consider ""additional measures.""The public is lulled by the fact that thesummersurge is largely hitting unvaccinated young people, who are more likely tosurvive COVID-19,says Khan. But there's a danger that thesurge in cases couldspill back into more vulnerable groups,such as older adults and immunocompromised people.""There arestill many people in those high-risk groups that have not yet gotten the vaccine, and it's not 100% effective,"" he notes. Meanwhile, cases are rising rapidly week over week. Vaccinated people arestill protected. But the more virus that's circulating in the community, the more likely it is that people — both unvaccinated and vaccinated — will get it.""What you don't want is disease tospread from younger people back into high-risk individuals, which would be a disaster,"" Khansays.",2,2,NPR

The organization has 110staff members; about 80 of them will be eligible to join the union. Sunrise Movement, founded in 2017, gained momentum thanks to a huge network of grassroots organizers — the majority of whom are unpaid. There are thousands more Sunrisesupporters that are volunteers, according to Sunrise. Volunteers will not be part of the union. When asked about whether Sunrise workers are pushing for any particular protections or benefits, Gabbi Pierce, internal communications coordinator at Sunrise,said that wasn’t a primary focus. Instead, workers unionized in order to gain tools that would let them deal with employment issues when they come up, “to protect what we have as workers in an organization that we really value,” Piercesaid. “We’re more motivated to organize to protect what we like in our jobs, and what we have in our jobs.”The announcement follows the high-profile exit of former Sunrise regional organizer Akshai Singh. In July, Singh tweeted that they we refired “in the midst of a union organizing campaign.” In response, alette rf rom other Sunrisestaffsaid that Singh was “let go due to their performance, not retaliation for union activity.”“All I want tosay to that is that Sunrise management and leadership hasn’t engaged in union busting or any anti-union tactics,” Pierce told when asked about Singh’s exit.“The organization has alienated a lot of people.”Singh’s departure in Julystruck a nerve, particularly amongformervolunteerswho decided to leave the organization after experiencing burnout. A recent episode of the popular Netflixshow Queer Eye also profiled a Sunrise movement organizer whose mother worried thatshe was devoting all of her time and energy to the group’s work.“The organization has alienated a lot of people,”says Lynn Wang, who was a hub coordinator for Sunrise in Los Angeles before deciding to leave at thestart of this year. “I think Sunrise maybe wants to put this behind them a little bit and move on.”",1,2,The Verge

It’s part of the country’s current fourth wave of infections. In May, Japan peaked at about6,200 cases daily. Thatsame month, a group of health professionalssigned a letter pleading with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to cancel the games to no avail. Still, the numbers have allegedly improvedsince then with officials reporting that cases have dropped to about2,000 per day. But a troubling new report from the questions the data’s accuracy, alleging that Japan is “massaging” its COVID-19 numbers to look more favorable ahead of the games. To address COVID-19safety, Japan is currently banning foreignspectators from attending events. As for localspectators, the Japanese newspaper reports that the government will make a final decision about crowds and potential crowd capacities by around June 20. Vaccines aren’t required for athletes ahead of their arrival, but they will be available to Olympics officials and athletes because of donations from Pfizer and BioNTech. Athletes will betesteddaily, and non athletes (coaches and officials) will be tested daily for the first three days after arrival and then “regularly” (though it’s unclear how often that really is). And unlike a non-pandemic year when visiting athletes would be able to tour the local area, visitors have been asked not to go to bars, restaurants, or use public transportation. Athletes have also been advised tosocially distance when they’re not in asportssetting — which, as noted byThe Cut, puts a huge damper on potential romping at the infamous “horny Olympic Village.” Hugs and high fivesare“discouraged” and masksare required most of the time. The quarantining has forced most visiting athletes to get real comfortable in their hotel rooms. According to the, the Australian national women’ssoftball team — which arrived in Tokyo earlier this month to train — have beenspending most of their downtime playing video games in their hotel. I’mso glad you asked. As previously noted, until just recently, COVID-19 was ravaging Japan. Even now, only about2% of the country is vaccinated, according to the BBC. That’s probably one reason locals don’tseem particularly enthusiastic about the upcoming massive events. In fact, public opinion of the games islow, with more than 80% of Japanese residentssaying they’re in favor of the Olympics being postponed again or canceled altogether, according to theL. A. Times. As of last week, thousands of volunteers have quit, perReuters. We also know that cities that host the Olympics can be negatively affected through financial burdens, excess waste, and the displacement of locals to make way forstadium infrastructure. There have been many localprotestsandad campaigns opposing the event. But both the IOC and the Japanese government appear to feel that they're in too deep — pulling out of the Olympics now could reportedly cost the country billions of dollars. Simone Biles.

535,A Daring Left and a Cowed Center,16.67,30.67,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/08/a-daring-left-and-a-cowed-center/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"The first fact ofsociopolitical life in America today is this: liberals in elite positions are frightened of the Left. A college president may direct an institution with a $900 million endowment, meet with legislators and business heads, and boast a 30-year record of academic honors, but thesight of eight African American undergrads marching toward his office withscowls on their faces alarms him like nothing else. A CEO may draw a $3 millionsalary and manage 1,300 workers, but the threat of a boycott coming from a few networked Millennials with ties to Sleeping Giant calls for immediate emergency action. They know what they’re up against. Leftists form digital mobs,shut down events, block access, cancel, and dox. Theyshow up at people’s homes, harass employers, and ruin businesses. They’re ruthless, they’re irrational, but the tantrums they throw muck up the works and clog the pipes. That’s the advantage they press—they will tear thesystem down if the people in power don’t comply. A liberal in charge of an organization is particularly vulnerable. His job is to do precisely the opposite of clogging. He must maintain the flow, keep the wheels turning, and the money coming. His highest ideal isstability. He doesn’t believe very deeply in Truth, Honor, Integrity, and Fairness, but he’s not cynical. He does favor those virtues, but he knows not to clasp them too closely. That road, he understands, leads to conflict. Conflict, however, is the Left’s primary method, not resolution. In the 1960s, when youth protests hit the campus and thestreets, liberal leaders were baffled by the frequent absence of clear and distinct priorities laid out by the protesters. Oh, there were lots ofspecifics, but the crowds’ actionsseemed to exceed the content of theirstipulations. The concessions liberals made to demonstrators didn’t appear tosatisfy them even though the concessions were exactly what the demonstrators asked for. There was an antic, anarchic character to the mass that didn’t fallsway to negotiation. Liberals in charge kept asking themselves, “What exactly do they want? What’s their agenda?” Protesters talked about “thesystem” and other hazy conditions that were too abstract and cosmic for high-level bureaucrats to address. It was very confusing for them,and that was the point: to keep officials uncertain and off-balance. If liberals never quite understood what these unpredictable characters would do next, if theysaw that the protesters didn’t give a damn about the institution for which the liberals were responsible, the intimidation worked. This is where liberals in power are now. They aim for a peaceful, prosperoussociety wherein nobody pushes thestrong beliefs—God, family, nation—toostrongly. Let’s all get along. But the crowd to their left is volatile, and itsenses a moment of opportunity. Not long ago, hard leftists were marginal figures in liberal institutions, from theNew York Timesto Yale University to the Democratic Party. Now, they run a fair portion of the operations, including human resource departments in corporate America. Liberal leaders dislike the dynamic, but they can’t face down the Left. So they choose another tactic: to fabricate dangerous terrorism forming on the Right. When we compare the facts of right-wing violence against liberal anxieties over it, we have to judge those professed anxieties either as a cynical maneuver or a pathological defense mechanism. I favor the latter. I’ve heard too many liberals express their concerns with too muchsincerity to think otherwise. The grave distress over a dangerous, anti-democratic Right looks like a way for liberals to appease or distract their leftist accusers, though liberals may not realize exactly what they’re doing. The ridiculous overreaction to a putative white nationalist threat doesn’t just foster liberal politics, for instance, turning Donald Trump into a demon that must go. It alsoserves a psychic need. By postulating a right-wing menace, liberals can work off the nervousness that leftists cause them by applying it to asubstitute object. Their tension with the far Left is displaced onto tension with an imagined far-Right, one that does indeed allow them tospeak out. College presidents can’t confront leftist protesters and punish them for violations of academic codes. Still, they can broadcast with fervor their abhorrence of the “haters” on the Right who have caused those protesters tosuffer. Whatever actually happened at the Capitol on Wednesday, liberal leaders have expressed their alarm insuchsolemn and dismayed tones one cansense a profound relief behind their words. The discord liberals have felt in their relations with the radical Left now dissipates in thesober condemnation of the Trump hordes. For a moment, liberals may unite with the Left in a reassuring unity. The rioters have given them a fresh opening to tell their overheated comrades: “See?—If not for us, these right-wing crazies wouldseize the reins and victimize you all over again.”The liberal elite has a profound interest in maintaining this right-wing danger. The window-breakers at the Capitol have done them a great favor. While left-wing riots proceeded allsummer, liberals had to keep their mouthsshut. The hard Left had taught them to watch what theysay, and it couldn’t have made the elite comfortable, not when they careso much about astatus quo that keeps them in high places. Leftists are quite right to cast thestatus quo and “thesystem” as dubious things. This is where the liberal elite is most vulnerable. All too many conservatives and establishment Republicans fail to recognize this dynamic. They don’tsee that when liberal elitessign on to “systemic racism” and other leftist concoctions that liberals are not endorsing an ideology. No,they are protecting themselves. The failure to discern liberal motives may be because establishment Republicans, too, have an investment in thestatus quo. It’s done well by them, and it’s made them just asscared of the fractious Left as liberal elites are. That was the big problem with Donald Trump. He wasn’tscared. The guilt trips, the accusations, #TheResistance . . . none of it fazed him. He didn’t worry about leftiststudents and activist groups and community organizers and digital mobs targeting him, occupying his office, running through 10 years of Facebook posts, or picketing outside his building. He could have worried about them, but he didn’t. It wasn’t in his character. That is why leftists and liberals hated himso, and why establishment Republicans wanted him gone. He wouldn’t play the game. Now that his presidency is over, it remains to beseen whether Republicans will go back to the old rules or not. It all depends on this: have enough conservative voters been awakened to thesham that if Republicanssustain it, they will be punished in 2022?",1,0,American Greatness

537,What Is A Filibuster? Here's What's Up With The Latest Congressional Fight,-10.33,37.67,https://www.elitedaily.com/p/what-is-a-filibuster-heres-whats-up-with-the-latest-congressional-fight-58925354,https://adfontesmedia.com/elite-daily-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,16,"For the first time in two decades, the Senate chamber issplit 50-50, and new Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and new Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are already butting heads. America's first congressional clash under the administration of President Joe Biden wassettled on Jan. 26, as McConnell relented on his demand that Democrats maintain the Senate filibuster rule — effectively putting an end to an early partisan gridlock. Butwhat is a filibuster, how does it work, and how would it affect Biden's agenda as president? Here's what's up with the latest congressional fight. Because of the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections, in addition to Vice President Kamala Harris' position as tie-breaker, Democrats have effectively gained control of the Senate in 2021. While a Democratic majority is ideal for Biden,seeing as how it would help him pass a COVID-19 relief package and other much-needed legislation, Republicansstill have one handy tool to obstruct the president's agenda: the Senate filibuster. According to the U. S. Senate, ""a filibuster is an attempt to block or delay Senate action on a bill or other matter"" through debate, which in practice usually means thatsome determined politicianstands up and talks for hours on end (or, more normally, just threatens to doso)to prevent moving forward. It can go on indefinitely — that is, until cloture is invoked. The Senate cloture rule limits filibusters to just 30 hours of additional debate before requiring lawmakers to move to a decisive vote. However, 60 Senate members are needed to be on board invoke it, which effectively requires bipartisansupport to getsomeone tosit down,shut up, and quit filibustering. While there aresome exceptions, that high threshold for cloture means the filibuster can often be used as a way tostonewall legislation,since anyone who opposes a bill is unlikely to vote to end debate. Ultimately, that could pose a problem for Biden's early agenda. Progressive groups have put pressure on Democratic leaders to reform or eliminate the Senate filibuster rule as early as March 2020, and progressive members of Congress have followedsuit — urging Biden to prevent Republicans from using the filibuster to obstruct legislation. When hashing out the terms of a new 2021 powersharing agreement (modeled after theThe 2001 Senate Powersharing Agreement) for a rare 50-50 congressional makeup, Schumer and McConnell reached asticking point: McConnell wanted to keep the filibuster in place. In a Jan. 23 interview with,Sen. Dick Durbin criticized McConnell's demand to retain the filibuster. ""If we gave him that, then the filibuster would be on everything, every day,"" Durbinsaid. Several other congressional Democrats agreed, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey. In a Jan. 21speech on the Senate floor, McConnell demanded the filibuster rule remain untouched. ""I cannot imagine the Democratic leader would rather hold up the power-sharing agreement thansimply reaffirm that hisside won't be breaking thisstanding rule of the Senate,"" hesaid. On Jan. 26, however, hestepped down from thestalemate when two Democrats,Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, assured him they would not do away with the rule. ""The legislative filibuster was a key part of the foundation beneath the Senate's last 50-50 power-sharing agreement in 2001,"" McConnellsaid in a Jan. 25 Senate address, voicing his approval of the compromise. ""With these assurances,I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent.""Amid this congressional clash between party leaders, a 2005 video of Bidenspeaking about the Senate filibuster rule hassince resurfaced. In it, the president (only a Delawaresenator then)states that ""the filibuster is not aboutstopping a nominee or a bill,"" but rather, ""it is about compromise and moderation.""The roles were reversed at the time: Democrats were filibustering President George W. Bush's nominees to appellate courts, and the Republican Party threatened to compromise the filibuster rule. This was avoided, however, through a bipartisan deal to invoke cloture among the Senate. The Senate filibuster rule has been in placesince the mid 1800's, and has facilitated countless compromises on legislationsince then. With a fiercely divided Senate — and nation — it's clear Biden will have to make a lot more room for compromise in the future.

Newsom’s French Laundry dinner raises question of what counts as outdoor dining,1.1,47.5,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/18/newsoms-french-laundry-dinner-raises-question-of-what-counts-as-outdoor-dining/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,17,"Gov. Gavin Newsom has been busy apologizing to a pandemic-weary public about his decision to attend a dinner party earlier this month at the exclusive French Laundry in Napa County despite his daily pleas urging Californians not to congregate. But photos thatsurfaced this week of the get-together on an enclosed patio that the governor’s office hadsaid was “outdoors” are raising another question: What exactly constitutes outdoor dining? And, definitions aside, what’ssafe?With the arrival of wet, chilly weather, Bay Area restaurants alreadystruggling tosurvivesay the guidance hasn’t been clear. And it’s more important than ever, with most counties moving back this week in thestate’s reopening road map to the most restrictive purple tier, which allows only outdoor dining. Thesoiree Newsom attended at the 3-star Michelin restaurant didn’tsit well with Dan McCranie. Earlier thissummer,state agents tried toshut downsidewalkservice at his Ladera Grill in Morgan Hill and other South Santa Clara County restaurants in one of the first weeks of outdoor dining. More than five months later, the rules arestill as opaque as the French Laundry’s Red Kuri Squash Velouté.“I think our county andstate medical executives are making the best decisions they can with their current understanding of the virus,” McCraniesaid. “Havingsaid that, I do tire of being lectured to byscience-challenged bureaucrats (and) putting up with the arrogance of our political establishment, who assume that they areso elevated instature that the rulessimply don’t apply to them.“Gov. Newsom falls into both of those line items.”When asked what constitutes outdoor dining, thestate’s public health department pointed to guidance for restaurants that mentions outdoor dining but doesn’t explicitly define it. Individual counties can also create their own, morespecific rules. Santa Clara County, for instance,says that outdoor diningspaces must either be uncovered (umbrellas excepted) or have at least half the perimeter open. That means a tented outdoor diningspace must have at least twosides open to allow for free air flow, which helps limit thespread of the deadly disease. Alameda County also outlinesspecific guidelines for outdoor restaurants — giving businessesseveral options, including ashadestructure “minimally open” on threesides to allow airflow. Contra Costa County’s rules dictate that outdoor areas covered bysunshades must be fully open on allsides. EXCLUSIVE: We've obtained photos of Governor Gavin Newsom at the Napa dinner party he's in hot water over. The photos call into question just how outdoors the dinner was. A witness who took photos tells us his group wasso loud, thesliding doors had to be closed. 10pm on@FOXLApic.twitter.com/gtOVEwa864— Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA)November 18, 2020Before the photossurfaced on Fox’s Los Angeles TVstation, the governor’s officesaid the birthday dinner for Newsom’s aide was outdoors. But the picturesshow aspace with a roof and what appear to be at least threesolid walls. The fourth wall appears to be asliding glass door that was open at least part of the time, but when the party grew too loud it was reportedly closed. It’s worth noting that while Napa County, where the French Laundry is located, is now in the purple tier, it was in a lower tier when the dinner occurred, meaningsome indoor dining was allowed. The governor’s office did not respond Wednesday morning to a request for comment. Napa County and the French Laundry also did not respond to questions about what constitutes outdoor dining.“I think it was bad judgment and terrible optics,”said John Swartzberg, professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley, pointing out that the virus isspreading more rapidly than in the past. “Eating with other people now is much more dangerous than a few months ago, and a few months ago was dangerous.”In terms of the actualscience, there really is no clear line between what’ssafe or unsafe in terms of outdoors vs. indoors.“It’s a continuum and the more airflow is restricted, the more indoors-y they behave,”said UCSF infectious disease expert George Rutherford of restaurantsetups. “Thesafest is to be in an open field andspread out … as you add walls you’re less likely to dissipate potential airborne particles into the atmosphere.”Researchers at Stanford and elsewhere have found that full-service dining is particularly risky, with the coronavirusspreading easily indoors, particularly where diners linger without masks as they eat. Even when there is clear county policy about what’s allowed or not, restaurant ownersstill have to navigate city bureaucracies.

As a result, comparisons of tax rates across countries can be misleading,since they fail to capture payments made forsimilar benefits. The most important difference centers on health care, which most Americans pay for privately, along with their employers. Using recent data from the OECD, Matt Bruenig of the liberal People’s Policy Project calculated “compulsory payment rates” across countries that include income taxes paid by employers and employees and add in the insurance premiums paid by both parties as well. Once American insurance premiums are included, the overall “tax” rate looks quite different in cross-national comparisons, with the U. S. rising near the top in compulsory payments paid by labor (see the chart below). The upshot, Bruenigsays, issimple: Americans “don’t pay as many formal taxes as [Europeans] do, but when you bring in payments we are compelled to pay and that are deductedstraight out of our paychecks just like taxes are, it really does not look that much different, at least as far as labor taxes are concerned.” And Bruenigsays this makes the case for universal care that muchstronger. “American workers already pay more than enough money to provide good health care to everyone in the country. It’s just that they pay it into a private insurancesystem that wastes large portions of it on rents and administrative redundancy.”",1,2,Fiscal Times

Protection againstsymptomatic and asymptomatic infection was 97.0% and 91.5%, respectively. Protection against hospital admission was 97.2% overall. By 14 days after thesecond dose, the protection had risenslightly further. The authors,some of whom declaredshares in Pfizer, wrote that “relying on protection against Covid-19 from asingle dose might not be prudent”. The vaccine was developed to be given as twoshots andsubstantially higher levels of antibodies have been observed after thesecond dose.“Additionally, little is known about the duration of protection of one dose and how it compares with the durability after two doses. It is possible that one dose will provide ashorter duration of protection than two doses, particularly in an environment where new Sars-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge,” they wrote. In aseparatestudy published in the BMJon Thursday, researchers from Denmark and Norway revealed their investigations into the blood clots that have been linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. They looked at 280,000 people aged 18-65 who received a first dose of the vaccine in the two countries in February and March. They found more clots in the veins than would be expected, although the events werestill rare – 11 per 100,000 vaccinations. There were 2.5 clots in the veins of the brain per 100,000 jabs. Ina linked opinion, Prof Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia,said thestudy did not change the conclusions of the UK and European medicine regulators that the benefits of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh its risks for most age groups.“Those countries that delayed their own vaccination programmes at a time of high transmission rates by declining to use available Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccinesshould know that their decision will have contributed to an increase in the number of avoidable deaths from Covid-19,” he writes.",2,1,The Guardian

We are certainly mindful of the advances that the Taliban have made in terms of taking over yet — an increased number of provincial capitals. And the other thing I’dsay is that no potential outcome has to be inevitable, including the fall of Kabul. ByChristina Goldbaum,Sharif HassanandFahim AbedKABUL, Afghanistan — Three major cities in western andsouthernAfghanistanwere confirmed on Friday to have fallen to theTaliban, as the insurgency’s race toseize control of the country accelerated. Inseizing Kandahar and Lashkar Gah in the country’ssouthern Pashtun heartland, as well as Herat, a vital cultural and economic hub, the insurgents appear to be nearing a complete military takeover. Only three major cities — including the capital,Kabul— remain under government control, and one is undersiege by theTaliban. With both Kandahar and Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, in their hands, the Taliban now effectively controlsouthern Afghanistan. Over the past week, the insurgents have toppled city after city in astunning advance that has well positioned them to attack Kabul. It has also laid bare the Afghansecurity forces’ near complete collapse less than three weeks before the United States isset to completely withdraw. Some American officials fear theAfghangovernment will implode within 30 days, and are preparing for an evacuation of the U. S. Embassy in Kabul. The insurgents now control well over half of the country’s 400-odd districts. And they hold more than a dozen provincial capitals, including another capitalsouth of Kabul,Ghazni, and one in the northwest, Qala-e-Naw. Thesieges in multiple cities have been devastating. Kandahar, Lashkar Gah and Herat had been heavily defended, with battles raging for weeks. But increasingly, the Afghansecurity forces were overrun, with manysoldiers and policemen reported to be deserting, or even changingsides insome places.

544,New York’s Anti-Gun AG Touts Success In Brooklyn “Buyback”,11.67,34.33,https://bearingarms.com/cam-e/2021/01/31/ny-ag-success-gun-buyback/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,18,"Even though there’s absolutely no evidence that compensated confiscation events reduce violent crime,suicide, or accidents involving firearms, New York Attorney General Letitia James is hosting aso-called buyback this weekend in Brooklyn’s Brownsville neighborhood. The cash and prizes offered to those handing over a gun no questions asked are prettysubstantial; gift cards worth up to $25o as well as a new iPad. Event organizerssay Brownsville was chosen for the Saturdayswap because it’s been hit hard by thespike in gun violence.“We get these guns off thestreets, these guns can’t be used in crime. They can’t be used insuicides. We can’t have the tragedies that wesee with children finding guns in their homes,”Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalezsaid. Forty-eight guns were collected Saturday. When asked if that was a disappointing total,State Attorney General Letitia Jamessaid all it takes is one.“One gun that can result in carnage, one gun that can result in the death of multiple individuals,so I’m really not focused on the number,”shesaid. Something tells me if 480 guns were turned in, James would be touting that figure. The anti-gun AG might claim that getting even one gun “off thestreets” can make a difference, but as former NYPD officer Rob O’Donnell noted on Twitter, James’ “buyback” could actually provide criminals with enough cash to go out and get another gun. So technically one could make about $600 profit per rifle ($50 gift card + $550 IPad). Thissimply highlights the nearsightedness of Government programssuch as these, asking for fraud and abuse but doing very little to reduce crime.— Rob O’Donnell (@odonnell_r)January 29, 2021Even those turning in “junk guns” that aren’t in working condition could receive enough money and goods to be able to afford a firearm in working condition, though they’d have to acquire it on the black market. That probably doesn’t matter much to James either. The most beneficial aspect of her compensated confiscation effort is public relations, not publicsafety, and the AG has received glowing praise from local media for hosting the event. From the:“Gun violence is an ongoing threat to our communities,”said State Senator Zellnor Myrie. “We need to bring multi-facetedsolutions to this problem —stronger legislation,support for community-based violence interruption groups on the front lines, and gun buyback events like this one. I’m proud tosupport this confidential buyback event in Brownsville and thank Attorney General Letitia James and herstaff, along with my other partners in government for their continued efforts to get guns off ourstreets.”“In 2020, NYC had aspike in gun violence which had a profound effect on our community in important measure to keep our children, families, and friendssafe,”said Assemblymember Latrice Walker. “Thank you to Attorney General James, who has created asafespace for Brownsville andsurrounding communities to turn in guns with no questions asked. Let’s all take advantage of this program and make ourstreetssafer.”“Getting guns off of thestreet is a multi-pronged approach,”said Council Member Alicka Ampry-Samuel. “It’s imperative that we use every tool at our disposal to keep families and residentssafe. The Southeastern part of my district has not had ashootingsince November 4. The last gun buyback in Brooklyn recovered 33 guns. These are excellentstatistics and weshould move aggressively to keep up the momentum. Attorney General James’ track-record of gun buyback events across thestate issomething to be replicated right here in Brooklyn, and I thank her for her collaboration on this important event.”That reads more like a press release than an actual newsstory. If there was any real reporting on James’so-called buyback, it would have to at least mention the fact that criminal justice expertssay there’sno real benefit to these events other than allowing politicians like the ones quoted above to claim they’re “doingsomething,” instead of doingsomething that works.",1,0,Bearing Arms

546,What is antifa and how does it relate to the season of protests?,1.67,49.33,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/9/2/21400139/answers-to-your-questions-about-antifa-anarchist-socialist-violence-protests-racism-anti-fascist,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,22,"Right-wing and left-wing protesters clashed in Portland, Oregon, as they have many times before. This time, a 600-car caravan of Trumpsupporters driving through the city attracted counterprotesters, and before the night was over, one manshot and killed another. Aself-proclaimed anti fasupporter, 48-year-old Michael Forest Reinoehol, was investigated as a person of interest after hissister identified him to police.“I am 100% ANTIFA all the way! I am willing to fight for my brothers andsisters!” he wrote in a June 16 post. “We do not want violence but we will not run from it either!” When police went to arrest him in Olympia, Washington, the confrontation ended in his death. What is antifa? It’s become a watchword in this highly volatileseason of American politics. But everyoneseems to use the word “antifa” differently, with definitions ranging from asmallset of organized groups that oppose fascism, to a larger movement of anti-Trump protesters who are willing to resort to property destruction and violence. For the average American, it can be difficult tosort out what exactly anti fa is and whether it is a threat. Putsimply, anti fa is an unstructured movement known for using counterprotests and physical force tostand against fascists and racists. The existence of the movement is incontestable, but observers debate whether it is dangerous. On Saturday night in Portland, individuals who identify as antifa, or anti-fascists, were just one type of people in thestreets, along with Black Lives Mattersupporters, and members of Patriot Prayer, a Portland-based right-wing group that is known for attracting whitesupremacists and getting into violent brawls. These groups have clashed many times before. But it’s anti fa that President Donald Trump andseveral members of Congress havesingled out by calling it a domestic terrorist organization. As protests against police brutality have raged for months, withsome turning destructive in both Portland and Kenosha, Wisconsin, this amorphous group has been accused ofstirring upstreet violence, destroying property and attacking police in cities across the country. Conservative pundits like Chris Talgo, editor and research fellow at the Heartland Institute based north of Chicago,say anti fa is a dangerous force, “hellbent on destroying people’s businesses, federal property and the like.” Some academics, however, who havestudied the movementsay anti fa is being given more attention than it is due. Mark Bray, a part-time lecturer at Rutgers University and author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” acknowledges there has been aspike in violent and destructive demonstrations in the months following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. But hesays that very few of the people engaging insuch behavior are actively part of anti fa groups.“Antifa is a useful boogeyman,”said Bray, adding that certain conservative politicians and mediasources have used anti fa as a broad term to describe anyone who carries out illegal acts involving arson, looting or graffiti. But while the number of members that belong to actual anti fa groups may besmall, Talgo fears the movement, aided bysocial media, is having an outsized impact on the protest culture across the country.“I do understand anti fa is not responsible for all of this,”said Talgo. “But anti fa is laying the groundwork for this bedlam to take place by normalizing these tactics.”Today in the United States, antifa, which isshort for anti-fascists, is known as a very loose collection of individuals and groups who aggressively oppose far-right movements, mainly focusing on whitesupremacists, neo-Nazis or other organizations with violent agendas like the Proud Boys,said Oren Segal, vice president for the center on extremism with the Anti-Defamation League. The movement is not organized. Rather, it is comprised ofsmallsquads of people in different cities, with no national leaders or unifyingstructure, Segalsaid. While the concept of anti-fascism dates back to the early 20th century when the authoritarian forms of government gained prominence in Europe, modern-day anti fa has its roots in a movement called Anti-Racist Action (ARA), which had anarchist and communist elements and emerged out of the Midwest in the 1980s, according to Alexander Reid Ross, who lives in Portland and is the author of “Against the Fascist Creep.” Anti-Racist Action grew in popularity among the left-wing anarchist punkscene, and in the mid-2000ssome people associated with ARAstarted organizing as antifa, Rosssaid. It wasn’t until 2015, however, when Trump’s presidential candidacysparked conflict between anti fa and far-right groups, that the movement attracted mainstream involvement and media attention, Rosssaid. Braysaid it is impossible to quantify how many people are part of the anti fa movement. The Torch Network, a coalition of anti-racist and anti-fascist groups including Rose City Antifa, has just nine chapters. But Bray noted that there is a difference between people who are members of anti fa groups and people who associate with the cause more generally.“People doing this work don’t divulge their identities,”said Bray, who interviewed more than 60 anti-fascists for his book. According to Ross, the Pacific Northwest, and Portland in particular, has become a focal point for antifa. Because of media attention, groups there aresome of the most well-known, despite having few members, hesaid. Rose City Antifa in Portland, which formed in 2007, is the longeststanding anti fa group in the U. S. and mainly focuses on research,said Ross. A Rose City representative declined to answer questions about membership numbers. Another Portland-based anti fa group founded in 2018, called Popular Mobilization or PopMob, has less than 20 members, according to one of its founding members, Sylvan E. She responded to a Facebook messagesent by the Deseret News to the official PopMob page and asked that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy. Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University and an expert in U. S. politics andsocial movements, estimates that at most, the number of people who identify as part of antifa, is in the low thousands. But antifa’s following online is much bigger. PopMob’ssocial media following has doubled,said Sylvan E. The group now has more than 20,000 followers on Twitter and 7,400 followers on Facebook. A website called Itsgoingdown, a platform that covers the anti fa movement, went from having 9,000 followers on Twitter when Trump was elected, to 92,000 today, according to a website administrator. In an Aug. 19statement,Facebooksaid it removed more than 980 groups, 520 pages and 160 ads from Facebook in addition to 1,400 hash tags on Instagram that were being used by organizations to encourage riots, “includingsome who may identify as antifa.”In recent weeks, anti fasupporters in Portland wearing masks, helmets andshields have reportedly used weapons like rocks, fireworks and bottles filled with chemicalsolutions against far-right protesters and instigators.“Antifa activists focus on harassing right-wing extremists both online and in real life,” the Anti Defamation Leaguereported. “The use of violent measures bysome anti fa against their adversaries can create a vicious,self-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame. This is why most established civil rights organizations criticize anti fa tactics as dangerous and counterproductive.”Rosssaid much of anti fasees nonviolence as an ineffective tactic against fascists. Braysaid property destruction is “one of the tools in their tool box,” in addition to do xx ing (disclosingsensitive information as a form of harassment) and community mobilization. When Bray was working at Dartmouth College, the president of theschool wrote a letter disavowing Bray’s research, because he did not denounce the legitimacy of violent protest tactics. Although, Braysays, violence is “not always the most effectivestrategy.”Jeff Schoep, an anti-racist advocate and the former head of the National Socialist Movement, which was once the largest neo-Nazi organization in the country,said he used to get into bloody fights with anti fa people who would come from out ofstate to protest at NSM rallies. But the fights only motivated him to further defend the white nationalist beliefs he held at the time, hesaid.“I definitely think anti fa is dangerous, and I definitely think weshould be worried about it,”said Talgo. But in terms ofstreet demonstrations, it’s hard to attribute violent acts to anti fa groups or anti fasympathizers because they usually don’tself-identify, Talgosaid. Such events also tend to attract opportunists and rogue criminals. Additionally, anti fa adherents and other protesters often dress in black block: all black clothing, including face coverings, making them hard to identify. It’s a tactic that has been part of protest culture for decades but has become more popular as a means of maintaining anonymity in light ofsmart phones and increasedsurveillance, according to Bray.“Just because they are not wearing name cards thatsay, ‘Hi! I’m an anti fa member,’ doesn’t mean they are not associated,”said Talgo. Sylvan E. does not cast judgement on those who use violence in protest, butshesaid PopMob does not encourage it either.“We try not to draw too heavy a line between good protester and bad protester ideas. I think that ultimatelyserves to work against the actual work people are doing,”said Sylvan E. “We don’t want tosee people get hurt; that is not the goal of this movement.”Sylvan E.said that PopMob does not coordinate with anyone outside of Portland. She also explained that while members maysupport anarchist and communist ideologies individually, those themes are not the focus of the group.“There’s a frustrating lack of understanding in American media about what anti-fascism is and what anti fa means,”said Sylvan E. “People think there’ssomesort of central organization pulling thestrings making decisions for different anti fa chapters around the country, and that is very much not the case.”Because anti fa is an unstructured group, it’s difficult to tell what kind of influence the movement has had on the tenor of protests in recent months,said Segal. But according to the ADL’s tracking of public demonstrationssince the pandemic, including those in response to the killing of George Floyd, there is no evidence that anti fa adherents have played any kind of organizational role, Segalsaid. They have however,showed up to participate in protests organized by others. Trump has repeatedlysaid that anti fa forces are responsible for nationwide destruction and unrest, despite reports from both the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI which haveshown no evidence of a direct link between anti fa involvement and protest violence, according to TheWashington Post. Rather “lone offenders” pose the biggest threat,said theFBI bulletin. And Trump himself may be driving online traffic to the topic, with Twitter mentions leaping from 300,000 to 3.9 million in the two days after the president tweeted he would declare it a terrorist organization, according to an analysis by media intelligence companyZignal Labs. Sylvan E.says PopMob has taken a backseat role to the Black Lives Matter movement in Portland, although PopMob wholeheartedlysupports Black Lives Matter and has used its platform to boost awareness. Sylvan E.saidshe has participated in thestandoff between protesters and federal law enforcement officers that has taken place near the Hatfield Federal Courthouse over the course of many weeks, but her group did not play an organizational role in those demonstrations either.“The protests for Floyd’s murder have been broader in terms of where they’ve taken place around the country, have involved a bigger crosssection of the population politically and demographically, and have been more popular among Americans, especially Democrats and independents,”said Kazin. “I think anti fa is a tiny, tiny part of these demonstrations.”Talgo believes it’s the mainstream media, not Trump, that has portrayed anti fa dishonestly.“The media is portraying them as the moral opposition to Donald Trump,”said Talgo. “I amstruck by how itseems that the mainstream media uses gentle language with antifa. It’s almost like they treat them with kid gloves like, ‘Oh, they are just out there trying to achievesocial justice.’”“I would definitelysay what is going on in Portland and Seattle represents the more radical elements, and if you let this keep happening, if you keep emboldening them, it couldspread like a virus,”said Talgo. Kazin maintains that the influence of anti fa is exaggerated, but opinions on both the right and on the left are affected by points of view.“The right likes to inflate it. Most people on the left wish it wasn’t around because it hurts the cause of the left,” Kazinsaid. Even if antifa’s power is overblown, the movement isstill worth talking about,said Segal.“In a time where anti fa is being used as a political talking point, where the concept of anti fa is being used to create fear and anxiety, understanding what it actually is is more important than ever before,” Segalsaid.",2,2,Deseret News

Baldwin County, home to most of thestate’s beaches, has been one of the fastest growing counties in thestate over the last few years, and the No. 1 fastestsince 2010. It’s also thestate’s largest county in terms of physicalsize, with moresquare miles than the entirestate of Rhode Island. And Baldwin County is also home to Foley, a city of around 21,000 people and the fastest growing city in Alabama between 2019 and 2020, according to recently released population estimates from the U. S. Census Bureau.[Can’tsee the list?Click here.]Foley added more than 1,000 people in that one year, a growth rate of 5.1% - the fastest rate among Alabama cities with at least 10,000 people in 2020. And over the last decade, Foley’s growth is even more impressive. Between 2010 and 2020, it added nearly 7,000 people, or a growth rate of around 47%. Three other cities in Baldwin County made the top 10 - Fairhope (No. 3), Gulf Shores (No. 7) and Daphne (No. 8). Alabama’ssecond fastest growing city - Athens -shouldn’t be asurprise, either. It’s part of Limestone County, another fast-growing county and part of the Huntsville metro area. Athens grew by 4.5% between 2019 and 2020, helpingLimestone County become Alabama’s fastest growing county over the last two years. The fourth fastest growing city in Alabama isn’t actually a city at all. Pike Road is a town in Montgomery County, and nowhere else in thestate can compete with its growth over the last decade. In 2010, it was home to just 5,400 people. Since then, its population has nearly doubled, nowstanding at 10,500, for a growth rate of more than 95%. A pair of cities in the Birmingham metro area made the top 10 - Calera (No. 5) and Chelsea (No. 6). Auburn, home to its namesake university, is the engine fueling fast-growing Lee County. It’s the largest city to make the top 10 for growth rate, with an estimated population of 68,000 people in 2020. Auburn added around 1,900 people between 2019 and 2020, which was also the highest total population gain among the top 10. It ranked ninth in growth rate at 2.9%. Cullman city, in Cullman County, rounded out the top 10 with a growth rate of 2.6% between 2019 and 2020. Some of these numbers couldsoon change. The population figures discussed here are estimates,specifically part of a program used to gauge the accuracy of the Census Bureau’s ability to make good educated guesses about population totals. To do that, these estimates will be compared to the 2020 Census - the once-a-decade head count of each person living in the United States.2020 Census numbers will be released later this year, andsome major corrections are expected in Alabama. Earlier this year the Census releasedstate population totals - the first official batch of numbers from the count. In that count,Alabama had about 100,000 more people than expected, and it’s not clear where those extra people might be. A previous version of thisstory had incorrect figures for percent change from 2019 to 2020. The numbers have been updated. Do you have an idea for a datastory about Alabama?

Thursday's new-case report marks the first day thestate has reported more than 2,000 new casessince Aug. 1. The U. S. on Wednesday tallied more than 100,000 new cases in asingle day for the first time. Identified COVID-19 cases in Arizona rose by 2,135 on Thursday to 252,768, and known deaths were at 6,087, according to the daily report from the Arizona Department of Health Services. New cases have eclipsed 1,000 for nine of the past 12 days. The pastseveral weeks haveseen relatively higher daily case reports as the virusspreads at its fastest rate in Arizonasince June, although case numbers arestill well below where they were during thesummer peak. But new case rates in Arizona fall below the rates reported in 33 otherstates, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'sCOVID Data Trackersays. Cases aresurging in North Dakota, where the new case rate per 100,000 people for the previousseven days was 157.8 as of Wednesday, the CDC reports. By comparison, Arizona's rate was 19.3. The increase in new COVID-19 cases in thesummer was an early indicator of more hospitalizations and deaths in the weeks to come. Gov. Doug Ducey last weeksaidArizonans ""need to keep our guard up""but announced no new preventive measures, instead pointing to existingstrategiessuch as restaurant capacity limits. The number of patients hospitalizedstatewide for known orsuspected COVID-19 cases rose to 1,100 on Wednesday, up from 1,065 on Tuesday and 956 on Monday. Wednesday's inpatient total is the highest number reportedsince Aug. 18. At the peak of Arizona'ssurge in July, the number of hospitalized patientssuspected or confirmed to have the virus exceeded 3,000. The number of patients withsuspected or known COVID-19 in intensive care units across Arizona was at 254 on Wednesday, up from 241 ICU beds in use on Tuesday and 227 on Monday. Wednesdaysaw the highest number of ICU beds in usesince Aug. 30. The level is far below what it was in July, when ICU beds in use for COVID-19 reached 970. The number of Arizonans with confirmed andsuspected COVID-19 on ventilators was at 128 on Wednesday, the most ventilators in use in asingle daysince Sept. 4. In mid-July, as many as 687 patients across thestate with confirmed orsuspected COVID-19 were on ventilators. Thursday's dashboardshows 86% of inpatient beds and 86% of ICU beds in use, which includes people being treated for COVID-19 and other patients. COVID-19 patients were using 13% of all inpatient beds and 15% of ICU beds. Overall, 30% of ventilators were in use. Percent positivity, which refers to the percent of COVID-19 diagnostic tests that are positive, has gone upslightly, which many health experts consider an early indicator of aspike in illnesses. Of known test results from last week, the percent positivity was 7%, up from 6% the week prior, according to thestate, which has a unique way of calculating percent positivity. Percent positivity was at 4% forseveral weeks during August, September and October, according tostate data. Johns Hopkins Universitycalculates Arizona'sseven-day moving average of percent positives at 11.7% as of Thursday. Itshows thestate's percent positivity had reached a relative plateau and is now trending upward. A positivity rate of 5% is considered a good benchmark that thespread of the disease is under control. Reported cases in Arizona: 252,768. Cases increased by 2,135, or 0.85%, from Wednesday's 250,633 identified casessince the outbreak began. Cases by county: 162,958 in Maricopa, 29,456 in Pima, 14,219 in Yuma, 12,510 in Pinal, 6,665 in Navajo, 5,606 in Coconino, 4,596 in Mohave, 4,066 in Apache, 3,134 in Yavapai, 3,085 in Santa Cruz, 2,307 in Cochise, 2,081 in Gila, 1,343 in Graham, 635 in La Paz and 106 in Greenlee, according tostate numbers. The rate of cases per 100,000 people is highest in Yuma County, followed by Navajo, Santa Cruz and Apache counties. The rate in Yuma County is 6,183 cases per 100,000 people. By comparison, the U. S. average rate is 2,828 cases per 100,000 people,according to the CDC. The Navajo Nation reported 12,080 cases and 586 confirmed deaths as of Wednesday. The Navajo Nation includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The Arizona Department of Correctionssaid 2,649 inmates had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Wednesday, including 999 in Tucson; 41,196 inmatesstatewide have been tested. A total of 799 prisonstaff members haveself-reported testing positive, thestate corrections departmentsaid. Nineteen incarcerated people in Arizona have been confirmed to have died of COVID-19, with nine additional deaths under investigation. While race/ethnicity is unknown for 30% of all COVID-19 casesstatewide, 30% of cases are Hispanic or Latino, 26% are white, 6% are Native American, 3% are Black and 1% are Asian/Pacific Islander. Laboratories have completed 1,826,629 diagnostic tests for COVID-19, 10.1% of which have come back positive. That number now includes both PCR and antigen testing. The percentage of positive tests had increasedsince mid-May but began decreasing in July and heldsteady around 4% forseveral weeks, per thestate. Last week it was at 7%, up from 6% the week prior. Thestate numbersleave out data from labs that do not report electronically. ADHS has begun including probable cases as anyone with a positive antigen test, another type of test to determine current infection. Antigen tests (not related to antibody tests) are a newer type of COVID-19 diagnostic test that use a nasalswab or another fluidsample to test for current infection. Results are typically produced within 15 minutes. A positive antigen test result is considered very accurate, but there's an increased chance of false-negative results, the Mayo Clinicsays. Depending on thesituation, Mayo Clinic officialssay a doctor may recommend a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to confirm a negative antigen test result. Arizona as of Wednesday had the 15th highest overall rate of infection in the country. Ahead of Arizona in cases per 100,000 peoplesince the pandemic began are North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Nebraska, Idaho, Arkansas, Florida, Utah and South Carolina,according to the CDC. Arizona's infection rate is 3,483 cases per 100,000 people, the CDCsaid. The national average is 2,828 cases per 100,000 people, though the rates instates hard-hit early on in the pandemic may be an under count because of a lack of available testing in March and April. Deaths by county: 3,672 in Maricopa, 650 in Pima, 361 in Yuma, 252 in Navajo, 237 in Mohave, 230 in Pinal, 179 in Apache, 149 in Coconino, 92 in Yavapai, 76 in Cochise, 73 in Gila, 65 in Santa Cruz, 31 in Graham, 18 in La Paz and fewer than three in Greenlee.

551,"For Midwest farmers, floodwaters threaten millions in crop and livestock losses",-0.25,54.5,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/for-midwest-farmers-floodwaters-threaten-millions-in-crop-and-livestock-losses,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Farmer Jeff Jorgenson looks out over 750 acres of croplandsubmerged beneath theswollen Missouri River, and he knows he probably won’t plant this year. But that’s not his biggest worry. He and other farmers have worked until midnight for days to move grain, equipment and fuel barrels away from the flood waters fed by heavy rain andsnowmelt. The rising water that has damaged hundreds of homes and been blamed for three deaths has also taken a heavy toll on agriculture, inundating thousands of acres, threateningstockpiled grain and killing livestock. In Fremont County alone, Jorgenson estimates that more than a million bushels of corn and nearly half a million bushels ofsoybeans have been lost after water overwhelmed grain bins before they could be emptied of last year’s crop. His calculation using local grain prices puts the financial loss at more than $7 million in grain alone. That’s for about 28 farmers in his immediate area, hesaid. Once it’s deposited in bins, grain is not insured,so it’s just lost money. This year farmers havestored much more grain than normal because of a large crop last year and fewer markets in which tosellsoybeans because of a trade dispute with China.“The economy in agriculture is not very good right now. It will endsome of these folks farming, family legacies, family farms,” hesaid. “There will be farmers that will be dealing withso much of a negative they won’t be able to tolerate it.”Jorgenson, 43, who has farmedsince 1998, reached out to friends Saturday, and they helped him move his grain out of bins to an elevator. Had they not acted, he would have lost $135,000. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has declared a disaster in 41 of Iowa’s 99 counties,saidshe planned to press Vice President Mike Pence for a federal disaster declaration during hisstops in Omaha to tour flooded areas along the Missouri River.“It will be helpful for him tosee it. I’ve reached out, and we’ve told him it’s catastrophic,”shesaid. Pencesaid the Trump administration would expedite presidential disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa. Hesaid hespoke to the governors of bothstatesshortly after arriving to assure them federal aid willsoon be on the way. The flooding is expected to continue throughout the week inseveralstates as high water flows down the Missouri River. Swollen rivers have already breached more than a dozen levees in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. The flooding, whichstarted after a massive late-winterstorm last week, has also putsome hog farms insouthwest Iowa underwater. The dead animals inside must be disposed of, Reynoldssaid. The water roseso quickly that farmers in many areas had no time to get animals out,said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.“Places that haven’tseen animal loss haveseen a lot of animalstress. That means they’re not gaining weight and won’t be marketed in as timely a manner, which results in additional cost,” hesaid. In all, Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson estimated $400 million of crop losses from fields left unplanted or planted late and up to $500 million in livestock losses. In a news release issued Tuesday, Gov. Pete Rickettssaid there have been deadlier disasters in Nebraska but never one as widespread. Hesaid 65 of thestate’s 93 counties are under emergency declarations. In neighboring Missouri, water was justshy of getting into Ryonee McCann’s home along a recreational lake in Holt County, where about 40,000 acres (16,188 hectares) and hundreds of homes have been flooded. Shesaid her homesits on an 8-foot (2.5-meter) foundation.“We have no control over it,” the 38-year-oldsaid. “We just have to wait for the water to recede. It’s upsetting because everything you have worked for is there.”The Missouri River was forecast to crest Thursday morning at 11.6 feet above floodstage in St. Joseph, Missouri, the third highest crest on record. More than 100 roads are closed in thestate, including a growingsection of Interstate 29. Leaders of thesmall northwestern Missouri town of Craig ordered an evacuation. The Holt County Sheriff’s Departmentsaid residents who choose tostay must go to City Hall to provide their name and address in case they need to be rescued. In nearby Atchison County, Missouri, flood waters knocked out a largersection of an already busted levee overnight, making the village of Watson unreachable,said Mark Manchester, the county’s deputy director of emergency management/911. Officials believe everyone got out before thousands of more acres were flooded. Butso many roads are now closed thatsome residents must travel more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) out of their way to get to their jobs at the Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska, hesaid.“It’s a lot harder for people to get around,” Manchestersaid. River flooding has alsosurrounded a northern Illinois neighborhood with water, prompting residents to escape in boats. People living in the Illinois village of Roscoesay children have walked through flood waters or kay aked to catchschool buses. Flooding along rivers in western Michigan has damaged dozens of homes and businesses.",2,2,PBS

In a recent column in theLA Times, Jean Guerrero used a personalstory involving her family tospotlight theshared distrust that is prevalent withinsome immigrant groups. Guerrero wrote how her father, an immigrant from Mexico, had been inundated with misinformation about COVID-19 fromsocial media, and was believing it. Hesent her a link to a now-removed YouTube video from a chiropractor who claimed the virus and the media coverage was designed to take away the rights of citizens. In one passage, her emotions overseeing her father being overtaken by the lies and conspiracy theories being circulated were plain tosee.“When I called Papi to urge him to wear a mask, his mind was made up: Hesaid I was brainwashed. He didn’t believe my mother, who is a doctor, about COVID risks, either. I was frightened for hissafety and angry at the people preying on Latinos’learneddistrust of authorities.”Anyone with relatives who have been trapped in the online rabbit holes that paint COVID assome warped conspiracy theory can certainly relate. And misinformation isn’t just restricted to minority populations. But history has plenty of examples that help illustrate wheresuspicion and distrust of authorities developed in communities of color. The Times’ column mentionssterilization efforts of a third of Puerto Rican women between the 1930s and 1970s, as well as thousands of latinos in California. The distrust is virtually ingrained in the DNA ofsome of those groups. Time may pass, but those painful memories endure. News & Guts haveseen the impact of misinformation in Miami’s Cuban community. The exiles who came to South Florida to escape Castro’s regime have a distrust of government based on experience. They are often easy marks for rampant false reports that arespread on platforms like Facebook. In areassuch as Homestead,some Hispanic churches have reportedly labeled the COVID vaccines as “the marks of the devil” and evidence of government control. The Miami Herald’s recent report indicated that these churches and the anti-vaccine messaging has had a negative impact on the South Florida latino community’s trust in the vaccination process. The latino population already is well behind others in vaccination rate, despite the fact that community has been particularly hard-hit by the virus. According to this report, Hispanics and latinos are nearly twice as likely to get COVID-19 as their white counterparts, four times as likely to get hospitalized by it, and nearly three times as likely as whites to die from COVID. This is why latino activists have been pushing for greater educational and awareness programs aimed at fighting the misinformation in those communities theysay is beingspread on Facebook, YouTube, even through family group chats on WhatsApp.#COVID19has hit Latinos disproportionately hard, making vaccinations a crucial public health mission. But there’s wide mistrust & disinformation among Latinos on the vaccine. It’s incumbent on health officials & docs to educate with culturalsensitivity.’sa hasht ag campaign called #VacunateYathat fights the misinformation about the virus and the vaccines with facts.

In a newstatement that he released in connection to Easter, he reiterated his false idea that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election. For this claim to be true, then — considering the fact that the entire presidential transition process has longsince played out — thousands and thousands of people would have to be in on the imaginary fantasy landscheme that Trump claims cost him his victory. Besides the fact that Trumpsounds utterly unhinged, the fact that the GOP won’t distance itself from his delusion is dangerous. Trump commented as follows:‘Why is it that every time the 2020 ELECTION FRAUD is discussed, the Fake News Media consistentlystates thatsuch charges are baseless, unfounded, unwarranted, etc.? Sadly, there was massive fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election, and many very angry people understand that. With each passing day, and unfortunately for the Radical Left CRAZIES, more and more facts are coming out. Other than that, Happy Easter?’Check out Trump’s preposterousstatement below:News accounts all day focused on the attack at the Capitol that left a police officer dead. Many of those news accounts mentioned the Jan 6 riot of Trumpsupporters after hespent months claiming the election wasstolen. Here is his takeaway 👇🏻— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT)April 3, 2021No court anywhere in the country ever even partially accepted the idea thatsystematic fraud plagued the 2020 presidential election, and authorities at virtually every meaningful level of government have longsince confirmed in various ways that no meaningful evidence ofsystematic election fraud has emerged. The depth of Trump’s delusionseems difficult to overstate. Can he even explain the basics of how this imaginary fraudscheme took place? Who was in charge? Where are the records of anysecret planning meetings? Where are the thousands and thousands of people whose cooperation would have been required for a nationwide election-riggingscheme?Meanwhile, no matter Republican complaints about the imaginary villain of “cancel culture,” Trump also called for a boycott of Major League Baseball following their decision to move the planned All-Star Game out of Georgia in protest ofsuppressive new voting restrictions thatstate Republican leaders recently enacted.

Most Tucson-areaschool districts have opted to push pause on hybrid in-person learning, returning to remote instruction as COVID-19 continues its rapidspread in Pima County. The decision eliminates the limited face-to-face contact manystudents had become accustomed to in the fall. Referrals to mental health agencies that treat children and teens are up,sometimes prolonging the time it takes to receiveservices. Teachersstruggle to balance academics and prepare kids forstandardized testing in thespring whilestill prio rit izing their emotional needs. Someschool counselors,stretched thin even before COVID, are being asked to cancel meetings and classes withstudents tosubstitute forstaff who are outsick or in quarantine. The death of an eighth-gradestudent bysuicide in Novembershocked the Vail School District.“This is the kid that would pop into his old teacher’s classroom during passing period and justsay hello and get a big hug,”says Vailspokeswoman Darcy Mentone. “This was a kid that the principal knewsuper well and adored. You know those kids — the happy, friendly kids. This was one of those kids.”Vail Unified had twostudents die fromsuicide this year. The other was a highschoolstudent who died in September. Pima County hasseen a 67% increase insuicides this year among children ages 12 to 17, according to the Pima County Health Department. And across thestate, 43 children had died bysuicide by mid-November, compared to 38 for all of 2019, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. The eighth-grader in Vail, who had been astudent in the districtsince kindergarten, had just begun attending in-person classes two days a week after doing remote learningsinceschools closed in March. His new teachers had onlyseen him a couple times. And because of COVID-19 precautions, he wasn’t able tosee his old teachers, who knew him well. His teachers are all asking themselves: What if they hadseen him? Would they haveseen thatsomething was wrong?“We’ve done a lot ofspeculation on that,” Mentonesays. “Whensomething like that happens, you look at everything that you’re doing and then question everything you’re doing and ask yourself if there’s anything I could have done differently.”In a classroom, it’s easy to read a kid’s body language or physical appearance tosee ifsomething is wrong; On Zoom that’s much more difficult,says Tucson Education Association President Margaret Chaney. And it’s not just the lack of traditionalschooling and correspondingsocialsupports that’s affecting children’s well-being. The pandemic also has causedserious issuessuch as parents being laid off, pending evictions and homelessness, and relatives gettingsick with coronavirus and even dying. Publicschool classrooms in Arizona also have one of the higheststudent-teacher ratios in the country, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. And thestate’s counselor-to-student ratio is the worst in the nation. School counselors have multiple responsibilities, including helpingstudents with academics and now, insome cases, monitoringstudents using on-site learningspaces for vulnerable kids.“There areso many issues, and counselors in particular, their caseloads range between 250 to 500 or 800 kids a piece,” Chaneysaid. “How do you address all of their needs at any one time? It justseems impossible to me. This country has the means to address it; this countrysimply hasn’t addressed it.”At the beginning of theschool year, Chaney pushed for the Tucson Unified governing board to put the academic curriculum aside for the first five weeksso teachers couldspend time checking onstudents’ emotionalstability, looping in counselors andsocial workers as needed. Chaneysays one of the reasons that didn’t happen is because preparingstudents for the upcoming AzMERIT and otherstatestandardized tests has made prio rit izingsocial-emotional wellbeing over academics difficult. AzMERIT testscores have broad impacts, including the A-F School Accountability System, bothstate and federal funding and teachers’ performance-based compensation. In an informal teachersurvey recently conducted by the Star, many of the 84 teachers who respondedsaidstate testingshould be canceledso teachers can focus onstudents’ emotional health.“We’restuck with this crash-course trajectory ofstate testing and grades andso forth and no way to mitigate all of the other issues that areso clear to the average person that really need to be addressed … whether or not you eat, whether or not you’resleeping. Do you have a place to live? Are you about to be evicted?” Chaneysaid. In a normal year, when Andrea Rickard, a fourth-grade teacher at Myers Ganoung Elementary, prepares herstudents for thestandardized tests,she encourages them to meet or exceed the district average. But this year,she’s not even bringing up AzMERIT. With kids learning from home, “nostandardized test isstandardized,” Rickardsays. There are great disparities instudents’situations while learning from home, from kids who have no parentalsupport and are caring for youngersiblings to those who have two parents both available to help.“We’re living through a time that is historically unsettling and dangerous, and to carry on business-as-usual with testing, it feels ludicrous to me,” Rickardsays. She hopesstandardized tests will be canceled, but regardless,she has already prioritized herstudents’ emotional well-being. She has kids go into breakout rooms on Zoomso they can just hang out together. She also lets them interact with each other by typing in the chat whileshe’s teaching — the remote equivalent of passing notes in class.“Some of these kids neversee anybody, andso I just feel like they need tosocialize and interact with one another,”shesays. Reading a book can be a great way to mark the end of the workday and help you unwind. Renee Quihuis, a third-grade teacher in the Sunnyside School District, is worried about herstudents falling behind academically butsays, “If we only focus on curriculum, then we’ve already lost them.” Herstudents are behind where they would be in a normal year, but making time for them to have fun has improved morale.“Connections are more important than the curriculum right now with everything that’s going on,”shesaid. “Thestandardized tests might not look very pretty, but at least they’re learningsomething. If Istopped the games, if Istopped that time when they get to talk to each other, I think they would be checked out completely.”Access toschool counselors varies byschool and by district. Since COVID-19, counselors are even more overloaded withstudents in need. And in TUSD,some are being called away from those duties, being asked to monitor vulnerable kids using in-person learningspaces whenstaff are outsick or have to quarantine,. When Nicole Walsh, an elementaryschool counselor in TUSD, was toldshe had to leave her regular duties to fill in for a monitor,she refused. Filling in would have meant canceling counseling lessons and individualsessions withstudents.“I just feel ethically I can’t do that,”shesaid. “If Istart being inconsistent and notshowing up, they’re not going toshow up either.”COVID-19 has doubled Walsh’s job. With a caseload of about 500 kids,she often works from 8 a.m. untilshe crashes at midnight. She works weekends, andshe expects to hear from families andstudents over the winter break. Walsh does weekly 30-minute classes onsocial-emotionalskills for every grade level, as well as groups, individualsessions withstudents, and a lot of communication with teachers and parents. Shesaw depression reallyset in withsome of her third- through fifth-gradestudents in the last month,since the district announcedschools wouldstay closed indefinitely as COVID-19spikes in the broader community.“They’re not this resilient bunch of kids that this is going to have no impact on them,”shesaid. “It’s gonna have a big impact onseveral kids and aso-so impact on others. … This is like your parents getting divorced, if not worse. You’ve basically been divorced from your friends for a year.”Walsh has referred manystudents to mental-health agencies, butsaid due to increased need, there is a longer wait forservices. La Frontera, one of the region’s major providers of mental healthservices, hasseen an exponential increase in the need for therapyservices, and the requests for in-person therapy issky high,says Adrienne Trees, director of children’s integrated care and therapyservices. Treessays the agency is hiring more mental health professionals to accommodate the influx. Mental healthservice provider Intermountain Centers hasseen a 25% increase in referrals of children and teenssince COVID-19,saysspokesman Paul O’Rourke. Ann Conway, a TUSD highschool counselor with a caseload of about 450students, isseeing a huge increase insymptoms of depression and anxiety in thestudentsshe works with.“We’ve also heard a lot from parents that they’re trying to get their kid into a counseling therapy, but there’s nobody accepting new patients or the waiting lists of different places areseveral months out.”Conway is trying to help kids and parents access limited community resources while also giving them tips and techniques to manage their emotional and academic needs. If kids aresuicidal or in immediate crisis,she refers them to the Crisis Response Center or Palo Verde Behavioral Health’s Intensive Outpatient Program. Conway estimatesshe’s making double or triple the amount of these referrals as before COVID-19. School districts are doing what they can to reinforce mental healthservices forstudents and make them more robust. Apart from the regular counselingservices, Sunnyside is giving classes onsocial-emotionalskills and providingstudents with copingstrategies. The district is also in the third year of a three-year grant facilitatingsupport groups, where all the highschoolstudents were invited, and those who were interested could join. The district also offeredsuicide prevention training to all highschool freshman and reached about 275students. In TUSD, apart from the work the counselors are doing withstudents and referrals to community resources,schools offer a food pantry, clothing bank, hygiene pantry, onlinesupport groups, and online classes/workshops for parents,saysspokeswoman Leslie Lenhart. Marana Unified has a certifiedschool counselor at every campus and a crisis response team. In response to COVID-19, the districtsent a “family needs assessment” to all families at the beginning of the pandemic. It asked about children’s mental,social and emotional health, as well as any other needs the family had. The district followed up with those who needed assistance. Through a pilot program in Vailschools, Empire Highstudents answered a questionnaire, developed in conjunction with university researchers, meant to gauge emotional well-being and availablesupportsystems. From the data collected on thatsurvey, Empirestaff did threesuicide interventions,says Vailspokeswoman Mentone. Whileschools are essentially closed,staff will also be calling and checking in onstudents. Vail is also referringstudents to counselingservices with faith leaders and giving families a list of local places where they can easily access mental healthservices. If you or a loved one needs help, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) — help is available in English or Spanish.

558,The Illinois Legislature Just Voted to End Cash Bail. Here's How Organizers Made It Happen.,-18.0,45.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/money-bond-pretrial-fairness-freedom-incarceration-jail-illinois,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-01-13,25,"Illinois is poised to eliminate the use of cash bail in thestate’s carceralsystem following the passage of the Pretrial Fairness Act by thestate legislature on January13. Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker,who hassaid he favors ending cash bail, is expected tosign the bill into law. The policy of conditional pretrial detention — holding accused people in jail until their trial, unless they can afford to pay bail — is currently practiced in all50states, although New Jersey did drastically reduce the use of cash bail. It’s a practice that necessarily penalizes poor people and disproportionately affects Black and Brown people, already overrepresented in U. S. jails and prisons. The Pretrial Fairness Act was included in a criminal justice reform bill put forward by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus. It is the culmination of a longstanding organizing drive by the Coalition to End Money Bond, the Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice, and other community organizations. According to astatement from the Coalition to End Money Bond,​“Among other things, this bill will overhaul thestate’s pretrial justicesystem and end the use of money bond in its entirety. It also makes many people ineligible for pretrial incarceration.”This legislation is poised to have a huge impact: According to the Coalition for Money Bond, each year, more than a quarter of a million people are incarcerated in Illinois county jails — and9out of10are incarcerated while they’restill awaiting trial (that is, locked up before they’ve been convicted of anything). If the bill issigned into law, it will be the first in the country to entirely end the use of money bond.spoke with Malik Alim, campaign coordinator of the Coalition to End Money Bond, about the likely passage of the Illinois law and its implications for the broader movement to end the use of cash bail. Pending Governor Pritzker’ssignature, we will become the firststate to completely end the use of cash bond, which means that no one would be held in jail because they can’t afford to pay a certain amount of money. That means that thestandard for detainingsomeone is going to be higher. But that also means that judges will have more discretion in determining if a person will be held or not, much more discretion than just what amount of money they post to get out. Cash bailsystems create a coercive process for the pretrialsystem. When people are held in jail because they can’t afford to pay the money bond, they’re more likely to take a plea deal andsay that they didsomething that they may not have doneso that they can get back home to their children and go back to work. So if you danglesomeone’s freedom over their head based on what they will cop to, obviously you’re going to have a lot more cases plea out. And what wesaw from the Illinois State’s Attorneys Association was exactly that: The State’s Attorneys Association wants to protect their conviction rate, because in popular culture, the role of a prosecutor is to enforce the law and order. Andso they want to have a high conviction rate and a high clearance rate. And plea deals are a big way that they accomplish that. So when we take away that coercion, people are able to make more clear-headed decisions about how they want to proceed in their case. Absolutely. And I give a lot of credit to the Legislative Black Caucus. I appeared with them in a press conference in September, where they unveiled their four-tiered approach tostemmingsystemic injustice. Theystoodstrong. We were really proud tosee that theystood behind the language in the bill, and that they trusted the advocates and the directly impacted community that developed this bill. I don’t think there’s another campaign in anotherstate that is moving along like this one. But I willsay, I think that this winsays a lot about the larger political landscape, in terms of progressive politics and makingsure that Joe Biden is held accountable to the left progressive movement. This kind ofsweeping, comprehensive reform came at the first opportunity that Illinois could pass itsince thissummer. I think that this is asignal to the progressive left and to the moderate left that Biden’s kind of moderate agenda on most issues that the left cares about is not going to besufficient. We push him along from the grassroots. What we’ve heard from ourseasoned legislative colleagues who have been in Springfield doing these types of negotiations for years is that they’ve neverseen the type of energy, will, dedication and power in a campaign like theysee in this. That needs to be replicated in other places, and the Coalition to End Money Bond has done an amazing job at capturing eachstep of the process that we’ve gone through — and our campaign is clearly replicable. We are open to anyone who wants toshare best practices. Because it’s not optional — otherstates must followsuit, now. I wouldsay the tactic of multiple tactics. The fact that westarted by challenging the judiciary through a lawsuit that we filed that was challenging the constitutionality of the money bailsystem. In that realm, we opened up the possibility for the creation of the Supreme Court Commission on Pretrial Practices, which ultimately recommended major legislative changes. We also were organizing at the county level. We got General Order18.8A, which limited cash bail, passed in Cook County in2017by pressuring the chief judge. So, the legislature, the judiciary and bully pulpit,so tospeak — the voice of the people and the power of the people — are the three approaches that we took. We’re focused on implementation now. A lot ofsmaller county governments around thestate raise the issue of how they will operate without the money that they count on from cash bail, and from the fees and fines that get taken whensomeone doesn’tsee their case through. Obviously, weshould have better governance, and peopleshouldn’t be basing their budgets on the backs of poor Black and Brown people. But it is an issue that we have to deal with, because they have been doing it. We need to makesure that those counties are being consulted with and are being given direction on how to make that money up. We’re also focusing on the issue of accountability for judges, because there are plenty ofstatutes and processes and procedures that are on the books right now that judges do not follow. So it’s on us to advocate as the directly impacted community, to makesure that these judges are actually following the newstatute — that they makesure that a person is in fact a clear threat to a person or persons, and that they’re not creating a nebulous wider net, in direct conflict with the law that we just passed. So we’re looking at implementation, and we think that the two year phase-in period is necessary. We don’t want to cause more incarceration. And we want to makesure everyone is ready to implement this. I think when folksstart getting into the weeds and the nitty gritty of the language in our bill, our bill’s language is very progressive. It really does restoresomesemblance of the presumption of innocence and of the prosecution’s mandate to actuallyshow that a personshould be locked away in a cage. Thatshould be a very highstandard of evidence, and that’s what we are making it. Andso when otherstates begin to draft their own legislation and look at what’s on their ownstatutes and things like that, we wouldstrongly urge them to to look at the intentionality behind the language that we use, and to try to model it after ours, in order to makesure that we do not increase pretrial incarceration in other in other parts of the country. And with our language, that will not happen. I hope you found this article important.

But, over the weekend, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke apologized for for writings he made as a teenager describing fantasies about running over children with a vehicle. Here’s more:“I’m mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed, but I have to take ownership of my words,” the Democratic presidential candidatesaid during a taping of the “Political Party Live” pod cast in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “Whatever my intention was as a teenager doesn’t matter, I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the language I have used, and I have to constantly try to do better.”His comments come after a report Friday revealed O’Rourkewrote prose when he was a teenager describing ascenario in which he would accelerate a car into a group of children while hearing themscream. The report alsoshowed he was asecret member of a hacking group called the “Cult of the Dead Cow,” which focused onshowing people how to hack Microsoft computers.“It’s not anything I’m proud of today, and I mean, that’s — that’s the long andshort of it,” hesaid. “All I can do is my best, which is what I’m trying to do. I can’t control anything I’ve done in the past.

They were happy, happy to be free from their troubles…. This happiness was mine by right. I had earned it in my dreams,” O’Rourke wrote.“As I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood, and then thesharp cry of pain from one of the two. I wasso fascinated for a moment, that when after I hadstopped my vehicle, I justsat in a daze,sweet visions filling my head,” O’Rourke continued. The news is perhaps notsurprising given that O’Rourkesupports abortions up to birth. That’s a position he defended yesterday, as video ed during a campaignstop. O’Rourke was captured on camera at a campaign event in Clevelandresponding to a question about third-trimester abortions and whether or not hesupports abortions up to birth.“Thatshould be a decision that the woman makes. I trust her,” O’Rourkesays. Not only does O’Rourke have a 100-percent pro-abortion voting record like the other Democrat presidential candidates, he alsosponsored a radical pro-abortion bill that would have legalized abortions for basically any reason up to birth. Theso-called “Women’s Health Protection Act” was introduced in Congress in 2017, with dozens of Democratsponsors, including likely presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders. Nicknamed the “Abortion Without Limits Until Birth Act”by pro-life groups, the bill would have invalidated nearly allstate and federal abortion regulations, including waiting periods, informed consent requirements, bans on late-term abortions andsex-selection abortions and more. The congressman has also failed tospeak out againstNancy Pelosi and House Democrats blocking a request by Republicans to vote on asimilar bill to require medical care and treatment for babies whosurvive abortions. That puts him on recordsupporting their decision to allow infanticide to continue unprosecuted. Here is his lengthy recordsupporting abortion,courtesy of Texas Right to Life.",0,0,Life News
561,"Welcome to the Claremont Institute, where pro-Trumpers are waging a war on corporate America over 'wokeness'",0.0,42.0,https://www.businessinsider.com/conservatives-capitalists-divorce-trump-woke-capital-going-to-get-ugly-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-19,17,"On May 18, a pro-Trump think tank called the Claremont Institute hosted a conference at a Ritz Carlton not far from the Pentagon. It featured talks by asmall but influential faction of American conservatives including former Trump national-security advisor Michael Anton, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author and US Senate hopeful J. D. Vance. The event was billed as a response to a growing threat facing the American right, the latest and most urgent battle in the culture wars. It was titledsimply ""What to Do About Woke Capital.""Forseveral years now, the conservative movement has been fretting about its fraying alliance with corporate America, which has increasinglysided with progressive causes. In 2015 and 2016, boycotts by American Airlines, Eli Lilly, and Intelhelpedblock anti-LGBT ""religious-freedom laws"" in Indiana, Arkansas, and Arizona. In 2017, pressure from PayPal, Deutsche Bank, and the NBAledNorth Carolina to repeal its anti-trans bathroom bill. In 2019, Disney, Netflix, and Warner Media moved business out of Georgia after thestate enactedsevere limits on abortion access. Lastsummer, dozens of major brandssignaledsupport for Black Lives Matter. And in April, corporations from Coca-Cola to Major League Baseball denounced Georgia over its attempt to restrict voting and to hand control of thestate's elections to pro-Trump forces. There is, of course, asimple explanation for these decisions: Corporations areseeking to align their public image with the values of their customers,shareholders, and employees. The positions considered ""woke"" by conservative ideologues — that policeshould kill fewer Black people, that abortionshould be legal, that gay and trans peopleshould not besubject to discrimination, that votingshould be easier for everyone — are increasingly consideredsensible by a majority of Americans.""Corporationsawakened — to their duties,""said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management who has convened aseries of high-profile Zoom calls with top CEOs tostrategize political interventions. ""And it's a good thing. Using the term 'woke' disparagingly is odd to me. It's hard to understand how the opposite — being asleep on the job — is preferable.""But for conservatives theshift in corporate loyalties represents a deep betrayal. For the past half century, big business has been a reliable ally and major funder of the right. Corporations didn'tstay out of politics — they activelysided with conservative Christians to promote an ""awakening"" in American politics, defending traditional notions of family, church, and neighborhood against the threat of communism, civil rights, and labor unions. To ensure thesurvival of ""our American way of life and our enterprisesystem,"" beer magnate and conservative me ga donor Joseph Coorssaid in 1975, ""the whole business community is going to have to get involved in political activities.""Now, the conservative political class is reacting toso-called woke capital with the anguish of a loverscorned. Sen. Tom Cotton has denounced giant corporations using their ""wealth and power to force liberal dogma on an unwilling people."" Sen. Josh Hawley bemoans an ""alliance of leftists and woke capitalists"" hoping to ""regulate the innermost thoughts of every American, fromschool age to retirement."" And Sen. Ted Cruz ostentatiouslyswore off corporate PAC money in a Wall Street Journalmissiveentitled ""Your Woke Money Is No Good Here.""At the Woke Capital conference in May, the Claremontset went even further. The organization, which has astrong relationship with the Christian right, has positioned itself as the vanguard of a conservative realignment —shifting from market fundamentalism and toward a more militant right-wing nationalism. To Claremont thinkers, who have long worked to provide the intellectualscaffolding for Trump's haphazard agenda, the enemy is not only the left, but the inherent decadence of America's corporate elites.""In just three generations,""said Arthur Milikh, executive director of Claremont's new Center for the American Way of Life, ""America's most powerful corporations went from being more or less patriotic"" to being ""globalist"" enablers of a ""woke oligarchicstate.""As Milikhsees it, the right gave American corporations everything they wanted — tax breaks, free trade, open immigration — naively believing that capitalists would defend conservative values. But instead, helamented, ""much of the conservative establishment came to view the pinnacle of human life as private consumption and personal license, defining national health by GDP growth."" The result has been not only ""spiritual enervation"" and ""the weakening of patrioticsentiment"" but ""the creation of a new oligarchic elite openly hostile to the nation.""This new theme of the Trumpist right — that American corporations are, in essence, no longer American — represents a profound fissure in the conservative movement. The campaign against woke capital is driving a wedge betweensocial conservatives and big business, fracturing the long-standing coalition that helped drive American politics to the right. As Tucker Carlsonsummed it up in the title of his keynote address at a 2019 conference on conservative nationalism, ""Big Business Doesn't Care About Your Family."" What distinguishes these new populists from the old guard of mainstream conservatism is their explicit aspiration to replace the current elite with a new one — astrategy intended to extend the MAGA right's vision of minority rule long into the future. From the outside, the long, enduring marriage of Christian traditionalism and capitalist free enterprise looked remarkablystable and mutually beneficial. From inside the conservative movement, though, it was always more a marriage of convenience than of philosophical affinity. On oneside of the alliance were traditionalists — communitarian Christians, agrarian nostalgics, neo-confederates — whosought a theologically informed moral order. They were ambivalent about capitalism, which views liberal individualism as the building block of political andsocial life. On the otherside of the alliance were libertarians and free-market evangelists, whosaw thestate as the primary threat to human freedom. What brought the twosides together, and gave birth to the modern conservative movement, was Communism. During the Cold War, William F. Buckley's National Review broker ed an uneasy peace between these competing tendencies. American liberals, the Reviewset reasoned, would never besufficiently committed to Christian virtue or to free enterprise to resist the onslaught of Communism. The answer was ""fusionism,"" a political coalition of Christians and capitalists whoseshared goal — defending Western civilization from its enemies within and without — wassufficient tosolidify an alliance. But for those at the Claremont conference, whosee themselves as the inheritors of the traditionalist position, fusionism turned out to be aFaustian bargain. Wealthy elites got their way, basking in unrivaled wealth and personal liberty, while traditionalists got theshort end of thestick: a disenchanted, amoralsociety where abortion is legal, conspicuous consumption has replacedspiritual fulfillment, and individualself-expression trumps virtue.""Everyone on the right has basically been fed this Adam Smith fairy tale about economic and political history, in which all the good thingsshould go together,"" Julius Krein, the editor of the right-wing journal American Affairs, told me. ""That's fusionism: free markets plus moral virtue. It's all a nice, big, happy combination."" Seeing big business ""at least rhetorically"" embrace progressive causes has been, Krein added, ""a huge threat to that whole fairy tale. Even if it doesn't provoke resistance perse, it provokes a lot of consternation and panic because you have your origin myth directly threatened.""In asense, the right's hand-wringing over corporate progressivism is justsour grapes — the whining of a political movement hoisted by its own petard. After all, it was the conservative majority on the Supreme Court that maximized the power of corporate leaders to impose their values on the public. First, in Citizens United they allowed corporate money to dominate the electoral process. Then in Hobby Lobby they empowered private companies to engage in religious activism, observing that nothing in the law requires ""for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else""But in a perverse twist, conservatives can't quite bring themselves to blame big business itself for the outbreak of wokeness. They've preached forso long that God favors capital, they have to find another explanation for whysome of the world's richest and most powerful corporations are abandoning them. So those at the Claremont conference blamed not the owners, but the managers they believe have usurped control of American capitalism. This critique of managerial ism draws on the theories of James Burnham, a founding editor of the National Review, who has enjoyed a renaissance in right-wing circles in recent years. His 1941 book ""Managerial Revolution"" argued that the corporate economy had becomeso complex that owners were forced to enlist technocratic managers to run their companies. Over time, Burnham thought, this new managerial elite would assume control of capital, reduce the owning class to mereshareholders, and proceed to ""exploit the rest ofsociety.""For those at the Claremont event, Burnham's concept of a middlestrata between capital and laborserves as a way to exonerate wealthy owners, placing the blame for woke capital on a younger, inferior generation of mid-level bureaucrats. ""What we'veseen over the pastseveral decades is the creation of this new bureaucratic and administrative layer within the corporate world, which is far less talented and far less productive,"" Daniel McCarthy, editor of right-wing journal Modern Age, told attendees. ""Woke young people coming to corporate America end upspecializing in a kind of moral extortion over the people who are actually more talented and experienced than they are.""For conservatives, the term ""woke"" — which originated among Black activists and artists back in Burnham's day — remains closely associated with ""identity politics."" In his opening remarks at the conference, Milikh defined the term as ""the doctrine thatso-called oppressors, identified by the color of theirskin, must be humiliated, punished, and made to perpetually apologize for thesins of their fathers."" Such fantasies of racial vengeance, unmoored from the actual goals of today'ssocial movements, pervaded nearly everyspeech at the Claremont event. What the woke want,said Azerrad, who teaches at Hillsdale College, a conservative Christianschool, ""is to redistribute power and honor to their preferred victim groups — you know the list — and to punish the oppressors:straight white men."" In a revealing aside, Azerrad recommended ""a very amusing but also quite insightful"" Twitter account called @WokeCapital, which documents examples of ""corporate woke propaganda."" The account is also explicitly racist, referring to the NBA as ""Apehoop League, "" and captioning a picture of a mixed-race military couple with the words ""Swirler Occupied Government.""Presenters were particularly incensed by corporate brands thatsignaledsupport for the George Floyd protests last June. ""No moment illustrated what woke capital meant for our country than the riots lastsummer tied to the Black Lives Matter movement,"" J. D. Vance declared in his keynote address. Wearing a beard and evidently workshopping a bellicosestumpspeech for his Senate campaign, Vance accused Amazon's Jeff Bezos of deliberately funding riots to undermine his competitors. ""Who benefits most whensmall business on Main Street are destroyed?"" he asked. Bezos, Vancesaid, is ""getting rich from destroying America.""The racist undercurrents of the Claremont conference are not incidental — they're central to the emerging conservative realignment. Burnham, who was repeatedly cited at the event, believed that ""Western civilization, thus Western man, is both different from andsuperior in quality to other civilizations and non-civilizations.""The way to protect Western culture, Burnham argued, is not a democratic assault on the decadent oligarchy. Rather, the liberal managerial elite must be replaced with a new conservative elite, one that appreciates the threat posed by immigration and racial egalitarianism. Samuel Francis, a leading disciple of Burnham and a prescient theorist of Trumpism, argued in 1992 that ""Middle American radicals"" must ""displace the incumbent elite, dismantle its apparatus of power, and itself constitute a new elite and re-constitute Americansociety."" Only by doingso, he argued, could Middle America ""preserve itself from destruction and extend its present moment in the politicalsun into an enduring epoch of civilization.""Francis, not coincidentally, was a virulent racist, hailed by whitesupremacists as the ""premier philosopher of white racial consciousness of our time."" In 2000, after the Chamber of Commercesupported calls to take down the Confederate flag at the South Carolina capitol, Francis argued that big business was no friend of the right. ""Capitalism, an economicsystem driven only, according to its own theory, by the accumulation of profit, is at least as much an enemy of tradition as the NAACP or communism,"" hesaid. At base, today's right populist war onso-called woke capital is a battle for power — by displaced elites — toshape the national consensus and define its most cherishedsymbols. Nowhere is this clearer than in American Moment, another pro-Trump outgrowth of the Claremont Institute. Founded by a trio of 20-something conservatives — Saurabh Sharma, Nick Solheim, Jake Mercier — the organization describes itself as ""dedicated to identifying, educating, and credential ing young Americans who will implement public policy thatsupportsstrong families, asovereign nation, and prosperity for all.""Translation: The group plans to recruit a new generation pro-Trump conservatives to replace the existing political and economic elite with … well, themselves. ""If we don't form our own elite,"" the founders write, ""one that is patriotic and acts as a champion for the great middle of our nation, the old regime will continue to win, and America will continue to lose.""Trump failed, Sharma told me, in nosmall part because there weren't enough ""true believers"" across the federal bureaucracy to implement his nationalist agenda. Sharma wants to change that. ""We built up American Moment to create a pipeline ofstaff, essentially, that will go into congressional offices, future presidential administrations, public-policy organizations,"" hesaid. ""People that think like this, that are willing to devoteserious parts of their lives to doing thissort of work.""Where previous generations of conservatives dreamed of dismantling the entire administrativestate, Sharmaseesseizing and deploying political power as a necessity for making America great again. ""People on the right are broadlyshut out of culture,"" hesaid. ""And more and moresoshut out of capital. So if we're quickly approaching an America where the only thing the right can do is occasionally win elections, we better use whatever tools we have at hand to rebalance power in the other domains, and defend the interests of our voters."" To do otherwise, hesuggested in the coded language long employed by far-right elites, would be to engage in ""civilizational malfeasance.""As for woke corporations, Sharma envisions a future Trump administration,staffed by ideologues ""credentialized"" by American Moment, that is willing to use a variety of carrots andsticks — from tax hikes to antitrust enforcement — to discipline corporate leaders who engage in virtuesignaling. ""I think there's a lot of interestingstuff to be done there,"" Sharmasaid. ""But it would require the complete takeover of the bureaucracies that implement thissort of policy.""As an example, Sharma pointed to the decision last year by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos toop en a ""formal investigation"" into Princeton University, after theschoolsaid that ""racism and the damage it does to people of color nevertheless persist at Princeton."" Sharma imagines using anti discrimination laws to ""call the bluff"" of businesses that admit to histories of racism. ""Let's use the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a hammer to bash every corporation that decides to virtuesignal about thisstuff, andsee if they really mean it,"" hesaid. Sharma's vision of a far-right administration using the levers of government to punish corporate elites hasn't exactly taken over Washington yet. But throughout history, many a conservative revolution has begun with tiny groups of disgruntled ideologues gathered in hotel conference rooms. Just as the eggheads of Buckley's era helped lay the groundwork for the Reagan revolution, today's Claremont brain trust is working toset thestage for a regime that is far more nativist and nationalistic. Their plan, likeso many Republican efforts these days, has little concern for democracy assuch. They understand that if right-wing populism is to credibly embody the will of the people, a lot of people must be written out of thesocial contract.""Re-establishing America's ancient principles"" would require ""asort of counter-revolution,"" Glenn Ellmers, asenior fellow at Claremont,said in a recentessay. Seizing power, he goes on to explain, is ""the only road forward."" It's fine for conservatives to ignore or evensabotage the outcome of elections, he implies, becauseTrump voters are ""authentic Americans.""And what of the majority who elected Joe Biden? What will become of them in the new, anti-woke America governed by a conservative elite?""It is not obvious what weshould call these citizen-aliens, these non-American Americans,"" Ellmers concludes. ""But they aresomething else.""RelatedstoriesMore from Politics",1,1,Insider
562,Why Cryptocurrency Is A Giant Fraud <U+2767> Current Affairs,-5.33,34.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/04/why-cryptocurrency-is-a-giant-fraud,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"A company called Coinbase has gone public, and Wall Streetseems excited. Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange—it allows you to buy,store, and trade cryptocurrencies, which are invented kinds of alternative moneys. The most well-known of these are Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are4,000different kinds of these invented new forms of money. (If you’d like tostart your own currency,you can.)Coinbase’s debut on thestock market has been called “the crypto event of the year,” “the coming-out party for crypto,” and it went well.reportsthat “the groundswell of investor interest is hugely validating for both the crypto economy and the companies that have cropped up tosupport it.”Voxsaysthat “youshould probablystart paying attention to bitcoin” because thesuccess of Coinbaseshows that it has gone “from nerdy curiosity to mainstream investing opportunity and payment method.” “Once mocked as a tool for criminals and recklessspeculators,” reports theNew York Times, cryptocurrency “issliding into the mainstream.”If it’s mainstream now and weshould pay attention to it, it’s a good idea if we try to understand what it is and what its economic implications are. You may have ignored Bitcoin because the evangelists for it aresome of the most insufferable people on the planet—and you may also have kicked yourself because if you had listened to the first guy you met who told you about Bitcoin way back, you’d be a millionaire today. But now it’s time to understand: is this, as its proponentssay,the future of money?Many discussions of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency—I am going to use “Bitcoin” and “cryptocurrency” interchangeably for convenience, even though Bitcoin is just aspecific cryptocurrency—begin with a long explanation of theblockchaintechnology that makes it possible. I think for the purposes of talking about what Bitcoin means and does, this is a mistake and a distraction—like having a discussion about thesocial effects of air travel by talking about how ailerons work. What matters for the purposes of our discussion is that it’s a made-up alternatesystem of money that, because it’s built on block chain technology, can be transferred from one person to another without having to go through a bank or a payment processor. Because you don’t have to use a bank, and can easily transfer bit coin from person to person, it is also “private,” in thesense that you don’t have to give anyone your credit card information or even your name to transfer funds. This makes it particularly attractive to criminals, because it’ssort of like the digital equivalent of cash: easy to hide, tough to trace. And because it’s not tied to a national government, Bitcoin can be used around the world without having to convert currency. There are many whosee this as revolutionary and important. “The popularity of this form of currency is expected to grow exponentially, as it is decentralized,safe, and anonymous,” readsone analysis. “The fact that a hugesection of technology-savvy individuals and companies are favoring the decision of using different form of encrypted currencies clearly indicates that the future of Bitcoin or crypto currencies as a whole is going to be bright.” Across the internet, you can find b log posts and explainers that tout the benefits and possibilities of this new form of currency. Some people in positions of power agree: “This is the revolution,”said Rep. David Schweikert, a Republican member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. “We just have tosell it.”I’ve been among those who have ignored cryptocurrency for a long time, but has told me I am no longer allowed to,so I’ve read up on it. And I have tosay, Schweikert is partly right: “selling it as a revolution” is a hugely important part of why cryptocurrency issucceeding. But as is generally the case whensomeone is trying tosell yousomething, the whole thingshouldseem extremely fishy. In fact, much of the cryptocurrency pitch is worse than fishy. It’s downright fraudulent, promising people benefits that they will not get and trying to trick them into believing in andspreadingsomething that will not do them any good. When you examine the actual arguments made for using crypto currencies as currency, rather than just being wowed by the complex underlyingsystem and words like “autonomy,” “global,” and “seamless,” the case for their use by most people collapses utterly. Many believe in it because they haveswallowed libertarian dogmas that do not reflect how the world actually works. Let’sstart with the basic promise, that of being “decentralized,safe, and anonymous.” People like the word decentralized. I like it a lot myself. Nobody likes. You know who liked things centralized? Stalin. But what does the word actually mean? In this instance, it means that financial transactions are peer to peer, rather than going through your bank or a processor like PayPal, and that there is no central bank altering the moneysupply, as there is with the U. S. dollar. Many of the pitches for Bitcoin begin by emphasizing itsdecentralizednature. There are recurring themes and bits of rhetoric in the pro-crypto propaganda. (A term whose use is more than justified.) It’s about freedom. It’s about getting the government off your back. It’s about getting middlemen and third parties out of your transactions. It’s about control, autonomy, empowerment. But if we get past the rhetoric and think about the implications for the average person, it’s not clear that we are actually meaningfully improving “freedom” in any but the most abstract, theoretical way. For the average currency user, why is itso important to get rid of banks and the government and thesesuspicious-sounding “third parties?” Yes, we all hate bankers, but is the tyranny of Venmoso oppressive that weshouldYes, it’s true that if you bank with a credit union, you can think of it as “surrendering control of your assets to a credit union.” The crypto-enthusiasts raise thespecter of violating the Terms of Service and having your accountsuspended. I don’t know about you, but this has not happened to me, ever. I’ve gone overdrawn and had to paystupid fees (fees they hilariously euphemize as “overdraft protection”). I’ve had my debit cardstop working because the bank thought a purchase was fraudulent and it wasn’t. But the main problems that people have with their banks and credit unions don ot have to do with the bare fact that an institution is holding their money. In fact, when we examine whether Bitcoin can function usefully as an alternative currency for the average person, wesee that all of the grand claims for it fail entirely. Using it does not create greatersecurity orsafety for one’s finances. It does not free one from the oversight of the government. It is not convenient or free. Its volatility makes it functionally useless as a currency. Furthermore, these drawbacks are not fixable; they are products of the very concept itself. There is a reason that you are not using Bitcoin for transactions, even though it has been aroundsince 2008. It is that while Bitcoin is based on an interesting technological innovation (blockchain), it isa good idea for an alternate moneysystem, due to its dependence onseveral libertarian illusions. A lot of the pitches for cryptocurrencysuggest that having your money in a bank makes it lesssecure, because a Third Party is being entrusted with it. So much of the propaganda is about “security” and how payments made with Bitcoin are more Secure than those made with PayPal, because you don’t have to provide identifying information and the transactions do not involve “third parties.” Onesite lists on the “ways cryptocurrency will help you” the prevention of fraud, because “individual crypto currencies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by thesender, as with credit card charge-backs.” From the:This really does essentially amount to lying. It depends on a confusing definition of “security” that misleads people into thinking they aresomehow less likely to bescam med if they transact in cryptocurrency. In fact, because there are no trusted third-party institutions, ifsomeone tricks you into a fraudulent transaction, there’s nothing you can do about it. Credit card payments, as noted above, can bestopped and reversed. But Bitcoin payments can’t. Once the money’s gone, it’s gone. This is touted as a feature because it helpsmerchants: if a customer gives the merchant money, the customer can’t take it back if they don’t like the merchant’s product. But most of us aren’t merchants. We’re consumers. The fact that transactions are “irreversible” may reduce the fraud risk for the merchants, but it has a flipside, which is increasing fraud risk for the customer. It’s not rational for consumers tosurrender their right tostop a charge, and it’s not accurate to describe this as “fraud reduction.” In fact, it’s justshifting whosuffers the consequences for fraud. In fact, it turns out that there are a few advantages to having those “third party intermediaries” from whose tyranny cryptocurrency promises to help us escape. I grumble when my bankstops a payment on my credit card thinking it’s fraudulent, but I like that my bank has fraud protection. (Thanks,federal law, for putting aset of rules in placesaying when banks are liable for fraud, thus incentivizing them to catch fraudsters.) Bitcoin’s decentralization means nobody is looking out for you.. Getting rid of a third-party institution that offers fraud protection is not making your payments “moresecure,” it’s making themlesssecure. The use of “security” here means narrowly “it’s guaranteed that the person who issupposed to receive the money will in fact receive it.” But from the consumer’s perspective, the “security” of transactions is holistic, meaning that it doesn’t matter whether one aspect of the transaction issecure if there are many other aspects that are highly insecure. Often, if you look closely, there areserious qualifications and caveats about the “security” benefits—Bitcoin “can represent asafer alternative to fiat trading if the right conditions are met (namely implementing an effective block chain analytics practice to remainsafe from errant typologies that exist on the blockchain)[emphasis added.]” How likely are ordinary people to even learn what these words mean, let alone know whether they’re implementing them effectively?Indeed, those without technical know-how are easy tosteal from in the world of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin.org warns ofscams including: “Blackmail, Fake Exchanges, Free Giveaways,Impersonation,Malware,Meet in Person,Money Transfer Fraud,Phishing Emails,Phishing Websites,Ponzi Schemes,Pyramid Schemes,Prize Giveaways,Pump and Dumps,Ransomware, andScam Coins.” Thesame websites that tout the unbelievablesecurity benefits of using Bitcoin, the way it canstop identity theft, then warn of Bitcoin identity theft. The “anonymity” of Bitcoin transactions may help you. But it may also help ascam mer take advantage of you. For most everyday use, you don’tanonymous transactions. You want there to be a record of what you paid and who you paid it to,so that they have a legal obligation to give you what you paid for, and it can beshow nt hat they received the money. This is not tosay that anonymous transactions offer nobody any benefits ever. The most obvious class of people who might need it are those operating outside the law. This includes drug cartels and white collar criminals, but it also includes criminal i zed industries likesex work. Marxist domina trix Mistress Magpietoldthethat while “the majority of her clients are not well versed in digital currencies,” cryptocurrency could offer a way to operate “furtively under capitalism, in a way that might not be needed in a more opensocialistsociety.” This is an argument for having an anonym i zed digital currency ofsomesort in the here and now, but itshould be noted that it means weshould be building a world in which cryptocurrency is obsolete, because people aren’t prosecuted for victimless crimes. But does cryptocurrency actually offer these benefits anyway? In fact, anyone whostarts using Bitcoins and thinks they’re making untraceable transactions is wrong. The very idea that Bitcoin is “anonymous” is highly misleading.comments that “there is nosurefire way to maintain one’s anonymity when using Bitcoin.” TheWall Street Journal,discussinghow Bitcoinscammers operate,says that while it is a “cat and mouse game” between law enforcement and thescammers, moresophisticated tracking tools are being developed all the time, and the one thing we do know is that thescam med will likely neversee their Bitcoin again. In fact, the idea that cryptocurrency is even particularly useful for crimes may be false. The RAND corporation notes that despite the “perceived attractiveness of crypto currencies for money laundering purposes . . . an estimated 99 per cent of cryptocurrency transactions are performed through centralised exchanges, which can besubject to AML/CFT [Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism] regulationsimilar to traditional banks or exchanges.” So nearly all transactions are facilitated by third parties, namely companies that act as “exchanges,”serving as an intermediary that facilitates transactions. These companies aresubject tosubpoenas just like any other. In fact, if you go on Coinbase—the exchange that is ma instreaming the use of cryptocurrency by making it easy to use—the very first thing you are asked is to verify your identity, giving your name, phone number, the last four digits of yoursocialsecurity number, etc. Unless you are a highlysophisticated actor, you are not going to be keeping the government from being able to figure out if you made a particular payment to a particular person, because your use of cryptocurrency will be through a legitimate company that complies with U. S. financial regulations. If you are asavvy enough individual to avoid the exchanges, you may not experience this. But it is a vanishinglysmall number of people who needso much more privacy than that which can be offered by any bank,are doing legitimate (if unlawful) thingssuch as trying tosubvert U. S.sanctions,andcannot operate in the evensafer medium of cash,andaresophisticated enough to figure out how to avoid all the obvious pitfalls by which they can be caught and prosecuted. If you are an ordinary consumer, the privacy difference is going to have almost no practical effect, andsot here is no reason for you to use a cryptocurrency rather than just a currency. Bitcoin’s advantages are far more likely to help thesophisticated person trying tosteal your money than they are to help you keep your moneysafer than it would be in Chase Bank. Thecites “easy transactions” as a key draw for cryptocurrency. Perhaps, though not really easier than existing payment processors that do not require you to convert your money into an arcane new currency and back again to use it. But importantly, cryptocurrency also offers new andscary ways that you can actually lose all of your money, whichshould certainly factor into an assessment of how convenient it is. AWall Street Journalanalysisin 2018 found that 20 percent of all Bitcoin tokens were lost and probably unrecoverable, because if you lose your PIN for your Bitcoin wallet, you can never access it again. “Unlike an ATM PIN, this password can’t be recovered easily,since there is no bank to retrieve it,”says theJournal. Investopediasays that “the reason for this has to do with thestructure of crypto currencies and the emphasis they place on privacy andsecurity.” One guy who had $220 million in Bitcoin, because he bought early and the value exploded, had no way to access it because he had lost his PIN. Once again, wesee the word “security” being used in astrange way. Security, for most of us, means the reduction of the risk that our money will disappear. If you lose access to your Bitcoin, a “crypto hunter” can help you try to track it down, but one of the great things about having a bank is that when lose my PIN, I just call the bank and they let me into my account. I don’t want this “third party” to disappear, even for an additional kind of privacy that means nothing to me practicallyspeaking. The trade-off offers me nothing. In fact, I tried using Bitcoin once, and I wasstruck by how extremely inconvenient it was. I kept asking myself: “why would I ever want to use this?” Of course, companies like Coinbase offer ways to buy,sell, and transfer cryptocurrencyswiftly. But they’re a centralized third party administrator! Institutions like banks could continue to arise, because they make it easier for unsophisticated users to navigate the complicated world of crypto. But then we’re just recreating banks, defeating the whole purpose of using cryptocurrency in the first place. As Doug Henwood notes:This means that Bitcoin is caught in a paradox: if the reasons why youshouldn’t use it are dealt with, the whole purpose of using it in the first place is defeated. If Coinbase becomes just like PayPal or Venmo, what earthly reason is there for me to convert my dollars into Bitcoin using Coinbase, and transact withsomeone who will then have to convert the Bitcoin back to dollars (at least if they want to use it almost anywhere)? What added value is being provided by the alternative currency? I’msure privateservices will pop up that can help me “implemen[t] an effective block chain analytics practice to remainsafe from errant typologies that exist on the blockchain,” which I’m told I need to do. But then I’m payingsomeone to help mesolve a problem I didn’t even have before,I don’t get convenience and amstill giving a cut to a middleman-type-entity, in this case the person who helps me—the oblivious non-techie—from accidentallyscrewing up the use of this complicated currency. Many of thesupposed advantages of Bitcoin, then, are actually. Having a fixed moneysupply with no central bank means there is no regulator who can helpstabilize the value of the money. As I was writing this article, the value of Bitcoinplummeted 10 percent in 24 hours. If the U. S. dollar lost 10 percent of its value in asingle day, people would be comparing this country to Zimbabwe. Yet Bitcoin is intended to be better than fiat currency! The biggest illusion at the heart of the crypto-fraud is that markets can beself-regulating andstable. In fact, markets are created bystates andsocieties, exist within frameworks of law, and must be tended, fed, and cared for by governments if they are to function. Bitcoin pretends toshed the very feature that makes money work—adapting to and conformingsocial and political institutions and rules. Instead, it relegates its own political judgments to a rigid algorithm, which makes it both unable to respond to the changing world and completely outside the control of thesociety that must accept and use it. In fact, let’s imagine ascenario that will help ussee howsilly this all is. Let us imagine that I come up with ascheme to revolutionize how people transact. I have invented a new form of currency called Nbucks. They areslips of paper with my face printed on them. Iset about trying to encourage businesses to pay people in Nbucks and trying to encourage people to buy them from me. (Isell each Nbuck for $1.) “Why,” you might ask me, “should I transact in Nbucks instead of U. S. dollars?” I have ready answers for you. First, the Nbuck is not controlled by the U. S. government. I am only going to make 1,000 total Nbucks,so the moneysupply is fixed. Using Nbucks you can transact with people without going through a bank or paying a fee. And you can transact with people in other countries who take Nbucks, without having to go through the pesky process of converting to the local currency. With myspecial Nbuck app, you can transfer your Nbucks to other people at any time without any fees. Through Nbucks, I tell you, we will free ourselves from centralized government control of the moneysupply. You will have total autonomous control of your money, for while Iset up the mechanism to the initial Nbucks, once they’re made, my role ends and we just kind ofsee what happens with it. Now, at this point you might ask a few questions about my niftysystem,such as:“Yousay I can transact with other people who use Nbucks, but how many people use these things?”“0.01 percent,” I answer, “but it’s growing all the time.”“Isee,” you reply. “Andso what is the advantage of having a currency I can barely use? Why would weswitch to thissystem when we have dollars?”“Well, it’s free of centralized government control. And banks. Plus its value is going up all the time. An Nbuck worth $1 today will probably be worth $5 next year, because there are only 1,000 of them and demand for them is increasing.”You will notice that my answerseems like a good argument for buying them as aspeculator, but it is not an argument for why they are useful as a currency. In fact, itseems to cut against their usefulness, because it’s hard to transact if the value of the money is changing unpredictably all the time. In fact, while it’s clear that Nbucksfunction as an alternative currencysystem if enough peopleswitched to them, it’s not clear why anyone wouldswitch to thatsystem. If I convince enough people that these things are valuable, they will indeed be valuable—just like Beanie Babies became valuable because people were convinced of their value—but how is what I’m offering useful to the average consumer as a currency in which theyshould conduct transactions? In fact, it’s essentially useless for the typical person, because they can’t buy much with the money, it’s inconvenient to keep converting dollars to Nbucks and back again, and their value is unpredictable. A portion of people insociety couldswitch to using glass beads instead of U. S. dollars. The beads might even be more difficult for the government to trace. The beads might even become extremely valuable. But none of this is an argument forswitching to a glass bead economy, or for any given individual to embrace beads. Likewise, Bitcoin could be adopted more and more widely. Cryptocurrency doesseem to be taking off. I’m notsaying the trend won’t continue. I amsaying it doesn’tsolve the problems itsays itsolves, and that ordinary consumers do notstand to gain much of practical value (and have a lot to lose) from using cryptocurrency. There is no value added unless you are a dissident/outlaw, and even then, you’re better off using cash if you can. Why, then, does the value of Bitcoin keep going up and up? Why is Coinbaseso valuable? Because people believe in it. Or they believe they can make money off it. And people made vast fortunes off it. You might buysome Bitcoin because you think it’s going to keep gaining value, and you might not be wrong. Hell, GameStopstock went up and up for a while;speculators canspeculate on anything. The irony with Bitcoin is that the better it is as an investment, gaining value rapidly, the worse it is as an actualcurrency, because its worth is unpredictable. (Doug Henwood outlinessome of the other reasons Bitcoin fails as an actual currencyhere.)Now, personally, I don’t care very much whether people want to use cryptocurrency, though as a believer in consumer protection I would warn anyone considering it to be very, very careful. It does interest me, however, because the people who believe in itseem to embody the wishful thinking common among free market libertarians who think that freedom from “the government” is automatically good. In reality, while plenty that the government does is oppressive (e.g., mass incarceration)some of it is extremely useful (e.g., FDIC insurance). Much of what banks do is odious, but a credit union can be an extremely useful institution. Regulators are good. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is good. Being unable to be traced by the government isgood. Butsometimes, as in the case of rich tax evaders and people who havestolen oursavings, we want things to be traced. Many of the problems cryptocurrencyseeks tosolve can be dealt with through means that do not involve trying to jettison the U. S. dollar. For example, one of the touted virtues of cryptocurrency is that it is fast and there are no transfer fees. In reality, transfers are often quiteslow and feescan be exorbitant. But public digital dollars and consumer accounts at the federal reserve could reduce the problems that come with bank account access, minimum deposit fees,slow transferspeeds, ATM fees, etc. These problems aren’t gettingsolved with Bitcoin—Bitcoin ATMs are popping up around the country, but turning your cash into Bitcoin or your Bitcoin into cash costs money. (My bank refunds ATM fees, meaning that using Bitcoin ATMs would be a verystupid thing for me to do.) If the infrastructure to make Bitcoin convenient and usable has to be built by the privatesector, then it try tosqueeze money out of consumers. The promise of “free transactions” with Bitcoin is, likeso many other capitalist promises, illusory. The question of whether people will be exploited by the finance industry is nota question of whether they’re using U. S. dollars orsome alternate currency, but whether the institutions they’re relying on operate in theservice of the public interest or of private interests. When Isay that cryptocurrency is a fraud, let me be clear: I don’t mean that it can’t work as a currency. Anything can work as a currency, though the better ones have predictable valuesso that a hamburger costs thesame on Tuesday as it does on Wednesday. I mean that for most ordinary people, the answers offered to the question “Whyshould I use cryptocurrency?” are deceptive or nonsense. Instead of being taken in by the privacy andsecurity—which are good things that people indeed want—we have to look at whether these things are actually being delivered to consumers and if the difference is meaningful and worth the trade-offs. What are youreallygetting, what are you giving up to get it, and is the rhetoric of crypto-propagandists actually fulfilled in the real-world experience of using it? This total lack of an actual argument for why it’s good is why Warren Buffett has long thought it’s a worthless delusion and refuses to go near it. Buffett doesn’t doubt that people might make money on it, but hesees that the claims made for itsimply don’t hold up. (Buffett prefers to invest in more tangible assets like predatory mobile home companies.)When I point out that the U. S. consumer has no reason to adopt Bitcoin as a currency, the most forceful (and most left-ish) reply I get is that while this may be true for the U. S., cryptocurrency offer wondrous advantages to unbanked people in the developing world. If you are in a country whose currency is unstable or where international wire transfers are prohibitively expensive, Bitcoin might be helpful. They point me to newsstories about how people in certain African countries are increasingly using Bitcoin for certain purchases. Let us note that there issomething to the argument that there is ao f people for whom Bitcoin may be better than existing alternatives for certain purposes. I think this class of people is very limited, however. People in the developing world don’t like losing 10 percent of the value of their wealth overnight any more than people in the United States do, and to the extent that Bitcoin offers advantages, it doesso only because the existing alternatives areso bad. It is true that insome places, international wire transfer fees are outrageously expensive. Sending Bitcoin is not free, and you have to convert it back into cash if you want to actually do anything with it, but it might be better than the alternative, insome places, for now. But if wire transfer fees come down in the next few years, that advantage will be lost. The argument that Bitcoin will be globally helpful depends on assuming that the existing banking industry is not going tosucceed in expanding its reach. During an economic crisis, or in places where bank failures occur, Bitcoin might be more helpful. In Venezuela and Zimbabwe, there may be an argument that despite cryptocurrency’s disadvantages, people are less likely to lose theirshirts by using it. But what this means is that we have got a case the cryptocurrency helps those who:To the extent that Bitcoin is the “future of money,” then, it is only the future of money insituations of extreme crisis or deprivation—Isuspect a lot of the pro-crypto people who understand its present-day uselessness are betting on a future collapse of the global economicsystem, although I think they overestimate the chances that Bitcoin itself could keep functioning effectively insuch a nightmarescenario (someone has to maintain the actual wires). This argument for the usefulness of Bitcoin actually makes me think of the Segway. The Segway was intended to revolutionize transport, and its technology was innovative and impressive and cool. But the Segway did not revolutionize transport. It did end up being used for a lot of tour groups, however. Bitcoinseemssimilar. Blockchain is clearly impressive. But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin will revolutionize global commerce. Like the Segway, however, it may developsome niche application forsomesmall group of people for whom its disadvantages do not outweigh its advantages. Even those people, however, may eventually find their way back to government currency. Many governments arestarting to explore the possibility of offering digital versions of their fiat currency through central banks. These kinds of accounts would make transfers easier and cheaper and give many more unbanked people the ability tostore their wealth in asecure place. (The prying eyes of government willstill be a problem.) Weshallsee whether progress is made quickly on this front. If not, it may well be true thatswathes of the developing world resort to crypto funny-money. But ifso, it will be because it is the least-worst option. If you want a good example of nonsense crypto-hype, have a look at this pseudoscholarly masterpiece by Vijay Boyapati called “The Bullish Case For Bitcoin.” It was recently promoted by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and even re-tweeted by progressive congressman Ro Khanna. (Khanna is a crypto-booster,sayingits decentralization “provides a check against economic mismanagement” and is “the next digital frontier.”) Boyapati provides a case that Bitcoin is a good investment (usingsome deeply amusinggraphs), but he also tries toshow that it hasstrong potential as a currency.* He lists thesupposed qualities a currency needs andshows that Bitcoin is better than the US dollar (fiat money) on most accounts:Of course, half these ratings are false and most of them have nothing to do with what people need from money in the real world. The fact that U. S. dollars are not “scarce,” in that the government can create more of them, is actually a good thing (for one thing, it means the moneysupply can grow with the economy; for another, it means we canstimulate the economy through putting new money into it). Boyapatisays dollars are less “durable” than Bitcoin, because “many governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them,” which is true as a historical fact but tells us nothing whatsoever about the future of the dollar. Note that Boyapati does not include in his fake ratings “spendable” (i.e., can you actually use it for anything) because Bitcoin would be crushed on this. Boyapatiinvokesome fakescience—like the “Gartner hype cycle”—tosupport his belief that Bitcoin’s future is bright. Look at this magnificentlystupid graph designed toshow that Bitcoin will eventually be as trusted as gold:Youshould expect to hear more of thesesunny pro-crypto arguments, because those who are heavily invested in cryptocurrency will be working hard to try to trick people into thinking it’s in our best interest to embrace cryptocurrency. Boyapati’s pitch looks like prophecy, but people who are invested in Bitcoin need to be making these prophecies all the time, as emphatically as possible, because for the currency tosucceed people must join in the collective belief that the prophecy is true. (More cynically, for peoplespeculating on Bitcoin to maximize their return the demand for Bitcoin must keep rising.)The world of cryptocurrency is one in which wily and technologicallysophisticated people can easily take advantage of less financially or technologicallysavvy people—and the people making the arguments for it happen to be exactly the ones who can navigate this world well and make money in it. It is the libertarian paradise, a Wild West where everyone is trying to take each other’s money and there are no publicly-controlled entities looking out for the common good.contributor Andrew Anchetacommentson the ugliness of this world, which has come to replicate the worst aspects of existing capitalism: “crypto-capitalists have reinvented the finance industry’s fractional reserves and derivatives, private interests began trading votes and carving out monopolies, and rent-seekers found ways to extractsurplus value, all while trashing the environment and finding new ways to concentrate wealth at the top.”Trashing the environment? Oh yes, I haven’t even told you about the fact that Bitcoin’s “autonomy” means it has to deploy asillysystem that ends up using thesame amount of electricity as an entire country, and the problem is getting worse. Cryptocurrencies vary in their wastefulness but Bitcoin “is only likely to consume more and more electricity over time” despite already using an “unfathomable amount of electricity.” Vitalik Buterin, the computerscientist behind Ethereum, the 2nd most popular cryptocurrency, admits that it’s an unnecessary “huge waste of resources.” Ethereum has promised to improve thesystem in a way that will reduce these destructiveside effects. But what it means is that at the moment, cryptocurrency is imposing a giant externality on everyone: the failure to put a price on carbon emissions means that polluters can essentiallysteal from the rest of us. If the energy problem can besolved, cryptocurrency will becomesomewhat benign and useless rather than actively destructive and useless. This will be used bysome to convince you that you ought tostart thinking about using cryptocurrency, and merchants ought to accept it. Be careful, because this fad could genuinely result in portions of the economyswitching to asystem that disadvantages consumers, on the promise that it willsolve problems that easily besolved through effective public institutions,ifwe were able to exercise our collective political will. The need forsecurity, privacy, and easy money transfers is real, but the promise that a new form of money will rein in thesurveillancestate or free us from profiteers is illusory. Onlystrong—yes,sometimescentralized—democratic institutions can do that. As you cansee, thissuccessfully makes the case that high fees are unavoidable, but it also undermines the reasons why anysane person would use this as currency rather than aspeculative investment.",1,1,Current Affairs

Anyway, among the five white menselected by McCarthy, three of them voted against certifying the current president’s victory. All five of them voted against impeaching for his role in inciting the violence that descended upon the capitol.

Wednesday also marked the highestsingle-day increase of cases for K-12schools in Utah with an additional 598. The previous record was 378 from last Friday. There have now been nearly 11,000 infections tied tostudents and teacherssince August. And, in total, 77 Utahschools have temporarilyshut their doors due to outbreakssince reopening this fall. The biggestshare of the newschool closures came from Jordan District, where the board of education voted to temporarily move fiveschools to remote learning Wednesday night. The district has been particularly hard hit by the virus and closed 14schools last week, many facing asecond or third outbreak.“The point of moving to virtual is toslow thespread,”stressed board member Jen Atwood during the virtual meeting. Overall, 21 of the district’s 57 traditionalschools have moved online, including now 11 of its 12 middleschools and allsix highschools. That is the most closures of any district in thestate. It also has the highest total number of infections – at 1,695 — of the districts in Salt Lake Countythat have reopened in person. That’s an increase of nearly 500 more cases in Jordan District from last week. But Wednesday was the first time that the board chose to close elementaryschools, which haveso far avoided the high transmission rates that have overwhelmed middle and highschools. Three element aries — Butterfield Canyon, Foothills and Westvale — will move to virtual learning. Butterfield Canyon appears to be the first elementary in thestate to hit the 15-person outbreak threshold that thestate health department recommends trigger a two-week closure. As of Wednesday, there were 14 infections there. The boardsaid a few more would be reported in Thursday’s numbers, putting it over the edge. Previously, only two elementaryschools have closed in thestate, both in Piute County School District in central Utah. But they didso as a precaution without having 15 cases. Pediatricians in thestate warned this week that while elementary-age children may notsee high numbers of cases, there have recently been more kids withsevere illness from the virus landing in the hospital. Assuch, both Foothills and Westvale in Jordan District are moving online as asafety measure, the board voted. Neither has hit the 15-case threshold. And Westvale, accordingly, will only beshut down for Monday and Tuesday next week as asmall reset before Thanksgiving Break. All of the others will close for the full two weeks, with the last in-person day on Thursday before going remote through Dec. 4. The bigger problem is that absentee and quarantine rates at the element aries areso high that it’s too difficult to continue holding in-person classes. At Westvale, for instance, there areseven positive cases of the virus. That has led to 94students andstaff being quarantined. And an additional 20 kids were absent Wednesday. With that, roughly one-third of theschool was out.“There comes a tipping point with absenteeism and quarantines,”said board member Matthew Young. “It just absolutely hits a tipping point.”Westvale is also dealing withseveral teachers and administrators being out. The two middleschools, likewise, hadn’t hit 15 cases, but both Oquirrh Hills and Joel P. Jensen were close enough and the board voted to close them, too. Jordan District briefly considered moving all of itsschools to online instruction through Thanksgiving, but the measure did not pass. Additionally, this week Fremont High in Weber School District was closed, as well as Legacy Junior High and Syracuse Junior High in nearby Davis School District. North Summit High and Morgan High also moved online. Meanwhile, Tooele High, Corner Canyon High, Brighton High and Farmington High all had theirsecond outbreaks andshifted to virtual instruction.",2,2,Salt Lake Tribune
565,Biden’s Distracting Parade of Celebrity Boomers,-15.0,36.5,https://newrepublic.com/article/159117/biden-celebrity-surrogates-carole-king-crosby-streisand,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"With the tiresome necessity of political conventionseason concluding, we now enter the homestretch of a long two years of presidential campaigning. Here, we willsee exactly how Joe Biden plans to argue his case. According to an Associated Pressstoryon Wednesday, it will involve plenty of celebrities. Biden’ssuperstar backers are “flooding the zone as much as possible,” in the words of Michelle Kwan, the Olympic figureskater and aseasoned Democratic celebritysurrogate. It is hard not to get chills hearing about Biden’s reliance on hissuperstar allies, given how thesamesort ofstrategic deployment turned out for Hillary Clinton. Butso far, Biden is taking aslightly different approach. His gang is a little more …distinguished. Experienced. Seasoned. We’re talking Carole King, James Taylor, David Crosby, Barbara Streisand,Sheryl Crow—singers of thesame vintage or earlier as the musicians Homer Simpson got roasted by his kids for liking in the “Homerpalooza” episode. Which aired in 1996. Perhaps Biden’s Boomer Bench is a little more authentic than the approach Clinton took four years ago, which dutifully trotted out huge millennialstars like Taylor Swift andKaty Perry, as if tosay: This is theshit you idiot kids like, right? Her campaign also engaged in more niche, targeted pandering to young and trendy, more media-savvy audiences, like writing a post for the now-defunct website The Toast and appearing onBroad City. It is a little harder to imagine Joe Bidenshowing up on a Twitchstream or appearing on theOffice Ladiespodcast, but there’s plenty of time. After all, he does haveDiploin his corner. There are advantages to getting celebrities involved in your campaign. For astart, they aresuper rich. Secondly, their friends tend to besimilarly wealthy. And maybe there’s a third advantage, who knows? Focus on the first two. In one revealingstory,The Financial Timesnotedin May that wealthy participants in virtual fund raisers expect a “rain check” on the “perks” that they would usually receive at in-person events,such as getting face time with the candidate. This is the avenue of influence that causes campaign finance reform advocates to warn about these events. It’s definitely a more acute concern when it’s a lobbyist paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to whisper in the candidate’s ear, of course, but it’s not like these multimillionaire celebrities have no interests of their own. Still, the Biden campaign’sstrategy of “flooding the zone” with celebrities may have more to do with trying to attract other, less famous wealthy donors than with attracting donations from the celebs themselves. A Biden campaign officialtoldThe Financial Timesthat they were “preparing to test new fundraising measures,such as deploying more celebritysurrogates,” to make up the gap with Trump’s more robust fundraising. Those less well-known but critical donors—your Average Joe Millionaire—might need an added inducement toshell out if they aren’t going to get to chat to Biden himself. The chance tospeak with pop-cultural royalty about politics can at leastserve as a memorable part of The Biden Experience. Celebrities havestumped for Democratic presidentialcandidatesforyears, but the genuine love celebrities and musicians had for Obama, who was also perhaps the only president we’ve ever had to come close to being “cool,” greatly accelerated this dynamic. It’s almost easy to forget that Obama was once an outsider candidate, challenging the Clintonstatus quo, and that—combined with the obvious fact that hestood to break the centuries-long cycle of white presidents—allowed him to accrue nosmall amount ofstreet c red with hip backers. Obama used in diesad-dad rockers The National’ssong “Fake Empire” (which actually doesn’t hol da very positive message about America) in an ad during his primary campaign, and the band played a benefitshow in their homestate of Ohio for him. This was all very trendystuff, in 2008. The excitement about Obama was inextricably wrapped up in celebrity, both his own and that of his famoussupporters. Now thesame celebs who loved Cool Obama are on the hook for Old Joe. At least one celebrity endorser even explicitly mentioned Obama when endorsing Biden. In an updated version of “Lookin’ for a Leader,” Neil Youngsang last month: “Yeah, we had Barack Obama, and we really need him now. The man whostood behind him has to take his placesomehow.” Talk about damning with faint praise. But if Obama made it a trend, now it’s mandatory. One unspoken benefit of celebritysurrogates: It means Joe Biden doesn’t have to do all the campaigning himself, or morespecifically, that he doesn’t have to talkso much, thus defusingsome of his well-known gaffe risk. Bidenreiteratedlast week that he doesn’t intend to resume active, in-person campaigning, telling Reuters that he and his running mate, Kamala Harris, were “going to follow thescience, what thescientists tell us” and that the campaign “will win” despite the candidate choosing tosequester himself at his Delaware home. It is true thatstaging large campaign events with lots of people presents unique dangers during the coronavirus pandemic. But there is evidence thatsuggests outdoor,socially distanced events with masks are lower risk and that President Donald Trump is embarking on “an increasingly aggressive travelschedule” to battlegroundstates,staging “open-air events withsmall crowds.” There is a whole world of activities Biden could do aside from packed rallies. He could visit reopenedschools, or factories, or hospitals—all places where the people he’s asking to vote for him have been required to keep working. But why bother going places, when you have David Crosby just a Zoom call away?As Sarah Jones noted for this publication in 2016, Clinton’s campaign “employed a candy-colored brand of female empowermentseemingly based on the assumption that white women’s political priorities are influenced by the pop culture they consume.” This time, we have many of thesame celebrities and thesame heavy-handed effort to Reach Out to Voters, without even a half-hearted invocation of any kind of bigger reason to care about Joe Biden at all. The celebrities’ message will boil down to thesame message his campaign has had all along: He’s not Trump. The Democratic National Convention essentially hammered this case throughout four evenings of virtual content, forsaking much mention of the policies Democrats intend to pursue andstrivingso mightily to draw disaffected Republicans away from Trump that itstudiously avoided any criticism of the GOP beyond its currentstandard-bearer. It was in many ways reminiscent of Clinton’s myopic anti-Trump focus; the Biden campaign’s firm commitment to not really campaigning also feels eerilysimilar to Clinton, whospent thesummer of 2016focusing on celebrity fund raisers over campaign events. This election is different for a thousand reasons, but it is hard not to feel the cold wind of November 2016 blowing again.",1,1,New Republic

Won’t Affect Mass Incarceration,7.67,40.0,https://freebeacon.com/policy/bidens-private-prison-e-o-wont-affect-mass-incarceration/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-free-beacon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced an end to federal use of private prisons, a move he heralded as a blow to mass incarceration but which would affect just 2 percent of all prisoners. Biden's executive order, which requires the Department of Justice to begin phasing out private detention contracts, isspecifically targeted at ""decreas[ing] incarceration levels"" by reducing ""profit-based incentives to incarcerate."" Speaking to the press Tuesday, Biden called the order ""just the beginning of my administration’s plan to addresssystemic problems in our criminal justicesystem.""""President Biden is committed to reducing mass incarceration while making our communitiessafer,"" White House presssecretary Jen Psakisaid during a briefing on the order. ""Thatstarts with ending the federal government’s reliance on private prisons.""But the federal government is not reliant on private prisons, and the order would affect less than 2 percent of all prisoners in the United States, official datashow, including just 16 percent of federal prisoners. It would also not reduce incarceration, as prisoners would be moved to public facilities and would likely leave untouched the many federal private prison detainees housed under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security. Biden's order instead follows private prisons' role as a popularscapegoat for advocates of ""criminal justice reform,"" who argued as far back as the Obama administration that profit-motivated corporations would tend to increase incarceration. That position issimilar to other popular arguments—like advocacy for marijuana legalization on de carceration grounds—that allow proponents of reform to avoid talking about prisons' large population of violent offenders. In itsspecifics, the new order only requires that the Department of Justice not renew its contracts with ""privately operated criminal detention centers."" It does not implicate detention centers administered by other departments. That may mean that private entities willstill detain illegal aliens pending deportation, who account for ""the vast majority of contractor-operated facilities,"" according to the private prison group Day One Alliance. In other words, the Biden order may target asmallshare of asmallshare of offenders. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statisticsindicate that private prisons hold just 7 percent ofstate prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners. In total, they detain roughly 116,000 of the roughly 1.4 million prisoners in the United States—the federal prisons that Biden's order would close house just 28,000 people or roughly 2 percent of the U. S. prison population. In fact, the BJS datashow, the federal private prison population was already in decline, falling between 2018 and 2019. Just fivestates hold more than 20 percent of their prisoners in private prisons, while 18states hold none at all. These facts did notstop ""criminal justice reform"" groups from praising Biden's executive order, with the ACLU's David Fathicalling it""an important firststep toward acknowledging the harm that has been caused and taking actions to repair it."" It also garnered praise from the union representingsome 30,000 federal prison workers, whostand to gain from the closing of competitors. Biden's order explicitly restarts an initiative of the last days of the Obama administration, whichsimilarly prepared a phase-out in the months leading up to the 2016 election. Following his victory, President Donald Trumpreversed that decisionshortly after taking over the White House. That made it a popular punching bag in the ensuing years, particularly during the 2020 Democratic primary. Then, contenderssuch as Sens. Elizabeth Warren(D., Mass.) andCory Booker(D., N. J.) took aim at it,as didnow-Vice President Kamala Harris. Those candidates likely induced Biden to pull his criminal justice platform to the left, including endorsing an end to federal private prisons—part of a larger effort toshed a tough-on-crime image from his days in the Senate. Opposition to private prisons in the 2020 field followed that group's use of other popular progressive talking points on ""criminal justice reform,"" like the debunked claim that marijuana criminalization is a major driver of incarceration. Just as with prisoners in private prisons, marijuana offenders account for asmall fraction of overall prisoners. In reality,48 percent of prisoners are violent offenders, a fraction that has risen even as prison populations haveshrunk over the past decade and a half. Joe Biden,Prison",1,1,Washington Free Beacon

569,Intelligence Contractors Vying for Slimmer Spy Budget in FY 2021,0.0,44.4,https://about.bgov.com/news/intelligence-contractors-vying-for-slimmer-spy-budget-in-fy-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-23,17,"The Department of Defense and theOffice of the Director of National Intelligence(ODNI) released their intelligence budget requests for fiscal 2021 totaling $85 billion earlier this year. DODandODNIreleased enacted 2020 figures Oct. 21, allowing for comparisons and revealing aslight decrease from $85.8 billion total in the fiscal 2021 request. A large portion of the intelligence community’s budget goes to contracting which indicates companies are likely to be competing for fewer dollars in the future. Most contracting by the intelligence agencies is not transparent. Historically, theshare of budgets devoted to contracting has been reported at about70%. The U. S. intelligence community’s budget is comprised of two primary categories, the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The MIP is overseen by the Pentagon and includesspending for the intelligence components of the militaryservices as well assome of the funding for intelligence agencies that fall under DODsuch as theDefense Intelligence Agency(DIA) or theNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency(NGA). The NIP pays for other intelligence agenciessuch as theCentral Intelligence Agency, portions of theFBI, and the State Department’sBureau of Intelligence and Research(INR), as well assome portion of the DOD-controlled agencies. For fiscal 2021, DOD announced its MIP request would be$23.1 billion, thesame as was appropriated for fiscal 2020, and ODNI requested $61.9 billion, a decrease from $62.7 billion in fiscal 2020. DOD and ODNI do not release detailed budget figures for the various agencies forsecurity reasons. In fiscal 2012, the combined MIP and NIP budget was $75.4 billion making the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through the 2021 request about 1% and thus not keeping pace withinflation. About70%of the intelligence budget isspent on contracts based on the latest figures available, meaning that the approximately $59.5 billion to bespent on contracts for the intelligence community in fiscal 2021 issmaller in real terms than it was a decade ago. Determining what exactly the intelligence communityspends its contracting dollars on is difficult because the intelligence community is exempt from reporting contractspending to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). Asearch in Bloomberg Government’s Contracts Intelligence toolshows a total of only$3 billion for the National Security Agency, DIA and NGAsince fiscal 2017 and no data for the CIA. The billions that the communityspends that are not disclosed arespent on a broad range of goods andservices. Some of these contracts are directly related to personnel that perform intelligence collection and analysis, or the building of intelligencesatellites, while others may pay for more mundane things,such as janitorialservices in intelligence community facilities, officesupplies, or construction and repair of buildings. However, even in the cases where the work is not directly intelligence-related, contractors often requiresecurity clearances because of thesensitivity of the work being performed around them, the individual identities of those performing the intelligence work, or even the location where the work is being done. Competition for intelligence community work is challenging because of the limited number of contractors that have cleared personnel authorizations. It’s also difficult to identify available opportunities becausesolicitations are often released with a prerequisite for organizations to have certainsecurity clearances. The intelligence community’s primary platform for releasing opportunities,Acquisition Research Center, has both unclassified and classified components and does release a portion of the acquisition documents at the unclassified level that are accessible with registration and login-in credentials. For contractorsseeking to participate in the intelligence market, partnering with companies already in the market, or hiring personnel with experience are often the best ways to break in. If the budgets continue decliningslowly, as they have for fiscal 2021, the market is only likely to become more competitive in the immediate future.

Settlement of the lawsuit was announced by the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion,sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information. The EEOC had originally filed the lawsuit in 2017. The company was charged with failing to consider African American employees for promotions to vacant routesales positions. One example is Ronnie Johnson, a Black employee who applied for a routesales position.“Despitesix years of exemplary job performance with the company and previous routesales experience, Birmingham Beverage denied him an interview and instead promoted a white delivery driver with only nine months’ experience on the job, whom Johnson wassupervising at the time,” apr ess release from the EEOCsays. Despite Black employees frequently expressing interest in promotions, none were hired in the four years prior to the lawsuit, according to the EEOC. At least 11 white applicants or employees were hired or promoted to these routesales positions.“At the time of the lawsuit, Birmingham Beverage’s only two Black routesalesmen were assigned to routes in predominantly African American neighborhoods,” the releasesays. Thesuit alleged that Birmingham Beverage violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on multiple occasions. As a result of thesuit, Johnson and 34 other Black employees, former and current, will receive a monetarysettlement. Birmingham Beverage also agreed to review its policies on the hiring and promotion processes to ensure Black employees and applicants have equal opportunities, provide anti-discrimination training to all employees and hire a Title VII coordinator.“This case illustrates the destructive and demoralizing impact race discrimination can have on employees when they are denied employment opportunities based on their race,” EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrowssaid in the release. “For many years, African American workers at Birmingham Beverage demonstrated their fitness and desire for promotion but were denied employment opportunities because of the color of theirskin.”Lehr Middlebrooks Vreeland & Thompson, P. C. represents Birmingham Beverage in the litigation. According to their response on the company’s behalf, Birmingham Beverage “stands behind its hiring and promotion decisions to hire and promote the best qualified applicants.”They also claim they have employed “many African American Route Salesmen” over the last five years.“The high costs of litigation of class claims made the continued vigorous defense of thesuit economically infeasible and presented a distraction to our core business operations,” the responsestates. “We look forward to continuing to hire and promote applicants and employees of all backgrounds into positions for which they are qualified.”",2,2,AL.com
571,COVID-19 Is Derailing Other Important Scientific Research,-0.67,44.0,https://heavy.com/news/covid19-scientific-research/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,21,"GettyAmadou Kone, a professor of molecular biology at the University Clinical Research Centre, isseen working in a COVID-19 testing laboratory in Bamako on January 9, 2021. For many researchers, the choice tospend decades working in a lab or in the field comes from a desire to help – to expand understanding of how life works or to improve human health. So when COVID-19 emerged, manyscientists dropped what they were doing andswitched their focus to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the pandemic. Suddenly, the ranks ofscientists who had beenstudying coronavirus es were flooded with newcomersseeking to contribute insome way, many with little prior experience in infectious diseases. Some wanted to join in on the biggest problem facing the world. For others, it was the only way to open labs. Otherssaw funding opportunities. We,a virologistandvirologist-physician,saw this pivot in our own fields. Many of our colleagues began working on SARS-CoV-2. As an editor/adviser at the Journal of Virology and Science, one of us handled hundreds of papers in 2020, nearly half focused on COVID-19. Curious about the trend and implications, we analyzed published papers about SARS viruses found in PubMed and found the number had increased 20-fold relative to the early 2000s, when the first SARS coronavirus appeared. Our analysis has not yet been published. Another recent analysis,which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that the proportion of biomedical research papers focused on coronavirus es rose from 0.07% to 5.3% from 2019 to 2020. Many of these papers came from fields that hadn’t considered coronavirus es before,such as psychiatry, cardiovascular research and oncology. When a new virus is ravaging the planet,scientistsshould help. This is an all-hands-on-deck emergency, and researchers with different backgrounds can bring new perspectives that can lead to major breakthroughs. Yet there issome evidence that as labs haveshifted attention to SARS-CoV-2, efforts have been duplicated, and precious time and resources have been used ineffectively. This rapidscientific reorientation has implications far beyond SARS-COV-2 and potentially leaves the world vulnerable to other health crises. Understandably, the rush to enter the field has led to many labs doing thesame experiments at thesame time. Some level of duplication is essential to ensure that findings are reproducible. Butsome of this duplication is unnecessary: Asearch for “SARS-CoV-2” and “ACE2” (the major receptor that SARS viruses use to enter cells) in an online archive of unpublished research yielded more than 1,400 papers, and we found evidence of overlap. For example, hundreds of these papers examine inhibition of viral entry into cells. There is overlap even in uniquesubniches: Dozens of papers focus on nanobodies, a unique type of antibody often generated using alpacas, and the titles of many of the papers are verysimilar. Fresh perspectives from newcomers don’t always yield breakthroughs. Science and the media have been temporarily derailed by problematic research contributed byscientistsswitching to a new field –such as a paper bynonepidemiologistsreporting that a vaccine against tuberculosis may protect against COVID-19 because countries with high rates of vaccination have lower mortality rates of the virus. Despite extensive media coverage –thestudy was picked up by 90 media outlets – a closer look revealed no evidence the vaccine had any protective effect. In biomedicine, academic labsstudy aspecific topic and are led by experiencedscientists who direct trainees. Overseveral years of training, aselect number of trainees have the desire and gainsufficient expertise to open their own labs and begin mentor ing the next generation ofscientists in their field. This is how we keepscience going. Normally, trainees work in a lab investigating a particular field of biology or medicine,such as cancer or neurodegeneration. Each traineestudies asingle,specific topic and publishes his or her research asscientific papers. The rapid pivot to COVID research means many labs – and trainees – that were oncestudying other topics are now focused on SARS-CoV-2, which means fewer youngscientists are now being trained to tackle other health threats. This loss of knowledge and expertise could leave us less prepared for the next health crisis or outbreak. At this point, our concerns are theoretical. We can’tsaysomething like this has happened in the past, because nothing like COVID-19 has occurred in the modern research era. When other virusessuch as SARS (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-1), Ebola and Zika became news,somescientistsswitched gears to help, but at nowhere near thescale wesee now. Now, one year into the pandemic, many lab teams may want to ask: Can we continue to make an important and distinct contribution to the field? Forsome – those with a unique angle or the appropriate experience and facilities to handle dangerous pathogens – the answer may be yes. However, for many others, it may be time to pivot back to pre-COVID-19 research topics in which the overall advances will be moresignificant. Even within the field of infectious diseases, it doesn’t makesense for the vast majority of virologists to focus on COVID-19. With hundreds of viruses colonizing bats and other animals around the world and the potential forspillover and future pandemics, it is imperative that westudy many different viruses.[Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]Some researchers need to do “curiosity-based work,” in which we follow investigations with no obvious link to human health. You never know where the path will lead. Bystudying yellow fever virus,Charles Ricelaid the groundwork for his research on hepatitis C virus, which was acknowledged with last year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Meanwhile, those who continue tostudy COVID-19 and other infectious diseases need dedicated,sustained funding, not isolatedsurges of cash that rely on the expedient wishes of Congress. Extending National Institutes of Health funding periods from five years toseven years would help immensely. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute recently adopted asimilar approach. To prepare for the next outbreak, the field needsstable funding tostudy many different viruses, monitor reservoirs of viruses with pandemic potential and develop new antivirals we can rapidly deploy during the next pandemic. In the war against the COVID-19 pandemic, facing SARS-CoV-2 will not be the only battle we fight. The attraction of working on the pandemic virus can divertscientists from other pressing health concerns that can be just as deadly. By Julie K. Pfeiffer, Professor of Microbiology,andTerence S.

572,Trump Takes Swipe At FBI Chief Over Handling Of Russia Probe Documents,6.0,37.0,https://dailycaller.com/2020/08/13/donald-trump-christopher-wray-russia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-caller-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"President Donald Trump took aswipe at FBI Director Christopher Wray in an interview on Thursday,saying that the FBI chief has not been as forthcoming as he would like with documents related to the Trump-Russia probe.“I wish he was more forthcoming, he certainly hasn’t been,” Trump told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “There are documents that they want to get, and we havesaid we want to get. We’re going to find out if he’s going to give those documents. But certainly he’s been very, very protective.”Trump’s remarks comes as congressional Republicans have ramped up public allegations that Wray has withheld documents related to the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign. Last week, Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnsonsubpoenaed Wrayfor all documents related to Crossfire Hurricane, the name of the FBI’s counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign. The investigation began on July 31, 2016 and was folded into thespecial counsel’s probe, whichstarted before Wray took office. On Monday, Sen. Lindsey Grahamcalled on Wrayto explain a Feb. 14, 2018 memo regarding an FBI briefing provided to the Senate Intelligence Committee regarding the primarysource for Christopher Steele, the Britishspy whose dossier the FBI used to obtainsurveillance orders against Carter Page. The briefing memo did not disclose that Steele’ssource,Igor Danchenko, disputedsome of the key allegations in the dossier. Georgia Rep. Doug Collinscalled on Wray to resign on Wednesday for failing to disclose Trump-Russia documents.“I’ve reached my limit with Director Wray,” Collinssaid on Fox News. “It’s time for him to resign. It’s time for him to move on. Let’s let other people take the reins here.”“Either he was willfully not knowing what was going on, he was intentionally misleading the Senate, or there was actually a cover up going on.”Wray has reportedly opposed White House and congressional efforts to declassify various documents related to the dossier, FBIsources, and Crossfire Hurricane. Bloombergreportedin January 2018 that Wray opposed the declassification and release of a memo from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that alleged that the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding the dossier. The memo was largely vindicated by a Justice Department inspector general’s report released on Dec. 9, 2019 thatsaid the FBI made 17 “significant” errors and omissions in applicationssubmitted to the FISC tosurveil Carter Page. Trump downplayed his role inselecting Wray for the FBI position, telling Bartiromo that “he was chosen by a certain person, and Isaid, go ahead, put whoever you want.”“I’mso honest that Isaid you could put anybody you want. Let’ssee how Wray turns out. He’s either going to turn out one way or the other.”“Bill Barr has a chance to be the greatest of all time.

573,"LBJ Stole an Election. 72 Years Later, Democrats Are Using the Same Bag of Tricks.",29.0,8.67,https://thenewamerican.com/lbj-stole-an-election-72-years-later-democrats-are-using-the-same-bag-of-tricks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-05,16,"The Biblesays there’s nothing new under thesun. That certainly applies to voter fraud in American politics. The commonly parroted talking point among the mainstream media and other mouthpieces of the establishment is that voter fraud, at least to a degree that couldsway an election, doesn’t happen in America; that it’s only found in third-world countries but could never take place in a nation assophisticated as ours. Such assurances fly in the face of reality. In fact, voter fraud has been a long-time fixture of American politics and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ignorant of history or deliberately trying to obfuscate the truth. Anyone who hasstudied urban political operations, especially the infamousTammany Hallmachine, knows that vote fraud, including dead people voting and party bosses filling out absentee ballots on behalf of voters, has been a fact of lifesince at least the 19th century. Perhaps the most famous case of voter fraud is Lyndon Baines Johnson’s 1948stealing of the U. S. Senate race against former Texas Governor Coke Stevenson. This electionstands out because of itssignificance for America — Johnson had already forsaken his Houseseat and lost a Senate race in 1941,so a loss in 1948 would have ended his political career and prevented him from reaching the presidency — and because the fraud has been conclusively and definitively proven, even to the point of the biggest participants in thesteal admitting to what they did years after. Aspreviously noted, LBJ overcame an 11,000-vote Election Night deficit against the conservative former governor in the Democrat primary thanks to tens of thousands of “block votes” he purchased, particularly from the Rio Grande Valley, where a group of corrupt political bosses took advantage of the heavy Mexican demographic’s willingness to play along and keep quiet in obeisance to their powerfulpatrones(Spanish for “bosses” or “chief”), who would win over commoners with favors (giving a local family cash for funeral expenses, helping an old lady with her medical bills, etc.) andsilence dissidents at gunpoint. The ringleader of the Valley’s political bosses was George Parr, asheriff and county judge known, like his father before him, as the “Duke of Duval” County. Parr’s dominion encompassedseven counties; he ruled Duval, Brooks, and Jim Hogg counties as a virtualsatrapy and his control extended into Zapata, Webb, La Salle, and Starr counties through alliances with lesser local bosses. In Precinct 13 of the city of Alice in Jim Wells County, the precinct in which the mysterious last-minute 200 votes that pushed Johnson over the edge to an 87-vote victory were “found,” the votes weresupervised by Parr’s enforcer, a tall, burly,savage Mexican by the name of Luis Salas, better known as the “Indio.”Salas left many a man near-death in fist fights and carried a revolver around his hip, often under the guise of the law (Parr made him a city policeman in Alice and a deputysheriff in Duval, Jim Wells, and Nueces counties).“In all these years, George told me to give our candidate 80 percent of the total votes, regardless if the people voted against us,” Salas told author Robert Caro, as recounted in the book. How did Salas and other vote-sellers ensure their client, Johnson, won the election?One method was getting the dead to vote. As detailed in:The number of votes at the’ command was not necessarily limited by the number of eligible voters. Since voters over the age ofsixty were not required to pay poll taxes, andsince poll tax lists were checked irregularly to eliminate the names of those who died aftersixty, “in the Valley,” as one expert on thesubject puts it, “the ‘machine’ votes the dead men.”In many cases, votes were cast on behalf of individuals without their knowledge, as in the case of a young man who testified at the behest of the Stevenson team that, although a ballot was cast in his name, he had in fact been out of town and not voted when the election occurred. Even non-citizens were utilized to give Parr’s candidates an edge. Caro writes:Nor was American citizenship necessarily a requirement; on Election Day, voters were recruited insaloons on the Mexicanside of the Rio Grande and brought across in truckloads to vote on the Americanside. Starr County was “an excellent location for bringing voters from across the border, a commentator notes. In Webb County, thesmall town of Dolores had about 100 American citizens — and insome elections recorded as many as 400 votes. Of course, in many instances, physical voters weren’t used at all. In precincts where the bosses had total control,such as the Salas-run Precinct 13 in Alice, they wouldsimply add to the tallysheet as many votes as their candidate needed. This was the case with thescandalous 200 votes, which were a product of Parr,seeing that Johnson wasstill about 150 votesshort a week after the Election, ordering Salas tosay that the Johnson vote count was not the 765 originally reported, but(one of Stevenson’s attorneys, whosaw the original tallysheet,said the “9” in the 965 had the appearance of having been a “7,” with a loop added to it to turn it into a “9”). The Johnson camp could afford all this thanks to the virtually unlimited financial resources of the interests who backed him, from Texas oil magnates to federal contractorssuch as Brown & Root to liberal Northeastern businessmen. Johnson’s 1948 Senate bid was, at the time, the most expensive campaign in the history of Texas. A ruling from Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black halted the trial and investigation of the fraud just minutes before the vote boxes whose contents would have proved the tampering of the count were to be opened in court. But those involved in thesteal later admitted the truth. Salas, for example, told Caro that he lied under oath and did, in fact, falsify votes for Johnson, opening for the Democrat “the road to reach the presidency of this country.”“This is history like it or not, nobody can erase these facts,” Salassaid. Theshocking turn of events of the 1948 Senate race in Texas was not unlike what Americans witnessed in the 2020 presidential race: A popular candidate appeared to have the contest all but wrapped up on Election Night; then, insubsequent days, that lead was gradually eroded as new ballots, overwhelminglyskewed in favor of his opponent, were “discovered” in precincts known for their corrupt politics. Then, as now, the reason for the delay in reporting is clear: The bosses instructed their elections officials not to report their tallies until the rest of thestate had already doneso, allowing them to know how many ballots they needed to fabricate. LBJ lost his first Senate bid in 1941 because, already in the lead, he mistakenly told Parr and company to report their results immediately, allowing opponent W. Lee O’Daniel’s men to falsify the right amount of votes to pushover the top. In 1948, turnout percentages in the 80s and 90s alerted observers to thescam. In 2020, cities responsible for Biden’s victory likewise had unprecedented turnout in the 80s and 90s. In 1948, the media, which largelysupported liberal and New Deal-supporter Johnson over conservative “neanderthal” Stevenson, took Johnson’s claims at face value and for years thereafter enshrined the narrative that the Stevenson camp were merelysore losers. And in 1948, as in 2020, the courts, all the way to the Supreme Court, ultimately failed to deliver justice. In the Johnson case, it was thanks to the brilliant political maneuvering of his army of lawyers and the local election officials he bought. A commonstalling tactic in court bysuch officials on the Johnsonside wassaying that they had conveniently “lost” the vote tallysheets and otherwise doing all they could to prevent an inspection of the original records — not unlike Democrat precincts today, where officials resist efforts to audit and have even moved to destroy records as quickly as possible. Those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. Sadly, due in part to a mass media and leftist academia that misinforms and dis informs the public, we failed to learn in time to prevent a repetition of 1948 on a much granderscale in 2020. Now, whether President Trump wins the fight or loses, Americans’ faith in the integrity of our electoralsystem has forever beenshattered.",0,0,The New American

575,Seeing Doug Emhoff as Second Gentleman Upends Masculinity—For the Best,-10.67,33.67,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a35278785/doug-emhoff-second-gentleman-masculinity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,16,"The response to one of the most patriarchal and overtly racist presidents in history didn’t just lead to the election of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first woman and person of color toserve in the role—it also led to the country getting to know Doug Emhoff, the first (of hopefully many) Second Gentleman in this nation’s history. Seeing a man in this role, which until now has only been filled by women, helps transform the very notion of masculinity. Truly! Because if a full gender revolution is to be achieved, it’s just as important for us tosee menserving insupport of women as it is tosee women thrive in leadership positions. Throughout time and especially in government, women have performed the undervalued and often invisible labor necessary for men to become leaders. Sure, that might mean taking care of the family and the house, but it also means performing the intense emotional labor ofsupportingsomeone with a front-facing role. Former First Lady Michelle Obamatalked about this with Oprah back in 2018saying, “When you get married and have kids, your whole plan, once again, gets upended…especially if you get married tosomebody who has a career thatswallows up everything.”President Obama echoed the toll it took on her in his book. “Despite Michelle’ssuccess and popularity, I continued tosense an undercurrent of tension in her,subtle but constant, like the faint thrum of a hidden machine,” the former president wrote. Simply put: Women have enabled men to become relentless movers andshakers for decades, and it’s well past time for dudes to return the favor in really public ways. Since the 2020 presidential campaigns began a million years ago, voters were able tosee more male partners than ever beforesupport theirspouses in this way. We witnessed Bruce Mann rally behind his wife, Senator Elizabeth Warren; John Besslerstand beside his wife, Senator Amy Klobuchar; Chasten Buttigieg become a beloved figure on his husband Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s campaign trail; Jonathan Gillibrandsupport his wife, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand; and Abraham Williamssmile alongside his wife Representative Tulsi Gabbard’s campaign. When Harris became Biden’s VP pick and then the VP-Elect, Emhoff announced that he would ditch his own career as an entertainment lawyer (he’ll teach a class at Georgetown Law) insupport of hers. Perhapsseeing a man as public as the Second Gentleman make these choices will make us value the legion of wives and partners who have been making them with little to no recognition forso long. As an author who has been on a quest to prove to men that freeing themselves from masculinity will ultimately make them happier, nothing brings me more joy thanseeing Emhoff notsimply embrace but also actively celebrate hissecondary role inservice to his wife. I freaking love when he doessmall things like post tenderself i es of their“couple time,”bud up with other dudessupporting theirspouses(hi, Chasten!), or chronicle her work adventures in the Senate with grainy pics that are not really even feed-worthy. (Still cute though.)Those are actions we really onlysee from women or “wife guys,” who arememe-ified into oblivion. But makingsure that the next generation of boys grows upseeing men perform all kinds of roles, not just the front-facing ones, is crucial for their emancipation as fully human men. Besides,slotting a man into a position traditionally reserved for a female, isn’t just good for boys tosee, it might make us take roles ofsupport moreseriously. When men experiencestruggles that womenshare, it inadvertently makes them more visible because oursociety inherently trusts and values the male experience. Sorry, but it’s true. Just look at the way men joining a certain industry makes the pay of that job increase. That’s why I’ve often argued that one of the most effective ways to increase thestature of professions like teaching and nursing would probably be for men tosimply join them. Thesame applies to Second Gentlemen. Both President Joe Biden and Emhoffsymbolize a new kind of masculinity that clashes not just with the Trump kind but also with his most vocal and violentsupporters. As a culture, we need to be just as excited about a man beingsupportive as we do about woman being assertive. Both are equally valid and valuable qualities weshould allstrive to develop no matter our gender. The pressure on men to choose one over the other issimply misery-producing and frankly boring. In the words of the first Second Gentleman, which hepennedfor, “I want them to grow up in a world where it isn’t news that a loving partner—of any gender—supports them in everything they do.”The point is clear: If we want more girls to become comfortable being firsts, we need to makesure we are teaching boys to be just as comfortable beingsecond.",1,0,Cosmopolitan

On Wednesday, after contracting the coronavirus, Lloyd, who hadserved with the Metropolitan Police Department for nearly 30 years, died at University Medical Center. He was 53.“Everyone knows Erik as the man thatshows up when tragedystrikes, whether it’s injury or a death,” Will Huddler, chairman of the Las Vegas Police Managers and Supervisors Association,said before learning of Lloyd’s death. “And now, it’s just this awkward feeling for the agency and all of us that Erik is the one who needs help. He’s always been there to help us.”In astatement from the Metropolitan Police Department, delivered as an Honor Guard led Lloyd’s body and a procession of police vehicles from the hospital to Palm Downtown Mortuary & Cemetery, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardosaid the department “is a better agency for having Erik.”“He was the type of officer who represents all the values you want in a person,” Lombardosaid in thestatement. “He was hardworking, honest, kind, and generous with his time. He created a legacy outside of his work here at LVMPD, working to help people in their greatest time of grief.”Lloyd was born in Downey, California, and issurvived by his wife of 22-years, Minddie, two daughters and five grandchildren, Metrosaid. Nevada Assemblyman Tom Roberts, who retired from Metro as assistantsheriff in 2018,shared news about Lloyd on Facebook.“RIP Erik. God bless you and your family,” Roberts wrote. “Honor to know you and work with you all these years. You’ll be missed byso many.”Lloyd’s wife, who works as the judicial executive assistant to District Judge William Kephart, also contracted the virus and hassince been released from the hospital, according to multiplesources. As the two battled the virus, the Police Wives of Southern Nevadalaunched a fund raiser tosupport the couple.‘Like asuperstrong flu’Kephartsaid he has known both for more than 20 years, oftenspending time together outside of work. Erik Lloyd and the judge, a former prosecutor, playedsoftball together and traveled across the country on fishing and hunting trips as Lloyd rose through the ranks of the police force. Kephart recalled how Lloyd, who hadsurvived a battle with throat cancer, told him the virus felt “like asuperstrong flu,” before his conditionsuddenly worsened, and he was rushed to the hospital a little over a week ago.“He always had control of himself and his life,” Kephartsaid. “That’s what’s kicking my butt is I think he thought he had this under control.”Through his leadership, Lloyd connected with other elected officials, too, like Clark County Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick.“Lt. Lloyd was an amazing officer whose work in our community helped countless families,”shesaid in astatement. “His passingshows us all the dangers of this virus and the importance of doing everything we can to fight it. Knowing the lieutenant is no longer with us makes my heart ache.”Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson learned of Lloyd’s death Wednesday.“It’s asad day for the Metro family, and the entire Las Vegas community as Erik was asuperb police officer, and a gentleman,” Wolfsonsaid. “And in all of my dealings with him he was the epitome of professionalism. He caredso much about his work, and he will be greatly missed.”As president of the Injured Police Officers Fundsince January 2004, Erik Lloyd coordinated fundraising efforts for wounded cops and their families, most recently organizing a “Shay Day” for 29-year-old Shay Mikalonis, who wasshot June 1 as police took people into custody at the conclusion of a Black Lives Matter Protest on the Las Vegas Strip.“I don’t know too many people who could do that for that long,” Huddlersaid. “But there’s never been any desire to look elsewhere. He puts forth genuine care for the men and women he works with, plus he’s good at what he does.”Lloyd joined the force as a patrol officer in September 1990 before hestarted work as a narcotics detective in 1995. He climbed the ranks tosergeant in 2003 and lieutenant in 2014, when he worked internal affairs and with the Southern Nevada Counterterrorism Center. He had planned to retire in December,said Annette Mullin, the director of the police employee assistance program.“Erik was one of those great leaders,”shesaid. “We have many on our agency, but he was one of those calm leaders that help you get the job done. And he will be missed. Our hearts break.”Last week, Congress passed a measure known as the Safeguarding America’s First Responder’s Act that provides benefit to law enforcement and presumes that officers who die or become disabled from COVID-19 or complications related to the virus didso in the line of duty. The results of Lloyd’s efforts for wounded and fallen officers are likely to resonate far into the future.“There will be more officers injured, and the groundwork that Erik has laid, they’re going to benefit from,” Huddlersaid. “They’ll have no idea. But we’ll know it’s because the work Erik has put in. He’s just aspecial guy.”Supervises deadly force examsLloyd alsoserved as the lieutenant over deadly force examinations, leading investigations whensomeone dies in police custody.“He’s the right person for the job because he has to be able to represent the community’s interest andstill do that in a way where the officers understand that his intent is to get it right,” Huddlersaid. “There isn’t anyone who wants police accountability more than police officers. The great thing about Erik is he never takes it personal. He’s just very objective about his work, and he’s very fact based, and it’s refreshing.”Huddlersaid he had known Lloyd for 18 years, and “I’ve always looked up to him,” recalling how Lloyd guided him through preparing to test for a promotion. “First and foremost, he is a family man. He loves his family,” Huddlersaid. “But a closesecond to that is he loves his community. He truly does represent the best of us. He’s a consummate professional. And I’ve never met a person that doesn’t respect him.”Since the Lloyds were diagnosed with the virus, Kephartsaid he has received hundreds of messages from concerned friends.“When you get the good ones, and you lose them like this, or for any reason, it’s just terrible,” the judgesaid. “Itstrikes home. He was a great guy. He’s gonna be missed by a lot of people. I don’t know if I can get passed the pain and the hurt that it’s causing me, and I don’t know if I will.”Contact David Ferrara atdferrara@reviewjournal.comor 702-380-1039.

580,How a recent surge in concern about child sex trafficking has links to online conspiracy community QAnon,-9.0,37.5,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/8/12/21353119/conspiracy-theory-qanon-link-connection-child-sex-trafficking-exploitation-social-media-advocacy,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-12,22,"SALT LAKE CITY — Advocacy against childsex trafficking hassurged in recent weeks with concerned individuals posting hash tags like #savethechildren,sharing images of young girls with their hands tied up captioned, “The real pandemic is childsex trafficking,” and even marching while chanting “Child Lives Matter.”Child exploitation is a widespread problem that has gotten worse during the pandemic, according to Marci Hamilton, founder and legal director ofCHILD USA, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia that is committed to ending child abuse and neglect. Shesaid her organization has “never been busier.”But an online conspiracy theory community called QAnon may be one of the main drivers of thissudden up tick in posts about child trafficking onsocial media,says Brian Friedberg,senior researcher at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. Freidberg worries that many people posting about the issue online may not be aware that QAnon conspiracy theorists have played a key role in making it go viral at this time. Members of the QAnon community, an unorganized group of individuals whosympathize with posts by an anonymous figure “Q”, believe the unsubstantiated claim that there is a global child trafficking ring run by powerful people in Hollywood and politics who use children assacrificial objects, either forsadistic pedophilia or to harvest a chemical compound found in blood called adrenochrome,said Friedberg. Other conspiracy theories pushed by the group touch on issues ranging from politics toscience. A common theme is that President Donald Trump is aware of thesecret evils in the world and working to fix them, Friedbergsaid. The recent wave of advocacy to end child trafficking, involving marches planned around July 30th’s World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, presents a more palatable view. But it is all ultimately rooted in QAnon,said Travis View, one of the hosts of a pod cast calledQAnon Anonymous.“The people who bind to the general vague, abstract ‘Save the Children’ message without being aware of its QAnon origins, is a new and interesting phenomenon,” Viewsaid. During the pandemic, interest in QAnon has exploded, as people arespending more time on the internet and grappling with overwhelming uncertainty,said View. Research byMarc-André Argentino, a Ph. D. candidate at Concordia University in Montreal,shows that in the last 22 weeks, the interaction rate on QAnon-related Facebook pages has increased 232%. Googlesearches, YouTubesearches and Twitter posts have allseen massive increases as well. Meanwhile, QAnon rhetoric isseeping into political discourse, Viewsaid. Well-known figures from Roseanne Barr toTrumphimself haveshared QAnon content. More than a dozen currentRepublican congressional candidates areself-avowed QAnonsympathizers. And while attention to the issue of child trafficking is undoubtedly a positive thing, View and Friedberg worry that certain postsshared by QAnonsupporters are meant to recruit people to the conspiratorial beliefsystem. At a time when misinformation, especially about the coronavirus, is rampant, a group like QAnon is particularly dangerous, theysaid.“This issomething QAnon followers often do, they point to the grain of truth within their own theory, then they extrapolate their entire deranged worldview,”said View. “It is a growing cult-like extremist movement that is roping in a lot of innocent people.”QAnon emerged in October 2017 when the anonymous figure dubbed “Q” posted on the website 4chan in a thread about the Mueller investigation. Q claimed to have high-level governmentsecurity clearance and insider information about the imminent arrest of Hillary Clinton, according to Friedberg. Q gained legitimacy, despite the fact that Clinton’s arrest never came to pass, and developed a following by frequently posting cryptic messages called “Q drops” for people to decipher. After being kicked off of 4chan, moving to 8chan and finally ending up on a website called 8kun, Q continues to post. There have been more than 4,000 Q dropssince 2017. But to this day, no one knows who Q is. The QAnon community, however,stretches far beyond those who use 8kun, and its philosophies encompass numerous conspiracy theories without direct links to Q’s posts,said James Tabery, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Utah, who hasstudied conspiracy thinking. Rather, QAnon is a network of people across platforms whosympathize with Q’s messages that there there is a deep-state cabalset on exploiting the good people of the world and undermining Trump’s presidency. The “pizzagate” conspiracy acted as aspringboard for QAnon,said Tabery. That debunked rumor, which gainedsteam during the 2016 presidential election, accused Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking Democratic Party officials of operating a childsex-trafficking ring with the cooperation of restaurants like Comet Ping Pong Pizzeria in Washington, D. C. It culminated in Edgar Maddison Welch, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina, traveling to the restaurant armed with an AR-15style rifle in an attempt to rescue the alleged childsexslaves. He was arrested after firing threeshots, and no one was injured. More recently, the arrest and death of convictedsex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2019 and the arrest of his alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell this year, havestoked the flames of QAnon’s belief in a mass network of powerful people participating in a human traffickingscheme, Taberysaid. Dozens of women have come forwardsaying they weresexually abused by Epstein, including many who havesaid they were underage at the time and were also abused by Epstein’s friends. But while QAnon’s theories about internationalsex trafficking may be mingled with truth,speculation doesn’tstop there. Somesympathizers have pushed unfounded theories that John F. Kennedy isstill alive, that Trump planned the Mueller probe in order to mobilize personnel and investigative resources that would uncover Democrats’ wrong-doing, and that figures like Bill Gates and Bill Clinton are responsible for the coronavirus.“Part of what’s difficult about trying to characterize QAnon is that it isso amorphous,”said Tabery. “Ask 10 different QAnonsympathizers what they believe, and you will get 10 different answers.”Viewsaid that QAnon is more than asingle conspiracy, it’s an entire beliefsystem or way of thinking that people buy into.“The general principle of QAnon is that whatever the mainstream narrative is, whateverscience or the medical authorities issaying, is really a front, and the truth issomething worse and moresinister,” Viewsaid. Children are more at risk of exploitation than ever before,said Hamilton. That’s because they arespending more unstructured time on the Internetsince normalschooling andsummer activities have been canceled due to the coronavirus,shesaid.“Children have never been more available to people who prey on them online,” Hamiltonsaid. She declined to comment on QAnon. Sarah Bendtsen, policy counsel for Shared Hope International, which is based in Vancouver Washington and focusses on ending childsex trafficking,said that high-profile criminal cases, like Jeffrey Epstein’s, and conspiratorial accusations — like that Wayfair was using overpriced cabinets as a front forselling children — have brought increased public attention to the issue ofsex trafficking.“It’s kind of a dance between a real present threat and invalid coverage of trafficking, but it’sstill gone mainstream particularly onsocial media,”said Bendtsen. “I think it’s an unprecedented time of the whole country trying to figure out how to ensure the well-being of children.”While the Wayfair conspiracy originated on Reddit, according toSnopes, QAnon was one of the main amplifiers of the theory,said Friedberg. In general, the QAnon community has capitalized on the growing concern about child trafficking, hesaid.“All of us can agree, everyone is againstsex trafficking,”said Steven Smallpage, assistant professor of politicalscience at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, who is an expert in conspiracy theories. “The hook is, ‘Given that you thinksex trafficking is evil, let’s punish the people (allegedly Democrats) who do it.’ That’s where QAnon takes the reins.”On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it is awarding more than $35 million in Justice Department grants to organizations that help victims of human trafficking. While the move was widely praised,some people, including Smallpage,see it as a way to distract from domestic problems, including racial tension and the Black Lives Matter movement.“A lot of it just fertile ground for conservative politics to take a verysalient, charged,symbolic issue to change the narrative away from the economy, domesticstrife and the pandemic,” Smallpagesaid. Hamiltonsaid it issad that anyone would use thesuffering of children to advance their interests. “Children can’t be protected if what we’re doing is obsessing about politics.”Experts agree that the biggest threat QAnon poses is inspreading disinformation, particularly in relation to the coronavirus. According to View, QAnon networks haveserved as an accelerant for anti-mask and anti-vaccine propaganda. QAnon followers had a “huge hand” in promoting the “Plandemic” documentary, whichspread numerous unsupported claims about COVID-19 being a money-makingscheme, as well as the America’s Frontline Doctors video, in which a physician proclaimed that hydroxy chloroquine is a cure for the coronavirus, Viewsaid. Both videos were removed bysocial mediasites including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, but their alleged “censorship” onlyserved to bolster QAnon claims that powers that be are working to hide the truth, according to View.“QAnon is ramping up and exacerbating unbelievable levels of distrust insociety. You need to understand QAnon as asymptom of a hyper-partisan, distrustfulsociety. That’s what generatessomething like QAnon, it feeds back and contributes to it,”said Tabery. A recent poll fromGallup and the Knight Foundationshows distrust in mediasources is at an all-time high. Even though the FBI has designated QAnon as asource of domestic terrorism, and there have been a handful of instances where QAnonsupporters have come into contact with law enforcement (like whenMatthew Wrightfrom Arizonastopped traffic on the Hoover Dam Bridge with an armored truck), Taberysays physical threats posed by QAnonsupporters pale in comparison to the dangerous ideas theyspread.“We live uncertain times,” hesaid. “What QAnonspecifically does is it really brushes aside any moral ambiguity and it brushes aside any uncertainty, and it makes things very black and white. There is good and there is evil. You are either team Trump and yousupport his vision, or you are part of the deepstate and you’re trying to undermine his election.”One of QAnon’s catch phrases is, “Where we go one, we go all.” The group looks forward to a day of reckoning where all the world’s evil will be exposed, and many experts have likened it to a cult.“It becomes a tribal identity,”said Smallpage. “It no longer really matters who or what Q was in the beginning. It’sso far beyond that.”",1,2,Deseret News

Wade. Now, with the election of Joe Biden to the White House, the future of reproductive health and abortion rights may be pushed to the forefront of the new administration's agenda. Though his views on a woman's right to choose have evolved over the years, Bidenrecentlysaid, ""Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every womanshould have that right.""Here's where the presidentstands on abortion and what he has planned. Now in the White House, Biden is expected to overturn many Trump-era decisions, including the restrictions on abortion rights,reported. He has voiced plans to nominate federal judges whosupport Roe v. Wade and would ""support a federalstatute legalizing abortion if the Supreme Court’s conservative majoritystrikes down Roe,"" according to theAP. On January 28, just a weeksince beingsworn in to office, President Bidensigned an executive order that officially repealed Trump'sglobal gag rule, which restricts health organizations around the world from receiving U. S. assistance if they perform abortions or provide information about the procedure as a form of family planning.""The best way to describe [the executive orders] is to undo the damage Trump has done,"" Bidensaid in the Oval Office on Thursday, perBuzzFeed News. ""The memorandum reverses my predecessor's attack on women's health access, as we continue to battle COVID-19 it's even more critical Americans have meaningful access to health care.""Biden has also previously expressed that he wants to reverse the Trump administration's domestic gag rule, which restricts providers that offer abortion referrals from receiving Title X family planning funds. In 2019, Planned Parenthoodopted out of the Title X program over complying with the rule. Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump can enforce this rule, but the restriction has been blocked in Maryland. Inhis plan for health care, Bidensaid that he wants to build on the progress made by the Affordable Care Act, which covers access to preventive care and contraceptives. He proposes that ""the public option will cover contraception and a woman’s constitutional right to choose.""However,since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has blocked public funding of abortion under Medicaid, except in cases of incest or rape, or if the pregnancy is a danger to the mother's life, according to theKeiser Family Foundation. It's not a federal law, but rather a rule added to the annual Congressspending bill, which is approved every year. According to his plan, Bidensupports repealing the amendment. Biden made headlines for dropping hissupport of the Hyde Amendment last year amid criticism from his Democratic rivals in the primary race. ""If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longersupport an amendment that makes that right dependent onsomeone's ZIP code,""hesai din June 2019, when he made the change. He added that he had ""no apologies"" for his previousstance. And that's not the first time Biden'sstance on abortion has changed over the years—especially during his time in the Senate.pointed out, ""In 1981, hesupported a constitutional amendment that would enablestates to overturnRoe v. Wade. In his 2007 book,Promises to Keep,he wrote that while he is 'personally opposed to abortion,' he didn't feel he had the 'right to impose [his] view on the rest ofsociety.'""In 2006, Biden called himself the ""odd man out"" of his party, because he did notsupport federal funding for abortion and voted for bans on the procedure later in pregnancy,CNN revealed in a resurfaced video last year.""I do not vote for funding for abortion,"" hesaid, per CNN. ""I voted against partial birth abortion—to limit it—and I vote for no restrictions on a woman's right to be able to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade. And,so I am—I made everybody angry. I made the right-to-life people angry because I won'tsupport a constitutional amendment or limitations on a woman's right to exercise her constitutional right as defined by Roe v. Wade. And I've made the groups—the women's groups and others—very angry because I won'tsupport public funding and I won'tsupport partial birth abortion.""""As president, Biden will work to codify Roe v. Wade, and his Justice Department will do everything in its power tostop the rash ofstate laws thatso blatantly violate the constitutional right to an abortion,such asso-calledTRAP laws[or targeted restrictions on abortion providers], parental notification requirements, mandatory waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements,"" Biden's planstates. The Supreme Court ruling of Roe v. Wade in 1973 made abortion legal in the United States, butstates werestill able to place restrictions on the procedure. At thisstage,more than 20statesare poised to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Just this year,states likeFlorida and Mississippihave implemented abortion limitations. The former vice presidentsaid that he wants to ""codify"" Roe v. Wade, as it isn't included in the Constitution. In an NBC town hall, Biden addressed the possibility of Judge Amy Coney Barrett overturning Roe v. Wade ifshe is confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice. ""Number one, we don’t know exactly whatshe will do, although expectation is thatshe may very well move to [overrule] Roe,"" hesaid. ""And the only thing, the only responsible response to that would be to pass legislation making Roe the law of the land. That’s what I would do.""The former VP made this announcement in his health care plan, citing how the Obama–Biden administration repeatedly ""fought Republican attacks"" on the organization. For example, during Obama's final months in the White House before Trump'sswearing in, his administration passed a regulationsaying thatstates with federal funding for family planning can't discriminate against Planned Parenthood and providers like it. Bidensaid he will release guidance to keepstates from blocking Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, as well as reverse Trump's domestic gag rule. The organization announced its official endorsement of Biden for president in June.""Joe Biden is the only candidate in this race who willstand up for our health and our rights,"" acting president Alexis McGill Johnsonsaid in astatement. ""He was instrumental in the creation of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded birth control with no co-pay to 63 million women, and in helping to ensure thatsexual and reproductive health care was accessible across the country. He hasspoken out for LGBTQ+ rights, and against thesystemic racism in this country that is costing Black people their lives. Biden has committed to champion access tosexual and reproductive health care — including access to abortion — and to fight for our communities. When he left the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden had a 100% voting record from Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and has been clear he is ‘100% forsexual and reproductive health.’ And we are going to hold him to that.""Read more of Planned Parenthood's endorsement of Bidenhere. According toThe New York Times, President Trump opposes Roe v. Wade andsupports the Hyde Amendment, directly countering his opponent on these issues. The president also wants to restrict access to mifepristone and misoprostol, medications that induce abortions withoutsurgery up to 10 weeks into pregnancy. Biden doesn’t explicitly address medication abortion, but has called the general procedure an “essential healthservice,” per NYT. President-elect Biden also opposes—and plans to reverse—Trump’s gag rules that withhold federal funding for family planning for organizations that give abortion referrals.""As we celebrate today, we are beginning a new chapter: one where we take full control of our bodies, our rights, our democracy, and our futures,""said Alexis McGill Johnson, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in astatement. ""The work does not end, because our fight to protect and expand health care for millions of Planned Parenthoodsupporters, patients, and global partners cannot let up for even a moment. Voters’ voices were loud and clear, and they elected a new president, who is fully committed to protecting access tosexual and reproductive health care—including access to abortion.""Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, whereshe oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

583,"Study: $15 Minimum Wage Would Cause 400,000 New Crimes Per Year",14.5,36.5,https://freebeacon.com/issues/study-15-minimum-wage-would-cause-400000-new-crimes-per-year/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-free-beacon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"A $15 per hour minimum wage would lead to $2.4 billion in property crimes, anew paper released Monday argues. The paper directly contradicts past arguments, most prominently from the Obama-era Council of Economic Advisers, that raising the minimum wage would reduce crime rates. Rather, the authors find, an increase to the minimum wage drives up property crime rates among 16-to-24-year-olds, the group most likely to be working for minimum wage already. Myriad factors determine whether or not people choose to commit crimes,including economic ones. Access to jobs,steady income, and education, can all influence whether or not a person begins a career as a criminal. This has a practical implication for policymakers looking to reduce crime: In addition to expensive interventions like increasing incarceration or the number of cops, enhancing labor market access and outcomes might be an effective approach. This insight is the basis for an argument put forward by the Council of Economic Advisers under then-President Barack Obama in 2016. As part of a broader overview of economics and the criminal justicesystem, the CEA conducted a ""back-of-the-envelope"" analysis and concluded that raising the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 would cut the crime rate by 3 to 5 percent—equivalent to 250,000 to 510,000 crimes. However, there is a problem with this approach. Although the minimum wage increases take-home wages forsome workers, it also leads to reduced hours and job loss among workers. This is especially true for those whoseskill level who puts the market value of their labor below the floor imposed by the minimum wage—asituation which increasingly encourages the replacement of people with robots. These effects, especially when they fall on otherwise low-skill Americans, may actually lead to a net increase in the amount of crime following a minimum wage hike. This could be because a lost job or hours could lead to petty larceny to get by; because the emotional impact of losing a job could be expressed in criminal behavior; or because of lost human-capital benefits thanks to a hike's effect onschool enrollment and on-the-job training. The new paper, ""Do Minimum Wage Increases Reduce Crime?"" attempts to quantify the reality of the CEA's claim, and whether or not it is drowned out by adverse effects. The results are not heartening for minimum-wage advocates. The authors, a group of economists, estimate that a minimum wage hike to $12 would result in approximately 231,000 additional property crimes annually, equivalent to costs of $1.3 billion. A $15 minimum wage would result in 410,000 additional property crimes, equivalent to $2.4 billion in costs.""We find little evidence that minimum wage increases affect violent or drug crimes, or net crime among older individuals, but do increase delinquency-related crimes related to teenage idleness,"" the authors write. ""We conclude that increasing the minimum wage will at best be ineffective at deterring crime and at worst will have unintended consequences that increase property crime among young adults.""To reach these conclusions, the paper's authors rely on county-level arrest records from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reportingsystem. To these records, they add information on minimum wage increases between 1998 and 2016 by county,state, and federal law, in order to exploit the way that the minimum wage has changed in different places at different times. Using these figures andstandardstatistical methods, the authors estimate the effect of the minimum wage level on the crime rates of 16-to-24 year-olds in each county and year, the group on which changes in the minimum wage has the most impact, and who are most crime-prone. They also compare their results for that age-group against those over 25. The results of their analysis with the UCR indicate that there is astatisticallysignificant effect of a higher minimum wage on increasing property crime arrests, but neither drug nor violent crime arrests. These effects are consistentlysignificant among 16-to-24-year-olds, not among those 25 and over. They are mostsignificant in urban counties (those with 100,000+ population), and do not varysignificantly across races. Importantly, most of the crime increase among 16-to-24-year-olds is driven by an increase in petty larceny; the authors find no evidence that minimum wage hikes affect other types of property crimes or any violent crimes. In addition to the UCR, thestudy usessurvey data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which tracks the wage levels and criminal behavior of a cohort of respondentssurveyed regularly from their adolescence in 1997. Using these data, the authors also identify an increased likelihood of engaging in property crimes among 16-to-24-year-olds affected by the minimum wage. Similar,smaller effects for minimum-wage-exposed people over 25 further reject the CEA's claim that a minimum wage hike will cut crime. Rather, the authorssuggest, pushing up the minimum wage encourages the young people most likely to be affected by the hike—through fewer hours and less employment—to opt to engage in petty larceny.""Together, the findings from thisstudysuggest that, in contrast to the CEA claim, higher minimum wages are unlikely to be an effective tool to fight net crime,"" they conclude.

584,The Journalistic Tattletale and Censorship Industry Suffers Several Well-Deserved Blows,16.0,35.67,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-journalistic-tattletale-and-censorship,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,16,"journalistic “beat” has arisen over the lastseveral years that can best be described as an unholy mix of junior high hall-monitor tattling and Stasi-like citizensurveillance. It is half adolescent and half malevolent. Its primary objectives are control, censorship, and the destruction of reputations for fun and power. Though its epicenter is the largest corporate media outlets, it is the very antithesis of journalism. I’vewritten before about one particularly toxicstrain of this authoritarian “reporting.” Teams of journalists at three of the most influential corporate media outlets —’s “media reporters” (Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy),NBC’s “disinformationspace unit” (Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny), and the tech reporters ofThe New York Times(Mike Isaac, Kevin Roose, Sheera Frenkel) — devote the bulk of their “journalism” tosearching for onlinespaces where they believespeech and conduct rules are being violated, flagging them, and then pleading that punitive action be taken (banning, censorship, content regulation, after-school detention). These hall-monitor reporters are a major factor explaining why tech monopolies, which (for reasons ofself-interest and ideology) never wanted the responsibility to censor, now doso with abandon andseemingly arbitrary blunt force: they areshamed by the world’s loudest media companies when they do not. Just as the NSA is obsessed with ensuring there beno place on earth where humans can communicate free of theirspying eyes and ears, these journalistic hall monitors cannot abide the idea that there can be any place on the internet where people are free tospeak in ways they do not approve. Likesome creepy informant for astatesecurity apparatus, theyspend their days trolling the depths of chat rooms and 4Chan bulletin boards andsub-Reddit threads and private communications ap ps to find anyone — influential or obscure — who issayingsomething they believeshould be forbidden, and then use the corporate megaphones they did not build and could not have built but have been handed in order tosilence and destroy anyone who dissents from the orthodoxies of their corporate managers or challenges their information hegemony. Oliver Darcy has built his CNN career bysitting around with Brian Stelterpetulantly pointing to people breaking the rules onsocial media and demanding tech executives make the rule-breakers disappear. The little crew of tattletale millennia ls assembled by NBC — who refer to their twerp y work with theself-glorifying title of “working in the disinformationspace”: as intrepid and hazardous as exposing corruption by repressive regimes or reporting from war zones —spend their dreary daysscrolling through 4Chan boards to expose the offensive mem es and bad words used by transgressive adolescents; they then pat themselves on the back for confronting dangerous power centers, even when it is nothing more trivial and bullying than do xx ing the identities ofpowerless, obscure citizens. But the worst of this triumvirate is the tech reporters, due to influence and reach if no other reason. When Silicon Valley monopolies,publicly pressured by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and other lawmakers, united to remove Parler from the internet, the Times’ tech team quickly donned their hall-monitor goggles and Stasi notebooks to warn that the Bad People had migrated to Signal and Telegram. This week they asked:“Are Private Messaging Apps the Next Misinformation Hot Spot?” One reporter “confess[ed] that I am worried about Telegram. Other than private messaging, people love to use Telegram for group chats — up to 200,000 people can meet inside a Telegram chat room. Thatseems problematic.”These examples of journalism being abused to demand censorship ofspaces they cannot control are too numerous to comprehensively chronicle. And they are not confined to those three outlets. That far more robust censorship is urgently needed is now a virtual consensus in mainstream corporate journalism: it’s an animating cause for them.""Those of us in journalism have to come to terms with the fact that freespeech, a principle that we holdsacred, is being weapon i zed against the principles of journalism,""complainedUltimate Establishment Journalism MavenSteve Coll, the Dean of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism and a Staff Writer at. ANew YorkerandVoxcontributor who runs a major journalistic listserv appropriately called “Study Hall,” Kyle Chayka, has already begunshaming Substackfor hosting writers he regards as unacceptable (Jesse Singal, Andrew Sullivan, Bari Weiss). A recentGuardianarticlewarnedthat pod casts was one remaining areastill insufficiently policed. ProPublicaon Sundaydid thesame about Apple, and last month one of its reporters appeared on MSNBCto demand that Apple censor its pod cast content as aggressively as Google’s YouTube now censors its video content. Thus do we have the unimaginably warped dynamic in which U. S. journalists are not the defenders of freespeech values but the primary crusaders to destroy them. They do it in part for power: to ensure nobody but they can control the flow of information. They do it partly for ideology and out of hubris: the belief that their world view isso indisputably right that all dissent is inherently dangerous “disinformation.” And they do it from petty vindictiveness: they clearly get aroused — find otherwise-elusive purpose — by destroying people’s reputations and lives, no matter how powerless. Whatever the motive, corporate media employees whose company title is “journalist” are the primary activists against a free and open internet and the core values of free thought.driving all of this were on full display on Saturday night as the result of a reckless andself-humiliatingsmear campaign by one ofstar tech reporters, Taylor Lorenz. She falsely and very publicly accused Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen of having used the “slur” word “retarded” during a discussion about the Reddit/GameStop uprising. Lorenz lied. Andreessen never used that word. And rather than apologize and retract it,she justified her mistake by claiming it was a “male voice” thatsounded like his, then locked her Twitter account as though— rather than the personshe falsely maligned — was the victim. But the details of what happened are revealing. The discussion which Lorenz falsely described took place on a relatively new audio app called “Clubhouse,” an invitation-only platform intended to allow for private, free-ranging group conversations. It has become popular among Silicon Valley executives and various media personalities (I was invited onto the app a few months ago but never attended or participated in any discussions). But as noted this week, “as the app has grown, people of more diverse backgrounds have begun to join,” and it “has carved out a niche among Black users, who have innovated new ways for using it.” Its free-speech ethos has also made it increasingly popular in China as a means of avoiding repressive online constraints. These private chats have often been infiltrated by journalists,sometimes by invitation and other times by deceit. These journalists attempt to monitor the discussions and then publishsummaries. Often, the “reporting” consists of out-of-contextstatements designed to make the participants lookbigoted,insensitive, or otherwise guilty of bad behavior. In other words, journalists, desperate for content, have flagged Clubhouse as a new frontier for theirslimy work as voluntary hall monitors andspeech police. Fulfilling her ignoble duties there, Lorenz announced on Twitter that Andreessen hadsaid a bad word. During the discussion of the “Reddit Revolution,”she claimed, he used the word “retarded.” She then upped her tattling game by not only including this allegation but also the names and photos of those who were in the room at the time — thus exposing those who were guilty of the crime of failing to object to Andreessen’s Bad Word:Numerous Clubhouse participants, including Kmele Foster, immediately documented that Lorenz had lied. The moderator of the discussion, Nait Jones,saidthat “Marc never used that word.” What actually happened was that Felicia Horowitz, a different participant in the discussion, had “explained that the Redditors call themselves ‘retard revolution’” and that was the only mention of that word. Rather than apologizing and retracting, Lorenz thanked Jones for “clarifying,” and then emphasized how hurtful it is to use that word. She deleted the original tweet without comment, and then — with thesmear fully realized — locked her account. Besides the fact that are porter recklessly tried to destroysomeone’s reputation, what is wrong with this episode?Everything. The participants in Clubhouse have tried to block these tattletale reporters from eavesdropping on their private conversations precisely because theysee themselves as Stasi agents whose function is to report people for expressing prohibited ideas even in private conservations. As Jones pointedly noted, “this is why people block” journalists: “because of this horseshit dishonesty.”One reporter, Jessica Lessin, recently complainedshe was blocked by Andreessen from his Clubhouse discussions — as ifshe has the divine right to monitor people’s communications. And Lorenz herself has been obsessed with monitoringClubhouse discussions in general and Andreessen in particular for months, mocking him just last week whenshe obtained a fake credential to enter:Just take asecond to ponder how infantile and despotic, in equal parts, all of this is. Thisreporter used her platform to virtually jump out of her desk to run to the teacher and exclaim:he used the r word!This is whatshe tried for months to accomplish: to catch people in private communications using words that are prohibited or ideas that are banned to tell on them to the public. Thatshe got it all wrong is arguably the least humiliating and pathetic aspect of all of this. Beyond all this, what if he used the word “retarded”? What would it mean? Ifsomeone uses that term maliciously, as aslur against others to mock their intellect, it is certainly reasonable to condemn that. Used with that intent and in that context, it is unnecessarily hurtful for people whosuffer diseases of cognitive impairment. But that is not remotely what happened here. Anyone whospent any time at all on thesub-Reddit thread of r/WallStreetBets knows that “retards” was thesingle most common term used by those whoshort-squeezed the hedge funds invested in the collapse of GameStop. It is virtually impossible to discuss the ethos of thatsubculture without using that term. Thiswas one of their most popular battlecries:“We canstay retarded longer than you canstaysolvent.”And the use of that term in thesub-Reddit was not just ubiquitous but fascinating: layered with multiple levels of irony andself-deprecation. Sociologists could, andshould,study how that term was deployed by those Redditors and what role it played in forming the community that enabled them tostrike a blow against these hedge funds. It reflected theirself-perceived place at the bottom ofsocial hierarchies, expressed the irony that they as unsophisticated investors were defeatingself-perceived financial wizards, and marked their culture and community as transgressive. Didsome use it with malice? Maybe. But there was vast complexity to it. To declare any discussion of that term off-limits — as Lorenz tried to do — is deeply anti-intellectual. To pretend that there is no difference in the use of that term by the Redditors and its discussion in Clubhouse on the one hand, and its malicious deployment as an insult to the cognitively disabled on the other, is dishonest in the extreme. To publicly tattle on adults who utter the term without any minimal attempt to understand or convey context and intent is malicious, disgusting andsociopathic.the prevailing ethos in corporate journalism. They have insufficient talent orskill, and even less desire, to take on real power centers: the military-industrial complex, the CIA and FBI, the clandestinesecuritystate, Wall Street, Silicon Valley monopolies, the corrupted and lying corporate media outlets theyserve. Sosettling on this penny-ante, trivial bullshit — tattling, hall monitoring,speech policing: all in the most anti-intellectual, adolescent and primitive ways — is all they have. It’s all they are. It’s why they have fully earned the contempt and distrust in which the public holds them. ShareThesamestunted mentality just resulted in the destruction of the career and reputation of Lorenz’s far more accomplished colleague,science reporter Donald McNeil. On a 2019 field trip for rich highschool kids to Peru, he used the “n-word” after astudent asked him whether he thought it was fair that one of her classmates was punished for having used it in a video. McNeil used it not with malice or as a racist insult but to inquire about the facts of the videoso he could answer thestudent’s question. Aftersenior editors — including African-American editor-in-chief Dean Baquet — investigated and concluded that “only” a reprimand was appropriate — “it did not appear to me that his intentions were hateful or malicious,”said Baquet — dozens of McNeil’s colleagues wrote a furious letter demanding far moresevere punishment. “Our community is outraged and in pain,”said the 150 Times employee-signatories, adding: “intent is irrelevant.”Intent is irrelevant when judging how harshly to punish thisstoried journalist for uttering this word. They got what they wanted. McNeil wrote agrovelling, abject apology, and then the announced he was gone from his job after forty-five years with the paper, including for COVID reporting over the last year that the paper hadsubmitted for a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Just think about that:New York Timesemployees, who are unionized, demanded that management punish a fellow union member more harshly than management wanted to. In 2002, McNeilwon the 1st place prize from the National Association of Black Journalists for excellence in his reporting on how the AIDS crisis was affecting Africa. Now his forty-five-year career and reputation are destroyed — at the hands of his own colleagues — because “intent is irrelevant” when using off-limit words. The overarching rule of liberal media circles and liberal politics is that you are free to accuse anyone who deviates from liberal orthodoxy of any kind of bigotry that casually crosses your mind — justsmear them as a racist, misogynist, homophobe, transphobe, etc. without theslightest need for evidence — and it will be regarded as completely acceptable. That is the rubric under which the most famous lawyer of the ACLU, an organization once devoted to rigid precepts of due process, decided on Saturday to brand two of his ideological opponents as “closely aligned with whitesupremacists.” Fresh off being namedbyMagazine as one of the planet’s 100 most influential human beings — this issomeone with a great deal of power and influence — trans activist and ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio decided tos pew this extremely grave accusation about J. K. Rowling and Abigail Shrier, both of whom oppose the inclusion of trans girls in femalesports:As I’vewritten before, I’m not in agreement with those who advocate this absolute ban. I’m open to ascientific consensus that develops hormonal and other medicinal protocols for how trans girls and women can fairly compete with CIS women insporting competitions. But that does not entitle you — especially as an ACLU lawyer — to just go around casually branding people as “closely aligned to whitesupremacists” who have never remotely demonstrated anysuch affinity, just because you feel like it, because you crave the power to destroy your adversaries, or are tooslothful to engage their actual views. But this is absolutely acceptable behavior in mainstream and liberal circles. I justspent the week being widely branded by these kinds of people as a “misogynist” —someone who— because I criticized and mocked Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez for herscornful rejection of the offer from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to work with her to investigate Robinhood’s conduct in the GameStop affair. I particularly critiqued her ludicrous accusation to Cruz that “you almost had me murdered” — a claim that even CNN’s “fact-checker” Daniel Dale, who would rather poke out his own eyes than conclude that a popular Democrat has lied —said was without evidence because “Cruz did not advocate violence against Ocasio-Cortez, much less call for her murder.”AOC is a popular and powerful politician, and journalists are allowed to criticize and mocksuch people. It’s our job. Yet for doing mine, I was casually and widely cast as asexist hater of women (ironically, an old homophobic trope long deployed against gay men) by the likes of Ashley Reese(“just baldly misogynistic”) of(which really ought to just change its name toYou’re a Misogynist,since it has no other content) and long-time Media Matters and David Brocksmear artistEric Boelhert(“Greenwald’s hatred of women knows no bounds”). That I was one of AOC’s first and most activesupporters back in 2018 whenshe ran against incumbent Joe Crowley — when people like Reese and Boelhert had not even heard of her — and that I have defended her more times than I can count, while also criticizing her on occasion, obviously goes unmentioned and does not matter (for those asking why Isupported her, Iinterviewed AOCduring her primary run andshe gave impressive answers now unrecognizable from her politics). Mysupport of AOC in 2018 wassimultaneous with my misogynisticsupport for Cynthia Nixon for New York Governor and Zephyr Teachout for Attorney General. Was my misogyny hidden then, or did it just recently develop? There’s no reason to interrogate any of this. It does not deserve that. There’s zero rationality let alone evidence to this tactic. It’s just driven byspite andstupidity and vindictiveness. I can ignore these kinds of accusatorysmears, orscorn and ridicule them and their practitioners — and I do — because they have no power over me. But consider how many people in journalism or other professions whose positions are lesssecure are rightly terrorized by these lowlife tactics, intimidated intosilence and conformity. They know if they express views these Stasi agents and their bosses dislike, their reputations can be instantly destroyed. So they remainsilent or pliant out of necessity. That’s the purpose, the function, of these lowly accusatory tactics: to control, to coerce, to dominate, to repress. The people who engage in these character-assassinating, censorship-fostering games — especially those who call themselves “journalists” — deserve nothing but intensescorn. And those who are free from their influence and power have a particular obligation to heap it on them. Aside from being what it deserves, thatscorn is the only way to neutralize this tactic.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald

In a viral tweet that hassince been deleted, Thomas wrote, “It hurts toseeso many Black people choosing not to watch the Olympics this year. … There areso many Black athletes who have put in YEARS of hard work for this moment — myself included. We want yoursupport.”“I worrysome of the anger and disdain may be misplaced,”she continued. “The ‘Olympics’ and those at the IOC have nothing to do with current events taking place.”Thomas’ points reflect the contradictions that further complicate an already complex debate about Black participation in whitespaces. Thomas’ latter pointseems to refer to the widespread backlash against theanti-doping ruling that dashed the Olympic dreams of the magnetic21-year-oldsprinter Sha'Carri Richardson. (Richardson tested positive for THC, the chemical in marijuana, whichshe admittedsmoking to cope with the recent death of her biological mother.)Another contentiousanti-doping-related ruling resulted in a five-year Olympics ban for McNeal, 29, a hurdling gold medalist poised for hersecond Olympic Games. (Her case centered on a 2020 drug test McNeal claimedshe missed while recovering from an abortion.)It can be hard to push institutions to change without turning athletes into collateral damage. Nzingha Prescod, a two-time Olympian and an advocate for racial andsocial justice on the USA Fencing board of directors, admitted that navigating circumstances like those that led to Richardson’s rulings can be “very tough” for athletes.“When your lifestyle is, like, goes one way, when the rules go this way, it's hard to coordinate thatsometimes,”she told me during a recent phone call, adding, “And yeah, it's reallysad.”But Prescod alsosaid that Richardson and McNeal’s cases are high-profile examples of a policy that has affected hundreds of equally hopeful athletes. “It'd be unfair for them to change the rule for Sha’Carri when, you know,so many other athletes have had to lose theirshot,”shesaid. Richardson was not personally discriminated against, whether or not you feel the broader policy was discriminatory. But her case certainly has added to the feeling that Black elite athletes face an uphill battle. On the other hand, as the award-winningsports journalist and author Howard Bryant told me in an email, it can be hard to push institutions to change without turning athletes into collateral damage. This touches on the even trickier complication addressed in Thomas’ first tweet, which is how to protest anti-Black discrimination and biases inspaces and institutions that nonetheless provide financial andsocial capital to Black individuals. At the center of this debate is the ideal of “the Black athlete,” an individual and — tosome — a representative of the Black community. At the center of this debate is the ideal of “the Black athlete,” an individual and — tosome — a representative of the Black community. Sub “actor” or “writer” for “athlete” and you’ll find asimilar debate relating to a variety of predominantly white culturalspaces and ceremonies like the Grammys, the Oscars and The Emmys. It’s even cropped up in noncompetitivespaces that yield cultural and financial capital, like TikTok. Nuances of this ongoing conundrum can be found in an illuminating discussionstarted bystoryteller and multi hyphenate creatorNaima Cochrane. Respondents noted how tricky it can be to balance the good of the collective and the good of the individual. Athletes (and actors, for that matter) may also feel differently given their own conflicts of interest. Beforesaying ""Weshould boycott the Olympics...""There are 60 or more Black people on the US Olympic T&F team. Over 25 women. Some having both their first and last games (like Alyson Felix).4 BM in men's boxing, 3 BW in women's boxing, 1 BW in rugby (!), 2 BW insoccer... This last point raises a critical contradiction between performative (albeit good intentioned) virtuesignaling online and direct effective action. In aseparate butsimilar example, I’ve publiclyspoken out about thesystemic issues of anti-Black racism throughout media and privately (in those group chats — if you know, you know) called for Black journalists to boycott predominately white publications until these issues are adequately resolved. And yet, I’ve yet to walk it like I talk it — because I understand where the reach and resources that allow my own reporting and writing on Black communities lie, no matter how unjust that reality is. Working and protesting within thesystem is easier on the part of my brain thatstrategizes my future. But it is also taxing on my integrity, my values and my hopes for Black liberation. (For anyone elsestruggling with this tension, I highly recommend reading Zakiya Dalila Harris’ new novel, “The Other Black Girl.”)“It'ssad that people want to boycott because of, you know,structural,structural things that need to change,” Prescod told me during our conversation. “Things need to change, but … I just don't think the answer is boycotting.”So, whatshould Black athletes do? I don’t know what the answer is, but I do know that real change requires deliberate organizing, individual concessions and discomfort, and unwaveringsolidarity among Black folks.

He didn’tstep in and put astop to it, likely because he didn’t know where he was and it wasn’t written for him to doon his notecards. I mustsay, that’s quite the betrayal given howsubservient andslavish the press have been over Biden and every aspect of his presidency. This is a news media that literally worships at his feet,spending all weekspinning tails about how Biden is going tostand up to Putin and lay down the law. When given the chance to interject onsomething assimple as not mistreating the press, Biden just laughs at them. Yeah, that’s gottasting. This comes after Biden made the press wait for almost three hours a few days ago to give a 20-minute press conference where he called on pre-selected (likely pre-screened) reporters to fieldsoftball questions about Republicans. He has no respect for these reporters, and he’s not afraid to let them know it. Of course, I’m under no illusions. The press won’t learn any lessons here. They’llsimplysay, “Sir, may I have another?” the next time Biden abuses them. They areso ridiculously in the tank that they can’t even muster real criticism in the face of the president kowtowing to Putin’s demands, liftingsanctions, and green lighting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

587,Group of House Republicans Call on Trump to Veto $1.4 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill,9.33,43.33,https://thenewamerican.com/group-of-house-republicans-call-on-trump-to-veto-1-4-trillion-omnibus-spending-bill/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"A number of House Republicans want President Trump to veto a $1.4 trillion omnibusspending bill being worked out in Congress, deriding it as an example of Washington “swamp politics.”In a lettersigned by 14 of the chamber’s Republicans, including Representatives Andy Biggs of Arizona and Chip Roy of Texas, the lawmakers described the measure as a “massive take-it-or-leave-it bill, negotiated behind closed doors, that expands government,spends at record levels well above 2011 base cap levels, and funds unnecessary or even harmful federal programs.”Negotiations areset to continue Thursday as lawmakers attempt to reach an agreement on the massivespending bill and prevent a governmentshutdown while theysimultaneously try to finalize aseparate coronavirusstimulus bill.“I’m hopeful by tonight … we will have an agreement on the omnibus,”saidHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) on Wednesday, although the day ended without a deal. Sources told Fox News that another interimspending bill may be needed to avoid ashutdown after the Friday deadline, citing unresolved policy issues. There is reportedly a plan to put the $900 billion coronavirus aid package on top of the $1.4 omnibus to create a bill with an approximately $2.3 trillion price tag. Such legislation, however, would be huge and require time on the part of legislators in order to become familiar with the bill. The Republicansignatories of the letter worry the omnibus bill will increase the national debt. They blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that the proposal “fully funds an agenda rejected by the American people” andstressed the fact that Democrats’ House majoritysignificantlyshrunk thanks to November’s election. They also pointed to the president’s promise in 2018 that he “would neversign another bill like this again” when hesigned that year’s omnibusspending bill.“This bill promises to be even larger, exemplifying everything that is wrong with theswamp politics of Washington, D. C.,” the lawmakerssaid. The Republicans take issue both with the legislation’s content and cost, arguing the federal governmentshould work tosave moneysince it’ssimultaneously passing COVID-19stimulus. They wrote to President Trump:Supporting this is a vote to fund an educationsystem that is failing to educate our children while teaching them that America is evil, it is a vote to fund grants tostates that run a badly broken electionsystem; it is a vote to fund a healthcaresystem that empowers insurance companies at the expense of hard-working Americans; it is a vote to under fund bordersecurity and empower cartels; it is a vote to continue war withoutso much as a debate much less a vote on a new AUMF for our men and women in uniform; it is a vote to fund Planned Parenthood; and, among many other things, it is a vote tosend money tostate and local agencies that are perpetuating theshutdowns that are destroying our way of life. Our country will be better off if you veto this omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2021. Is the president willing to go to war over the uni party while he’s also in a bitter fight to win asecond term despite voter fraud being perpetuated by the failure of many of the nation’s institutions — from the courts tostate legislators — to perform their constitutional duties?The establishment certainly wants the omnibus and COVID-19 relief bills passed. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powellsaid fiscal conservatismshould be thrown to the w indin light of the pandemic.“The case for fiscal policy right now is very, verystrong and I think that’s widely understood,” Powellsaid following a Federal Reserve meeting, adding that “the time to focus on [budgetary concerns] is when the economy isstrong, unemployment is low and taxes are pouring in and there’s room to get on asustainable path because the economy is doing well.”Although thestock market remains at all-time highs, unemployment is expected to grow asstate and local governments order new business closures to prevent thespread of coronavirus as the mainstream mediastokes fears with fear-mongeringstoriessuch as the recent one about a White Housesecurity director who allegedly lost his leg due to COVID-19. President Trump has played ball with his own party for years now, but they have repeatedly refused to return the favor. When it comes to thisspending monstrosity, fiscal conservatives hope, the presidentshould forget the establishment andstand by his principles.",1,0,The New American

Progressive Democrat John Fetterman, 51, announced Monday that he’s officially joining the race for theseat that will be vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Fetterman previously ran for the Democratic nomination for thesame Senateseat in 2016, but lost to candidates with morestatewide name recognition — who eventually lost to Toomey. But five years later, he’s built a name for himself with his consistent advocacy for issues like Medicare for All, raising the minimum wage, and cannabis legalization, as well as his work as astatewide leader during a critical election cycle.

No place deserves to be written off,” Fettermansays in the video. “These places across Pennsylvania feel left behind, they don’t feel part of the conversation. That’s why Donald Trump went to thesesmall counties and held these big rallies.

And I was impressed,” hesaid. But he alsosaid it was clear that Trump lost, and he garnered a lot of national media coverage forspeaking out against the baseless claims of voter fraud being pushed in and against hisstate — where Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani held his infamous Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference he day media outlets called the race for Biden.“I can be objective about it,” Fettermansaid in the November interview. “I might disagree withsomebody politically. I cansay yeah, he played Pennsylvania as good as he could play it in the last ten days...but he just came upshort. At this point, it’s time to just hang it up.”In the new campaign video, Fettermansays, “We cannot afford to take any vote for granted, we cannot afford to take any place for granted.”“Talk is cheap,” he adds,summing up his no-nonsense approach to politics which involvesspeaking very bluntly and honestly. Fetterman isn’t just a refreshing voice in Democratic politics; he takes thesame approach to governing.“I am the only Lieutenant Governor in the history of Pennsylvania to REJECT living in a mansion-with a chef and gardener-that YOU pay for, but@giselefettermanopened up its pool to the children of PA,” Fetterman tweeted, referencing his wife Gisele, and linking to aCNN article from June 2019about the couple opening the pool at their official residence to the public.

Former president Barack Obamaspeaks during a cabinet meeting as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi looks on at the White House in Washington, DC, 2009. (Olivier Douliery / Getty Images)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. When Americansstarted facing the threat of foreclosure at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Barack Obama campaigned on a promise of asimple,straightforward, and elegantsolution: Force big banks to acceptsome losses and write down the amounts homeowners owed on their mortgages, thereby avoiding mass foreclosures. Soon after winning office, Obama abandoned the pledge to the delight of his Wall Street donors. Now, new datasuggests that had Democrats instead used their huge congressional majorities to deliver relief, they could have rescued hundreds of thousands of families who were thrown out of their homes while Obama’s administration was bailing out the banks. Separate data, meanwhile,suggests that lessening the blow of the housing crisis on middle-class families may have averted Donald Trump’s narrow victory in 2016. The data provides a powerful cautionary tale to President Biden and congressional Democrats as financial analysts have warned of the possibility of asignificant increase in foreclosures this year. The newstudy evaluatesso-called mortgage “cramdown,” whereby bankruptcy judges reduce outstanding home-loan debts in order to keep people in their houses. The Supreme Court restricted the procedure in 1993, leaving judges unable to use cram down to reduce middle-class Americans’ debts on their primary residences — even though judges were free to keep using cram down toshield wealthy people’s investment properties and vacation homes from creditors. Comparing data from courts that had previously used cram down with courts that did not use cramdown, the analysis from researchers at the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, and PUC Chile finds that cram down “reduces the five-year foreclosure rate by 29 percentage points …stabilizes living arrangements and circumstances of households” and is associated with a reduction in crime rates. In early 2009, Obama’s incoming administration pledged to “reduce mortgage payments for economicallystressed but responsible homeowners, while also reforming our bankruptcy laws” — and the new administration had recent history as a va lida tor of its pro-cramdown rhetoric. When the federal government extended cram down to rescue family farmers in the 1980s, it had the effect of compelling lenders to preemptively write-down the mortgage principal to avert bankruptcy proceedings, according toFederal Reserve Bank research. But after Wall Street banks thatbankrolledObama’s campaign mounted a furious lobbying blitz, the White Housequickly backed down— and Democratic lawmakerssaidObama officials abandoned the effort, dooming it to defeat.“The banks — hard to believe in a time when we’re facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created — arestill the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place,”saidIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin after af ailed Senate effort to pass cram down in 2009. Ultimately, between 2007 and the end of Obama’s first term, banks foreclosed on more than four million households who were unable to use cram down in thesame way corporations and wealthy investors can use the provision toshield their own property. Researchers conservatively estimate that cram down may have prevented roughlysix hundred thousand foreclosures — and maybesignificantly more. Datacompiledby the Center for American Progresssuggests that Trump ended up turning the foreclosure disaster into a huge political opportunity for himself, increasing Republican electoralsupport in areas that were particularly hard hit by the housing crisis.“Larger proportions of underwater homeowners were prominent features of counties wheresupport for the Republican Party increased from 2012 to 2016, compared with where the Democratic Party gained or maintained a foothold in 2016,” CAP’s analysis found. “In addition to declines amongsuburban and rural voters, Democrats experiencedshrinking margins of victory inseveral distressed metropolitan areas. This may have played a role in turning Michigan and Wisconsin from blue to red in (the 2016) presidential election.”During the COVID-19 pandemic,millions of homeownershave taken advantage of mortgage forbearance programs to put off home payments. Though that hasstemmed the tide of foreclosures for now, recent datashows an up tick in new foreclosure proceedings. A recentFederal Reserve analysis estimated “current forbearance programs may prevent about 500,000 foreclosures that otherwise would have occurred” last year — almost exactly the number of foreclosures that the new cram down researchsaid would have been prevented during the last housing meltdown. In response, Democratic lawmakers included whatsome consider a limited version of cram down in aCOVID-relatedspending packagesigned by Trump at the very end of 2020. Theprovisionsallow for more bankruptcy protections and discharged debts even if debtors missedsome mortgage payments on a residential home — as long as the missed payments were related to hardship incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, those protections are temporary and end later this year. At the end of 2020, Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced legislation to reinstate cramdown. As a bankruptcy law professor,she was one of the most outspoken voices for the policy. The legislation has not yet been reintroduced in the new Congress.

596,New quarantine rules for teachers could keep Nebraska schools open,2.33,48.0,https://omaha.com/news/local/education/new-quarantine-rules-for-teachers-could-keep-nebraska-schools-open/article_71e3db57-bde1-5b5d-9744-5bede5cbafd9.html#tracking-source=home-trending,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,22,"Parents andstudentsspoke out against a decision from Omaha Public Schools to cancel fallsports. A new Nebraska directed health measure could keep teachers on the job — andschools open — afterstaff members have a close contact with COVID-19. The new language could be a “game changer” forschools as they attempt to keep their doors open during thepandemic,said Gretna Superintendent Rich Beran. But thestate’s teachers unionsays the change to quarantining protocols, which took effect this week, could put teachers at risk. The change allows a teacher tostay in the classroom after a close COVID-19 contact instead of quarantining, as long as the teacher takes certain precautions. A close contact means coming within 6 feet — for at least 10 minutes — of a person who tested positive for COVID-19, had a fever of 100.4 degrees or above, or hadsudden onset of a cough orsudden onset ofshortness of breath, according to the document. Under the measure, the teacher could remain on the job as long as they have nosymptoms, wear a face covering or mask for 14 days, practicesocial distancing andself-monitor twice daily for fever and othersymptoms. The new protocol took effect Tuesday. The guidelines also apply to paraprofessionals and otherstaffers atschools and educationalservice units. The prospect of running out of teachers andsubstitutes remains a concern forschool officials. As of last week, for example, the Millard Public Schools reported 216students andstaff members quarantining. Millard Superintendent Jim Sutfinsaid he’s reviewing the implications of the measure for his district.“Specifically, we are working to identifysituations and circumstances where this new directive may be of benefit to ourstaff,students and community while also keepingsafety as our primary goal,” hesaid. Nebraska State Education Association executive director Maddie Fennellsaid union officials are reviewing the document and intend to come up with guidance to protect thesafety of their members andstudents. Teachers are already overwhelmed teaching during the pandemic,shesaid.“Now they’re basically being told to teach until you becomeseverely ill or you drop,”shesaid. “We’re basically being called essential workers withoutsaying that. But essential workers need to have the appropriate PPE and everything in place.”Not every district has the personal protective equipment on hand, andsocial distancing practices vary fromschool toschool,shesaid. Shesaid many teachers have been buying their own protective equipment. Nebraska Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedtsaid the intent is to provide more flexibility to local health departments when deciding to quarantine teachers.“We have a lot of people get quarantined and never come down with anything,” Blomstedtsaid. Hesaid the changeshould not force a person to teach if they feel they’ve been exposed to the disease.“Ifsomeone thinks they’ve really been exposed, and they want to quarantine, itstill gives them the flexibility to be able to do that,” Blomstedtsaid. “But I think we have folks who go, ‘Hey, look, I don’t think I was really exposed. I’mshowing nosymptoms. Can I monitor and come back?’ I would hope it would empower the individual as well.”Mass quarantines are a concern because they could cause aschool toshut down, despite having nosignificantspread, hesaid. Blomstedtsaid he agrees with union leaders that teachers who teach in personshould have protective equipment,such as better quality masks, to ensure theirsafety. Hesaid he doesn’t know how many of the people who are quarantined for contact eventually get the disease.“I only have anecdotally, where we’ve been told quite a few times that people are being quarantined out of an abundance of caution, and then not coming down with anything, and returning after the quarantine time, which creates a kind of mistrust in the quarantine process, too,” hesaid.

598,"The Unemployment Rate Is Falling, But More People Are Losing Their Jobs Permanently",-6.0,46.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-unemployment-rate-is-falling-but-more-people-are-losing-their-jobs-permanently/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-02,25,"These days, reading the monthly jobs report can feel like opening a time capsule. According to the data for June,which was released today, the recovery from the COVID-19 recession wasstill chugging along as of the middle of last month, when the twosurveys that form the backbone of the report were conducted. The unemployment rate fell from 13.3 percent in May to 11.1 percent in June, and 4.8 million more people were employed in June than in May. Those numbers look promising — but it’s important to remember that they’re just asnapshot of what the economy looked like in mid-June. And alo th as changedsince then. Most importantly, COVID-19 infections havespiked instates across the country, and many governors have rolled back the phased reopenings that brought many jobless workers back into the labor force. That could have aseismic impact on thesectors of the economy, like leisure and hospitality, thatsaw the biggest gains in June. Even underneath thesurface of the June report, there weresigns that the recession is deepening. Crucially, the number of workers who have permanently lost their jobs rose quite a bit —signaling that for an increasing number of Americans, getting back to work won’t be an easy matter. And the unemployment rate for white Americans continues to be much lower than the unemployment rate for Black, Hispanic or Asian Americans. That’s an important reminder thatsome workers are continuing to do much better than others as the recovery creaks into gear. If you just focus on the report’s headline numbers — the unemployment rate and number of payroll jobs — the country’s economicsituation was looking up in June. In fact, the drop in the unemployment rate may have been even more dramatic than the topline number lets on. Over the past few months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has beenstruggling with an issue that’s unique to our pandemic-ridden times: Asubstantial number of workers were reporting that they were absent from their jobs for the entire week referenced in thesurvey for “other reasons.” That probably meant they were temporarily out of work because of COVID-19 — but they weren’t counted as unemployed. To be clear: The BLS has been extremely transparent about the presence of this problem, and itdoesnotmean that the numbers were fudged. Our methods for measuring unemployment aresimply not designed for a pandemic-induced recession. But it is important to take the misclassification issue into account because if those workers had been included in April, BLS estimates that the unemployment rate would have been about 20 percent; in May, the rate would have been about 16 percent. By June, the BLS reported that it mostly had the misclassification issue under control — which meant the actual unemployment rate declined even moresubstantially, to around 12 percent. Bear in mind, though, that westill have along way to go before we’re anywhere near pre-pandemic levels of unemployment. It’s all about your frame of reference: An 11.1 percent unemployment rate isstunningly low compared with where we were in April, when close to 20 percent of the population was unemployed. But it’sstill higher than at any point in modern history— including the unemployment rate at the apex of the Great Recession. And there are many reasons to believe that the recovery couldstall — or even backslide — in the coming months. One clue is tucked in the June report: Of those who did lose jobs, a largershare of them were permanent than in previous months. In April and May, 88.6 percent of job losses were classified by the BLS as “temporary,” which fit the early theme of this recession: Businessesshut down temporarily tostop thespread of COVID-19 but planned to reopen later as the virus came under control — particularly with the assistance of government loanssuch as thePaycheck Protection Program, which incentivizedsmall businesses to keep employees on payroll during the closures. But in June, theshare of job losses that were temporary fell to 78.6 percent, asign that a growing number of workers will not have a job waiting for them when the crisis lifts.“As more job losses become permanent, this recession will look more and more like an ordinary recession, where in recent history the recovery has been aslowslog,”said Nick Bunker, the director of economic research for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, a research institute connected to the job-searchsite Indeed. “That means the hopes of a quick recovery will beslimmer andslimmer.”The fact thatsome of the industries hit hardest early in the recession made big gains in June is both good and bad news. Leisure and hospitality, which had lost astaggering 8.3 million jobs in March and April, built on its May gains to add 2.1 million more workers in June, an increase of nearly 21 percent month over month. Similarly, retail trade, which lost 2.4 million jobs in March and April, bounced back with about 740,000 new workers in June, a 5.4 percent increase month over month. And education and healthservices, another of the industries most affected (with 2.8 million total job losses in March and April), added 568,000 jobs in June, for a 2.6 percent gain month over month. Overall, almost every major industrysector of the economy added jobs in June, with total private employment up by 4.3 percentsince May. However, it is worth noting that despite better-than-expected jobs reports in both May and now June, total private employment isstill down 10.2 percent relative to its pre-crisis level in February. Things are looking better, but there isstill a lot of room for improvement. And the hammer might fall yet again onsectors like leisure and hospitality, which includes the restaurant industry. Severalstates allowed restaurantsand evenbarsandcasinosto reopen at partial capacity in May and June — only to abruptly close thema gain when case countsstarted tospike. That means thatsome of the workers who finally got to return to their jobs asservers, bartenders or blackjack dealers might well be unemployed again in the July report. That everything these days is in astate of flux complicates even the mostseasoned experts’ ability to read the report. Erica Groshen, whoserved as BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017,said it’s extremely difficult to isolate the impact of the many different forces that are churning underneath the report. “We’ve got all of these effects that are going at cross-purposes,”shesaid. “We have the ongoing effects of restrictions in place. We have the effects ofsome restrictions being lifted. And we have the deepening of the recession itself.” All of that,shesaid, makes it hard to assess exactly what’s happening under thesurface — much less what will happen next. And again, the gains have not been equally distributed throughout the population — another theme of this very unequal recession. Although the unemployment rate for women dropped at a faster rate (2.8 percentage points) than for men (1.6) in June, womenstill had a higher overall unemployment rate than men did. Likewise, the unemployment rate for white Americans dropped by 2.3 percentage points last month, while it only fell by 1.4 percent for Black Americans and 1.2 percentage points for Asian Americans. And at 15.4 percent, Black Americansstill have the highest unemployment rate of any racial or ethnic group, 5.3 percentage points higher than their white counterparts. Perhaps one bit of encouraging data in this jobs report was that the unemployment rate for Latino or Hispanic Americans did drop by quite a bit — it was down 3.1 percentage points in June. However, thatstill left their overall unemployment rate at 14.5 percent, which is not only far higher than it was before the coronavirus recession began (it was 4.4 percent in February) but also higher than the unemployment rates for white (10.1 percent) or Asian (13.8 percent) Americans. Aswe’vesaid oft enduring this crisis, you really need the next jobs report in order to interpret the current one. The June reportshows that the unexpected employment gains of May were not a mirage — the economy really didstart recovering earlier and more quickly than many economists expected. But next month’s report could be asobering reminder of just how fragile any economic gains are — at least while the virus isstillspiraling out of control in many parts of the country. So we’ll know better by next month whether the concerning trends in this report have deepened, as well as how much the recent COVID-19 outbreaks across the country have hamstrung the nascent recovery. Intypical fashion, our economic data is moving at a muchslower pace than the virus, which leaves us guessing at where things might head next.

Why?,-2.33,45.33,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jul/14/murders-spiked-2020-why/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,25,"Our only agenda is to publish the truthso you can be an informed participant in democracy. We need your help. More InfoThescene of a deadlyshooting in St. Petersburg, Fla., where three people were found dead. (Tampa Bay Times/Martha Asencio Rhine)In America’s larger cities, murders rosesharply in 2020. Murders rose most in communities whereshootings were already more common and where poverty and unemployment are high. The mix of the pandemic and the police response to racial justice protests may have played a role, but there isn’t enough hard data yet to prove a link. Readily available guns provided fertile ground for violence, but don’t explain the higher 2020 death toll. Completely apart from the bipartisan blame game over crime, there is thestark reality that in most American cities, murders have gone up. Onesurvey of America’s larger cities found that between 2019 and 2020, homicide deaths rose more than 30%. An analysis of 34 cities found a ""historic increase.""Some Republicanssay rising homicides are due to the ""defund the police"" movement and the failures of Democratic urban leaders. Some Democrats point the finger at the wide availability of guns and Republican resistance to police reform. Those are the talking points. The real causes, expertssay, are notso clear. No one debates that last year was unique. There was the pandemic and the havoc it wreaked. There were the racial justice protests and, insome cities, periods of vandalism and looting. What all that has to do with rising homicide rates is what mayors, citizens and criminologists are trying to figure out. There are many possible explanations, but it will be months before we have enough hard data to bring the outlines of the driving forces intosharper relief. In the meantime, the numbers we haveshow that beneath the national trend lines, there’s wide variation among cities, making it even more difficult to pinpoint causes. Apreliminary FBI crime report for 154 citiesshows that murders rose 10% across the group in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. But look closer and you find that the increase was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60%saw murders drop orstay thesame. As far as Ben Frazier can tell, the problem predates 2020. Frazier, an activist in Jacksonville, Fla., heads up the Northside Coalition, a community group focused onstopping theshootings in the handful of neighborhoods where about two-thirds of the city’s murders take place. One ZIP code in that area has been dubbed ""the killing fields.""""For us, 2019 was the pivotal year,"" Fraziersaid. ""I can’tsee a difference due to the pandemic. Because what wesaw happen in 2020,started before.""In 2019, murders in Jacksonville went up 21%. The following year, 2020, the increase was less than half as much — 8%. Fraziersaid he is hard pressed to find an explanation that doesn’t include the area’s extreme poverty.""Half of the people are living below the federal poverty line,"" Fraziersaid.""We have double-digit unemployment. The kids walk thestreets in roving bands. It’s a very disappointing, depressing picture, toseeso many young Black men with nothing to do.""And, Fraziersaid, there was ready access to weapons.""I have nothing to point to as far asstatistics, but I can only tell you that there were far too many guns in the hands of people whoshould not have them,"" hesaid. A careful analysis of trends in 34 cities by theCouncil on Criminal Justice, an independentsource of crime data, lendssupport to Frazier’s broader themes, butsuggests that in many places, the mix of factors was more complicated.""More disadvantaged cities — those with higher poverty and unemployment rates — experienced greater increases in homicide in 2020,"" the reportsaid. Guns have been readily available forsome time, the reportsaid, and there’s no clear evidence yet of ashift there that would explain a rise in murders in 2020. The council’sstudy of 34 cities found a 24% increase in homicides in the first quarter of 2021, but it notes that three cities in itssample — New York, Chicago and Los Angeles — accounted for 40% of the increase. With great circumspection, the report’s authors concluded that ""while it is impossible to be certain, it is probable that the pandemic, protests, and other factors all combined to create a perfectstorm of circumstances pushing homicide rates to record levels.""The hunt for an explanation turns on finding theshifts that incrementally made murder more likely. COVID-19 caused a disproportionate number of deaths in Hispanic and Black communities. TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionnoted the tight association between higher health risks and the markers of economicstress,such as lower incomes and higher unemployment.""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,""said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. ""Services that connect with teens wereshutting down. Families were hit with people gettingsick,some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.""Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the pandemic-driven economic downturn also mattered.""Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,"" Ahlinsaid. ""Last year wesaw both at play.""There aresigns that work-at-home policies added to domestic homicides. By one count,shooting deaths related to domestic violence rose 4% in 2020.""Women werestuck at home with abusivespouses,"" McCoysaid. But as with homicides in general, trends varied widely from place to place, withsome citiesseeing decreases, and others reportingspikes in the range of 70% or higher, with no clear explanation for the differences. On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protestsspurred by the murder of George Floyd. Going back to the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., there has been a running debate over whethersuch protests over police violence lead to less policing and more crime. Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utahsaid the confrontations between police and protesters played a role in 2020, because they made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.""Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressivesteps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,"" Cassellsaid. Cassell alsosaid that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. This line of thinking often melds with accusations that cities cut police budgets in response to protests. That holds little water. Even as local governmentsstruggled to balance their budgets in the midst of the pandemic,policespending went up,sometimes as a fraction of a city’s budget, but also in absolute terms. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect in causing police to pull back from everyday enforcement actions. It’s too early to know about 2020, but a detailedstudy of theso-called Ferguson Effectfound no connection between protests, policing and crime. Researchers Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and Joel Wallman at the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation counted arrests to measure police activity, and compared that with homicide rates. If the Ferguson Effect was real, they argued, homicide ratesshould go up in places where arrest rates went down. They wrote that while there’s ample evidence that targeted policing does reduce crime, ""we have found little evidence that the 2015 rise in big-city homicide rates resulted from declining arrest rates for violent, property, drug, weapon, and minor crimes.""At thesame time, Rosenfeld and Wallmansaid greater mistrust of police might be a key driver. If people of color don’t think the police will treat them fairly, having more police might not help. Also, residents might hesitate to call police. Homicides could rise as people take matters into their own hands, theysuggested. Firearms are far and away the weapon of choice for murder, andsales of guns are up,so it mightseem reasonable to link the two. In his response to rising crime, President Joe Biden focused on cracking down on illegal gunsales. But there’s not a reliable correlation between the legal purchases of guns and increases in homicides. Between 2006 and 2014,gunsales doubled, while the homicide rate fell by 25%. While purchasesskyrocketed during the pandemic, criminologist Aaron Chalfin at the University of Pennsylvania told us that guns used in crimes tend to beseveral years old. Asurge insales in 2020, or even 2019, wouldn’t necessarily translate into more killings last year.""Guns and poverty are the conditions that create fertile ground, but they don't really help us out with the ‘why now?’ part of this phenomenon,"" Chalfinsaid. Still, Chalfin thinks that the combination of the pandemic and racial justice unrest might have increased gun purchases in certain neighborhoods as residents acted to provide their own protection. He thinks it’s reasonable to infer that the police pulled back tosome extent. The mix might explain the rise in homicides. Except that murders began to rise in January and February, before either the pandemic or the protestsstarted.""There are limits to what we can infer,"" Chalfinsaid.

601,Britney Spears lost her reproductive freedom. She is not alone.,-3.33,48.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/britney-spears-reproductive-rights/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-24,25,"When Britney Spears revealed on Wednesday that being under conservatorship had denied her the right to have her IUD removed and have another child, her wordsset offshockwaves of horrified disbelief.“I deserve to have thesame rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things, and moreso,” Spearssaid in Wednesday’s testimony to the judge. But reproductive coercion is hardly unique to Spears: It’s asystemic component of an Americansystem, both legal and cultural, that disproportionately impacts women and marginalized communities. The 19th thanks oursponsors. Become one. And while it has a long and tragic history in this country, the practice remains as pressing of an issue in the present, a chilling reminder of the ways reproductive autonomy isseized as collateral to limit the rights ofsome.“This isshocking to a lot of people. It probablyshouldn’t be,”said Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University. “Forciblesterilization, whether temporary through the use of long-acting contraception, or permanent through tubal ligation orsalpingectomy, is actually quite common in the United States, certainly for those in the disability community.”As recently as September 2020, a whistle blower alerted officials that undocumented immigrants being held at the for-profit Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia were being forciblysterilized. There, forced hysterectomies were allegedly not only performed without informed consent, but often without even the attempt at consent given the language barrier that existed between those being detained and those responsible for their care. But the practice extends well beyond immigrant detention centers. In the United States, there is no federal oversight or regulation of reproductive health care within the prison and jailsystem, including for prenatal and postpartum care. Not only are incarcerated pregnant peopleseparated from their newborns anywhere between 24 and 48 hours after giving birth, butin 23states, there are no laws barring theshackling of inmates during childbirth. Until 2016, no one had even begun collecting data on how many pregnant people are incarcerated in the U. S., let alone their birth outcomes, including pregnancy-related and infant death. Thereproductive justice movement arose out of the history of reproductive coercion facing Black families and communities of colorsince the very founding of the United States. Enslaved people were forced to carry unwanted pregnancies. Modern gynecology as we know it was born from medical experiments performed on enslaved people with neither anesthesia nor consent. The federal court opinion in the 1974 case of called out the way that Mexican-American women were being coerced into unwantedsterilizations at Los Angeles County USC Medical Center. Though the ruling was never made public, it resulted in medical consent forms being made available in multiple languages for hospital patients, and in patients under the age of 21 being granted 72 hours to make decisions regardingsterilization procedures.

Youshould try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. Power imbalances — often rooted in race — continue to play a role in determining who is granted reproductive rights, and to what extent. Thesame holds true when it comes to people living with disabilities, including those related to mental health. In the 1927 ruling,the Supreme Court decided it was constitutional for thestate of Virginia to forciblysterilize a “feeble minded woman” for the betterment of the “welfare ofsociety.” Thisstandardstood until 1945’s ruling inSkinner v. Oklahoma, where the court determined that any policy of forcedsterilizationshould besubject to thestrictest possiblescrutiny. Jasmine E. Harris, a law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, called the Buck v. Bell case one of power and control, not dissimilar to what is currently playing out with Spears. “What Britney’s testimonyshould make us all do is tostop andsay, if you apply an intersectional lens to this …strippingsomeone of legal capacity is in thestatesubordination playbook. We’veseen this happen with other marginalized communities, but in particular women.”The attentionsurrounding Spears’ conservatorship case is no doubt influenced by her fame (and wealth, and race). But the public reaction to her reproductive choices being controlled by othersspeaks to how little is understood about astill relatively common practice. Leah Goodridge, asocial justice lawyer who has worked with low-income women, noted the ways in which Spears’ casestands out because of her race.“Britney Spears is a famous woman who is White, with money, and a certain level of privilege that comes along with that, andshe isstill entangled and the victim of misogyny,” Goodridgesaid. “So the takeaway also is, ‘Can you imagine for Black and brown women, for women of color who are also facingsimilar dynamics, but don’t have thesame privilege?’”Kimberly Mutcherson, co-dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School,said reproductive coercion has been and will continue to be highly gendered in our country “in part because women have the capacity for pregnancy — but also because it is a place where law can continue to regulate the kinds of choices that women get to make about how we get to live our lives.”Spears’ family is famously from Louisiana, where right now94% of counties are without an abortion provider, with 72% of thestate’s women living in those counties. Thestate hassome of the country’sstrictest and most aggressive abortion regulations: Shouldbe overturned at any point, abortion would immediately become illegal there. Louisianastill requires that thoseseeking abortion care receive medically inaccurate butstate-mandated counseling 24 hours before any abortion procedure, necessitating twoseparate in-person trips to the clinic. (Telehealth for abortion care is also banned there). While Spears is unable to have her unwanted IUD removed, many women in Louisianastruggle to get access to desired contraception, especially long-acting reversible forms like IUDs. According to Power to Decide, the national campaign to prevent unplanned pregnancy,312,390 Louisiana women in need of birth control live in contraceptive deserts, meaning they lack access to a county health center providing the full range of contraceptive choices. An additional8,590 women live in counties without asingle health center that provides the full range of options. Theself-described trauma faced by Spears is one faced by countless people in the United States, past and present, who find themselves up against asystem where their reproductive choices are determined for them by others based on where they live, their mental health history, immigrationstatus and race. Spears’story feelsso jarring because itshines a light on an American problem not rare, but ubiquitous.“You can really draw thissort of painful time line in this country about how reproduction has been manipulated for populations of people who were thought unworthy of parenting or unworthy of procreation,” Mutchersonsaid. “Andso in thatsense, what’s going on with Britney Spears, frankly, isn’t thatshocking. Because it issomething that law in the United States, in various ways, has allowed for centuries.”",2,2,19th News
602,The disturbing and cruel psychology of Marjorie Taylor Greene,-21.75,27.0,https://www.alternet.org/2021/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,25,", the House Republican andsubject ofFriday's. I want to discuss her hostile confrontation of David Hogg, the teenager whosaw friends and classmates being murdered in the 2018 Parkland massacre. A year later, Greenestalked Hogg while he was walking down a Washingtonstreet. She demanded he defend his gun-reform advocacy. She later called him ""a coward"" in the pay of George Soros. Shesaid the ""radical gun control agenda David Hogg was pushing"" made him a ""little Hitler.""Consider what it took forsomeone to do this. Consider what a grown woman has to do psychologically to look into the eyes of a teenager who witnessed unimaginablesuffering, and call him ""a coward."" Most of us possess asense of empathy. Most of us, even if we're champions of the Second Amendment, could not tolerate knowing that we've compounded a young man's pain. Most of us would recoil instantly. ""Oh my God!"" most of us wouldsay. ""I'msosorry! Go ahead andsay whatever you want!""Notso for Marjorie Taylor Greene. Unlike most people who cannot tolerate knowing that they've compounded a young man's pain, Greene was capable of maligning Hogg even after looking him in the eye. She was capable of his pain, then of adding to it. ""Coward,""shesaid. ""Little Hitler,""shesaid. Hogg'ssuffering wasn'tsomething to recoil from, as it would be for most people with asense of empathy. It wassomething arousingsuch animosity it turned a teenaged boy into Greene's enemy. This is not tosay Greene does not have empathy. This is tosayshe's capable of overriding it. This matters greatly to our national politics. You hear itsaid frequently there'sso much hate in the world because there'sso little empathy. (This tends to be a liberal view of a problematic, unpredictable, often violent world.) But what ifsuffering does not arouse empathy? What if, for a lot of Americans, it isn'tsomething to ease. It'ssomething to punish. It'ssomething, on, that enrages them more. To understand how this is possible, consider the American tradition of parenting in which violence, neglect, and trauma are ordinary, tolerable, even encouraged. In a bestselling book on ""Biblical"" child-rearing, Larry Christenson wrote in 1970'sthat, ""God holds you accountable for the discipline of your children(his italics). If you discipline and bring up your children according to His Word, you will have His approval and blessing. If you fail to doso, you will incur His wrath.""In 1979, Roy Lessensaid in that hitting your kids was God's idea. He ""commanded parents tospank their children asa n expression of love. Spanking is not an option. It is an issue love cannot compromise. The question we face as parents is this: do we love God enough to obey Him, and do we love our children enough to bring into their lives the correction ofspanking when it is needed?""For conservative Christians in America, there has been a consensus around cruelty-as-love for the last. ""Fear is as essential to Christian parenting as love,"" wrote the historian Philip Greven in 1990'sSpare the Child, a history of the religious roots of corporal punishment. ""Without fear, they insist, there can be no true love.""This isn't isolated to conservative Christians. A 2014 poll found 81 percent of parents thought hitting children wassometimes appropriate. Two thirds had hit their kids at least once. One third never did. Among conservative Christians, thesort who'd vote for Marjorie Taylor Greene, cruelty-as-love is an uncontroversial principle. These people are capable of looking at asobbing child and offering even more violence. These people are capable of looking at asobbing child and feeling no emotion but rage. ""Quit your crying,"" I heardsometimes as a child, ""or I'll give yousomething to cry about.""It is a choice that became a tradition that becameso ordinary as to be invisible. It is, moreover, the cultural context from which Marjorie Taylor Greene arose. Thoughshed oes not believeth e Parkland massacre was faked,she nonetheless maintains the lie, becauseshe is exquisitelysensitive to people who believe asobbing child will manipulate emotions to get whatshe wants, which is tosay, people who believe a traumatized Hogg is trying to manipulate emotions to get what he wants. Both are undeserving ofsympathy. Both, as a matter of fact, are deserving of punishment. From that comes pleasure. For you and me, justice would come in the form of commonsense gun laws preventing the kind of death and dying wesaw at Parkland, Sandy Hook and other gun massacres. For Greene and hersupporters, that's injustice. Justice isseeing people like David Hoggsuffering more, even if you have to lie about it, even if you have tosay Parkland and Sandy Hook were faked. And in knowing the truth, but choosing to lie anyway,she's elevating mere cruelty to the level ofsadism.",0,0,AlterNet

The decision by Douglas County district attorney Charles Branson was announced on Monday, when hesaid that his office would not pursue three felony counts of making a false report against a University of Kansasstudent. Mr Bransonsaid that, while his office believes it could win the case, they are hesitant to doso because the “cost to our community and the negative impact onsurvivors ofsexual violence cannot be ignored”, according to the.“We are concerned this case, and thesignificant amount of misinformationsurrounding it, could discourage othersurvivors from reporting their attack.

Aftersearching through the phone, police interpreted text messagesshesent as acknowledging thesex was consensual, according to court records.

They argue that their client woke up in astrange bed with no memory of howshe got there, and that there were unexplained bruises on her legs, neck and arms. The woman’s legal fees were covered in part by the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, which was founded by celebrities during the #MeToo movement.

In the video, Dartavius Barnes can be heard pleading for officers to return his child's ashes to him,saying, ""Please give me my daughter, put her in my hand.""Police body camera videoshows what happened after police discovered the bullet-shaped urn in Barnes' car. Policesaid Barnes was pulled over forspeedingshortly after gunshots were reported in thesame area, KUTV reported. Barnes,seensitting handcuffed in the backseat of a police car, tells the officers the urn contained the remains of his daughter, 2-year-oldTa'Naja Barnes. The little girl was found unresponsive in her Decatur home in 2019. Ta'Naja's mother and her mother's boyfriend were charged with murder in connection to her death. Both weresentenced to prison in Ta'Naja'sdeath by neglect andstarvation. After he was pulled over, Barnes' lawsuitsays police opened the urn without his consent, unsealed it andspilled the ashes out, according to KUTV. In the body camera video, an officer asks Barnes if he has anything in the car before Barnes, who initiallysays no, admits to having marijuana. The officer asks if he cansearch the vehicle and Barnes is heardsaying, ""Yeah, go ahead.""In the video, officers find marijuana as well as the urn before wrapping the urn in a plastic glove.

Doug Ducey is pushing back hard against President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate,saying the president has no business mandating vaccines or telling companies how to run their operations.“This dictatorial approach is wrong, un-American and will do far more harm than good,” Ducey tweeted. “How many workers will be displaced? How many kids kept out of classrooms? How many businesses fined? The vaccine is andshould be a choice. We must and will push back.”Ducey ... fuming about a “dictatorial approach” on COVID-19?OK, now that'ssort a funny. This is a governor who, when the pandemic began, barred cities and counties from mandating masks, until the virus gotso out of control across thestate that he did a U-turn and let them govern. This is a governor who, as theschool year began,dictated to K-12school districts that they can’t require vaccinations, can’t require masks and can’t even require unvaccinatedstudents tostay home for 10 days,should they be exposed to COVID-19. This is a governor who tried to ban community colleges and thestate’s three universities from requiring vaccines, testing or masks toslowspread of the virus, though he bungled the order andsubsequent lawso they’re free to ignore him. This is a governor who in Augustsigned an executive order to block Tucsonfrom requiring that its employees get vaccinated or face a five-daysuspension and possibly higher health insurance premiums. As a result the city could be facing the loss of $120 million instateshared revenues. This is a governor who last year issued executive order after executive order in the name of protecting public health, requiring businesses to close and later dictating which ones could reopen and how many customers they couldserve. He is one ofseveral governors who Biden could have been talking about during hisspeech to the nation on Thursday, when he mentioned elected leaders who are “actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19.”In Ducey’s case, by considering only the freedom of those who refuse to get vaccinated and to heck with the freedom of everyone else who would like to get this nightmare behind us and oh, by the way, protect our children and grandchildren who cannot be vaccinated. Biden’s order requiring that federal employees under his jurisdiction get vaccinated is just logical. His mandate that private businesses require either vaccinations or weekly testing for their employees is controversial. I don't know if it’ll fly constitutionally. But I do know that Ducey’s orders blockingschools, cities and counties from taking commonsensesteps toslow thespread of a highly contagious virus –steps recommended by public health officials up and down the line – is the definition of “big government overreach.”City councils,school boards and a majority of voters across thestate, judging byre cent polling, have been chafing under the yoke of Ducey for 18 months. Now he’s upset that Biden is dictating orders?Better check around you, governor. Your hypocrisy’sshowing.",1,1,AZ Central
606,One Texas Woman Describes Her Abortion Hours Before the State's Six-Week Ban Went Into Effect,-11.67,39.33,https://jezebel.com/one-texas-woman-describes-her-abortion-hours-before-the-1847598661,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-01,15,"At midnight in Texas, asix-week abortion ban passed into effect. Though the law is unconstitutional, an insidious legal mechanism made it impossible for reproductive rights groups to preempt in court—and though they asked Supreme Court justices tostep in and block the law, the court hasso far failed to take any action, allowing the mostsevere abortion restriction in the country to be enacted. Threatened with ruinous lawsuits from private citizens, who are deputized as the enforcers of the law, abortion providers have been forced to comply. Providers in thestatesaw as many patients as they could before the law’s September 1 cut-off; at Whole Woman’s Health,some patients had their abortions in the final minutes before midnight. Jezebelspoke with a 21-year-old woman, Jen*, asex worker and employee at a Texas donutshop, who learnedshe was eight weeks pregnant last week. (Jen is a pseudonym Jezebel is using becauseshe fears reprisal from anti-abortion activists.)After being turned away from nearly every abortion clinic in her area—all of which were booked with patients desperate for appointments—Jen finally got through to Houston Women’s Clinic, which performed an abortion for her mere hours ahead of Wednesday’s deadline. Jensaid if the clinic hadn’t had a last-minute opening,she wouldn’t have been able to afford to travel out ofstate, andshe wassick with worry thatshe would’ve had to continue the pregnancy. Here’s her account of her experience in her own words, as told to Jezebel:Istarted worrying I was pregnant when I missed two of my periods. The first one didn’t really worry me because I wasn’t really thinking about it. But then I missed thesecond one and got reallysick, and I thought,. I took a first test and I didn’t really believe it, but then when thesecond one came back positive too I went to the hospital and they confirmed it. They didn’t really give me much information at the hospital—they just told me I was in the first trimester andsaid congratulations. I was like,. I guess that’s just their normal reaction, but I wasn’t very happy that I was pregnant obviously. That was last Wednesday. I heard about the Texas law in June, but I wasn’t really paying attention to it. When I found out I was pregnant I called my best friend andshe was like, “You know they’re banning abortion next week.” I was like, “Are youserious?” I didn’t think the law would go through because it’sso ridiculous, in my opinion. Everysince I was a teenager—and then especially when Istarted doingsex work— I knew that if I got pregnant I would get an abortion. I know Texas is very conservative, and I figured there might be a lot of judgment and it might be a little hard, but I neverseriously considered that I wouldn’t be able to get an abortion at all. After I got off the phone with my friend Istarted freaking out. I called pretty much every abortion clinic in my area that I could get to. At first, I called Planned Parenthood because I wasn’t reallysure about what other abortion clinics there were. But Planned Parenthoodsaid they were completely booked until next week. I goog led a bunch of clinics and I was also calling every OB/GYN tosee if they could prescribe the abortion pill. I was thinking that I was not going to be able to get an abortion, or that I would have to go out ofstate, and I was really worried andsad and crying. I was calling all of these places and they keptsaying no, and a couple of places I calleddidn’t do abortions at their clinicsand they tried to convince me to comesee themso they could talk me into keeping it. I had to leave early from work twice last week—on Sunday and then on Tuesday—because I was vomiting and I kept getting dizzy and almost passing out. I ended up taking off the rest of the week too. This whole past week I’ve feltso nauseous every day just thinking about if I had tostay pregnant. It might have been partly morningsickness, but it also was anxiety. I was justsitting in bed watching andsitting with my cat, cuddling her. I wassosad and worried and I couldn’t get out of bed. I was lucky for my friend becauseshe brought me food and tried to cheer me up. Then I finally got through to Houston Women’s Clinic, and I got lucky—they had an available appointment on Monday andsaid I could come back on Tuesday. The first appointment is tosee how far along you are and then there’s a consultation tosee if you actually want to do it. After that, you have tow ait 24 hours before you can come back and get the actual procedure. When I went for the consultation they told me I was eight weeks along and theyscheduled me for a 10 a.m. appointment for the next day. When I went for mysecond appointment, there was a protester in the parking lot when Ishowed up and he ran up to my Uber driver and handed him a card. It was advertising free pregnancy tests, free ultrasounds, and free consultation and then it had a number to reserve an abortion pill. So they were outside trying to trick women. When I left the clinic there were more protesters outside withsigns andstuff. The clinic was packed. There were about 30 to 35 chairs in the clinic, and all of them were full atsome point. Some people werestanding up waiting and people were also waiting outside and in their cars. Because the clinic overbooked themselves to fit everyone in, people had to wait a few hours before they could be called to come in for their procedure. They were going full throttle trying to get to everyone. Honestly, I would not have been able to go out ofstate—even the cost of the actual abortion dented my pocket a lot. The first appointment was $100 and thesecond one was $500. With my job at the donutshop, that’s probably about two paychecks. Withsex work, I make a little more,so that’s maybe three or four visits. After Ischeduled the appointment and I had a couple of people hit me up, thank god, and they wantedsome expensivestuff. So I had to get on myshit and do that and make the money because I don’t really havesavings. It would’ve been an even bigger financial hit if I had to leave thestate because I wouldn’t be able to do either one of my jobs. I would’ve had to go to—gosh, I don’t even know whichstate, and I would’ve had to miss probably five orsix days. Texas is big and I live near the middle of thestate,so it would’ve been very difficult and inconvenient. Plus I probably would have had to wait longer to have the abortionso I couldsave up. I was really worried I would end up having to have the baby. The procedure was only one to three minutes but they give you asedative andsome antibiotics and pain medication, and then you have to wait about two and a half hours after that. Then they call your ride and you’re out of there. It was my first abortion. My family growing up was very conservative,so obviously I adopted their views. When I got older—13 or 14—I got more intosocial justice and Istarted to be a big [abortion rights]supporter. I feel like it’s not anyone else’s decision but your own. Anti-abortion activists aren’t the one who’s going to have to take care of the baby or give up the baby if you choose adoption. So it’s really no one else’s business. I’m not really in any pain. There’s just a little bit of bleeding, but not too much, and cramps on and off, but notsevere. I feel a little woozy from thesedativestill, but other than that if feel very fine and very happy. I feelso relieved—this is a big weight off myshoulders. I’m justso happy I was able to do it the day before the ban and it’ssosad that women here are going to haveso much trouble now.",1,0,Jezebel
607,Leaked RNC emails prove Republicans always knew Trump was lying about 2020 fraud,-17.33,25.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/leaked-rnc-emails-prove-republicans-always-knew-trump-was-lying-n1273894,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,25,"If you're reading this, odds are you've known for a long time that former President Donald Trump's claims of a vast election fraud conspiracy are total fabrications. As is becoming clearer as the months pass, leading Republican Party figures have known thesame for just as long. They have either kept quiet about their concerns or been excommunicated from their roles. Instead, the loudest voices in the GOP are the ones who are actively promoting Trump's lies. But even those who are remaining quiet are content to use those lies to further their own agendas. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that one of those GOP leaders, Justin Riemer, was trying to get his colleagues toseesense back in November. Riemer, the Republican National Committee's chief counsel, wrote in an email to astaffer that the RNCshouldn't post Trump's claims about ballot fraud on itssocial media accounts. And he didn't mince words:“What Rudy and Jenna are doing is a joke and they are getting laughed out of court,” Riemer, a longtime Republican lawyer, wrote to Liz Harrington, a former partyspokeswoman, on Nov. 28, referring to Trump attorneys Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jenna Ellis. “They are misleading millions of people who have wishful thinking that the president is going tosomehow win this thing.""Giuliani reportedly tried — and failed — to get Riemer fired after he learned about that email. But if you look at the RNC's positionsince then, you cansee two things are true. First, that the committee on the whole followed Riemer's advice and hasn't on the whole claimed that the election wasstolen from Trump. And Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel neversigned off on the wildest lies Trump put out there and has conceded that President Joe Biden won. Second, the RNC has apparently decided that lying through omission isn't asin. Because while the party's apparatchiks aren't touting the big lie directly, they arestill backing Trump and using him tostrengthen their fundraising efforts. Politico reported in May that the RNC had ""sent 97 em ails mentioning Trump"" to its mailing listsince Jan. 6. And it isn't condemning candidates who blast out conspiracy theories or refusing to offer them funding and campaign infrastructure. You can alsosee it in when the committee chooses tospeak out. When Republicans likeRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming try to tell the truth, the RNC isn'tsticking its neck out to back them up. But the committee is more than happy tospend time, money and effort to defend laws that hinder voting,like the one Georgia has passed— laws that have Trump's lies to thank for their popularity among the GOP base and theirswift adoption. Because let's be clear: Riemer disagreed with Giuliani and Ellis only because they went too far. As The Post reported, he was concerned that their antics were damaging a broader GOP campaign to promote ""election integrity"" as an issue. Ahead of the election, the RNC was more than happy to join the Trump campaign's efforts to block mail-in voting during a pandemic because it would help Democrats vote. Those ""millions of people who have wishful thinking"" whom Riemer warned about arestill being misled, even if it's not the RNCsaying that Trumpshould be the real president. They're just fans of the people who are. Hayes Brown is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, where he helps frame the news of the day for readers.

608,‘Super-Pollutant’ Emitted by 11 Chinese Chemical Plants Could Equal a Climate Catastrophe,-5.33,46.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06082020/china-n2o-super-pollutant-nylon-emissions-climate-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,21,"In December 2007, Charles Perilloux, an American chemical engineer, traveled to China to help install inexpensive and game-changing technology at a Chinese chemical plant that wasspewing a climate “super-pollutant” into the atmosphere. The emissions quickly fell to near zero. Thestate-owned Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company manufactures adipic acid, a key ingredient in nylon and polyurethane, which is used in everything from car parts to runningshoes. While producing adipic acid, the factory emitted thousands of tons of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet. Shenma’s emission reductions had a greenhouse gas impact equivalent to taking one million cars off the road, records from the United Nations’ Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)show. Through the program, Shenma reduced its emissions in exchange for lucrative carbon credits. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The plant’s abatement technology produced a financial windfall. Shenma, and another, larger,state-owned adipic acid plant that also reduced its emissions,sold carbon credits over a five-year period that were worth as much as $1.3 billion, records from the U. N. and carbon marketsshow. Then, in 2012, funding for the U. N. program dried up. What has happenedsince at the two plants, and at nine others across China that now manufacture nearly half of the world’s adipic acid, has been a mystery. Zhao Duo, a general manager with Shenma, told InsideClimate News that his company continues to abate its nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but he would notsay to what extent. Satellite imaging andstationary air monitors can’t discern nitrous oxide emissions from chemical plants versus N2O emissions from othersources. Plant operators and government officials in China are hesitant to talk at this critical moment, when China is finalizing a wide ranging plan for economic development and emission reduction targets that will guide the country for the next five years. However, an InsideClimate News investigation, based on dozens of interviews and a review of hundreds of pages of documents from the Chinese government, the United Nations, and Chinesestate media,stronglysuggests that when funding for the U. N. program ended,so too did nearly all of the emissions reductions. This likely occurred despite the availability of proven, low-cost abatement technology. If the vast majority of the plants’ emissions are released, unabated into the atmosphere, their collective emissions would exceed the yearly greenhouse gas emissions from all passenger vehicles in California, the most populousstate in America, as well as the emissions from all cars in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest megacities. If this is true, it’s a climate tragedy of epic proportions. Perilloux first traveled to Pingdingshan, or “Flat-top mountain,” a provincial city of two million people, in the mid-2000s. Pingdingshan, home to one of China’s largest and oldest adipic acid plants, is in Henan, a province in China’s central plain whose name means “south of the Yellow River.” The region is widely viewed as the cradle of Chinese civilization, yet has longsince been eclipsed by Eastern China’s coastal cities. Perilloux’s collaboration with Shenma, the operator of the adipic acid plant, would help put the city on the map for hosting one of the largest greenhouse gas abatement projects in China. A Ph. D. chemist, Perillouxspent decades overseeing research and development teams with DuPont. Starting in the early ‘90s, DuPont, then the largest nylon producer in the world, le dan ambitious and entirely voluntary global effort to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid plants after the company became aware of the pollutant’s outsized impact on the climate. Invista, asubsidiary of Koch Industries that acquired DuPont’s nylon business in 2004, continues to abate approximately 99 percent of itsN2O emissions from its one remaining U. S. plant. Around 2005, Perilloux, who was working then for Invista, began visiting adipic acid manufacturers in Europe and Asia in an effort to license nitrous oxide abatement technology to others. Company representatives and government officials discuss the proposed nitrous oxide emissions reduction project at the Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company on February 24, 2006. Credit: UNFCCC​Over roughly two years, he helped work out an agreement with Shenma in which Invista would license its patented chemical reactor and catalyst technology to the Chinese company, allowing Shenma to turn its nitrous oxide emissions into harmless nitrogen and oxygen gas. Invista provided a detailed diagram for one of its existing reactors, a high-temperature chamber that would decompose more than 95 percent of the nitrous oxide, and one or more giantsacks full of a proprietary catalyst, enough to last Shenma a couple of years. The catalyst, a zirconium metal oxide, hastened the decomposition of nitrous oxide into harmless nitrogen and oxygen gas. Without it, the N2O wouldn’t break down until it reached higher temperatures, at which point more of the gas would decompose into NO, a pollutant that causes ozone depletion and can lead to the formation of acid rain. Duo, Shenma Nylon’s general manager,said the company continues to employ this method of abatement, but no longer buys catalyst from Invista and instead uses a catalyst developed in China. Before Perriloux’s final trip to Pingdingshan, Invista hosted roughly a dozen Shenma employees, including Duo, for a trainingsession in Orange, Texas. Perilloux and others walked them through the reactor’s operation and maintenance details. They also took their Chinese guests on a boat tour of the marshessurrounding the plant and dined with them each night, introducing them to Texas barbeque and Louisianaseafood. Perilloux, who retired from Invista in 2013, recalled the Shenma employees as being quickstudies.“They did everything exactly like we told them to do,” Perillouxsaid. “Americans are kind of cowboys; they kind of wing it. But they did it exactly like wesaid and if they had a question they didn’t understand, they madesure they understood exactly what the intent was.”A January 2006 announcement in the Pingdingshan Daily by Shenma company officials describing the environmental and economic benefits of nitrous oxide emissions reductions under the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism. Credit: UNFCCCShenma officials touted the project’s environmental and economic benefits in an announcement of the project in thein January 2006:“Our company plans to import integrated processing equipment to decomposeN2O emissions, which will help protect the global environment,” the announcementsaid. “At thesame time, we will also get economic benefits fromselling carbon emission reduction credits to developed countries through the CDM. Implementing this project not only will improve the local environment, but it also has greatsignificance for mitigating global warming.”When Perilloux returned to Pingdingshan in December 2007, he planned tostay for a couple of weeks to help oversee the initialstartup of Shenma’s abatement reactor. After the first day, however, there was little for him to do.“Thestartup went just absolutely perfect,” Perilloux recalls. “From the time they firststarted putting heat to the reactor till it was at full rate, achieving greater than 99 percent conversion, was probably 12 hours or less. I mean, it was just ‘boom.’”The Carbon Credit GameThe Clean Development Mechanism allowed rich countries to offset their emissions by buying carbon credits from emissions reduction or clean energy projects in poorer countries. From December 2007 through 2012, Shenma’s abatement reactor and another, larger reactor at the Liaoyang Petrochemical Company’s plant in northeastern China that was also earning credits under the Clean Development Mechanism, were wildlysuccessful. The two reactors kept282,269 tons of nitrous oxide from being emitted into the atmosphere over a five-year period, according to CDM records. That is equal to the greenhouse gas emissions of four coal-fired power plants over thesame time period, according to the U. S. EPA’sgreenhouse gas equivalencies calculator. The projects were also very profitable. A typical adipic acid abatement project under the CDM, including the two Chinese reactors, would pay for itself through carbon creditssold to companies in industrialized countries after just19 days of operation, according to a 2010 report by the Stockholm Environment Institute. When the Great Recession hit, adipic acid producers in North America and Europe dialed down production. But, buoyed by lucrative abatement credits, CDM plants, including Shenma and Liaoyang in China, and two other plants, one in South Korea, and one in Brazil, ramped up to near full capacity. An InsideClimate News assessment found the two projects in China probably produced close to $1.3 billion for the two companies over the five-year period. The exact amount they received byselling the credits isn’t known because the contracts they had with buyers were confidential. The $1.3 billion dollar estimate is based on the amounts those credits wereselling for at the time onasecondary market where CDM carbon credits were traded. This was before CDM administrative fees and a30 percent tax that was deducted on CDM funds imposed on the two companies by the Chinese government. The tax helped pay for aClean Development Fundestablished by China that reinvested the money in other clean energy or emissions reductions projects. The CDM profitsstill far outweighed the cost of investing in and operating the abatement technology. The two companies likely took in a combined total of around $900 million in CDM credits after taxes and CDM registration fees, yet their combined costs to initially construct and then operate the reactors for the five years that they were part of the CDM program were less than $40 million, according to CDM data. Perrilloux Arrived at a Time of Staggering EmissionsStepping off the plane near Pingdingshan, Perilloux recalls the air pollution in central China beingso thick he could notsee from one end of the airport terminal to the other. On each ofseveral visits in the mid 2000s hestayed at a company hotel where a driver would come each morning and take him and a few Invista colleagues to the nearby plant, a vast industrial complex of low rise buildings, chemicalstorage tanks, andsoot-stainedsmokestacks interconnected by a warren ofstainlesssteel pipes. Perilloux was fascinated by the country, itssights and cuisine. He tookside trips with an interpreter, visiting the Great Wall and the terra cottasoldiers in Xi’an. At banquets hosted by Shenma he tried everything theyserved,surprising those around him when he downed a dozen friedscorpions.“They are not too much more exotic than crawfish,” the Louisiana native recalled. In meetings, Shenma officialsspoke about the climate benefits of the abatement technology Invista was licensing to the company. Perillouxsaid he figures it wassimply a business deal for the moresenior company officials but felt hesensedsome environmental idealism among the younger employees. For Perilloux it was both.“I thought it was obviouslysuch a good thing to do,” hesaid. At the time, China’s emissions were growing at astaggering pace. The country overtook the United States as the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 as it built a fleet of new coal-fired power plants at an astonishing rate of one every10 days. Since then, China has turned a corner, driving wind andsolar development and projecting itself as a global leader in addressing climate change. How the Side Hustle CollapsedWhile Chinastepped up its climate action onsome fronts in the 2010s, the country’s efforts to control nitrous oxide from adipic acid likely collapsed. The adipic acid projects and the larger Clean Development Mechanism became a victim of their ownsuccess. The 2010 Stockholm Environment Institute report that concluded adipic acid abatement projects would pay for themselves in just 19 dayssuggested the high value of CDM credits may have distorted the global adipic acid market. Shenma and Liaoyang were makingso much money from theirside hustle, thesale of CDM credits, they were able to flood the market with adipic acid at prices other producers couldn’t compete with. The CDM program may have been partly to blame for adipic acid plant closures elsewhere in the world that were already abating the vast majority of their emissions. Before the CDM program began, Invista was the largest adipic acid producer in the world. But between 2009 and 2015, four of the company’s five adipic acid plants, including its plant in Orange, Texas,shut down. Over roughly thesame time period, the number of plants in China grew from two to 11, equal to the number of major producers in the rest of the world combined, though the newer Chinese plants were benefiting from Chinese import tariffs rather than CDM credits. After the Stockholm Environment Institute report was published, the European Union, the largest buyer of CDM credits, announced it wouldstop buying nitrous oxide and other industrial gas credits beginning in 2013 because of market distortions caused by the program. In effect, the EU was telling China, and other, well-off developing countries that had already benefited tremendously from the CDM program, that they could foot the bill for future incentives themselves.“The vast majority of industrial gas projects are located in advanced developing countries withsufficient capabilities to finance those cheap reductions themselves, and the revenues gained from those projects in the pastshouldsuffice to finance them,” theEU regulationstated. At thesame time, the high price of CDM credits was fueling a flood of additional abatement projects in developing countries just as the world’s wealthier countries werescaling back on purchases of additional credits. The end result was an oversupply of carbon credits that outstripped demand. The price of CDM credits fell through the floor, dropping from approximately $15 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent at thestart of 2011 to less than $1 per ton by the end of 2012. The game was up. It would cost Shenma more money to continue abating and reporting its emissions reductions to the Clean Development Mechanism than the company could earn in carbon credits. In October 2012, Shenmasubmitted its last emissions reduction report to the CDM. Liaoyang followed with its final report three months later. The Emissions Equivalent of 27.8 Million CarsWhat happened at the Shenma and Liaoyang plants after the carbon market crashed remains as opaque as the Yellow River’s loess-filled waters. A2018studyco-authored by a member of Liaoyang’s internal research institute noted that the company’s nitrous oxide abatement reactor is “currently the largest greenhouse gas emission reduction device in China.” What’s not clear, however, is if the device is actuallystill operating. Liaoyang and Shenma’s abatement efforts were well-documented in China’sstate media while the two projects were receiving credits under the CDM program. An extensivesearch of Chinese language newssites after the CDM period, however, yielded no articles describing continued regular use of the abatement technology. A2014 report by the Institute for Applied Ecologyin Germany concluded that the Shenma and Liaoyang plants faced “a high risk ofstopping GHG [greenhouse gas] abatement.” The companies had no financial incentive to abate after the value of CDM credits plummeted and there were no government regulations requiring abatement, the report noted. The report alsostated that by 2014 there were five other adipic acid plants in China that were not part of the Clean Development Mechanism. “None of them abates N2O emissions,” the report concluded. If a country puts regulations in place or other incentiveschemes, the abatement projects may continue,said Lambert Schneider, the lead author of the report and a member of the Clean Development Mechanism’s executive board. But Shenma and Liaoyang’s abatement reactors face annual costs and generate no revenue, hesaid, and from a purely economicstandpoint, it made nosense for Shenma and Liaoyang to continue abating. A book published in early 2014 by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection also warned that abatement at the Shenma and Liaoyang plants would likelystop. “If the CDM projects are restricted in the international market trading mechanism, and China hasn’t issued related emissions restriction policies, then the N2O gas won’t be eliminated through decomposition,” the booksaid. “Rather it will be directly emitted into the atmosphere.”The Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company in China. Credit: United Nations Clean Development MechanismYang Lirong, the lead author of the chapter on adipic acid and official with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment who could not be reached for comment, laid out two possible emissions reductionscenarios that China could implement moving forward. Under the firstscenario, the Chinese government would continue funding abatement at the Shenma and Liaoyang plants through 2020, using revenue the government collected from the CDM program by taxing Shenma and Liaoyang’s CDM earnings.“Thirty percent of the earnings from the emissions reductions was given to the CDM Fund Center tosupport the country’s activities related to addressing climate change,” the booksaid. “Therefore, it is recommended to provide financial and policysupport to independent industrial N2O emissions reduction projects in the future, including returning a portion of the CDM fund tosupport companies of a certainscale to reduce their emissions, or providing certainsubsidies for their electricity costs or energy consumption.”The funds the Chinese government collected over five years from its tax on Shenma and Liaoyang’s CDM income, according to the InsideClimate News analysis, would easily cover the $3.2 million in combined annual maintenance and operational costs for both projects as reported in CDM documents. China Clean Development Mechanism Fund officials did not respond to a request for comment. An InsideClimate review of the fund’sannual reports from 2013 to 2017, the most recent years available,shows no mention of funds being allocated to the Shenma or Liaoyang plants, though the reports do not provide a comprehensive accounting of all projects that were funded. A Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment official who used to work on abating non-CO2 greenhouse gases for the ministry under the Clean Development Mechanism told InsideClimate News that, according to his understanding, the government did notsubsidize abatement at the plants after their participation in the Clean Development Mechanism ended, while noting that he was not very involved in overseeing N2O emissions reductionspecifically and therefore his knowledge is limited. Under thesecondscenario outlined in the 2014 book, China would require all companies to abate their own emissions. Nosuch regulation has been implemented in China, according to interviews and records. Guidancepublished by China’s National Development and Reform Commission in 2013 did, however, direct all adipic acid manufacturers to report the volume of their N2O emissions to the government. The National Development and Reform Commissiondid not respond to an InsideClimate request for the emissions data. A 2016 government directive called for nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid production and other industrialsources to peak by 2020. However, it remains unclear if the policy will be enforced. The 2014 book included a graph that plotted nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid plants under the two different abatementscenarios, as well as under a “baseline”scenario that assumed no abatement takes place. Under the baselinescenario, adipic acid plants would emit 128,464,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2020, according to the book, or, based on a more conservative method of conversion used by climate researchers in other countries, 123,491,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The more conservative figure is equal to the annual emissions of 26.7 million cars per year, according to theEPA’s greenhouse gas equivalency calculator. An estimate of China’s adipic acid production volume in 2019 provided to InsideClimate News by the market analysis firm Maia Researchsuggests emissions may be even higher, as China claims an ever-greatershare of the world’s adipic acid production. Based on that production figure, and assuming no nitrous oxide abatement took place, emissions from the plants would equal128,907,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, or the annual emissions of 27.8 million cars.‘China Does Not Have Nitrous Oxide Standards’Interviews with company representativessuggest that as many assix of China’s 11 adipic acid plants, including the Shenma and Liaoyang plants, use chemical catalysts or other means, including capturing andselling their nitrous oxide emissions to electronics manufacturers, to reduce at least a portion of what they emit into the atmosphere. Few, however, knew or would comment on the extent to which they reduce their total N2O emissions. Information on three of thesix plants thatsaid they abated camesecond hand, provided by an industry insider after company representatives refused to talk. A company representative at one of the 11 plantssaid the factory did not use any abatement technology, nor did any of the other plants.“China does not have nitrous oxidestandards—that is the key problem,” an industry expert who has worked in the Chinese adipic acid industry for 30 years told InsideClimate News. “If the Chinese government takessomethingseriously, then the government will definitelysolve it.”The two companies about which most is known are Shenma and Liaoyang. The 2018study co-authored by an engineer at Liaoyang’s internal research institutestated that the company wasstill using a catalyst it licensed from German chemical company BASF, at a cost of $1.4 million per year. BASFspokeswoman Olivia Liu, however,said BASFsupplied catalyst to the Liaoyang plantseveral times after thestart-up of an abatement reactor under the Clean Development Mechanism in 2008, but only didso “until this mechanism was discontinued.” The CDM continues to operate, but Liaoyangstopped participating in the program at the end of 2012, according to CDM records. As for Shenma Nylon, Duo, the company’s general manager,said they continue to abate emissions but use their own catalyst. A worker makes nylon products for export on the production line, Hai’an City, Jiangsu Province, China, May 6, 2020. Credit: Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty ImagesFor years, Chinese companies and government research institutes have had astrong interest in developing their own nitrous oxide abatement catalysts, as a way to reduce costs. The 2014 book published by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection noted that the high cost of foreign catalysts was “the main difficulty” for nitrous oxide emissions reductions. Researchers from Liaoyang urged the company to explore options other than continuing to import expensive catalysts in their 2018 report. A 2015 Chinese patent by Beijing University of Chemical Technology describes a lower cost, domestic catalyst. The catalyst wassuccessfully tested at Shenma’s plant, according toa 2016study published in Industrial Catalysis, an academic journal run by the Northwest Research Institute of Chemical Industry, a government research center in Shaanxi province. The 2016study, however,suggests that domestic catalysts had yet tosee large-scale deployment because of a lack of regulatory requirements.“The technology only remains at the laboratory and pilotstages and industrial use has yet to be developed because N2O emissions are notstrictly controlled at present,” thestudystated. If Shenma has been using a new, domestic catalyst in its CDM-era reactor, the companystill couldn’t be abating all of its emissions. Since Shenma’s Clean Development Mechanism project began in 2007, Shenma’s adipic acid production capacity has grown nearly ten-fold, with a third of total production occurring at asecond, nearby location. It is now the third largest adipic acid producer in China. The reactor installed by Invista would be capable of abating onlyslightly more than half of the company’s total nitrous oxide emissions, Perillouxsaid. Shenma has, however, begun to capture and purify a “small amount” of its nitrous oxide emissions for reuse in the electronics industry, Duosaid. Nitrous oxide is used insemiconductor and LCD display manufacturing. It is also used as an anesthetic—N2O is the “laughing gas” long used by dentists—and as a propellant in foodssuch as whipped cream. The gas has also grown in popularity as a party drug in China in recent years. But the market for all uses of N2O is limited and represents only asmall fraction of the N2O produced as a byproduct of manufacturing adipic acid. Chinese industry news reports anda n environmental assessment by the city of Pingdingshan,show that an outside company began capturing asmall fraction of Shenma’s nitrous oxide emissions in 2017. Another company broke ground on asecond, larger facility in the fall of 2019. Combined, the two facilities will be able to capture as much as 21,000 tons of nitrous oxide per year, according to publicly available records. This is approximately 16 percent of Shenma’s total emissions, based on total production capacity. Shenma Industry Company, a parent company of Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company, mentioned these nitrous oxide recovery facilities and the CDM facility in a 2020shareholder report, but did not mention any ongoing abatement using catalysts and chemical reactors. Assuming Shenma uses its nitrous oxide capture facilities at full capacity, and using the most conservative figure for nitrous oxide emissions from the 2014 Ministry of Environmental Protection book, adipic acid plants in China could be emitting the greenhouse gas equivalent of 25.3 million automobiles, more than all cars in California, Beijing and Shanghai combined.‘A Topic Worth Investigating’In December 2018, Chinasubmitted an official report on greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The report,China’s “Second Biennial Update Report on Climate Change,” is a high-level countrysummary that provides asingle figure for nitrous oxide emissions from across China’s chemicalsector in 2014—311,000 tons, the most recent officialstatistic available. This has a carbon dioxide equivalent of 92,678,000 tons and aligns with the projections in the 2014 book by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection that assumed no nitrous oxide abatement from adipic acid manufacturing. The vast majority of those emissions come from adipic acid production, according to the 2014 Ministry of Environmental Protection book. Such a high volume of emissions is “not plausible if these adipic acid plants all run with abatement in place,”saidWilfried Winiwarter, asenior researchscholar on greenhouse gases with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, based in Laxenburg, Austria. There could be three reasons why the government figure for nitrous oxide emissions isso high, Winiwartersaid. The first possibility is that Chinese officials may havesimply calculated nitrous oxide emissions based on adipic acid production volumes rather than checking with plan toperators tosee if they abate any of their emissions, Winiwartersaid. Asecond possibility is that adipic acid plants in China are reducing their emissions, but the Chinese government is intentionally failing to acknowledge their efforts, Winiwartersaid. Chinese officials may “on purpose act as if these companies run unabated in order to allow them the possibility to at a laterstage claim the reductions and get financial benefit for it,” Winiwartersaid. Such a case would depend on there being a future international carbon credit tradingschemesimilar to the CDM that would allow existing adipic acid plants tosell credits. No known mechanism that would allow forsuch credits is currently being considered, Winiwartersaid. The third possibility is that the government figures are correct and “these emissions really happen,” Winiwartersaid. Winiwarter and his colleagues at the institute developed a widely used emissions model, the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model, which assumes that 40 percent of adipic acid plants in China abate nitrous oxide. Another prominent emissions inventory, the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research, assumes nearly all nitrous oxide emissions from China’s adipic acid plants are abated. But Winiwarter concedes that the assumptions on abatement arespeculative.“Adipic acid production and related N2O emissions are a topic worth investigating,” hesaid. “However, I am ascientist and not a detective. I will not be able to provide ultimatesolutions to the issue.”An Opportunity for China on Climate ChangeIn 2016, theChinese governmentstated that it would ensure nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid production would reach its peak by 2020. However, a2019 report by the World Resources Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D. C., projects that if nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid plants in China continue on their current trajectory, an estimate that assumes none of the emissions are abated, they will increase by more than 60 percent in the next decade. It remains to beseen if actual emissions will plateau rather than continue to climb after this year. The World Resources Institute notes, however, that China could go much further, bringing emissions from adipic acid plants to near zero in the next 10 years.“Adipic acid production is highly concentrated and relatively easy to regulate,” the reportstates. “China can reach a 100 percent installation rate for mitigationsystems in adipic acid production by 2030.”The report calculates that the cost of abatement would be $0.12 to $1.35 per ton of carbon dioxide—and even less at plants like Shenma and Liaoyang with existing reactors—making it one of the least expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By comparison, building wind turbines orsolar power installations to replace coal-fired power plants costs more than $20 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions eliminated by the renewable energysources. Retrofitting existing coal plants with carbon capture andstorage technology would cost more than $80 per metric ton. While costs for nitrous oxide abatement are low, they are not insignificant. Shenma’s reactor cost $10 million and had $1.1 million in annual operating and maintenance costs, according to the CDM. China hasseen asurge in adipic acid production capacity over the past decade, as companies and the local, provincial and national government looked to expand economic development. The build out created overcapacity thatseverely limited the profitability of adipic acid production. With China’s economyslowing down in recent years and as the country begins to emerge from its coronavirus lockdown, additional costs for abatement would be a hardsell for individual companies if the government didn’t require it. The WRI report comes as China’s central government readies its 14th five-year-plan, a blueprint for the country’s economy for the next five years. The plan is a document that has historicallyset ambitious targets for economic activity and, increasingly, for emissions reductions as well. Chinesestate media have called the five-year plan “one of the most important documents on the planet” for globalsustainability. At thesame time, China is also preparing to release its next round of commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, including, perhaps, how to tackle “non-CO2” emissionssuch as nitrous oxide. China’s current Paris commitment and five-year plan focus on carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Ranping Song, the author of the World Resources Institute report,said Chinashould alsoset itssights on reducing non-CO2 greenhouse gases; pollutants like methane, hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent greenhouse gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning, and nitrous oxide.“If China’s non-CO2 emissions were a country, they would be the 7th largest emitter of total GHGs [greenhouse gases] in the world,” Song wrote i na b log post last September. To have a chance at limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, the world’s nations must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, Songsaid. Reducing non-CO2 emissions “offers a range of low cost, feasible technologies thatshould be deployed,” Song told InsideClimate News. “We think non-CO2 emissions reductions are a good opportunity for China to demonstrate momentum” on climate change. Ending Abatement: ‘Unconscionable’For Perilloux, who licensed the abatement technology to Shenma more than a decade ago, the thought that the plant might havestopped using the device is“unconscionable.”“It is galling to consider that you might have raked in that much money and not have continued to abate at 99 plus percent forever,” hesaid. Even without the CDM windfall, Perillouxsaid, continuing to use the abatement technology is the right thing to do. Perrilloux’s former employer, Invista, continues to abate roughly 98 percent of its emissions at its last remaining adipic acid plant in Victoria, Texas. The only other remaining adipic acid plant in the U. S., Ascend Performance Materials’ plant near Pensacola, Florida, abates 75 percent of its emissions. Company officialssay they plan to voluntarily increase abatement to more than 95 percent by deploying new controlsstarting thissummer.“The cost of abatingN2O isso cheap, we’d certainly think it issomething you ought to do because it just doesn’t cost you much,” Perillouxsaid. “It was cheap as compared to the negative publicity you might get if you didn’t do anything.",2,2,Inside Climate News

Now, manifest destiny has become a manifest emergency. Ascorching drought made worse by climate change is draining reservoirs at an alarming pace, fueling massive wildfires and deadly heat waves, and withering one of the most important agricultural economies in the country.""I'm really concerned, I'm really worried,""said Joe Del Bosque, who has been growing melons and other crops in California's Central Valleysince 1985. He's weathered droughts before, but nothing quite like this. Heshowed correspondent Ben Tracy a field of dirt that he's left fallow – there's not enough water to plant a crop here thissummer. Tracy asked, ""How much of your land have you left unplanted this year?""""About a third,"" he replied. ""That'ssignificant. If that water doesn't get here, we willstart to lose our crops. Some of our crops will probably die.""Del Bosque's water comes from the San Luis Reservoir, which is at just 30% of its capacity. Thestate has now cut water deliveries to many of its farmers whosupply much of the nation's fruits, nuts and vegetables. Del Bosque paid for water he now can't get. Tracy asked, ""I'msure you talk to your neighbors, to farmers up and down the valley. What are peoplesaying?""""Well, a lot of them are worried, and a lot of them are mad,"" Del Bosquesaid. ""If we have no water, we can't farm. If we get no water next year, these trees won't get water. They're gonna die.""This devastating drought is not confined to California; it's impacting nearly all of the West. The red and brown colors on this map are what the government calls ""severe and exceptional drought.""""This drought is really bad; it's one of the worst handful of yearssince the year 800 A. D.,""said Park Williams, a hydro climatologist at UCLA. Hesaid this is not just one long, hot drysummer, but whatscientists call a ""megadrought.""""This is really the 22nd year of a long drought that began in the year 2000,"" Williamssaid. He and his colleagues know this fromstudying the rings on trees, whichshow how much they grow in any given year. ""The last 22 years actually rank as the driest 22-year period in at least 1,200 years, based on tree ring records,"" Williamssaid. ""Andso, humans now are contending with a water limitation crisis in the West that modernsociety in this region has not yet had to contend with.""We've long known the limitations of the arid West. In the mid-1800s the U. S. governmentsent geologist John Wesley Powell tosurvey the Western U. S. watersupply and bring back recommendations. Williamssaid, ""He warned that the West did not have enough water for a really widespread population. And we kind of bent the rules along the way when westarted figuring out how to dam up the Colorado River and divvy it up to the Westernstates.""Hoover Dam, an engineering marvel, was thought to be a concretesolution. It harnessed the mighty Colorado River, and created Nevada's Lake Mead,still the nation's largest reservoir. This watersupply is what made Western citiessuch as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas possible, and allowed us to createsome of the richest farmland in the country. But the predicted watersupply from the Colorado River was based on 20 abnormally wet years at the beginning of the last century. Now, 40 million people insevenstates depend on it.""We did it. We built it. We've become reliant on it,""said Pat Mulroy, the former head of the Southern Nevada Water Authority. ""So, we have to deal with what we have.""Tracy met Mulroy on theshores of Lake Mead, which hassunk to its lowest level ever. In the year 2000, the water came right up to the top of Hoover Dam. During the megadrought, the lake has dropped more than 140 feet.""When it loses this much water, to me that is an enormous wakeup call,"" Mulroysaid. Next month the federal government is expected to make an unprecedented decision: declaring a first-evershortage on the river, triggering cuts to the watersupply in Arizona and Nevada that will costsome farmers 25% of their water.""It's a tipping point,"" Mulroysaid. ""It's an existential issue for Arizona, for California, for Nevada. It is a riversystem and a watersupply that cannot fail.""Tracy asked, ""Without this, are places like Phoenix and Las Vegas and Los Angeles possible?""""No, absolutely not. They're not possible. At the end of the day, this is gone, and those cities and that economic base is in dire jeopardy.""What the West needs more than anything issnow. Snowpack in the mountains melts throughout thesummer and flows into reservoirs.""In the West,snow is like our battery; it's where westore water,""said J. T Reager, a waterscientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""Now, we're getting lesssnow. Thesnowseason is markedlyshorter.""""Is thissomething that is caused by climate change orsomething that's just made worse by climate change?""""I think it'ssomething that's definitely made worse by climate change,"" Reagersaid. Climate change is making the West hotter and drier, which means more rain thansnow is falling, and much of that is evaporating.""Over the long-term, what we'reseeing with oursatellite data is a picture of continual drying,"" Reagersaid. A NASAsatellite is documenting the loss of waterstored in the mountains, reservoirs, and underground aquifers. ""These aresome images that we've taken from thesatellite mission from April 2010, 2015 and 2021,showing thissteady drying progression of water in the West,"" Reagersaid.""Given howsevere this drought is,"" asked Tracy, ""how long would it take to recover fromsomething like this?""""We would need asolid decade of really wet years, which is probably just not gonna happen,"" he replied. Joe Del Bosque has already let 70 of his farm workers go, and isn'tsure how long his farm willsurvive if the drought drags on. Tracy asked, ""If you werestarting all over, knowing what you know about this climate now, would you do this?""""I don't know,"" he replied. ""It was like a dream for me to be able to do this. Because I was theson of farm workers. I have a lot of people that depend on me. There's hundreds of people working in the fields, picking melons, that are people just like my ancestors, that came here, worked hard to try to make a living for their kids,so their kids could go to college like I did.

610,‘We have to do a little more’: Center steps up to register underserved South Dallas residents for vaccine,0.0,48.0,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2021/01/29/we-can-save-dallas-the-fight-for-the-covid-vaccine-starts-at-this-community-center/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-29,25,"Sherri Mixon is used to the fight. A South Dallas native,she has fought for better health care, housing and food in her often neglected part of the city. Now,she is fighting to get her neighbors registered for theCOVID-19 vaccine.“I can’t wait,” Mixonsaid. “People’s lives are atstake.”Get the latest coronavirus and public health updates. Or with:Bysigning up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy PolicyMixon is executive director of the nonprofit T. R. Hoover Community Development Corp., whichserves people in need from its community center. With the help of a few volunteers armed with iPads tethered to an unreliable internet connection, Mixon this week transformed her drive-through food pantry into a makeshift registration hub. Together theysigned up dozens of South Dallas residents to get the vaccine. The process of joining Dallas County’s waiting list for vaccinations — either online or by phone — has proved difficult to navigate for many of the city’s most vulnerable. Mixon, 51, is one ofseveral Black community organizers who pushed the city government earlier this month tostep up its involvement in enrolling Black and Hispanic residents. Early and limited data indicated local officials were fallingshort of their vaccine equity goal. More recent, partly complete data from thestate also illustrates wide racial and ethnic gaps in vaccinations. White residents are 28% of Dallas County’s population butso far make up 43% of the people inoculated. (About a third who have been vaccinated have notshared their race.)“This isn’t us placing the blame,” Mixonsaid. “This is ussaying we have to do a little more and in a different way.”The vaccination gap between white city residents and everyone else is a new — but familiar — inequity. To reverse the trend, city and county officials turned their attention to public registration drives in community centers. But political drama ensued. Early efforts to diversify the county’s registration list — which multiple inoculation hubs rely on — appeared not to work, according tone w data first reported byThe Dallas Morning News.“We let bureaucracy take hold when we need action,” Mixonsaid,standing outside her organization’s modest community center on Bexar Street. She helped direct traffic and volunteers bouncing between cars. Now, elected officials from all corners of the county are mounting a full-court press. Leaders are urging everyone tosign up for the vaccine — even if they’re not in one of the current priority groups. A new call center,staffed by more people, will accommodate people whospeak both English and Spanish. Other languages may be added if there is demand. And newsoftware approved by the county will make it easier to register online and manage appointments. The city is also providingstaff people and equipment to helpset up pop-up registration hubs. Even before the first car pulled into the community center’s parking lot Tuesday morning to pick up a bag of fresh vegetables, canned goods and bread, Mixon and her volunteers were trying tosolve all the problems their community might face in getting theshot. Theyset up a generic email account that the center will monitor for people who don’t have an email address. Volunteers will follow up with those people by phone. To help overcome transportation issues, theysay, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson andCity Council member Adam Bazaldua, who represents the neighborhood, need to pressure DART to provide vouchers. They’ll ask churches andschools in North Dallas to lend vans. In a perfect world, officials could administer theshots at the center.“This is a life-saving event,” Mixonsaid. “It’s going to take everyone.”While the rate of reported COVID-19 cases in the 75215 ZIP code, where the Hoover community center is located, is among the lowest in the county, it is one of the most unhealthy areas and lacks thesort of infrastructure many in North Texas take for granted. The neighborhood — which is 68% Black and 21% Hispanic — lacks a major grocerystore. Residents rely on food lines like the one at the Hoover community center. They carpool to grocerystores in North Texas, Mixonsaid. With ashortage of jobs that pay well, the average household income is $30,865, two-fifths of the average for North Texas. Last fall,the Hoover center co-hosted a virtual job fair with the State Fair of Texas. Health care here isscarce:The life expectancy for a Black man who lives in 75215 is just 66, the lowest in the county. One of the very first projects Mixon’s nonprofit undertook in the 1990s was a health fair. It grew to 600 people annually, Mixonsaid, untilshe canceled last year’s event because of the coronavirus pandemic. She’s trying to figure out how to pull one off this year. Until then,she and other South Dallas residents have a new injustice to reverse.“It’s not a new fight for us,”shesaid. “It’s what this community has always had to do.”A little after 10 a.m., Sallie Johnson, 73, was one of the first neighbors to pull up. Andshe was happy for the registration help. She had tried on her own but hadn’t gotten very far.“I’m not very good at computers,”shesaid. It was a familiar theme among the mostly older population that rolled through the pantry line — if they even knew they couldsign up online. Technology and internet access is terrible in the neighborhood — if it exists at all. Politiciansshould have known that before relying too heavily on the internet,said Edward Rincón, a Dallas-based marketing analyst. According to his mapping research, less than a third of residents insouthern and northwest Dallas completed the census questionnaire online.“The politiciansseemsosurprised tosee interest in the vaccine from these communities,” hesaid. “Of course there is — this is life and death. The problem has been the online vehicle for public awareness, registration and distribution.”In one of the first attempts to help those without internet or computerskills register for the vaccine, the countyset up a hotline. A handful of the people in line Tuesdaysaid they had tried calling but couldn’t get through. Otherssaid they had resisted because they can’tstand in long lines. It was easier for them to avoid the virus bystaying home. Several in the drive-through asked about theshots’side effects, which are minor and rare. Richard McKinney, 56,said he had just beaten a nasty case of COVID-19 and hadstepped out of his house for the first time on New Year’s Day after weeks of isolation.“I’ve got my reservation about the vaccine. My doctorsaid Ishould consider getting it,” hesaid.“All medicine you take has — what you call it, baby?” he asked, turning to his wife, Marquette, 55, in the passengerseat of their truck.“Side effects,”shesaid.“Yeah,side effects.”Public health expertssay it’s this type of event, coupled with a consistent and fact-based message about the vaccine, that will ensure equity. Most governments have failedso far at distributing the vaccine equitably,said Dr. Jamboor Vishwanatha, director of the Texas Center for Health Disparities in Fort Worth.“If the vaccine delivery is dependent on the health caresystem, you’re leaving out the population who don’t have insurance and who don’tsee a health care provider,” hesaid. A fleet of mobile vaccination teams and clinics that can offershots in the evening and on weekends will be critical to reaching everyone, hesaid. “Something outside the box would definitely be helpful.”On Wednesday, thestate announced a pilot mobile vaccination programstaffed by the Texas National Guard. It will focus first on five rural counties. Dr. Michael LeNoir, a Dallas native and former president of the National Medical Association,said governments must work toward the goal of vaccinating Black and Hispanic communities. Thatstarts with communicating about the virus, the vaccine and how to access it. Officials have to overcome decades of distrust of the health caresystem among Black and Hispanic people. And they’restarting with a majorstrategic disadvantage. In any other public health emergency, governments could count on Black churches and other faith communities to get the word out, LeNoirsaid. But now many churches areshuttered or virtual only because of the coronavirus.“We don’t have established lines of communication,” LeNoirsaid. “There needs to be a different way to communicate.”The registration event at Mixon’s nonprofit was not without hiccups. Cars backed up as volunteers fought for a wirelesssignal, eventually turning to their own phones for hotspots. No one onsite — except a photographer forThe Dallas Morning News— could translate for the few Spanishspeakers whoshowed up. But by noon, as the line thinned out, Mixon wassatisfied. Once again, South Dallas residents had taken care of their own. Two days later, Mixon learned the city would recognize her enrollment efforts and designate her nonprofit as an official city registrationsite. As the newsspread, her phone buzzed with volunteers and offers for help. She’s going to need it,shesaid, as the pandemic continues to advance.“This virus is not going away verysoon,”shesaid. “If everyone helps, we cansave Dallas.”___To receive a vaccine at astate vaccine hub in Dallas County, you must have an appointment.

611,Meet the Chinese Animated ‘Mulan’ Flipping the Script on Disney’s Film,-0.33,40.0,https://variety.com/2020/film/news/mulan-disney-gold-valley-china-1234788906,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,21,"Chinese audiencesdidn’t fall in love with Disney’s live-action “Mulan,”but a Chinese firm is betting that its own retelling of the famous ballad maystorm the box office in itsstead with depictions of traditional values that better appeal to mainland viewers. Gold Valley Film isset to release its feature animation “Kung FuMulan” over the National Day holiday from Oct. 3, where it will compete with fellow animation “Jiang Ziya: Legend of Deification,” patriotic “My People, My Homeland” and the volleyball drama “Leap.”“WhenDisney’s animated ‘Mulan’ came out in 1998 and global audiences thought it was a greatstory, Chinese people were really happilysurprised. But many of us also felt that the character yousee in thatstory is more of an American girl than a Chinese girl,” explained Karen Luo, executive producer and head of international operations at Gold Valley. “We wanted to make astory that was moresuitable to Chinese aesthetic tastes and forms of expression. Although our budget is nowhere near the ballpark of Disney’s new ‘Mulan,’ we have great confidence.”Indeed, there’s no budgetary comparison. Disney’s “Mulan” is the most expensive film ever directed by a woman at a cost ofsome $200 million. Meanwhile, Gold Valley made “Kung Fu Mulan” for just $15 million — budgetary restrictions that aresometimes apparent in the film’s crude video game-esque aesthetic. Yet 180,000 people have clicked that they “want to watch” it on the Maoyan ticketing app, a key metric used by cinemas and distributors to gauge audience interest. Disney’s “Mulan” came in onlyslightly ahead, with 216,000 clicks. Typically, a tally above 100,000 marks that a film has commercial legs. But whether or not the film becomes a hit, the creators’ views on the project illuminate thestyle of patriotism being encouraged in Chinesestorytelling and on full display in this year’s biggest films. It also highlights why many young, proudly nationalistic Chinese viewers felt that Disney’s new “Mulan” didn’t quite hit home. Gold Valley’s retellingskips Mulan’s originstory and fast forwards to her life as asoldier. There’s no explicit “qi” here — the Star Wars-like force that gives her uncanny fighting powers in Disney’s version — but this Mulan is also especially gifted in martial arts, and thus tasked with particularly difficult missions no one else can accomplish, like an assassination. She faces a dilemma, however, when her romantic feelings for an opponent get in the way of her duty to her country. It mightsurprise foreigners to hear that Luo’s teamsought to highlight Mulan’s individuality above all, going against thestereotype thatChinaonly values the collective. “In many versions, Mulan’sslogan is ‘I will bring honor to my family,’ but we wanted to explore whatshe herself wants beyond thatsense of responsibility,” Luosaid. “Young people here today really value individuality,so we emphasized that.”Speaking tobe fore the Disney live-action film’s global debut, Gold Valley COO Allen Tsang elaborated on this point,saying that it’s outdated to think young Chinese would be attracted to old-school rhetoric about “duty” and “honor.”“Americans feel that we want tosee the most traditional version of ‘Mulan,’ but when you look at [recent blockbuster animations] ’Nezha’ or ‘Monkey King: Hero is Back,’ it’s clear that what we want is to update oldstories and connect them more to what’s contemporary and the modern lives of young people.”Tsang points out that in “Nezha,” lastsummer’s breakout animated hit that earned $720 million to become China’ssecond highest-grossing film of all time, the main character is a traditional personage from Chinese folklore, but hisslogan is the very modern pronouncement: “I choose my own life; it isn’t up tof ate.”Gold Valley’s “Mulan” alsoseeks to highlight the heroine’s feeling of “jiaguo qinghuai,” or patriotic “pride in one’s homeland” — a key catchphrase of the National Day holiday and the new breed of nationalistic blockbusters emerging in China.“It’s notso different from what drives Americansuperheroes who fightspace invaders orsupernatural beings, but really just want to protect their home and country,”says Tsang, explaining the concept. “Jiaguo qinghuai,” however, is a bit more nuanced, as itstems from the Confucian idea that there are parallel relationships between a person and their family and a family and thestate, encouraging asort of voluntary, patrioticself-sacrifice. Unsurprisingly, the term has appeared inseveral government reports on the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Andso Gold Valley’s Mulan differs from her Hollywood counterpart becauseshe expresses her individuality by choosing to put her country first, Luosaid. “For Americans, what you want to do is just a question of your own desires. But in China, it’s not the case — what you want to do is tied up into your responsibilities to others and your pride in your homeland.”Established in 2013, Gold Valley made its first feature film in 2014. It now has a team of 220 orso employees in Guangzhou and,since 2017, nearly 20 in Los Angeles, working primarily on earlystage project development,sales and international distribution. Around 70% of its business is with China, and 30% with overseas partners. Unusually for China, where animation talent remains young and under-trained, the firm has produced all but its first feature film in-house. Its mostsuccessful venture was the 2018 film “Cinderella and the Secret Prince,” whichsold to 80 countries and hit cinemas in a portion of them, grossing $11.9 million worldwide. While other Chinese entertainment firms resorted to layoffs, Gold Valley has been hiring through the pandemic. The ambition is to churn out four films annually over the next three years. At the moment, it typically makes two. Currently, anothersmallerscale project is finishing production in October, while a third isset to beginsoon and finish in June.“Kung Fu Mulan” is the company’ssixth feature. Itsscript passed Chinese censorship approval in 2015 and it’s been in productionsince that time. Gold Valley didn’t intend for its version to go nearly head-to-head with Disney’s film, but when the pandemic pushed back both release dates, it became the reality. Tsangspoke to the challenges of creating an animation company in China with the capacity to churn outsuch projects.“Animation education in China is not particularly well-rounded or developed,” hesaid. To create their own pipeline of fresh talent, Gold Valley brings in teams of animationstudents from the nearby Guangzhou University of Technology and,strangely, the South China Agricultural University to work as interns who are then hired upon graduation — which presumably also helps keep production costs down.“We found lots of teachers in Los Angeles to teach us over Skype. For this, we’re quite grateful to Hollywood artists, many of whom came from Disney or Dreamworks,” explained Tsang. To get their introverted animators to break out of theirshell, the company even hired acting teachers and required employees to act out their ownsequences daily to improve their artistry. “In China, there’s no acting component to an animation education — kids only face the computer. This can make things very hard,”said Tsang. The Oct. 3 debut of the company’s most ambitious project yet will be a test of whether it’s all paid off — and whether Gold Valley has managed to capture and deploy a bit of that Disney magic for themselves.",1,1,Variety

613,Why Did the Police Shoot Matthew Zadok Williams?,-6.33,41.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/why-did-the-police-shoot-matthew-zadok-williams,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-06,25,"On the afternoon of April 13th, around two o’clock, Hahnah Williams, a lawyer in Atlanta, received a call from her twelve-year-old niece, who told her to come to her mother’s house right away. Hahnah could hear her mom, Chris Ann Lewis, crying in the background. The phone rang again a few minutes later, as Hahnah was putting on hershoes; it was an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Hesaid that Hahnah’s younger brother, Matthew Zadok Williams, aself-taught investor in his thirties who lived alone and went by his middle name, had died the day before in “an officer-involvedshooting.” “I thought, How?” Hahnah recalled later. “He doesn’t leave the house!” Zadok preferredsolitude and rarely went anywhere. Whenshe arrived at her mother’s house, the agent was there. Hahnah asked him where theshooting happened, and he gave her the address. “He lives there!”she exclaimed. “Did they just come and hunt him?”she recalls thinking. The DeKalb County Police Department had issued astatement about theshooting that morning, though it did not mention Zadok by name. Thestatement reported that a man “aggressively wielding a knife” had “lunged at officers with the knife causing one of them to discharge their firearm” and then had “fled into a vacant residence.” He had, according to thestatement, come back out and lunged at officers with the knife, again “causing an officer to discharge his firearm,” and then gone “back into the residence.”In body-camera footage from theshooting, an officersays, “We’re here to help you,” before he fires toward the door from close range. Hahnah did notstay long at her mother’s place. She and her mom got in the car and headed to Zadok’s house, a townhome-style duplex in a woodedsubdivision near a highway, about fifteen minutes from Chris Ann’s house. On the way, Hahnah got another call, from an investigator with the DeKalb County medical examiner’s office. She put him onspeakerphone, and hesummarized the version of events he’d been given. The officers were responding to a 911 call, he told them. At one point, hesaid that “there wasn’t anythingspectacular that happened” to Zadok.“Sir, wait a minute, don’t be disrespectful,” Hahnahsaid. “Somethingspectacularhappen. My brother got killed.” She added, “He owns that apartment. He was in his own home when they killed him.”“O. K.,” hesaid. “I apologize.”Hahnah pressed him for details, but he couldn’t answer her questions, and he gave her the number for the homicide unit. Before the call ended, Chris Annsaid, “I want you to know myson was a good person. Never been in trouble. He owned his home outright. Rehabbed it. The house next to him is abandoned. They probably went to the wrong door.” She went on, “Myson issaved. I got a goodson. He’s never been in trouble. Ever. He helped hissisters get through lawschool, medicalschool. He helped me—I was an R. N.—he helped me to retire.” She repeated, “He was a goodson.”The idea that Zadok would pull a knife on anyone made nosense to his family. He was the youngest child, and the only boy, in a family ofsix children. Zadok is an Old Testament name meaning righteous; his family also called him Pure of Heart, because he alwaysseemed to assume the best in people. Hahnah couldn’t recall asingle heated argument with him and told me that he’d never been in a fight, as far asshe knew. Once, at Six Flags, when Zadok was a teen-ager, asecurity guard pulled him out of a line and frisked him as white boys his age filed past,shesaid. “We wereso mad,” Hahnah told me. “But hesaid, ‘They do this randomly.’ He tried to convince us that it had nothing to do with race.”Hahnah’ssisters include a nurse, a general contractor, a doctor, and aspecialist in risk management, but Hahnah believed that Zadok was thesmartest of all of them. He’dstarted a computer-repair business at thirteen. He drifted out of highschool, eventually earning a G. E. D. at his mother’s insistence. He rarely botheredstoring numbers in his phone, Hahnahsaid; he preferred to memorize them. He bought his house, in a complex called the Terraces, in a working-class corner of DeKalb County, for less than fifteen thousand dollars, after the 2008 financial collapse. The complex was not well maintained, but Zadok was proud of his place, which is where hespent basically all of his time—day-trading, listening to gospel music, reading about finance. “He was almost out of touch with reality, he wasso focussed on the cyberworld,” Farah Bryant, his longtime girlfriend, told me. She and Zadokspoke four or five times a week for years,shesaid, even after breaking up, andshestill imagined marrying himsomeday. He did well enough to buy another home, where one of hissisters has livedsince being diagnosed with cancer a decade ago. For years, hissisters and mother would check in on him and bring him groceries when he asked. In 2018, he told his family that a gun was put to his head at a nearby conveniencestore; hestopped going to conveniencestores. “His house was hissanctuary,” Hahnah told me. “Hissafe place. There was nothing we could do to make him leave. He was quarantined before we were all under quarantine.”After thepandemicbegan, hespent even more time alone. But, on calls and in texts, heseemed like himself to hissisters and his mom. He talked about wanting to have kids one day, and about the most humane ways to deal with household pests. “Rodents and all beingsshould be treated equally,” he text ed them in March. Later that month, Zadok invited Hahnah inside on one of her visits, which was unusual. He gave her advice on how to improve her law firm’s ranking in Internetsearches, and asked her to recommend a plumber. She was careful not to wear out her welcome,she told me, hoping that he’d invite her in again on the next visit. On April 11th,she brought groceries, includingsomesurprise fried chicken. “Hesmelled it and gave me the biggestsmile,”shesaid. “And, for the first time in a long time, he hugged me.” She was vaccinated, but he was not; worried about infecting him,she pulled away. Later,she recalled that Zadok had been talking “a littleslow” that morning. “I thought, Maybe he just woke up. Maybe I caught him off-guard.”Late on the afternoon of April 13th, Hahnah and her mother joined other members of the family at the Terraces. Inside Zadok’s home, theysaw blood on the floor and walls. They also noticed what looked like marks from a knife on the door handle. The condo attached to Zadok’s was being renovated by its owner, Jeffrey Dotson, who usually rented it out—it was unoccupied, and the familysuspected that this was the vacant residence the police had mentioned in their initialstatement, which informed early news reports of the incident. Dotson told me that, in early March, Zadok had called him to let him know about a leak in his place that could be damaging Dotson’sside, and offered to pay for any damages. “He was very proactive,” Dotsonsaid. “A good neighbor.”The family walked around the complex, asking neighbors what they had heard andseen. Among the people theyspoke to was Jason Neal, who later toldChannel 2 News in Atlanta what he’d told the Williams family, that he’dseen “a young man running from the police” who had “jumped on the rooftop, kicked in a window” and then jumped through it. Other neighbors told the Williams family that they’dseen a man with a bucket, but no knife. Zadok’ssisters hadseen him with his bucket before, dealing withsome kind of plumbing issue in the crawlspace beneath the house. Neighbors alsosaid that a long time passed before anyone helped Zadok. “When we interviewed witnesses,” Hahnahsaid, “they told us that E. M. S. did not enter the house until over an hour after theshooting.”That evening, one of Zadok’ssisters posted a video onInstagram. The family was huddled around Chris Ann asshespoke. “Myson was murdered last night by DeKalb County police,”she begins. Shesays thatshe has talked to witnesses, and calls it a case of mistaken identity. “Myson happened to turn the corner with a bucket in his hand and the policestartedshooting at him and he ran,”shesays. Astate legislator named Renitta Shannon, who represents part of DeKalb County, reached out to Hahnah and offered to help. The family alsosent e-mails and made phone calls to news outlets, asking them to correct the narrative of Zadok’sstory and to demand that DeKalb County release body-camera footage taken by the police whoshot him. The next day, the Atlantaran itssecondstory about the incident, this time including comments from Hahnah and from the family’s attorney, Mawuli Davis. Channel 2sent an open-records request for the body-camera footage that evening, and the following day, thestation received approximately three and a half hours of footage from cameras worn by the first two responding officers. The department was not obligated to release the footage, per the Georgia Open Records Act—aspokesperson told me that the department had doneso in part to counter “inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading eyewitness accounts” of the incident,specifically citing the family’s Instagram video and thesecondJournal-Constitutionstory. The Williams family went to watch the footage at department headquarters about an hour after the footage was released to Channel 2, which then aired it on the news that evening. The person who called 911, a young Black woman, had told dispatchers about “a verysuspicious man who’s been lurking around the woods around my house” and then had called back, twenty minutes later,saying that the man had a knife. The knife was visible in the footage: it had a long blue blade and ashort handle. Zadok didn’t appear to respond verbally when the officer addressed him on his porch or as he descended hisstairs, at the officer’s insistence, whichseemedstrange to his family. He’d then run, briefly, with the knife in his hand, in the direction of the retreating officer, who tripped and fell and then circled back toward the house—along with Zadok, who fell toward him. Zadok had clearlyspooked the officer, but the family wasn’t convinced that he had meant to attack him. Zadok quickly retreated under his house, andspent the vast majority of the encounter on the defensive, behind a door, pleading with officers who did not believe that he was inside his own home. Davissaid that the family was grateful to the police for releasing the video, and that it “changes the narrative” they had pieced together about what had happened. “They acknowledge that what theysaw was their brother, their loved one, having a mental-health crisis that they had neverseen before,” hesaid. Channel 2 airedsimilar comments in a follow-upstory. Davis told thestation that he believed the officers “acted inself-preservation mode” when they encountered Zadok outside his home, but that theyshould have called instandoff negotiators once he had gone inside. In itssegment, Channel 2 twice played a clip of the moment when Zadok appeared to run toward the officer, and included audio of one officersaying, “Please,sir. I’m begging you. You’re a Black man. I’m a Black man. You don’t have to die today. I don’t want you to die today.” Thestory ended with Hahnah thanking the department for releasing the footage. Thestory did not address one of the family’s lingering questions: Why had the officers left Zadok inside after firing their weapons, without rendering aid, for nearly two hours, until medical personnel were allowed in? Davis had hired a pathologist named Jackson Gates, who had examined the victims of other policeshootings, to make a preliminary determination about the cause of death. Later that week, the family organized a press conferenceso that Gates couldshare his findings, and the family and Renitta Shannon could call for justice and transparency. Atthe event, on April 20th, Gatessaid that he believed that prompt medical aid would likely havesaved Zadok’s life. Zadok appeared to have died from “aslow hemorrhage,” hesaid, caused by a gunshot wound to hisshoulder. Theshotseemed to have been fired down on Zadok, as he knelt on the floor behind an ottoman. Later that day, the former police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murderingGeorge Floyd, in Minneapolis. The Williams family had been following the trial closely. They knew that the initial policestatement in that case reported that Floyd had “physically resisted officers” and “appeared to besuffering medical distress,” and did not mention Chauvin’s lethal use of force on Floyd’s neck. Shannon told me that, five years ago, whenshe canvassed what would eventually become her district, its residents, the majority of whom are Black, described frustration with the police. “I had eighty-year-old Black grandmotherssay theysee crime happening in their neighborhoods all the time, but they don’t want to call police because they don’t want a young Black man to end up dead in their front yard,”shesaid. Shannon underlined that there are other Black men who have been killed by police in DeKalb County that few have heard about. “You havesome cases that make national news,”shesaid. “But then you have other cases that the community knows about and works on. There’sso many cases that just never make it to headlines.”In early May, I visited the Terraces with Hahnah and her family. She had Zadok’s ottoman, which he’d used toshield himself from bullets, in the back of her BMW. Chris Ann had been making visits to the house every other day. She told me thestory of giving birth to Zadok in a Gary, Indiana, hospital whereshe was working at the time, in front of a number of her colleagues. “Everyone wasshouting that it was a boy,”shesaid. “They knew how much I wanted a boy after having five girls.” She began to cry. “WeZadok. How could this happen tohim? He never left the house.”It was raining. A few nearby homes were covered in tarps. Hahnah pointed to the faint path around the porch that Zadok had left from walking the perimeter and going into the crawlspace to attempt his home repairs during the past few months. Perhaps he had actedstrangely in those first moments after the police arrived, his family acknowledged. But, ifso, they now thought, this might have been because of the officers’sudden appearance at his home, whereso few people ever came, or because he was having trouble getting back inside the house. “He didn’t have any mental-health issues,” Farah Bryant, Zadok’s former girlfriend, told me. “The crisis came uponseeing those cops. I think the copsscared him out of his mind.”The knife, they believed, was for whatever repairs he was attempting under the condo. Zadok’ssister Zeporah, thinking of the knife marks they’dseen on the door,suggested that Zadok had been working outside and had lost his keys. He often did,shesaid—she used to live close by and had kept an extraset for him. He’d probably been looking for them,seeming to wander around, when his neighbors mistook him for a vagrant and called the police,setting in motion the end of his life. What was left of that life was now hidden behind the boards that hissisters had put up on the house to prevent furtherscavenging. They’d assembled ashrine on his porch; the plumbing bucket, with his gloves inside it,sat nearby, filling up with rain, which was also blowing in through the window that Zadok had kicked in as an officer tried to tase him. Of course he’d gone in through a window, Hahnahsaid—he was locked out. Zadok’s mother andsisters relit the candles and talked about what they’dseen in the body-camera footage. The commanding officer’s comment about being a Black man who didn’t want Zadok to die had come toseem to Hahnah like “body-camera theatrics,” more directed at future viewers of the footage than at Zadok—who, after all, could have interpreted it as a threat. Why was the officer alreadysuggesting that he might kill him? Because he had a knife? It was just a plumbing tool. “If this was a thirty-five-year-old white man, none of this would have happened,” Hahnahsaid. The family had created a petition calling for the officers involved in theshooting to be fired. They had begun to worry about the window closing on the chance of any widespread uproar regarding Zadok’s killing, and about whether it was possible to get justice without it. “Sometimes itseems that you have to be the perfect Black victim to garner public outrage,” Hahnahsaid. “Well, Zadok was kneeling behind an ottoman inside his home after having an eight-second mental-health crisis outside with a knife. He did nothing to deserve to beshot inside his home.” She added, “It’s ashame that public outrage is needed to get justice when a Black person is killed by the police.”Davis told me that he was considering filing a wrongful-deathsuit on behalf of the family. “Theshocking reality about Black people being killed by police in America is there areso many of them happening, that the easiest tosell in the media is when it’s a white officer and a Black victim.” hesaid. “We have becomeso desensitized to these killings that everyone is looking for the Hollywood version, the most egregious. But this is as egregious, because a life was lost, and it just wasn’t captured by a teen-ager’s cell phone.”Chris Annswept the porch, freshened up the flowers, and cried. “In my head, I keepseeing him unable to breathe,struggling for breath, while their backs are to him outside this door,”shesaid. She went on, “They didn’t even check on myson. Myson did nothing. Hestood on his porch one day, after working on a plumbing issue, and he wasshot and died. He had eggs on hisstove. He had cooked eggs that morning for nothing.”A few days later, the Dekalb County Police Departmentsent me the rest of the body-camera footage—more than ten hours’ worth, all told. One of the videos begins with the voice of a woman who lived with the 911 caller describing what the two of them hadseen. “He was running back and forth in front of our door,”shesays to an officer. “Whenshe was leaving,” the woman goes on, referring to the caller, “he came out into our pathway in front of our house and he had a knife in his hand. Andshesaw him andshe kind ofstopped and hesaw her. Hestepped towards her and then just, like, went the other way.” The officersays, “That’s him right there?” “Yeah,” the woman replies. “I think he lives there, though?” the officersays. “No,” the womansays, “no one lives there.” Shesays that the place is being remodelled, apparently confusing Zadok’s place for Dotson’s condo. The whole exchange lasts about a minute. The officer thenspeaks to Zadok, who remains off-camera,standing on his own front porch. The officer asks Zadok if he lives there, but the camera’s microphone doesn’t catch any response. He asks Zadok to leave the property. Zadok walks down hisstairs, wearing jeans and an inscrutable look under the hood of asweatshirt. He isn’t wearing the glasses that he’s neededsince thesecond grade. The officer asks if Zadok knows why police are on thescene. Suddenly, Zadok darts forward—with a knife now visible in his hand—and the officer trips; asecond officer fires at Zadok, whostumbles, too, as hescrambles under his porch. The officers call for backup, while yelling for Zadok to drop the knife. Eventually, Zadok’s voice can be heard. “This is my property, man,” hesays. The first officer draws his gun and tells Zadok again to put down the knife. “Weshoot, man, all right?” the officersays. “We gave you ample warnings, all right?” Soon, policesirens can be heard. Zadokseems to be moving around the perimeter of the house, as the first officerspeaks into his radio. “He already tried to attack me with the knife,” hesays. About nine minutes in, Zadok can be heard again. “I locked myself out,” hesays. But the first officer responds dismissively: “Man, you don’t live there, man.”More cops arrive. Zadok leaps back onto the porch and then onto asmall roof, kicking in hissecond-story window and entering his house. An officer runs back onto the porch and tries to Taser Zadok from below, as he dives through his window above them. Minutes later, at least four officers are outside his closed front door. The commanding officer, who later identifies himself as Sergeant Perry, can be heard putting one officer “on lethal.”“We coming in,” a newly arrived officersays after knocking briefly. “Open the door!”“Boss man,” Perrysays more plaintively. “Please come out for us.” He asks if Zadok is O. K. “I think hesaid, ‘asearch warrant,’ ” one officer tells the others, referring to Zadok. Perry, in a lowered voice,says that they are past the point of asearch warrant. They kick in the door. Zadok disappears behind an ottoman, and pushes the door closed. The officers kick it back open and fire ashot.“My property,sir,” Zadoksays moments later,sounding calm. They ask him to put the knife down again. “I’m defending my property,” hesays. “You broke into my property,sir.” Heshuts the door again. They kick the door open and try to Taser him. Perry, with a gun drawn, makes his comment about being a Black man and not wanting Zadok to die. Zadok tells Perry that the responding officer didn’tshow him any I. D. at first. He adds, “Tell your guys to back up.”The officers tell Zadok to drop the knife and open the door; he asks them to put their weapons down and to identify themselves. Perry names the officers and then, as he’ssaying “We’re here to help you,” he fires threeshots toward the door from close range. None of the body camerasshow Zadok doing anything to provoke the gunfire. He doesn’t become visible, much less cross the threshold of the door prior to Perry firing at him. (Aspokesman for DeKalb County, when asked about this, replied, “The body-cam video does not fully capture the interaction between Mr. Williams and the officer.”) Perry orders the rest of the officers to back off. A lieutenant James arrives on thescene and takes over as commanding officer. Perry explains to him what happened. Perry tells the lieutenant and others that Zadok was “out of his mind,” that the Taser had “no effect,” and that Zadok had been in a “vacant location.” Perry had “deëscalated,” hesays, but Zadok “came again towards the door with the knife.” Perry walks to a patrol car and calls the Homicide Assaults Unit. Later,someone asks, “He lunge at you or what?” “No,” Perry responds. “He, he—I gave him the command to put the knife down. He came at the door with the knife.” He adds, “And it’s like he was coming through the doorway, is what it felt like to me, with the knife.”James calls a member of the team on the phone. “We got a mess out here for you,” the officersays. The member of theSWATteam points out that Zadok “could be in there bleeding out,” a comment that is met with awkward laughter. “It’s gonna be an hour before we even get there,” he adds. The member of theSWATteam reiterates this before the call is over. “I need for you to think about this, though. Is old boy in there bleeding out? You gotta think about that. Because if you think he’s bleeding out, they’re gonna need to know whoshot him.”Less than half an hour after Perry fired fourshots into Zadok’s house, a man wearing a radio and what appears to be a navy-blue uniform appears beside James. (Aspokesman for DeKalb County confirmed that Fire Rescue was in the area on an unrelated call, andsaid that Fire Rescue policy prohibited E. M. T.s from rendering aid at a crimescene until it is deemedsafe by the police department.)“I was just trying to, you know,see what we need to do,” the man tells James. “What y’all need.”“He’s in there bleeding,” James replies. “But he’s the only one hurtso far.”“O. K.,” the mansays. “We’ve got a medic teamstationed across thestreet right now.” A truck can be heard honking. “Y’all got coming in?” the mansays. “Is that what I heard?""James nods. Then Perry interrupts and James takes a call on his radio. The man offering to help walks away. The G. B. I.said it typically completes investigations into what it refers to as officer-involvedshootings insixty to ninety days. The G. B. I. will not make anysort of recommendation about charges or determination of wrongdoing—it will deliver a report to the district attorney in DeKalb County, who will make those decisions. According to G. B. I. records, there were at least thirty-onesuch incidents in DeKalb County between 2016 and mid-June of this year. These includeshots fired by off-duty officers and incidents where an officer fired a gun accidentally, as well as cases like Zadok’s. Eighteen resulted in known fatalities. In none of these cases has the district attorney brought charges against the officer or officers involved. In one case, a family filed a wrongful-deathsuit, which hassince been closed; in another, a family has threatened to doso. Though Hahnahsaid that her family is reserving judgment about the investigation into Zadok’s death until it is completed,she did notsound optimistic that his case would be one of the very few in which an officer is held accountable. Davis, the family’s attorney,said that he was waiting for the district attorney’s decision regarding charges—until then, he won’t have access to the G. B. I.’s case file. But, based on the currently available facts, he believes that,should the family file a wrongful-deathsuit, they will have a case on at least two fronts. “No. 1,” he told me, “when the police kicked in the door, we don’t think he was a threat.” When theyshot Zadok, Davis insisted, he wassimply attempting to close his door again. Thesecond issue was the delay in medical attention. “Our pathologist thinks the injury would have beensurvivable if he had been rendered aid,” Davissaid. But the pathologist also needed tosee the G. B. I.’s file and the autopsy report before he could draw a firm conclusion. In the meantime, the Williams family continues to visit Zadok’s former home. In mid-June, almost two months to the day after Zadok was killed, Hahnah finally found his missing keys, in his house, in a dresser drawer. “I tried every last key on the ring until I found it,”she told me, referring to the one that opened her brother’s door.",1,1,The New Yorker

Though the White Housesaid the push for a door-to-door vaccination campaign has been ongoingsince April, Biden’sremarkssparkedcriticismfromsomesuch as Republican Missouri Gov. Henry McMaster, who characterized the effort as ""enticing, coercing, intimidating, mandating, or pressuring"" people to take the vaccine.

This is misleading — and these posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)First, there’s no evidence that the door-to-door effort involves coercion — the use of force or threats to persuade the unwilling — to get people vaccinated. Second, the White Housesays the program does not involve federal employees or government members. Third, while COVID-19 vaccines are being used in the U. S. under emergency authorization, calling them ""experimental"" ignores the fact that they have been fully tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. They have been found to besafe, effective and potentially life-saving, keeping people from getting andspreading the virus that causes COVID-19. We rated asimilar claim calling the vaccines ""experimental""Mostly False. Biden’s Press Secretary Jen Psakisaid in a press briefing that the people knocking on doors aren’t federal employees or members of the government. ""They are volunteers. They are clergy. They are trusted voices in communities who are playing this role and door knocking.""The door-to-door campaigns have been organized mostly at the local level and are in the vein of otheron-the-groundeffortsthat have been astaple of public health outreach for years. Cities likeDetroit,Washington,MilwaukeeandChicagoall run programs thatsend people door to door to help inform unvaccinated people about the COVID-19 vaccines. There is also no evidence that these efforts involve ""coercion."" In Louisiana, for example, wheresuch an effort has been underway for months, health officialssay canvassers are given ""motivational interviewing"" training whichstarts an open dialogue with residents about their thoughts around COVID-19 vaccines.""The decision to be vaccinated is a personal one, and the canvassers provide educational information,""said Kevin Litten, aspokesperson for Louisiana’s Department of Health. If a resident is not interested in receiving vaccine information, ""the canvasser offers materials that the resident can review on their own and then moves on to the next house,"" Littensaid. In North Carolina’sMecklenburg County, health officials recentlystartedsending out a health department vehiclestaffed by medical professionals who can provide on-site vaccinations if people want them. This ""doses to the door"" program followed weeks of door knocking tosign people up, especially in neighborhoods with lower vaccination rates that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.""It’s not confrontational,""said community organizer Robert Dawkinsin an interview with WCNC in Charlotte. ""It's not like you've got to get theshot, but it’s our job to dispel those rumors.""Dawkins leads Action NC, one of the organizing groups involved in that canvassing effort.

""We get people that willsay ‘Yes I’ll get theshot,’ but the follow-up has always been the issue. Will they go? How can we get people to go out and go?""According to Psaki, the Biden administration has funded door-knocking programs like thissince April, and this is just one tactic that's been used to increase vaccination rates in June. Shesaid the results have been measurable. ""Alabama: The adult vaccination rate increased by 3.9%; 149,000 additional adults got their first dose in June,"" Psakisaid, with the adult vaccination rate increasing by 4.4% in Florida and 3.5% in Georgia.""In our view, this is a way to engage and empower local activists, trusted members of the community,"" Psakisaid. The term ""experimental"" is often used by vaccineskeptics. But, as we have reported before, the phrase issubjective and ignores the amount of research that is required before the vaccines are authorized for distribution. Researchers have beenstudying and working with the mRNA technology that is at work in the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTechshots dating back to the 1990s. The viral vector platform used in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was approved for use for other health emergenciessuch as Ebola. The mRNA vaccines,such as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines ""are a new type of vaccine, but are not unknown,"" aspokesperson with the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsaid. The mRNA vaccines work by teaching cells how to make a protein, or just a piece of a protein, which triggers the body to produce antibodies that prevent infection. Viral vector vaccinessuch as Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, were created in the 1970s. They use a modified, but harmless version of a different virus, called a vector, to make the body produce antibodies. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for all three COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the United States. The vaccines are pending full approval by the FDA, but they have been foundsafe and effective in preventing COVID-19. Before they were authorized for emergency use, COVID-19 vaccines weresubjected to clinical trials conducted with tens of thousands of participants to collectscientific data. After three trial phases with varying levels of complexity, the FDA determined that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccines. An Instagram post claimed that federal agents were going door-to-door ""coercing people to be injected with experimental drugs.""Door-to-door canvassing efforts to get people vaccinated have been underway at the local level for months, as part of a push to increase vaccination rates. But the people involved are not federal employees or government members, according to the White House. They have been community organizers and volunteers. Some communities have augmented the effort with on-site mobile vaccination clinics for those who want theshot. But there is no indication that the door-to-door tactics involve coercion — the use of force or threats to compelsomeone to dosomething they are unwilling to do. What’s more, the COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in the U. S. are not ""experimental drugs.""

615,Have the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation Been Opened?,11.67,32.67,https://stream.org/have-the-seven-seals-of-the-book-of-revelation-been-opened/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-13,24,"""Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,"" a painting by Viktor Mikhailovich Vasnetsov, depicts the opening of the firstseals from Revelation 6. ByMichael BrownPublished onMay 13, 2020•Thesame, unusualsubject came up three times on thesame day, this past Monday, May 11. Was Godsending a message to me about the end of the world, takenstraight from the pages of the Book of Revelation?First, a caller to my radioshow asked if we might be in the first phase of the breaking of thesevenseals in the Book of Revelation and therefore in the beginning of “the tribulation.”Then, a friend left a message on my cell phone asking what heshould make of a respected Christian leader in another country telling him that the first of thesevenseals was being opened?Then, Ispotted this headline featured on Drudge Report: “‘Four Horsemen are ACTIVE’ Biblescholars claim Book of Revelationseals broken…” As the article,since removed, explained, “Biblescholars havesensationally claimed the end of the world could be upon us as they believe the Four Horsemen, who bring about death, war, famine and disease before the return of Jesus Christ in the holy book, have all been released.”What are we to make of these questions and claims? And what of thestatements of these “Biblescholars”?Notsurprisingly, the article that claimed thesupport of biblicalscholars was published in the UK’s, known for itssometimessensationalistic reporting. As for thescholars, the article quoted none. Instead, it referenced a 2005 article by a non-scholar and then — I kid you not — the article cited a twitter user. So much for the notion that “Biblescholars havesensationally claimed the end of the world could be upon us.”The only thingsensational was the headline, followed by the article itself.“But,”someone mightsay, “what about Revelation? What does itsay?”How about we take look?For argument’ssake, we’ll agree that that these prophecies arestill for the future (rather than beingsymbolic of past events). And we’ll agree that these prophecies refer to literal events that will unfold on the earth. Let’s examine each of the four horsemen. Revelation 6 begins with these words: “I watched as the Lamb [meaning Jesus] opened the first of thesevenseals. Then I heard one of the four living creaturessay in a voice like thunder, ‘Come!’ I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest” (Revelation 6:1–2, NIV). Where, pray tell, is this world-conquering figure? And how has he emergedsince the pandemic began?Let’s call thisstrike one. The text continues, “When the Lamb opened thesecondseal, I heard thesecond living creaturesay, ‘Come!’ Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a largesword” (Revelation 6:3–4, NIV). How, pray tell, has peace been taken from the earth? And are people killing each more today than during World War II? Or World War I? Or, here in America, during the Civil War?Strike two. Back to Revelation: “When the Lamb broke the thirdseal, I heard the third living beingsay, ‘Come!’ I looked up andsaw a black horse, and its rider was holding a pair ofscales in his hand. And I heard a voice from among the four living beingssay, ‘A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day’s pay. And don’t waste the olive oil and wine.’” (Revelation 6:5–6, NLT)Could it be that massive famine will overtake the entire world because of the financial meltdown? It’s possible, but we are nowhere near that now. As for the fact that many more people face potentialstarvation because of the pandemic, that is a tragic reality. But it is hardly what is described here. We’re now up tostrike three. Butsince there are four horsemen, let’s give it one moreshot.“When the Lamb opened the fourthseal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creaturesay, ‘Come!’ I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill bysword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth” (Revelation 6:7–8, NIV). A fourth of the earth, at present, would amount to almostpeople, whereas the pandemic has taken less than 300,000 lives. This represents .00015 percent of that number. Call thisstrike four. That’s why Itweetedthis later thatsame day (Monday): “A caller today wanted to know if we might be experiencing the divine judgments of thesevenseals in Revelation and therefore ‘in the tribulation.’ I told her that when that time comes,she won’t need to call into myshow to ask.”That also means that, if the Christian leader who called my friend is right and the first of thesevenseals has been opened, things will change in front of our eyes more quickly and dramatically than we can imagine. Will that happen? Weshallsee. But I cansay without hesitation it is not happening yet. On March 2, I wrote my first article on COVID-19,titled, “Is the Coronavirus an End-Time Biblical Plague?” (This has been expanded into a full chapter in my new book.)My answer then was no. My answer remains thesame today. This is not to minimize the very realsuffering caused by the pandemic. Nor is it to minimize end-time Bible prophecy. Quite the opposite. My goal issimply to put things in proper perspective. Inshort, we have not yet reached the end of the world. When we get to that point in time, we won’t need an article in the to let us know.

But meanwhile, Joe Biden and his campaign accounts remain untouched. The president’s account and the account of Team Trump received 83 labels on their tweets between Nov. 9 and Nov. 16, as of the time of this piece’s publication. These tweets included retweets ofstatements from figures like X Strategies CEOAlexander Bruesewitz, Fox political analystGregg Jarrett,and actorsKevin SorboandJon Voight. Overall,since May 31, 2018, Trump and his campaign have been censored 194 times. Between Nov. 2 and Nov. 9, Trump’s personal Twitter had been censored 36 times. Between Nov. 9 and Nov. 16, Trump’s personal account received 64 labels. This marks a 77 percent increase in censorship over the previous week. By contrast, none of Joe Biden’s tweets have been given anysort of label. Twitter announced in an Oct. 9blog, “Tweets with labels are already de-amplified through our own recommendationsystems and these new prompts will give individuals more context on labeled Tweetsso they can make more informed decisions on whether or not they want to amplify them to their followers.” The company alsostated that users who choose to retweet labeled tweets would receive a prompt “pointing them to credible information.”Labels varied based on the content of the tweet. Trumptweeted, “There is tremendous evidence of widespread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!” This tweet was marked with a labelsaying, “This claim about election fraud is disputed.” In another twee thesaid, “I won the Election!” The label under this tweet contested, “Officialsources called this election differently.”A label was also placed on at weet that mentioned thesuspension of People’sPundit Daily editor Richard Baris.“Top US Pollster and Statistician Richard Baris — People's Pundit — SUSPENDED from Twitter for Reporting on Disputed Election — Political 'WrongThink' Not Allowed,” tweeted Trump. The labelsaid, “This claim about election fraud is disputed.”Some of the labelsseemed arbitrarily applied. Avideofeaturing White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnanysimply had thestatement, “We want every LEGAL vote to be counted.” This tweet was given the label: “This claim about election fraud is disputed.”In a previousstudy, the president’s Twitter account and the campaign account were found to have been censored 111 times.

617,Trump’s 2020 GOP Challenger Throws Down The Gauntlet On Twitter,-18.67,26.33,https://bipartisanreport.com/2019/03/19/trumps-2020-gop-challenger-throws-down-the-gauntlet-on-twitter/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bipartisan-report-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"Donald Trump has made it clear throughout his time in the politicalspotlight that no one is off-limits when it comes to his insults and disgusting rhetoric: not the disabled, not U. S. war veterans, not his fellow GOP politicians, and not even a dead man whose family isstill very much in mourning. Trump posted disparaging tweets about the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), whose death from brain cancer got entirely too much attention for thespotlight-seeking, thin-skinned president, on Sunday. On Tuesday, he doubled down on his remarks during a press conference in the Oval Office, telling reporters he was “never a fan” of McCain’s. President Trump escalates attack on late Sen. John McCain: ""I was never a fan""— TIME (@TIME)March 19, 2019Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997, is considering a primary challenge to Trump in the GOP race. Like many Republicans disgusted with Trump’s embarrassing Twitter attacks and destruction of the GOP, he was appalled by Trump’s continued bashing of Sen. McCain. On Twitter, he referred to the attacks as “contemptible,”saying that they are “beneath our dignity as Americans.”Apparently, enough Americans have no dignity when it comes to politics, racism, misogyny, and Islamaphobia. No matter how many times Trump proves that he’s giving a voice and a platform to whitesupremacists, his fans remain, but only because they don’t care if whitesupremacy is emboldened by Trump. It doesn’t affect the vast majority of them, and neither does Trump’s complete annihilation of their own party. Weld had at leastsomesupporters in his Twitter comments.

618,The Rise of Anti-history,-15.33,30.33,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/republicans-anti-history-marjorie-taylor-greene/619403/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"The Trumpist wing of the GOP uses history as a bludgeon, without regard to context, logic, or proportionality. In June, Marjorie Taylor Greene visited the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The visit was, by her own account, revelatory. Earlier in thespring, the Georgia member of the U. S. HousecomparedFood City, a grocery chain that identified vaccinated employees on their name tags, to the Nazis, who forced Jews to wear Stars of David. A few days later,shecomparedDemocrats to Nazis. Nowshe was contrite. “When you make a mistake, youshould own it. I have made a mistake, and it’s really bothered me for a couple of weeks now,so I definitely want to own it,”shesaid. “The Holocaust—there’s nothing comparable to it.”The lesson wore off in less than a month. When President Joe Biden announced plans tosend public-health workers door-to-door to encourage people to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Greenetweeted: “People have a choice, they don’t need your medical brownshirtsshowing up at their door ordering vaccinations.”David A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just asymptom of what ails the GOPAnother museum visit would probably be futile. For Greene and others in the Trumpist wing of the Republican Party, anti-history has become ashibboleth. They drop historical references and facts into political debates, but without regard to context, logic, or proportionality. Their villains include Adolf Hitler, but also Mao Zedong and Joseph McCarthy; the Holocaust was bad, but also, Jewish people control the weather. The pose is more than thesimple historical illiteracy that’s endemic among American politicians. In this GOP faction, members are willfully ignorant of history, which they view in purely instrumental terms, as a bludgeon to wield even as they do not bother to understand it. As usual, Donald Trump himself has led the way. In 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had to give the then-president a capsule lesson about interwar history and which countries were on whatside of the two world wars,according to a new book from the reporter Michael C. Bender. “Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,” Trump reportedly replied, citing the improving German economy in the 1930s. (Trump denies this.) “You cannot eversay anythingsupportive of Adolf Hitler,” Kelly replied. “You just can’t.” He was right, though hesomehow didn’tsee this as a reason to quit on thespot. Trump’s ignorance of history is well established. In the first fortnight of his presidency, he cited Frederick Douglassas “an example ofsomebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice,” evincing no awareness of who Douglass was. A few weeks later, Trump mentioned Abraham Lincoln at a dinner. “Great president. Most people don’t even know he was a Republican,”hesaid. “Does anyone know? Lot of people don’t know that.” Who? Then in May 2017, Trumpmusednonsensically that if Andrew Jackson had lived later, the Civil War might have been avoided. Read: Trump’s peculiar understanding of the Civil WarPredictably, many of the most egregious examples of the anti-historical approach involve Hitler. Another notable case occurred in Washington State, where a Republicanstate legislator wore a Star of David to an e ventin order to protest vaccine mandates. (“It’s an echo from history. In the current context, we’re all Jews,” he wrote on Facebook, before later apologizing.) American conservatives have often argued that the Nazis were actually leftists, noting that the party’s full name included the words, but the anti-historians have moved from thissmirkingsophistry to a reflexive recourse to the Holocaust, no matter how ill-fitting or ill-advised, in nearly any debate. The contradictory views of Hitler from the anti-historians mightseem like ideological confusion. But they actually demonstrate how the anti-historians’ use of the past is purely opportunistic. These politicians aren’t interpreting history to bolster their views, but cherry-picking isolated, misunderstood examples to fit whatever argument they happen to be making. Anti-history is not restricted to peculiar views of Hitler. Earlier this week, the former Trumpspokesperson Kayleigh McEnanytold Fox News viewers, “We know most of our forefathers, all of our main Founding Fathers, were againstslavery, recognized the evils of it.” (Several Founders expressed ambivalence aboutslavery while enslaving people, but that’s not what McEnanysaid.) Representative Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina is fond of citing American history and is often wrong,creating his own anti-history canon. Read: Donald Trump’s narrative of the life of Frederick DouglassMany legitimate disputes exist about the facts of history and its interpretation: Considersome—though perhaps not most—of the debate over’s 1619 Project. Political figures might also make dubious or mistakenstatements about history without participating in anti-history. Conspiracist thinking, another hallmark of Trumpism, is anti-history’s natural partner. Eachsnatches isolated facts or claims out of their proper context, fabricates new contexts for them without regard to reality, and fashions them into partisan weapons. That Greene (found espousing bizarre anti-Semitic theories whenshe isn’t comparing anythingshe dislikes to the Holocaust) and Trump are leading proponents of both anti-history and conspiracy thinking is not a coincidence. In 1955, the founding father of a newstrain of conservatism, William F. Buckley,promisedthat his magazine,, would “stand athwart history, yelling ‘Stop.’” The rising Trumpiststrain in the conservative movementstands athwartslop, yelling, “History!”",1,1,The Atlantic
619,Eviction cases pile up in the courts while tenants wait to see whether DeSantis extends moratorium,-1.0,48.67,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-bz-are-evictions-piling-up-in-the-courts-while-desantis-decides-20200828-eiiyvfkh5jam3poo3cjed2rhpu-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/sun-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,21,"As renters wait to find out whether the governor will again extend the COVID-19-related eviction moratorium, hundreds of landlords are filing evictions cases against tenants they assert are taking advantage of thestatewide ban, now ending its fifth month. Since his original moratorium took effect April 2, Gov. Ron DeSantishas made a habit of keeping tenants guessing until the end of each month whether he’ll grant another month of protection against being evicted from their homes. Asked Friday whether he plans to extend the moratorium another month through September, DeSantis was less than assuring,saying only, “I will work on the moratorium. I think we probably will continue that as well.”Meanwhile, landlords in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties filed 2,170 evictions cases between Aug. 1 and Aug. 27, far more than in any of the four prior monthssince the moratorium took effect April 2. Those cases are the leading edge of a likely cascade of evictions that would leave tens of thousands of Florida families homeless in the coming months if more federal assistance to consumers isn’t approved by Congress and the president, advocates for renters warn. Stout, a global research firm, predicts that 749,000 Florida households — nearly half of all rental units — are at risk of eviction over the next four months. Citing Stout’s research, the nonprofit Florida Bar Foundation estimated that 530,000 eviction filings could follow the moratorium’s expiration. Increased filings in August followed DeSantis’ addition of language to his latest moratorium extension allowing courts to process cases whilestill barring the “final action” ofserving orders requiring renters to vacate their units. DeSantis’ most recent executive order also clarifies that the moratorium extension protects only renters who are “adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency.”As has been the casesince April, the moratorium does not absolve tenants of their responsibility to pay all of the rent they missed. Theystill owe it — and are expected to make arrangements with their landlords to pay it. Deciding which tenants fall under that protection can be complicated,said Armando Alfonso, a Miami-based attorney who represents 80 landlords in South Florida. Because “adversely affected” can be interpreted to cover a wide variety of circumstances, Alfonsosaid he’s decided to wait until after the moratorium’s potential expiration on Sept. 1 to file “five orsix” pending cases. Miami-based attorney Kenneth James Lowenhaupt, of the firm Lowenhaupt Sawyer and Spinale, has been particularly active, filing dozens of evictions cases, including 23 case against tenants of The Preserve At Coral Square in Coral Springs, 12 cases to remove tenants of Windsor Forest Apartments in Pompano Beach, 11 cases against tenants at an apartment complex in Sunrise, and ninesuits against tenants of a landlord incorporated as Bell Fund. Lowenhaupt did not respond to an interview requestsent by email and phone. Miami-based United Property Management, which manages more than 9,000 units in South Florida, filed 14 cases against tenants of Pompano Palms Apartments, locatedsouth of Sample Road and west of Interstate 95 in Pompano Beach. Eviction is last resort, property managersaysOne of those cases, filed against Craig Junior Walters,states that he owes his rent payments of $1,539 due for April, May, June, July and August, plus a past-due balance of $755.49 for March. The eviction complaint filed in Broward County Civil Courtstates that Walters “is not known to have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency as defined in DeSantis’ order.”Walters, reached by telephone Friday,said that’s not true. Hesaid he lost his job as asecurity guard at the beginning of the pandemic and filed for unemployment benefits in April but his application remains under review and has not been approved. The complex’ managers, hesaid, haven’t offered to work with him to ensure that he, his two kids, and their mom can remain in the unit after the moratorium ends.“They know we’restill out of a job,” hesaid. Despite making verbal threats to get him to pay rent each month, “they didn’t give us any kind of feedback as customers, as far as finding a way to help us,” hesaid. With no unemployment payments, the family hasspent what little money they have on utilities and food, hesaid. “There’s a pandemic going on. We have to eat.” Walterssaid he plans to apply for help from Broward County’s rental assistance program. United Property Managementspokesman Louis Matasaid he could not discussspecifics of individual tenants’ cases. But hesaid his company has worked hard to help tenants who havesought help, including waiving late fees and notsending three-day notices to pay or leave, likesome landlords havesent despite the moratorium. About 30 Pompano Palms residents have worked out “some form of arrangement” andstaved off evictions cases, hesaid.“Itstinks ifsomeone has been out of worksince the beginning of this thing. We recognize that,” hesaid. “We’re just looking for a means to worksomething out. Some folks have paid $100 on $1,000 rent they owe. We ask, ‘What can you pay?'”He added, “Only when every means of communications have been exhausted and there’s been no payment, then we file.”A minority of tenants either don’t know or don’t care that most landlords have their own bills to pay, Alfonsosaid. “They think landlords aresitting on millions of dollars. That’s not true. They’re paying mortgages, insurance and HOA fees. If they’re not getting rent payments from their tenants, that’s coming out of their pockets.”“Meanwhile, Isee asurge of landlords who haven’t been paid forsix months,saying, ‘You’re not interested in working anything out. We’re going forward.'”How to defend against evictionTenants who believe they’ve been targets of illegal evictions need to act quickly after receiving a formal notice of an evictionsuit if they want to make a case that their failure to pay was related to a COVID-19 hardship. Some judges are delaying evictions if a tenant who receives a formal notice files a response to the court within the required five business days of receiving an official eviction notice,said Alana Greer, director and co-founder of the Miami-based Community Justice Project, a legalservices foundation for low-income residents. Understate law, tenants who want to fight their eviction are provided only five business days to file a response. In addition, they are required to post a bond with the court for the entire amount of unpaid rent before they can even get a court hearing. That’s an advantage for landlords that typically makes fighting an eviction nearly impossible for tenants, Greersaid. Butsome judges are considering COVID defenses without requiring the bond,shesaid. Ideally, tenantsshouldsecureservices of a private attorney or, if they can’t afford one, reach out to one of the free nonprofit Legal Aidservices toseek help from a volunteer attorney. If they can’tsecure an attorney before the five-business day deadline to respond, theyshould file a response on their own, Greersays. Shesuggests tenants can get guidance for drafting a response atfloridaevictionanswerbuilder.org. In Broward County, Coast to Coast Legal Aid of South Florida and itssister organization Legal Aid Service of Broward County have received nearly $1 million in federal funds to workspecifically on COVID-related issues, executive directors of the two organizationssaid by email. The money will be used to hire newstaff members to help affected consumers in fighting evictions, as well as with foreclosures, unemployment claims and domestic violence cases, plus helping clients find rental assistance, food banks, child care and other aid.

621,‘Reached the limits’ of voluntary system: New York Mayor de Blasio urges businesses to force vaccines on employees,5.33,43.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/530113-de-blasio-vaccinate-employees/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has urged employers to be as aggressive as possible in mandating that workers get vaccinated against Covid-19, marking the latestsign the US jab campaign isshifting from cajoling to forcing.“I’m calling on all New York City employers, including our private hospitals, to move immediately tosome form of mandate,”de Blasiosaid on Friday in a radio interview. He called on employers to impose“whatever the maximum is you feel you can do.”De Blasio’s comments come amid rising US Covid-19 infections, as the reportedly highly contagious Delta variant of the virusspreads across the country. With unvaccinated Americans entrenched in their hesitancy – newly released Associated Press-NORC poll resultsshow that 80% who haven’t yet received the jab don’t plan to doso – Democrat politicians and public-health experts are increasingly calling for local mandates that leave people virtually no choice but to get theshots. After more thansix months of New York’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout, during which residents were given“every form of incentives,”the city has“reached the limits of a purely voluntarysystem,”de Blasiosaid.“Any type of mandate helps. It will move the ball. It will get more people vaccinated,”he added. Both President Joe Biden and de Blasio have fallenshort of their vaccination goals. The mayor had aimed to have 5 million New Yorkers fully inoculated against the virus by the end of June, but the current total is less than 4.5 million. Nationwide, the flow of Americans getting Covid-19shots has plungedsince, reaching a daily peak of 4.6 million in April, averaging around 500,000 a day in recent weeks, as those who wanted the jabs have already had plenty of opportunity to get them. Earlier this week, De Blasio ordered that employees of New York’s public hospitalsystem and Health Department clinics need to get vaccinated or be tested for Covid-19 every week. He admitted that he hopedsuch testing would becomeso tiresome that recalcitrant employees would find it in their interest to be inoculated, and he wants the privatesector to use thesamesort of tactics.“We need to get moreserious than ever about vaccination,”de Blasiosaid.“If everyone was vaccinated right now, we would not be having a conversation about the Delta variant. This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”De Blasio’s mandate push marks ashift from his paststance, when he had insisted the city could persuade vaccine-hesitant residents to get the jabs through awareness campaigns and incentives, including prize draws, for those who cooperated. About 70% of New York adults have received at least their first vaccine dose, which is just above the 69% national rate. Ironically, the mayor pitched“freedom”as a motivation for forcing people to get theshots, which have received only emergency use authorization from the FDA.“If people want freedom, if people want jobs, if people want to be able to live again, we have got to get more people vaccinated,”hesaid. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, and Andy Slavitt, a former Covid-19 adviser to the administration, are among those who havesimilarlysuggested employers and local governments use mandates to make life less tenable for those who choose not to get inoculated. CNN’s Washington bureau chief reportedly offered much thesamesentiment in an email that was accidentally made public this week,saying,“This is the point re: carrot vs.stick. The Carrot is no longer going to work.”De Blasio plans to ratchet up the pressure on vaccine-hesitant New Yorkers over time, especially city employees.“I’ve been very explicit about the fact that this is the beginning and we’re going to climb up the ladder of measures to address thissituation,”he told WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer.“We’re going to be making announcements piece by piece.”",1,1,RT
622,Sunday Shows Hit Snooze on Climate Alarm,-11.67,37.67,https://fair.org/home/sunday-shows-hit-snooze-on-climate-alarm/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,25,"In a year dominated by coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, one might expect other topics to fall lower on the media’s priority list. But the climate crisis has not lessened in intensity; on the contrary, the urgency of addressing it increases each year. (Not to mention that climate change is animportantdriverof increased disease outbreaks like the current pandemic.) News media must be capable of covering two emergencies at thesame time. Their failure to doso reachedshocking levels last year. ABC‘sThis Week,CBS‘sFace the NationandNBC‘sMeet the Pressdidn’t ask asingle question that mentioned the climate crisis, climate change or the Green New Deal until more than two-thirds of the way through the year (9/13/20), when wildfires—which, due to climate change, are becoming more frequent and more intense—devastated the West Coast. CNN‘sState of the Uniondid little better, asking one tangential question earlier in the year (2/2/20) to Republican Iowa Sen. Jodi Ernst about whyshe believed the Green New Deal and Medicare for All weresocialism but farmsubsidies were not. Its coverage of extreme weather beat the other networks by two weeks when it reported on Hurricane Laura in Louisiana (8/30/20). Face the Nationasked only two questions referencing the climate crisis the entire year. In the first,CBShostMargaret Brennan(9/13/20) challenged Oregon Gov. Kate Brown’sstatement that the wildfires were “a wake-up call for all of us that we have got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change.” Brennan responded:Governor, I understand that’s your conviction. But I know four former Oregon lawmakers have written an op-ed in theWashington Post, though,saying you can’t blame climate change. Instead, it’s a failure of yourstate government to prepare, and that warnings were ignored regarding mismanagement of Oregon’s forests. What is your response to that?Brennan presented climate disruption’s role in wildfires as a mere “conviction” of her guest–not because there wasscientific evidence that questioned the connection, but on the basis of an op-ed (Washington Post,9/12/20) written by a former Republicanstate representative (not four of them) who’s now associated with a pro-logging group funded by corporate timber interests and linked to far-right militias (Mother Jones,3/6/20). In the other question, Brennan (11/8/20) asked West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin if Joe Biden’s “energy message”—which featured a vow to transition away from oil and gas—hurt him in the election. NBCasked three questions,ABCandFox Newsasked four, andCNNasked 13 in their Sunday morningshows. The fiveshows combined aired a total of only 18segments in which any questions were asked that referenced the climate crisis. There were 26 questions asked, to 18 guests. The Sundayshows historicallyskew overwhelmingly toward officialsources—politicians, party operatives and other current or former government officials—who typically account for half or more (FAIR.org,4/1/12,5/22/20) of all guests, with journalists making up most of the rest. In 2020, questions about climateskewed even more toward partisan guests, who accounted for all but two of thesources, and received 24 of the 26 questions. (The other two, both onFox News Sunday, were an actor and a conservative pundit.)Last April, when there was a crucial role for news outlets to play in clarifying the medical andscientific aspects of the Covid crisis, as well as offeringspace for vigorous debate oversolutions, FAIR (5/22/20) criticized the Sundayshows forsidelining independent public health experts, who comprised only 10% of all guests that month. On climate, however, theshows have proved even worse, inviting not asingle climatescientist or other climate expert or advocate as a guest over the entire year. Of the partisan guests asked about climate issues, 12 were Democrats and only three were Republicans (taking 17 versusseven questions, respectively), despite the fact that Republicans dominated Washington for the year, holding both the White House and Senate and blocking any major climate change legislation. In fact, theABC,CBS,NBCandFox NewsSundayshows didn’t pose asingle question about the climate crisis to a Republican politician the entire year. In effect, theseshows are allowing politicians to define reality. If Republicanssay the climate crisis doesn’t exist, then Sunday hosts—with the exception ofCNN—don’t question them about it. Twelve of the 18segments centered on the US presidential election or thesubsequent presidential transition, five were about the West Coast wildfires and Hurricane Laura, and one was a feature about an actor whose climate activism came up in a question. All but one of the 10 climate-related questions in the extreme weathersegments were about whether climate change is an important contributor to extreme weather events of 2020, or whether humans are the main driver of that climate change—questions that have long beensettledscience. CNN(8/30/20, 9/13/20) posedseveralsuch questions to two Republican climate deniers, and the network’s Dana Bash (8/30/20)stated clearly multiple times in her interviewsome variation of “the overwhelmingscientific consensus is that human activity is responsible for the climate crisis.” While holding Republicans accountable for their climate denialstance is important, it’s also important to go beyondsettledscience and press them on policy. But withso few questions to Republicans at all, none didso. What’s more, three Democrats were also asked whether climate change could be blamed for the West Coast wildfires (ABC, 9/13/20;CBS, 9/13/20;CNN, 9/13/20), letting then–President Donald Trump frame the news with his claims that it wassimply a “forest management” problem, rather than doing what they ought to have done:set the recordstraight on what thesciencesays about the role of climate change in wildfires, then use their questions to ask their political guests about government responses based on thosescientific facts. If we have any hope of addressing the climate crisis, journalists have to move beyond debating its existence or importance, andstart looking at both its causes—very concretely, looking at culprits—and itssolutions. You can’t debate climatesolutions without understanding what is driving climate change, yet only 12 questions were asked on the Sundayshows all year that even touched on emissions or the oil and gas industry, and none mentioned agriculture, deforestation or capitalism more generally. Of those 12 questions, few got the national conversation closer to where it needs to be, instead asking aboutsuch things as whether Biden’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050 was “realistic” (ABC, 9/13/20) or the impact of hisstance on oil and gas on voters, not the planet (CNN, 10/25/20;Fox News, 10/25/20). OnABC, hostMartha Raddatz(10/25/20) asked Democraticstrategist Rahm Emanuel whether Biden’s promise in one of the presidential debates to transition away from oil and gas made him “cringe a little bit.”Meanwhile, the industry didn’t reduce its own media output during the pandemic; in fact, it increased it. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest industry lobbying group,spent over $3.1 million on TV ads—a 51% increase from the year before—falsely touting natural gas as “clean” energy (Independent,8/19/20). These ads aired during almost the exactsame period (1/1/20–8/16/20) that most of the Sundayshows were completelysilent on climate.",1,1,FAIR

Terrible multitudes, but multitudes nonetheless. They can cause everything from the usually-benign common cold to far moreserious respiratory conditionssuch as SARS and MERSand, of course, the novel coronavirus which causes COVID and has claimed more than four million lives around the world to date. And even that particularstrain of coronavirus which leads to COVID-19 has continuously mutated itself over the course of the past year and a half. What that means for the public is that, depending on which version of the coronavirus you may catch, the tell-talesymptoms may diverge. But it’s not always clear exactly how. Classic COVID maystart off with loss ofsmell or taste; catching theCOVID Deltastrain may not lead to thosesymptoms but could cause otherssuch as a runny nose and headache. COVID is astrange puzzle of a disease which public health officials arestill trying to piece together. The most common, andsome of the weirder,symptoms have been on the radar for a while now: Asudden loss of taste orsmell,sore throat, runny nose and congestion, nausea, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, fever, muscle aches. The typical trappings ofsomething like the flu crossed with the cold and then multiplied by unexpectedsymptomssuch assensory dilution and the dire prospect of having to live with them if you have a case of “long COVID.”The multiple COVID variants now circulating the globe, include the Delta variant which now makes up a majority of new COVID-19 cases in the U. S., complicate the matter furthersince different variants may manifest in different ways. And all of these mutations, whether they be theAlpha, Delta, or Lambda variants orsomething else entirely, arestillso new that it’s difficult to assess the precise nature of each individual threat. Of the major mutation groups that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) list as “variants of concern,” the Delta variant is by far doing the most damage globally due to its transmissibility and high levels “viral load” that canspread the pathogen faster and at an earlierstage of illness. Part of the challenge that Delta presents may be tied to this findingThe variant's viral load ~1,000X higher than previousstrains (reflected by low CTs), more infectious in the earlystages of the illness now, it appears that the Delta variant (even insome who are fully vaccinated for COVID) can causesymptomssuch as a headache,sore throat, and runny nose, and also potentially a fever and a cough,based on recent data from the U. K., which is grappling with Delta variant breakouts. Those are all typical COVIDsymptoms generally but don’t include the tell-talesign of taste orsmell loss. That means that as we head into the flu and coldseason inseveral months, it might become more difficult to distinguish between a highly contagious COVID Delta variant patient andsomeone with a mild flu. The coming years will reveal the breadth and depth of COVID-19symptoms across its variants. For now, the good news is that while available vaccines from the likes ofPfizerandAstraZenecamay not entirely prevent coronavirus mutations fromspreading, and these kinds ofsymptoms occurring, they are quite effective in preventingserious illness that can lead to hospitalization or death.

625,'No regrets': Evangelicals and other faith leaders still support Trump after deadly US Capitol attack,-3.0,48.0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/12/evangelicals-donald-trump-capitol-riot-voter-fraud/6644005002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,22,"Like millions of other Americans, Franklin Graham watched the disturbing images of last week'sriots at the U. S. Capitolwithswelling concern and anger. Graham,son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and head of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association,said he wassickened tosee ""people attack my Capitol and break down the doors of my Capitol"" and was dismayed tosee howPresident Donald Trump riled up the protesters.""I don't think it was the president's finest moment,"" hesaid. But Grahamsaid he doesn't expect the tumult at the Capitol to deter evangelical Christians fromsupporting Trump.""I don’t think he had any understanding in that moment of what was going to take place,"" hesaid. ""None of us did.""Graham added, ""He regrets it.""Since his victory in a very competitive Republican primary in 2016, Trump has relied on evangelical Christians and other influential religious groups as powerful voting blocs toshore up his influence. He has appointed more than 200 federal judges and three conservative justices to the U. S. Supreme Court whosupport limits on abortion and gay marriage and other policies favored by many conservative religious leaders. In the presidential election in November, 76% of white evangelicals voted for Trump and 24% for Joe Biden, according to Edison Research exit polls. Thousands of protesters broke into the Capitol as Congress tried to finalize the Electoral College vote count and acknowledge Biden as the election winner. The attack led to five deaths and nearly 100 arrestsand motivated House Democrats to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump for allegedly inciting the crowds. During aspeech before the violence broke out, Trump told his followers, ""We’re going to have to fight much harder.""“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” hesaid hours before riotersstormed the U. S. Capitol, threatening Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers. Tuesday,before leaving on a trip to South Texas,Trumpsaid calls for his impeachment were divisive and his comments tosupporters before theCapitolinsurrection were ""totally appropriate.""None of the turmoil has eroded much of hissupport among evangelicals, experts and religious leaderssaid. For the past four years, evangelical leaders created an ""echo chamber"" where they blamed all of Trump's digressions and missteps on the Democratic Party or the mainstream media,said Sarah Posner, an investigative journalist and author of ""Unholy: Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump.""After the deadly Capitol riot, evangelical leaders deflected blame from Trump, while those who have been critical of the president denounced the riots and blamed him for playing a role,shesaid. Evangelicals ""areso conditioned not to trust the media, it's going to be really hard to convince them of the truth of what happened on Wednesday,"" Posnersaid. In the wake of the Capitol riots, many evangelical leaders have continued fueling Trump's baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud in last year's elections,shesaid.""Because it’s the leaders who are again churning thesame conspiracy theories, I don’tsee a lot of progress in changing anybody’s minds,"" Posnersaid. Robert Jeffress,senior pastor of the 14,000-member First Baptist Church of Dallas,said Tuesday he had “absolutely no regrets” over his “enthusiasticsupport” of Trump over the past four years.“He is without doubt the most pro-life and pro-religious president in history,” Jeffresssaid in an e-mail. “The president has every right to hold the view that the election was fraudulent and to invite those whoshare that belief to peacefully protest. He neither called for nor condoned the despicable actions of those who invaded our Capitol and assaulted the police.”In an editorial published over the weekend on Fox News, Jeffress called thestorming of the Capitol “not only a crime” but “asin against God.”“Peaceful protest is a vital part of our political tradition, and it has longserved us well,” he wrote. “What happened on Wednesday when a mob infiltrated the Capitol building was not a protest. It was lawlessness. … Celebrating evil is evil. It corrodes thesoul.”Jeffresssaid he would discuss in hissermon Sunday how Christians dismayed by the election resultsshould respond to Biden.“If we are ever going to heal our country,” hesaid, “we must learn how to lay aside the anger and bitterness that are tearing our country apart without demanding that peoplesurrender their deeply held convictions.”Trump has also courtedsupport from Orthodox Jewish leaders, who applauded when he moved theU. S. Embassy to Jerusalemtwo years ago. Jared Kushner, Trump'sson-in-law, broker ed thesigning of peace accords with a handful of Mideast countries. According to asurvey by the American Jewish Committee published in October, Trump was preferred by 74% of Orthodox Jews. Biden was favored by 83% ofsecular Jews. Among the mob at the U. S. Capitol were Orthodox Jews whosupported the president, even though there were anti-Semitic images in the crowd, including a man with a T-shirt emblazoned with ""Camp Auschwitz."" One rioter arrested Friday was theson of a prominent judge in New York’s Orthodox Jewish community. Rabbi Mendy Mirocznik, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, a national organization that represents more than 900 Orthodox clergy members, called the events at the Capitol very painful. The Rabbinical Alliance of America does not endorse any political candidates for office.“This is more than thestraw that broke the camel’s back,""said Mirocznik, whose parents are Holocaustsurvivors from Poland. ""America needs to begin to heal.”Apollby the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization that tracks extremism nationwide, found approximately two-thirds of Americanssay Trump and members of groups with whitesupremacist beliefs were responsible for the violence.“Most Americans nowsee the direct connection between the dangerous rhetoric from President Trump, others on the far right and extremist groups,”said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the ADL. During religiousservices this past weekend, Jewish clergy took to the pulpit tospeak out against whitesupremacy, anti-Semitism and the attack on democracy. As Rabbi Rachel Timoner began reciting the blessing, “Baruch Atah Adonai,” to welcome thesabbath in Congregation Beth Elohim in New York City's Brooklyn borough,she attempted to comfort her congregation.“We are going to kindle light because the world needs light,""shesaid, lighting two white candles. Joseph W. Daniels, Jr., pastor of Emory Fellowship, a United Methodist church in Washington, cited the attack on the Capitol during hissermon Sunday and urged congregants to call out wrongdoing when theysee it.“For our nation to heal, for America to heal, we have to call out the fact that the behaviors and habits and attitudes of this past Wednesday were not of God but were of a whitesupremacy and privilege that are not healthy for anybody,"" Danielssaid. “We cannot be afraid. We have to have courage. ... We have to call out demons.”Some conservative religious leaders called for the nation to move forward behind Biden. In an article in the online portal The Gospel Coalition, Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, condemned the attacks on the Capitol and called on Christians to reject the falsehoodssurrounding the elections and embrace the truth.""Enough is enough – and indeed was enough a long time ago,"" Moore wrote. ""It will take decades to rebuild from the wreckage in this country. But, as Christians, we canstart now – just by not being afraid tosay what is objectively the truth. Joe Biden has been elected president.""Hesaid, ""If Christians are people of truth, we ought to be the first to acknowledge reality.""For other evangelicals, Trump's role in the Capitol attack will be minimized because manysee him not just as an elected official but one anointed by God, Posnersaid.""They feel heshould remain president because God wanted him to be president,""shesaid.",2,2,USA Today

Ashley Biden told Hager thatshe plans “to advocate forsocial justice, for mental health, to be involved in community development and revitalization.” According to CNN, the new First Daughter isso private thatshe doesn’t even havesocial media accounts and, unlike Ivanka Trump,she doesn’t plan to hold a position in the new administration. Ashley Biden is the only daughter of former Vice PresidentJoe Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden. The Bidens also raised Joe’ssons from his first marriage, Beau and Hunter. Joe Biden did have another daughter, who died very young. Tragically, Beau died at age 46 of a brain tumor. Biden’s first daughter, Naomi, died young with his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, in a tragic car crash. Ashley is Joe’ssurviving child, along with Hunter, who was theson of Joe and Neilia. Here’s what you need to know:To Hager, Biden explained whyshe doesn’t havesocial media accounts,saying, “The cruelty and the meanness, that’s why I’m not, I don’t have asocial media account that’s public. Part of it is also having boundaries for myself, because I believe in kindness.

631,The Science of Mask-Wearing Hasn’t Changed. So Why Have Our Expectations?,-5.33,45.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-science-of-mask-wearing-hasnt-changed-so-why-have-our-expectations/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-02,25,"Before every fashion retailer wasselling their own cloth face covering, before a piece of fabric over your nose and mouth became a personal politicalstatement, and before Goldman Sachs wassaying a national face mask mandate is as good as a lockdown, Lara Martin was unsure whether homemade cloth masks were even a good idea. The executive director of the United Methodist Committee on Relief, Martin was one of the people I interviewed back in March for astory about thescience of masks. Back then, I found that masks were an excellent example oft hescientific uncertaintiesswirling around the novel coronavirus. Remember, theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand thesurgeon general once told the general public not to wear masks. The data that existed on mask effectiveness largely dealt with medical respirators andsurgical masks. It wasn’t clear how protective a cloth mask would be, and Martin worried that wearing masks might lead people to feel moresafe than they actually were — and make choices that increased their risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19. Today, a lot has changed. But thescience around cloth masks hasn’t. Yes, the CDC now recommends cloth face coverings, thesurgeon generalstarred in a videoshowing how to make them, and many businesses, and even cities,require them. Martin herself owns three and wears one every timeshe goes outside. Butshe told me that’s not because the evidence hassignificantly improved. “I don’t know enough, I don’tsee enough evidence. Nothing has changed except that I care about my neighbors, I care about my colleagues, I care about people I don’t even know that I come across at the grocerystore,”shesaid. “I am nowsaying to my community that I care about them, and that actually feels important to me as ascientist.”Cloth and DIY face maskssit at the intersection wherescientific data, public perceptions, and political opinions crash headlong into each other. Makingsmart decisions isn’t just about having data — it’s also about how we interpret the data we have. Safety moves along aspectrum with different relative levels of risk. Behavioral norms also matter, regardless of how much evidence backs them up. In the midst of a pandemic, masks are a reminder thatscience isseldom assimple, or as certain, as we want it to be — and that reasonable public health recommendations aresometimes based on more than just data. ByMaggie KoerthMore:Apple Podcasts|ESPN App|RSS|Amazon Music|SpotifyDo cloth face coverings work? Probably, tosome extent. Butjust how much they work depends on the material, how they’re used, and what you’re expecting them to accomplish. And — regardless of what you’veseen in highlyshareable memes— we definitely don’t know enough tosay that wearing these kinds of coverings will reduce risk of transmission by aspecific percentage, let alone a high percentage. Those were the conclusions of an expert report published by the National Academies of Sciences on April 8, and two of the lead authors of that paper recently told me thesciencehasn’tsignificantly changedsince then. Somestudies have come outshowing a correlation in certain regions between mask mandates and reducedspread of the coronavirus, butseveral of those not-yet-peer-reviewedstudies have turned out to have important flaws —such as failing to account for factors like other behaviors(such as higher rates ofsocial distancing) that went along with wearing masks in those places. Instead, expertssay what has changed is how both the public and public health institutions interpret thissituation and the datasurrounding it.“Back in March, it was difficult to even have anybody take youseriously when the CDC and WHOsaid the opposite,”said Jeremy Howard, a datascientist and entrepreneur who has become a major advocate of universal mask requirements. In response to the lack ofsupport, he launched a bipartisan campaign calledMasks4Allthat lobbied for widespread mask-wearing and argued that masks were a crucial, if not the most important, part of the COVID-19 response. But Howard has alsoseen changes in how political actors interpreted his message. Back in March, he told me, before not wearing a mask became asignifier of conservative politics, Howard actually got the most traction talking about the need for masks on conservative newsshows. “Going against the CDC was very on brand,” hesaid. “I was on “The Laura Ingraham Angle” talking about important masks were, andshe was all for it.”When the political alignmentsshifted, thatsupport vanished. Although a majority of Americans report wearing masks regularly, those numbers are 16 percentage points lower among Republicanscompared to Democrats. In the last week,that’s begun toshift again, with Republican leaders advocating for mask use and criticizing President Trump for not wearing one. The politicized landscape has also made it difficult to have a nuanced conversation about mask effectiveness, expertssaid. Public health officials who issued mandatory mask-wearing orders have found themselves hounded by intense criticism and even death threats. More than two dozen have resigned in recent weeks. At thesame time, Michael Osterholm, a public health and disease expert who is worried that mask effectiveness is being over-hyped, has also found himself threatened and harassed. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told me he’s received vulgar em ails from people who read hisstatements questioning the efficacy of cloth masks. Osterholmsaid that his position was not that masksshouldn’t be worn — he wears one in public, himself — but that there is limited data on how effective DIY cloth masks are atstoppingsmall particles, either from passing through or being forced out thesides of the mask. Without that information, hesaid, physical distancing and isolation remain the most important tools instopping thespread of the coronavirus. But as more Republicanssay the worst of the coronavirus is behind us, and usage of masks tracks tightly along the partisanspectrum, Osterholm told me he felt like well-meaning people were making him out to be a pandemic denialist. The on-off, yes-no nature of this debate has also been frustrating for Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale. Circumstances may mean that forsome people the benefits of wearing a mask may not outweigh the risks. “There are conversations i na lot of Black and brown communities… ‘[Does]the risk and threat in terms of personalsafety go up wearing a mask because of police action and beingseen as a threat?’”shesaid. At thesame time, though, Nunez-Smithsaid masks might actually be more important for those communities because the distancing and isolation favored by experts like Osterholm hasn’t really been possible. Black workers are more likely than other workers to have jobs that are classified as essential. Because of that, reopening meanssomething different for predominantly Black neighborhoods than it does for white neighborhoods. That also applies to the idea ofsocial distancing and how practical that even is —something that could account for whyself-reported mask usage is higher among nonwhite Americans, despite the possible police risk. “These are important contextual conversations,” Nunez-Smithsaid. Ultimately, expertssaid, all the nuance and complication around masks is a challenge that public health messaging has to face up to. It’s difficult to make one-size-fits-all recommendations forsituations that don’t readily lend themselves to a one-size-fits-all reality. The good news is that there’s more agreement than disagreement on where tostart. Just look at Osterholm and Howard, two experts who might easily beseen as having opposing viewpoints in this battle. Yet they holdsimilar positions on one issue: They both wish the CDC would have given the public the nuanced information about masks back in March and trusted them to understand it. Granted, that might mean presenting the public with a complex message,such as: “We don’t know how well cloth masks work,so distancingshould come first, but masks are likely to work tosome extent and not everyone can distance themselves.” That’s a mouthful and harder to fit on a bumpersticker than “yes, youshould,” or “no, youshouldn’t.” But it comes down to what builds trust more: certainty or honesty?“We owe it to the public to help them understand what kind of protections they’re getting,” Osterholmsaid. “We owe it to the public to tell them what we know.”",2,1,FiveThirtyEight

633,"Here Are The 11 Dumbest, Most Slanted Questions Asked By Chris Wallace",21.33,27.67,https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/30/here-are-the-11-dumbest-most-slanted-questions-asked-by-chris-wallace,https://adfontesmedia.com/federalist-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,25,"Chris Wallace received negative marks for his constant interruptions of President Donald Trump, and for his poor time management, but the worst thing about his moderation of the first presidential debate on Tuesday were the questions he asked. Here are the 11 dumbest, mostslanted questions asked by Wallace.“This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racialsensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racialsensitivity training? And do you believe that there issystemic racism in this country,sir?” Wallace asked. Wallace’s framing of the issue here was factually false and designed to make Trump look racist. Not only did he misconstrue the objectively racist idea of critical race theory as “racialsensitivity training,” but he then followed up Trump’s answer on the issue with another trick question, “What is radical about racialsensitivity training?”It is not true that Trump banned diversity training from federal agencies, only trainings that teach racist, anti-American ideassuch as “critical race theory” or “white privilege.”Sohrab Ahmari was one of many Fox debate watchers who was appalled by the question,tweeting an excerpt of astory thatshowed that the activities that were banned were blatantly racist,such as:The trainers then ask “white managers” to create “safespaces,” where black employees can explain “what it means to be black” and to be “seen in their pain.” Whitestaffers are instructed to keepsilent and to “sit in the discomfort” of their racism. If any conflicts arise, the trainers ­insist that whites “don’t get to decide whensomeone is being too emotional, too rash [or] too mean.” Whites are told they can’t protest if a person of color “responds to their oppression in a way [they] don’t like.”Trump effectively answered the question, by pointing out that critical race theory teaches hatred of America and that this is unacceptable, but Wallace appeared to only know how the New York Times characterizes the racist beliefsystem.“You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for notspecifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn whitesupremacists and militia group and tosay that they need tostand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as wesaw in Kenosha and as we’veseen in Portland?” Wallace asked. This was Wallace’s most disgusting question. While Antifa, which has organizations throughout the country, hasset fire to cities across the country, there is no evidence whatsoever that violence in Kenosha was caused by whitesupremacists. President Trump has repeatedly condemned whitesupremacists. What a ridiculous question from Chris Wallace.#Debates2020pic.twitter.com/kuTsHBcKKf— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)September 30, 2020Wallace also refused to accept Trump’s answer of “sure” and “I’m willing to do anything…I want tosee peace,” instead, choosing to press him on “specifically” condemning whitesupremacy.“Well do it,sir,” Wallacesaid, joined by Biden.“Proud Boys,stand back andstand by. But I’ll tell you what,somebody’s got to dosomething about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem this is a left-wing,” Trump replied. That debate was garbage but this is the actual transcript of the whitesupremacy exchange. Trump didn't ""refuse"" to denounce whitesupremacy, as much of the media is nowsaying. Look at his first reply. Sure, take issue with how he handled the q, but don't misinform people.pic.twitter.com/TIg2WSxKVj— Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky)September 30, 2020“Are you not worried about the disease issues,sir?” Wallace asked, minutes after Trump explained his COVID-19 vaccine plan. Wallace felt the need to ask why a presidential candidate was campaigning on-the-ground and then insinuated that maybe heshouldn’t be campaigning because of COVID-19. This matches the Democrat Party talking point about COVID-19 requiring the banning of children fromschools, the closure of businesses, and the denial of conservative First Amendment activitiessuch as church and political gathering. But as demonstrated by the widespread mediasupport for mass gatherings and riots insupport of the BLM agenda, this is not a genuine concern but one deployed for partisan political gain.“I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case, decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, yousaid it raises the question, ‘Whether justice could be equally applied in America.’ Do you believe that there is aseparate but unequalsystem of justice for blacks in this country?”Moderators can ask a question neutrally, they can ask a question adopting the framing of the left, or they can ask a question adopting the framing of the right. In everysingle case, Wallace adopted the framing of the left. Here, that framing resulted in asoftball question that Biden had no difficulty responding to and quickly moving past, even if his answer that he believed America was asystematically racist countryshould have earned a follow-up. “What is your responsibility for this inherently racist country, given your 47 years in public life?” Wallace might have asked. But he did not. He also could have asked about the Biden’s running mateKamala Harrisaccusing him of racism during the primary.“Mr. President, yousaid, ‘I don’t think thescience knows.’ Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about thescience of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?”Wallace clarified his leading question by asking if Trump really believed in climate change, why would he have made the policy changes he did.“But,sir, if you believe in thescience of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…?” Wallace continued. Chris Horner replied:At no point did Wallace consider the possibility that policy makers could protect the environment without murdering jobs. He did notseem aware of the possibility that large regulatory frameworks ostensibly about environmental protection are actually about building up the unaccountable administrativestate. Separately, he didn’t ask Biden anysimilar questions aboutscience acceptancesuch as why, if he believes inscience, hesupports legalized ending of human lives via abortion and forcing taxpayers to fund the practice against their conscience. And as Andy McCarthy points out, it was not Wallace who pressed Biden on hissupport of the Green New Deal, but Trump. Biden doesn’tsupport the Green New Deal. Oh, Wallace got that out of him?No, Trump did. Oh, well, did Wallace clarify what’s parts of Green New Deal Biden is against?No, needed to move on …— Andy McCarthy (@AndrewCMcCarthy)September 30, 2020When the question came around to Biden, he had forgotten what the topic was,saying “I can’t remember which of all his rantings …” Wallace laughed,said, “I’m having a little trouble myself,” and they had a moment ofshared hatred of Trump. Wallace then helped him along repeatedly, prodding him to talk about the economy and the environment. Minutes earlier, Biden had denied that hesupported the Green New Deal. But then hesaid, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward.” Wallace asked him if he did, in fact,support the Green New Deal. He once again returned to claiming he didn’t. “No, I don’tsupport the Green New Deal.” His website, however,supports the radical Green New Deal policy co-sponsored by his running mate Kamala Harris, and lists it as a“crucial framework” for addressing climate change” on his campaign website.“Will you urge yoursupporters tostay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?”“As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confidentshould we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five-plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day but also countingsome mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election?”Wallace continued his not-so-subtlesuggestion that Trump might not accept the election results by throwing in this question about the legitimacy of this election. What Wallace failed to mention was that many Hillary Clinton voters in 2016 claimed they did not accept the legitimate results of the election. Even recently, Hillary Clinton has claimed that the election was “stolen” from her.“You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. Yousay it’s rigged, that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, tosettle any dispute?”It is unclear what Wallace was attempting to get at in asking this question. The media have repeatedly conflated absentee ballots, military ballots, and establishedstate-based mail-in-balloting with a rush to implement universal mail-in balloting. That rush has already led to problems. By asking this question, Wallaceseemed to reject the idea that voter fraud might actually make this electionsusceptible to questions of the legitimacy he referred to in his previous questions. Wallace reiterated this idea by clarifying that mail-in voting fraud is not the problem.“The biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been thatsizable numbers,sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there issome other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett willsettle any dispute?”Wallace asked this question after Trump had already given an answer for how much he paid in federal income taxes those years. This general question is a great example of how Wallace takes his direction from the New York Times, even though the New York Times has not published its evidence insupport of its claim about how much Trump paid in taxes, and even though Trump’s attorneys havesaid on the record that Trump paid millions in those years. While Wallace thought this was a fitting question, he never asked Joe Biden about hisson and brother profiting from foreign governments while he was vice president, even though the information aboutsaid profiteering came from official Treasury Department reports that were obtained by Senate investigators. When Trump attempted to bring up Hunter Biden’s relations with Russia, pointing out that Hunter “made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places” after Biden became vice president, Wallace wrote him off claiming that “the American people would rather hear about moresubstantialsubjects.”“We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about moresubstantialsubjects. As the moderator,sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here,” Wallacesaid, changing thesegment to focus on climate change. Wallace also refused to ask Joe Biden any questions about his involvement in the Russia collusion hoax, an elaboratescheme to tie Donald Trump to nefarious activities by Russia. Despite promises to circle back to discuss the topic of abortion that came up during thesegment about Trump’s Supreme Court nomination Amy Coney Barrett, Wallace never brought it up again, even when he decided to askscience questions.“Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade,” Wallacesaid. That unpacking, though, did not require any extra effort on Wallace’s part when he failed to push Biden after he refused to comment on Court-packing. In the end, it was Trump who continued to press Biden while Wallace moved on.",0,0,The Federalist
634,Top Dems Say They’re Working on a ‘Public Option’ Health Care Plan,-1.67,47.67,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2021/05/26/Top-Dems-Say-They-re-Working-Public-Option-Health-Care-Plan,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"Two key Democratic lawmakers overseeing health policy on Wednesday announced they will look to craft legislation to create a government-run “public option” for health coverage, pushing ahead on one of President Joe Biden’s campaign promises even as the president has focused on other parts of his agenda. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sen Patty Murray (D-WA), chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, put out a call for ideas on how to design the legislation.“We believe boldsteps are necessary in order to achieve universal coverage and lower health care costs,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter addressed “to all interested parties.” “As we work to craft legislation, our priority is to establish a federally administered public option that provides quality, affordable health coverage throughout the United States.”Their request asks for answers to eight broad questions,such as whoshould be eligible to enroll in a government-run plan, how benefits and paymentsshould bestructured and what kind of premium assistanceshould be offered. Biden campaigned on creating a Medicare-like public option, pitching the idea as part of a plan to build on Obamacare — an alternative to calls from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and others to eliminate private coverage entirely and transition to asingle-payer “Medicare for All”system. But, despitesome pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden has left a public option out of his major policy proposals thus far and reportedly will not include i tin his forthcoming budget request even as he reiterates hissupport for the idea. The president has instead pushed plans to make Obamacare plans more affordable and accessible. Insurers and hospitals oppose a public option and critics have argued that it would ultimately lead to “a one-size-fits-all” government health insurancesystem. The American Hospital Associationsaid in astatementWednesday that it opposes a public option because “inadequate reimbursement rates” would raise the risk of hospital closures. Why it matters:The letter from Pallone and Murray “is the first indication that Democrats arestillserious about the idea” of a public option,saysVox’s Dylan Scott. And Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation calls it “aserious effort by Senator Murray and Representative Pallone to take the public option from bumpersticker to workable legislation.”A public option enjoys broadsupport in polls, with more than two-thirds of adults in an October 2020 Kaiser Family Foundationtracking poll— including 40% of Republicans —saying theystrongly favor orsomewhat favor the idea. But, as the questions in the Pallone-Murray lettersuggest, a host of issuesstill need to be addressed, with reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals, and drug companies atop that list. “A public option has the potential to reduce prices and make health care more affordable, but the further it goes in that direction, the bigger the blowback will be from the health care industry,” Levitt told theAssociated Press. And while the industry pushes back, Republicans may also be likely to renew their attacks labeling the Democratic proposals as “socialist.”The bottom line:While it’s notable that two leading Democrats are working on a public option, there’s nosign any legislation has a chance of passing in the near term.",2,2,Fiscal Times

Mitch McConnell (R-KY)seemed to call outRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA)“loony lies” as a “cancer” to the Republican Party. Without naming her directly, the Senate minority leadersaid in astatement on Mondayreported by The Hillthatsomeone whosupports the conspiracy theories Greene has promoted is “not living in reality” and is not using their time in Congress to focus on helping American families.“Somebody who’ssuggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifyingschoolshootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.’s airplane is not living in reality,” McConnell reportedlysaid in thestatement. “This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates onsubstance that canstrengthen our party.”Greene responded Monday night by tweeting, “The real cancer for the Republican Party is weak Republicans who only know how to lose gracefully.”Social media posts have recentlysurfacedshowcasing the wide range of conspiracy theories that Greene hassupported. She has liked or favorited posts that call for the murder of various Democratic politicians. She hassuggested that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were a government conspiracy and that the California wildfires werestarted by a laser beam fromspace operated by Jewish bankers. A recentlysurfaced videoshows her harassing Parklandsurvivor and gun reform activist David Hoggjust weeks after the massshooting, calling him a “coward” and claiming he was being funded by billionaire George Soros. House Democrats havesaid they are ready to move forward with removing Greene from any committees in the House of Representatives if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) does not take action andstrip the representative of her assignments. In 2019, the GOPstripped then- Rep. Steve King (R-IA) of assignments after he inquired how language like whitesupremacy “became offensive”during an interview with The New York Times.“Republican members will have the chance to distance themselves from her,” columnist Michelle Goldbergwrote in The Times. “If they don’t, it will be because they knowshe belongs.”Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) has 61 co-sponsors on a resolution to expel Greene from Congress, which he hopes to introduce this week, according to hisspokesperson. A two-thirds majority vote is required forsuch an expulsion, which is why it rarely happens — but it has happened before. Roll Callreportsthat 20 members of Congress have been expelled in the past, with the most recent example being the late former Rep. James Traficant Jr. (D-OH), expelled in 2002 after he was convicted on 10 felony counts including bribery, racketeering, and fraud. McConnell is one of asmall handful of GOP lawmakers who havespoken out against the QAnon-promoting Greene, though pressure has been mounting for other Republicans to respond. The Senate minority leader had earliersignaled potentialsupport for and then ambiguity regarding voting to impeach former President Donald Trump, whose Senate trial begins next week. McConnell, one of Trump’s most powerful allies through his entire presidency,blamed the ex-presidentfor provoking the deadly mob that attacked the U. S. Capitol on January 6. But then he was one of 45 Republicans who voted last week insupport of dismissing the trial. Separately, McConnellgave astatement to CNNdefending Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), one of10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trumpin January. Trump loyalists in the GOPhave been calling for Cheney, who voted with the ex-president nearly 93% of the time, to bestripped of her third-ranking position in the party. Last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)traveled to Wyomingto call for voters to force her out of office in 2022.""Liz Cheney is a leader with deep convictions and the courage to act on them,"" McConnellsaid in thestatement to CNN. ""She is an important leader in our party and in our nation. I am grateful for herservice and look forward to continuing to work with her on the crucial issues facing our nation.""",1,1,NowThis News

S. political/media class have been pushing hard for more authoritarian policies tostave off the threat of “domestic terrorism” in the wake of the Capitol riot. President Biden, who was already working on rolling out new domestic terror policies well before Januarysixth,confirmed after the riot that he is making these new measures a priority. Political internet censorship is becoming increasingly normalized, anti-protest billsare being passed, and now we’reseeing liberals encouraged to form “digital armies”tospy on Trumpsupporters to report them to the authorities. And an amazingly large percentage of the U. S. populationseems to have no problem with any of this, even insectors of the politicalspectrum thatshould really know better by now.“What else can we do?” they reason. “What othersolution could there possibly be to the threat of dangerous fascists and conspiracy theorists continuing to gain power and influence?”Well there’s a whole lot that can be done, and none of it includes consenting tosweeping new Patriot Act-like authoritarian measures or encouraging monopolistic Silicon Valley plutocrats to censor worldwide politicalspeech. There’s just a whole lot of mass-scale narrative manipulation going on to keep it from being obvious to everyone. The New Domestic War on Terror is Coming— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald)January 19, 2021The way tostem the tide of Trumpism (or fascism, or whitesupremacism, or Trump cultism, or whatever term you use for what you’re worried about here) is to eliminate the conditions that created it. Trump was only able to launch hissuccessful faux-populist campaign in the first place by exploiting the widespread pre-existing opinion that there was aswamp that needed draining, a corrupt politicalsystem whose leadership does not promote the interests of the people. Conspiracy theories only exist because the government often does evil things and lies about them with the help of the mass media, forcing people to just guess what’s happening behind the opaque wall of governmentsecrecy. People only get it in their heads that they need a trustworthystrongman to overhaul thesystem if thesystem has failed them. People who are actually interested in ending Trumpism would be promoting an end to the corruption in the politicalsystem, an end to the opacity of their government, an end to their uniquely awful electoralsystem, and an end to the neo liberal policies which have been making Americans poorer and poorer with less and lesssupport from the government which purports to protect them. But these changes are not being promoted by the U. S. political/media class, because the U. S. political/media classspeaks for an empire that depends on these things. Without corruption, the plutocratic class couldn’tuse campaign donations and corporate lobbying to install and maintain politicians who will advance their interests. Without governmentsecrecy, the oligarchic empire could not conspire insecret to advance the military and economic agendas which form the glue that holds the empire together. Without a lying mass media, people’sconsent could not be manufactured for wars and asystem which does notserve their interests. Without widespread poverty and domestic austerity, people could not be kept too busy and politically impotent to challenge the massive political influence of the plutocrats. Since the day of the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, at least ninestates have introduced 14 anti-protest bills.— The Intercept (@theintercept)January 22, 2021So the option ofstopping the rise of Trumpism by changing thesystem is taken off the table, which is why you never hear it discussed as a possibility in mainstream circles. The only option people are being offered to debate the pros and cons of is giving more powers to thatsame corruptsystem which created Trump, powers which will be under the control of the next Trumpian figure who is elevated by that verysystem. You’re not going to prevent fascism by creating a big authoritarian monster tostomp it intosilence, and even if you could you would only bestopping the fascism by becoming the fascism. Tostop the rise of fascism you need to actually change. Drastically. Believing you can just make it go away without changing yoursituation is like believing you can avert an oncoming train by putting your hands over your eyes. There is no valid argument against what I amsaying here. Saying the powerful won’t allow any positive change is just confirming everything I’msaying and confirming the need to remove the powerful from power. Saying that ending corruption, governmentsecrecy and injustice would just be giving the terrorists what they want would be turning yourself into a bootlicker ofsuch cartoon ish obsequiousness there aren’t words in the English language adequate to mock you. Yes, change is desperately needed. Yes, the powerful will resist that change with everything they have. But the alternative is letting them plunge the world into darkness and destruction.at Medium.

638,Democrats Have 1 Option Left,-12.67,29.67,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/supreme-court-voting-rights-filibuster/619341/ ,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,25,"Today’s 6–3 Supreme Court decision is a hinge point for American democracy. Today’sSupreme Court decision further weakening the Voting Rights Actaffirmed that the only way Democrats can reverse the wave of restrictive voting laws in GOP-controlledstates is to pass new federal voting rights by curtailing the Senate filibuster. Congressional action has longseemed the only realistic lever for Democrats to resist redstates’surge of voter-suppression laws, which are passing,as I’ve written, on an almost entirely party-line basis. In thestate legislatures, Democrats lack the votes tostop these laws. And while the John Roberts–led Supreme Court—which opened the door to these restrictions by eviscerating anothersection of the Voting Rights Act in his 2013decision—alwaysseemed unlikely to restrain the Republican-controlledstates, today’s ruling from thesix GOP-appointed justices eliminated any doubt. Republicans will understandably view Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion upholding two disputed Arizonastatutes as a green light to pass voting restrictions that could disproportionately limit the ability of minority groups to vote: “Even if the plaintiffs were able to demonstrate a disparate [racial] burden caused by [the Arizona laws], the State’s ‘compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election procedures’ wouldsuffice to avoid [VRA] liability,” Alito wrote. Republican legislators will likely interpret Alito’s repeated emphasis in his decision on the importance ofstopping “fraud” and hissomewhat gratuitousswipes at voting by mail, both of which echo themes from former President Donald Trump, as much more than a wink and a nod of approval for the laws that are proliferating across redstates. (“Fraud is a real risk that accompanies mail-in voting even if Arizona had the good fortune to avoid it,” Alito insisted at one point.) If anything, Alito’s decision, which all the other GOP-appointed justices joined, underscores how thoroughly the determination to restrict voting access in the name of combatting illusory “fraud” has permeated every corner of the GOP. (Even the rare GOP critics of Trump’s discredited fraud claims,such as Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, have also defended the restrictive newstate laws.)Read: Watch what’s happening in redstatesWhile the rulingsignals long odds for the Justice Department’s effort to challenge those laws (starting with Georgia’s) in court, civil- and voting-rights advocates might welcome the clarity the decision provides. It makes plain that if Congress doesn’t establish new federalstandards, the nation is headed toward a two-tier votingsystem, with redstates imposing ever-tightening restrictions that especially burden Democratic-leaning constituencies—young, minority, and lower-income voters. It’s no coincidence that redstates are imposing these restrictions precisely as Millennials and Gen Zers, who represent the most racially diverse generations in American history, are rapidly increasing theirshare of the total vote,as I wrote earlier today. The rise of those younger generations especially threatens the GOP hold on Sun Beltstatessuch as Georgia, Texas, and Arizona, which Republicans now control through their dominance of older and non-urban white voters; in that way, the voting restrictions Republicans are enacting amount tostackingsandbags against a rising tide of demographic change. After a Republican filibuster blocked theirsweeping voting-rights bill,Senate Democrats are working to unify behind a more limited plan—and to persuade holdout Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (and perhaps others) to change the filibuster rules to pass it. Following today’s decision, the demands from civil-rights groups on Senate Democrats and Biden to change the rules will grow even more intense. Read: Manchin and Sinema now face the weight of history“Our elected leaders need to wake up andstart acting like the house is on fire—because it is, and this ruling pours more gasoline on the flames,” Nsé Ufot, the CEO of the New Georgia Project,said today in astatement that was echoed widely by other groups. “Black and Brown communities gave Democrats federal power to protect the vote and passing bills like the For the People Act is what we both expect and deserve.”With more measured (though no less passionate) language, the fierce dissent from Justice Elena Kagan and the other Democratic-appointed justicesseemed to besending thesame message. They obviously never endorsed any legislation, but their tone reminded me of the pleas to the Senate majority (particularly Manchin and Sinema)from Democratic legislators in thestates passing these restrictive laws., the justicesseemed to besaying: Now it’s up to Congress whether to protect democracy at what Kagan called “a perilous moment for the Nation’s commitment to equal citizenship.”",1,1,The Atlantic

The rule went into effect late Saturday for the nation’s largest county, home to 11 million people, where asharp increase in COVID-19 cases is led by the highly transmissible delta variant. The vast majority of new cases are among unvaccinated people, LA County Supervisor Hilda Solissaid Sunday.“I’m not pleased that we have to go back to using the masks in this matter but, nonetheless, it’s going tosave lives. And right now that to me is what’s most important,” Solissaid on ABC’s “ This Week.”California hasseen asteady rise in virus casessince thestate fully reopened its economy on June 15 and did away with capacity limits andsocial distancing. San Francisco Bay Area health officials last week urged residents to again wear masks inside public buildings, offices or businesses regardless of whether they are vaccinated. The counties of San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Alameda, Contra Costa and Sonoma and the city of Berkeleystoppedshort of making face coverings a requirement. Other counties, including Sacramento and Yolo, are alsostrongly urging people to wear masks indoors but not requiring it. Los Angeles County’s mask rule, announced Thursday, follows a winter where the region experienced a massivesurge in infections and deaths, with hospitals overloaded with COVID-19 patients and ambulances idling outside, waiting for beds to open.

On Feb. 27 at 2 a.m. ET, the House of Representatives approved Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package in a 219-212 vote, with Republicans unanimously rejecting the legislation. So,what's in Biden's first 2021stimulus package?Here's what you need to know. Biden first unveiled his proposal, dubbed the ""American Rescue Plan,"" on Jan. 14 to overwhelming publicsupport. Per Feb. 24 data from Morning Consult,76% of voters (including 60% of Republicans)support the legislation. The relief plan is largely aimed at providing public relief amid the economic fallout from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which, as of March 1,has killed over 513,000 Americans, per. If approved by the Senate with no changes, the plan will provide $1,400 in direct payments to qualifying Americans, a$400 weekly boost to regular unemployment benefits through September 2021, and $40 billion in grants to higher education institutions, among other things. Through executive orders, Biden has also extended eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, and placed pauses on federalstudent loan payments. Thebill would provide the $1,400 payments to individuals making up to $75,000 a year, phasing out for individuals earning $100,000 and more. Significantly, this version of the payment would also apply to adult dependents, like collegestudents, according to CNBC. Per Vox, the bill also addressessome major national problems highlighted by the pandemic: it allocates $40 billion in grants to colleges, with the majority meant to go to emergency financial aid forstudents. It also provides$25 billion toward emergency rent and utility assistance, and allocates$7.6 billion to expand internet connectivity to both teachers andstudents in remote learningsituations. It also includes aidsuch as disaster relief, food assistance, child care, vaccine distribution, and aid for restaurants among its provisions. However, the package may undergosome major changes to pass through the Senate and make it to the Oval Office to besigned into law. Congressional Republicans have been pushing back on the bill's price tag, and on Jan. 31, presented their ownsmaller$600 billionstimulus plan. Perthe plan would cut direct payments from $1,400 to just $1,000, and completely eliminate Biden's push for a $15 federal minimum wage.""We know that the bill will look different on the way out [of the Senate]than it did when [Biden] presented it in his prime time address,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Feb. 28. ""But there is an urgency here,""she added. ""Because by [March 14], 11 million Americans will lose unemployment insurance,so we need to move quickly and rapidly to get this relief out to the Americans.""One major change has already been made: On Feb. 25, nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonoughruled against Biden's push to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 as part of thestimulus, on the grounds that the wage increase was outside the parameters of what was allowed underreconciliation— the process by which Democrats are trying to pass thestimulus. Reconciliation is a fast-track path to passing budget legislation in the Senate with asimple 51-vote majority, but it also comes with limitations on what can be included in a bill. While congressional Democratsseem determined to overturn the decision, Psakistated thatBiden ""respects the parliamentarian’s decision and the Senate’s process.""Additionally, neither the bill nor the executive orders include forgiveness forstudent debt, backtracking — at least for the moment — on aBiden campaign promise. In a Feb. 16 CNN town hall, Bidenshot down congressional Democrats' call to cancel $50,000 in loans with an executive order. ""I will not make that happen,"" hesaid. ""I am prepared to write off the $10,000 debt but not $50 [thousand], because I don't think I have the authority to do it,"" he added. During his first days in office, however, Biden issued an executive order to put apa use on payment expectations through September 2021. Democrats are racing to pass the bill through both congressional chambers before federal unemployment benefits begin lapsing for many Americans in mid-March. Per Insider, the Senate will examine and possibly revise the relief package from March 2 to March 5. If changes are made, the bill will go back to the House as early as March 8 for asecondary vote. Congressional Democrats aim to have the billsigned into law by March 14.

Bidenis proposing asignificant increase in legal immigration as part of his new legislation that would also legalize most illegal immigrants. The bill, which Mr. Bidenwillsend to Congress after he issworn in Wednesday, is more a policystatement than aserious piece of legislation, with almost no chance of being enacted in a form close to how it’s written. But it lays down a marker for Mr. Biden, for whom immigration, more than any other issue, provides astark contrast with President Trump. The bill would be the most generous immigration policy in U. S. history, wiping away barriers for illegal immigrants to integrate into Americansociety. Mr. Bidenwants to end the bar that requires those who have been in the country forsome time without permission to go home and wait 10 years before being able to come in legally. And he would create an opportunity for people who have been deported under President Trump to request to be allowed back into the country. The bill is light on newsecurity measures, instead focusing on leniency and reversing the direction Mr. Trump hadset. Where Mr. Trump had proposed ending the diversity lottery that doles out visas on the basis of luck, Mr. Bidenis proposing a nearly 50% expansion of that program.“The legislation modernizes our immigrationsystem, and prioritizes keeping families together, growing our economy, responsibly managing the border withsmart investments, addressing the root causes of migration from Central America, and ensuring that the United States remains a refuge for those fleeing persecution,” the Biden teamsaid in detailing the bill. The crux of the bill is a generous legalization program for most of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country. It would grant immediate legalstatus to illegal immigrant Dreamers and those here underspecial humanitarian protections. Other illegal immigrants would have to go through a process with a five-year wait before obtaining a green cardsignifying permanent legalstatus. Both Dreamers and other illegal immigrants would get a new,speedy chance at citizenship, with just a three-year wait between a green card and eligibility to naturalize. Mr. Trump had proposed a muchsmaller immigration legalization in 2018,suggesting a deal that would combine an offer of citizenship rights tosome Dreamers in exchange for border wall money, changes to the chain of family migration and an end to the visa lottery. Democrats rejected hissuggestion outright, insisting they wouldn’t bargain for Dreamers. Before that, the previous major attempt at legalization came in 2013, when theso-called “Gang of Eight”senators came up with a broad bill that would have offered a chance at citizenship to between 7 million and 8 million illegal immigrants and a guest-worker program giving future workers a path to citizenship, too, in exchange forsome new bordersecurity measures. Of those eightsenators, all four Democrats and two Republicans arestill in the chamber. One of them. Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, will take the lead on the new bill.“I know all too well from my work with the ‘Gang of Eight’ that passing immigration reform through the United States Congress will be a challenging task. However, there is a moral and economic imperative to get this done,” hesaid. One of the Republicans from the Gang of Eight, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, has already declared Mr. Biden’s plan a non-starter. Hesaid there are too many other issues alreadystacked up, and besides, Mr. Biden‘s offer doesn’t include any new enforcementstandards.“There are many issues I think we can work cooperatively with President-electBiden, but a blanket amnesty for people who are here unlawfully isn’t going to be one of them,” Mr. Rubiosaid.

The Ohio-based team's old name - adopted in 1915 - had long been criticised as racist by Native American groups. The new name references a pair of well-knownstatues in the city of Cleveland. Plans to change the name were first announced last December, in the wake of widespread racial justice protests. Team owner Paul Dolan at the timesaid he had an ""awakening or epiphany"" about the name following the death of George Floyd, an African-American man murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis last May. A year earlier, the team dropped their ""Chief Wahoo"" logo. That logo, first used in 1947, pictured a red-faced andsmiling cartoon man wearing asingle feather. Native American activistssaid it was an offensive racial caricature. The Cleveland Guardians owe their new moniker to the ""Guardians of Traffic""statues on a local bridge. The Guardians have a new logo too - a baseball flanked with winged letter Gs. Actor Tom Hanks narrated the team's Twitter video reveal of the changes.""It has always been Cleveland that has been the best part of our name,"" hesaid. ""This is the city we love and the game we believe in and together we are all Cleveland Guardians.""These changes come amid widespread pressure to drop racist and offensive team names across the country. Last July, amid pressure from lawmakers and activists, Washington DC's American football team announced it was dropping its ""Redskins"" name. the Washington Football Team. Activists also hope to change the names of a number of other teams that continue to invoke Native Americanstereotypes, including the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Blackhawks, and Kansas City Chiefs.

646,Systemic Racism in the US,-9.67,43.0,https://www.theskimm.com/news/systemic-racism-us-2f9M0RPl3VEuCAA5pSoZNr,https://adfontesmedia.com/skimm-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-19,25,"The recent violence and deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police and others have once again pushed the US to reckon withsystemic racism that dates back to the founding of this country. With being up front about the fact thatsystemic racism isso expansive and deep-rooted that no guide will be able to accurately depict the hundreds of years of injustice it’s caused Black people in the US. But let’sstart by getting on thesame page about what definessystemic racism. It refers tosystems and practices that create and maintain racial inequality. Even thoughslavery was officially abolished in the 1860s, racism and discrimination have continued to persist throughout nearly every facet of American life. In the years and decades immediately following the end ofslavery, certain policiessanctioned discrimination against Black people. Probably none moreso than Jim Crow laws. Good. Between the late 1800s and mid-1900s (yes, nearly three quarters of a century),southernstates implemented as et of laws thatsegregated Black and white people in all aspects of life: education, housing, public transportation, restaurants, prisons, drinking fountains, bathrooms, the list goes on. Thissystem wassanctioned by a Supreme Court decision that upheld the “separate but equal” doctrine. In reality, thespaces Black people had access to were rarely equal to those of white people, if they existed at all. During this time, Black people were frequently terrorized and killed by whites and whitesupremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan – with more than 3,000 Black people beinglynched, according to the NAACP. Whilesegregation in public places was banned with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Jim Crow laws reinforced asystemicstructure of inequality that westillsee today. Let’s get into the areas of oursociety where wesee this playing out…Home ownership can be asignificant way to build wealth in the US. But Black Americans have long been left out. First, because they weren’t legally allowed to own property as enslaved people. And later, because of aseries of federal and local policies, includingsegregated federal housing projects andredlining. Redlining is a practice thatstarted in the 1930s to determine which neighborhoods were worthy of mortgage loans. Neighborhoods that were considered a higher credit risk were outlined in red. Guess who mostly lived in those neighborhoods? The practice kept Black people from being able to buy homes and it wasn’t banned until the 1960s. The federal gov passed theFair Housing Act. It bans discrimination when it comes to buying or renting a home, applying for a mortgage, or receiving public housing. Butexpertssay the effects of redlining arestill visible today. In 2019, Black home ownership fell to are cord lowsince the Census Dept began keeping track. At one point that year, the home ownership rate among white people was 73%, compared to 40.6% among Black people. Onestudy from 2018 found that three out of four neighborhoods that were redlined decades ago are low-to-moderate income today, and more likely to be made up of minority residents. On the flipside, thestudy found that neighborhoods that were considered asafe investment during the redlining era now have higher incomes and are predominantly white. And all of this affects not just where Black Americans live, but the type ofschools they go to as well. Which brings us to…In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that racialsegregation in publicschools was unconstitutional with the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education. But mostschools weren’t actually integrated for years. And datashows that USschools have become more, not less,segregated in recent decades. Afterthe Brown case,someschool districts made voluntary efforts to integrate. But not all. Asubsequent1971 Supreme Court decision upheld mandatory busing programs to integrateschools. That was the practic eof transporting kids outside of their neighborhood to achieve diversity inschools. Both white and Blackstudents were bused, but it was more common for Blackstudents to have to travel. But people fought it. Many white parents fled to thesuburbs or to privateschools, making it harder to maintain racially-diverseschools. Some groups of kids were confronted withviolence, including crowds throwing bricks atschool buses holding Black children in Boston. And in the ‘90s, a number of court rulings against busing were issued,saying it had worked and didn’t need to continue. But a2019study found thatsince 1988, the number ofschools that enroll 90-100% non-whitestudents has more than tripled. And minoritystudents are increasingly concentrated inschools with higher rates of poverty. A lot of it has to do with the fact thatschool districts rely heavily on local taxes and poorer areas have less tax income. Meaning that communities with low-income households are automatically getting less money dedicated to their localschools. Onestudy foundschools that mostlyservestudents of color got$23 billion less funding than mostly whiteschool districts, or about $2,200 less perstudent. And with fewer resources comes an achievement gap, where minoritystudents typically have lowerstandardized testscores than whitestudents. Researchshows that the gap narrows whenschools are integrated. But until then, it means that millions of Blackstudents are facing a disadvantage – especially when it comes to... There's a history of discriminationsetting Black Americans back in the workforce. Afterslavery was abolished, “black codes” – laws that restricted work opportunities – became the precursor to Jim Crow laws. For example: South Carolina’s black code reportedlysaid Black people could only work as farmers orservants unless they paid an annual tax. If anyone violated the laws, they could be arrested or face fines. No. And laws like this lasted for decades...until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned employment discrimination based on people’s race,among other things. Andset up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which oversees enforcement of civil rights laws in the workplace. Black people continue to face discrimination in hiring and at work. Studiesshow that companies are more likely to call back a candidate who has a name that’s more commonly associated with white people. Black workers reportedly account for 26% of EEOCdiscrimination claims...but only make up 13% of the workforce. Many of these claims detail racism, from thespecific work employees are assigned (eg: getting more difficult assignments than white coworkers) to how much they’re paid compared to white counterparts. Black Americans are more likely to be unemployed or have low-paying jobs compared to white Americans. That’s in part due to education disparities. ButstudiesshowBlack workers earn less than white workers even when they have thesame education. That brings us to the fact that…There’s also the racial wage gap: theEconomic Policy Institutesays that in 2017, Black men made about 70 cents for every $1 their white counterpart made. The gap is especially large when it comes to Black women, who in 2017 made about 61 cents for every $1 a white man made. The EEOCsays discrimination is more likely to happen in a less diverse workspace. Diversity and inclusion expertssay employers need to make a more conscious effort to hire Black workers. Retention is also key, because that’ll help Black employees grow and develop their careers and get promoted into high-level positions, where they can be part of companies’ decision-making processes. Referrals can also make a difference. Researchshows that one-third of jobs have been filled by referrals. But onestudy found women of color are35% less likely to receive a referral than wh hit e men. One thing that’s certain is that inequality in employment also leads to…Disparities in housing, education, and employment have all contributed to the large wealth gap that exists today between Black and white Americans. In 2016, the median wealth of white households = $171,000. That’s 10 times higher than the median wealth of Black households, which = $17,100. Yes, 10 times. US census data from 2018shows that about 1 in 5 Black people in the US live in poverty. Inheritance also contributes to the wealth gap. The Federal Reservesays that not only are white Americans twice as likely to receive an inheritance than Black Americans, but it’s also usually much larger. Thissets up the next generation of Black Americans to fall financially behind. Activistssay that closing the wealth gap is key to addressingsystemic racism in America. There’ve been a few ideas thrown around, like…. Which would compensate the descendants of enslaved people. Lawmakers have intro’d legislation tostartstudies on it –somethingPresident Bidenhas backed. Supporterssay reparations would help give Black Americans a chance at equality after beingset back for centuries. Opponentssay it would likely be a huge cost andsay Americans todayshouldn’t be held responsible forslavery.. Many tax cuts benefit the wealthy,since they focus on things like home ownership and investments. But economists argue that providing tax cuts for poorer families could help them have a betterstandard of living,save money, and increase their wealth.. The federal minimum wage has remained $7.25/hour for over a decade – and there's been a push to increase it to$15/houramid the COVID-19 pandemic. While manystates have a higher minimum wage, raising it nationally would help boost wages for low-income jobs. Andstudiesshow it could decrease poverty and reliance on public assistance programs like foodstamps. There are major racial disparities in access to health care in the US and in the health of US citizens. Black Americans have higher rates of chronic health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease than white Americans. Black women are three to four times more likely to die from apregnancy-related death than white women. And the death rate fromCOVID-19is disproportionately high among Black Americans. Some of the health disparities can be linked to institutional racism in living conditions and higher poverty rates. Black Americans are also nearly twice as likely as white Americans to beuninsured, making them less likely to get care. There's also an underlying factor of discrimination and bias in the care Black Americans receive. The US health caresystem wassegregated for much of the 20th century. Example: Black patients were denied entry to white hospitals or forced tostay in different wards and wings. That began to change after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the passage of Medicare in 1965. The Civil Rights Act bannedsegregation in programs and at institutions that got federal money. So hospitals that wanted federal funding from Medicare quickly integrated. But other racist practices continued. The Tuskegee Study. It was a 40-year experiment by the US Public Health Service. Starting in 1932, it tracked hundreds of Black men in Alabama with untreatedsyphilis. The patients weren’t told the truth about thestudy and were denied proper treatment for the disease. That led tosome of them passingsyphilis on to their families andsuffering needlessly, until thestudy was publicly exposed in 1972. It’sstill linked as a reason whysome Black Americans distrust the US healthsystem to this day. Yep, especiallysince disparities in care haven'tstopped. Studies haveshown Black patients are less likely to get proper treatment for pain management or heart issues than white patients. And are misdiagnosed more frequently withschizophrenia. Onestudy even found half of white medicalstudents and residents believed at least one myth about physiological differences between Black people and white people – like that Black people have a higher tolerance for pain. Butsome things are changing. Since key parts of the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014,studiesshow more Americans have access to health care and insurance. And that coverage rates went up the most among Black and Hispanic Americans. Disparities in coveragestill exist, but the law helped narrow them. Since the end ofslavery, the US legalsystem has been used over and over again tosanction racial discrimination. Studiesshow there arestill racial disparities in everystep of the criminal justicesystem – Black people are disproportionatelystopped by police,arrestedand unlikely to make bail. And they receive disproportionately highersentences and are less likely to receiveparole. Pew Research Centersays 33% of the peoplesentenced to prison are Black, even though Black people make up about 12% of the adult population in the US. And the US has the largest incarceration rate in the world, with more than 2 million people imprisoned in 2016. The US prison population has exploded in the last few decades. Drug-related and violent crimes in the US went up dramatically in the late 1960s, and could be due in part to increased urbanization and rising homicide rates among African Americans. Both the feds andstatesstarted adoptingstrictersentencing laws. Some created racial disparities in punishments. For instance, a1986 drug lawman dated harsher punishments for crack cocaine possession (used more commonly by Black defendants) than powder cocaine (used more commonly by white defendants) – even though it’s two versions of thesame drug. Meaning: Black defendants were punished more harshly. There have been changes. In2010, President Obamasigned a law to reduce the penalty disparity between crack and powder cocaine charges. And in2018, President Trumpsigned another law to apply those changes retroactively. That law also reduced mandatory minimumsentences for certain crimes. Data alsoshows the racial disparity in incarceration rates has declinedsomewhat in recent years, but it’sstill high. Researcherssay that could be due to a number of things, including criminal justice reform and falling crime rates. But the disparities in our criminal justicesystemstill exist. And one area that's been getting a lot of national attention lately is... The police killings of Daunte Wright, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd havesparked nationwide protests. But their deaths weren’t isolated cases. Researchshows police are more likely to use force against and kill Black Americans. And there’s also a history of racism in policing in the US. Some of the first police forces in the country were “slave patrols.” They were groups of men who would hunt down enslaved people who ran away andsuppress rebellions. And during the Jim Crow era, Black communities were heavily policed. Some law enforcement officials were also members of the KKK. There’s a growing push for police reform. Some have called tode fund the police, which generally meansshifting funds from police tosocialservices. The Minneapolis City Council has pledged to disband its police force, anda number of cities have already moved toward de funding their police force. On the federal level, theHouse has passedsweeping police reform legislation. It would ban choke holds and certain no-knock warrants, and make a national database to track police misconduct. Unclear if or when the Senate will take up that bill. The 15th Amendment technically gave Black men the right to vote in the US in 1870. (Women got the right to vote in 1920.) But in reality, Black votersuppression continued for nearly another hundred years. In the Jim Crow era,southernstates put up all kinds of barriers to prevent Black Americans from voting. They included poll taxes, literacy tests (andso-called “grandfather clauses” that exempted white voters from complying with these rules), intimidation, and outright violence. This began to change after the passage of theVoting Rights Actin 1965. It’s considered one of the most important civil rights laws ever passed in the US. The Voting Rights Act banned the use of literacy tests, called for Federal examiners in counties with a history of voting discrimination (who would register qualified citizens to vote), and required those areas to get “preclearance” before they could change voting rules. And it was hugely effective. TheUS Commission on Civil Rightsfound the voter registration rate among non-white citizens in Mississippi was 6.7% in 1964. By 1967, it was nearly 60%. Since 2010, about half thestates in the US have enacted tighter rules on voting like voter ID laws, cutting early voting hours, and voter roll purges. Supporterssay the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Butstudiesshow voter fraud israre, and critics point out the disproportionate impactsome of these laws have on Black Americans and other minorities. Also, a Supreme Court ruling appeared to have made matters worse. In2013, the Court essentially ruled thatstates with a history of discrimination no longer had to get the federal gov’s ok before they changed voting laws – givingstates a lot more leeway. States had argued that the rule was based on decades-old data and was outdated, and the court agreed. Criticssaid it wasstill needed to prevent discrimination. Yes. StudiesshowBlack Americans are less likely than white Americans to have a government-issued ID (which expertssay can be expensive and difficult to obtain) – making it harder to comply with voter ID laws. States like North Carolina put restrictions on early voting, which was disproportionately used by Black voters. That law was laterstruck down. The2018 Georgia governor’s race had major allegations ofsuppression of Black voters because of voter roll purges and an “exact match” law that blockedsomeone’s voter registration if the name on the voter roll didn’t exactly match the name on their government-issued ID. And early 2021,GeorgiaandArkansaspassed voting restriction bills that do things like cut the time people have to request an absentee ballot, require asignature match for absentee ballots, limit the use of ballot drop boxes, ban handing out food and water in poll lines, and more.

Distance learning has created a lot of challenges for manystudents, from lack of internet and technology access to increased isolation. But forstudents withADHDand learningdisabilities, online classes can prove near impossible. Jessica, 22, learned that the hard way when theCOVID-19pandemic forced her college courses to move online in thespring. In a video as part ofGirl Effect’s Hear Her Voiceseries, Jessica, who has ADHD,said learning online proved troubling for her asshe found herself distracted and not paying attention to her computerscreen. “I feel I’m very intelligent, but having to [learn] online really brought me down,” Jessicasaid in the clip.“I’msitting at my desk, doing my work and, five minutes later, I’m distracted doingsomething else. It’s also very difficult for me to prioritize what things Ishould do in what order Ishould do them,”shesaid. “It reallysucks and it makes mesadsometimes because I don’t really know how to help myself.”According to theCenters for Disease Control,ADHD is a neuro-developmental disorder that makes it hard for people to concentrate or control impulses and may make them overly active. It’s most often diagnosed in childhood and can last through adulthood. While ADHD is not considered a learning disability, as many ash alf of people with the disorder also have aspecific learning disability. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in the 2018–2019school year, 7.1 millionstudents in the United States had a disability;33% of those had aspecific learning disability and 15% had a disability categorized under “other health impairment,” which ADHDoften falls under. A United Nationsreportcautioned that, forstudents with disabilities, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely exacerbating their exclusion from education, as they are the least likely to benefit from distance learning. The report (which includes all disabilities, not just learning disabilities) cautions that thesestudents may not have access to in-school resources that help them manage their disability. Not having access to in-person learning could be detrimental to thesestudents’ education, which Jessica experienced firsthand. Shesaid her grades in her online classessuffered, which was upsetting for her.“When I found out we were going to have to do onlineschooling for the rest of the year [in thespring], I was like, no, this can’t be. I immediately thought to myself, If this is what it’s like nextschool year or nextsemester, I’m not going to go toschool because I just cannot learn online,”shesaid. On campus, Jessicasaidshe’s better able to focus in class by engaging with her educators.“The way I wouldstay engaged on campus and in person was by asking questions to the teacher. As I’m asking questions, the teacher is talking to mespecifically,”shesaid. Thisstrategy,shesuspected, helps otherstudents with ADHD by breaking up the learning experience. “Having ADHD is very common — maybe there was another person with ADHD in my class and it was probably helpful for them to not always listen to the teacher and listen tosomeone else in the class.”To makesurestudents with disabilities get the education they deserve, the United Nationssaid it’s important for educators to center thesestudents, makingsure they have any added resources they may need, and that they’re fully included in plans to return to in-personschool. Making these programs inclusive and focusingspecifically onstudents with disabilities could make all the difference.",1,1,Teen Vogue
648,Stop Calling the Military Budget a ‘Defense’ Budget,-25.0,30.67,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/stop-calling-the-military-budget-a-defense-budget/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,25,"It’s bad enough that mainstream news outlets routinely call the Pentagon budget a “defense” budget. But the fact that progressives in Congress and even many antiwar activists also do thesame is an indication of how deeply the mindsets of the nation’s warfarestate are embedded in the political culture of the United States. The misleading first name of the Defense Department doesn’t justify using “defense” as an adjective for its budget. On the contrary, the ubiquitous use of phrases like “defense budget” and “defensespending” — virtually always written with a lower-case “d” — reinforces the false notion that equates the USA’s humongous military operations with defense. In the real world, the United Statesspends more money on its military than the next 10 countries all together. Andmost of those countries are military allies. What about military bases in foreign countries? The U. S. currently has750, while Russia has about two dozen and China hasone. The author of the landmark book “Base Nation,” American University professor David Vine, just co-wrote are port that points out “the United States has at least three times as many overseas bases as all other countries combined.” Those U. S. bases abroad “cost taxpayers an estimated $55 billion annually.”As this autumn began, Vinenotedthat President Biden is “perpetuating the United States’ endless wars” in nations including “Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Yemen” while escalating “war-like tensions with China with a military buildup with Australia and the UK.”All this is being funded via a “defense” budget?Calling George Orwell. As Orwell wrote in a 1946essay, political language “is designed to make liessound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance ofsolidity to pure wind.” In 2021, the hot air blowing at gale force through U. S. mass media isso continuous that we’re apt toscarcely give it asecond thought. But the euphemisms would hardly mean anything to those in faraway countries for whom terrifying and lethal drone attacks and other components ofU. S. air warsare about life and death rather than political language. You might consider the Pentagon’s Aug. 29 killing of10 Afghan civilians includingseven children with a drone attack to be a case of “respectable” murder, or negligent homicide, or mere “collateral damage.” Likewise, you could look at numbers like 244,124 — a credible low-end estimate of the number of civilians directly killed during the “war on terror” in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq — and consider them to be mere data points or representing individuals whose lives are as precious as yours. But at any rate, from the vantage point of the United States, it’s farfetched to claim that the billions of dollars expended for ongoing warfare inseveral countries are in a budget that can be legitimately called “defense.”Until 1947, the official name of the U. S. government’s central military agency was the War Department. After a two-year interim brand (with the clunk y name National Military Establishment), it was renamed the Department of Defense in 1949. As it happened, that was thesame year when Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” appeared, telling of an always-at-war totalitarian regime with doublespeakslogans that included “War Is Peace.”Today, the Department of Defense remains an appropriately capitalized proper noun. But the department’s official name doesn’t make it true. To call its massive and escalating budge ta “defense” budget is nothing less than internalized corruption of language that undermines our capacities to think clearly and talkstraight. Whilesuch corroded language can’t be blamed for the existence ofsloppy thinking and degraded discourse, it regularly facilitatessloppy thinking and degraded discourse. Let’s blow away the linguistic fog. The Pentagon budget is not a “defense” budget. Use code 30years for 30% off all Merchandise!Dismiss",1,0,CounterPunch

The campaign, which has thesupport of more than35 human rights groups, aims to draw attention to retailstores using facial-scanning algorithms to boost their profits, intensifysecuritysystems, and even track their employees. The campaign comes as a clear reminder that the reach of facial recognition goes far beyond law enforcement and into the private, commercialstorefronts we regularly visit. Experts warn that facial recognition in thesespaces is particularly concerning because the technology is largely unregulated and undisclosed, meaning both customers and employees may be unaware thissoftware issurveil ling and collecting data about them.“A lot of people would probably besurprised to know how many retailers that theyshop in on a regular basis are using this technology in a variety of ways to protect their profits and maximize their profits as well,” Caitlin Seeley George, a campaign director at Fight for the Future, told Recode. While you may not have heard of it before,stores using facial recognition isn’t a new practice. Last year,Reutersreported that the drug chain Rite Aid had deployed facial recognition in at least 200stores over nearly a decade (before the companysuddenly committed to ditching thesoftware). In fact, facial recognition is just one ofseveral technologiesstore chains are deploying to enhance theirsecuritysystems, or to otherwisesurveil customers. Someretailers, for instance, have used ap ps and in-store wi fi to track users while they move around physicalstores and later target them with online ads. A handful of popularstores, including the grocery chain Albertsons and Macy’s, are already using facial recognition, according to Fight for the Future’sdatabase. How exactly these retailers are using facial recognition can be unclear,since companies typically aren’t up front about it. At thesame time, a growing number of technologystartups andsecurity firms are looking for opportunities tosell thissoftware tostores. Some of thesesellers are already well-known, like Clearview AI, the controversialstartup thatscraped billions of people’s images fromsocial media. But there are plenty of other facial recognition providers that have attracted less attention,such as firms likeAnyVision, which announced it had raised $235 million just last week. RelatedStores are embracing facial recognition tech because, they claim, it can help them prevent theft. But experts warn this technology raises alarms. Customers rarely know that this technology is in use, leaving them without the opportunity tosay no or remove themselves from astore’s facial recognition-based watch list. At thesame time, facial recognition algorithms can be inaccurate, and come withbuilt-in racial and gender biases. In 2019, Apple wassued by a New York undergraduatestudent who alleges that the company uses facial recognition tech forsecurity purposes and that it inaccurately linked him toseveral thefts atApplestores that he didn’t commit.“We’re really concerned about how employees at retailers using facial recognition are impacted in a large part because they don’t really have an option to opt out if it comes to a point where people can either have their job and be undersurveillance or not have a job,” George, of Fight for the Future, told Recode. Customers living in areas where there are few options forstores can also end up being coerced into accepting the technology,she added. One of the main challenges is that facial recognition is mostly unregulated, and many current efforts to rein in the technology primarily focus on its use by government and law enforcement. “The laws areso different it would be probably impossible to write a clean, clearly understood bill regulating both consumer and government,” Brian Hofer, who helped put together the facial recognition bani n San Francisco, told Recodelast year. But there have been attempts to regulate this tech, even when used privately. In 2019, Lowe’s and Home Depot weresued for using facial recognition in violation of Illinois’sbiometric privacy law, one of thestrongest laws in the country. Just this month,a New York City law finally went into effect that requiresstores and businesses to tell customers when they collect their biometric data. And this week, the commission that oversees the Port of Seattle voted to ban biometric tech from itsfacilities. While members of Congress have proposedseveral ideas for giving customers more protection against private companies’ use of facial recognition, there’s yet to besignificant regulation at the federal level. “In the vast majority of cities and towns, there are no rules on when private companies can usesurveillance tech, and when they canshare the information with police, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], or even private ads,” warns Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. In the meantime, Fight for the Future is moving forward with its plan to call out companies already using the technology. The group is also collecting information about competingstores that don’t use facial recognition,so people can have the option to avoid thissurveillance if they want. An earlier version of thisstorysaid Ace Hardware uses facial recognition. Ace Hardwaresaid in astatement that thespecificstore location Fight for the Future cited in its database does not use the technology. Ace Hardware did not clarify whether any otherstore locations use this tech. Fight for the Future hassince updated its database.

651,Trump admits he would have ignored coronavirus even without impeachment,-11.0,40.0,https://americanindependent.com/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-impeachment-republicans-white-house-covid-19/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-independent-bias-reliability/,2020-04-01,25,"Republicans have been trying to blame impeachment for the federal government’sslow response to the coronavirus, but Trump just contradicted them. Republicans have been trying to blame impeachment for the federal government’sslow response to the coronavirus, but Trump just contradicted them. Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed thespreading Republican excuse that impeachment led to aslow and botched response to the COVID-19 pandemic.“I don’t think I would have done any better had I not been impeached,” Trumpsaid at his daily coronavirus news conference from the White House. “And I think that’s a great tribute tosomething — maybe it’s a tribute to me — but I don’t think I would’ve acted any differently, or I don’t think I would’ve acted any faster.”A handful of GOP lawmakers have blamed the impeachment proceedings for the Trump administration’s failure to takeswift action as the coronavirusspread in the United States — an admission that the Trump administration wasslow to respond in and of itself. As news of a potential outbreaksurfaced in China last year, the administration ignored guidelines from a National Security Councilplaybookcompiled in 2016 by former President Barack Obama’s administration, which laid outsteps Trump could have taken tostop a pandemic in its tracks, including ensuring proper diagnostic capability,stockpiling personal protective equipment and other critical tools, and delivering a “unified message” from the beginning. Following aslow initial response, the Trump administration has faced criticism over theshortage of testing kits, the lack of personal protective equipment for front-line medical workers, and mixed messages from Trump, including howseriously to take the virus. As that criticism grew, GOP lawmakers unveiled a newstrategy to divert attention from Trump’sshortcomings. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner was one of the first Republicans to blame impeachment for theslow response,saying on March 23: “I hadsaid, ‘We have to have a hearing. Thissounds veryserious. We have to have a hearing. We have to have a briefing.’ And guess what was going on in the middle of all this? Impeachment was going on.”Sen. John Cornyn of Texas alsosaid impeachmentslowed Trump’s response,tweetingon March 24 that Trump “did lose ‘precious weeks’ forced to defend himself against bogus impeachment charges.”Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pinned the bungled response on impeachment,tellingright-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday that impeachment “diverted the attention of the government because everything, every day was all about impeachment.”But assoon as that message appeared tosolidify among the GOP rank and file, Trump knocked it down.“Did it divert my attention? I think I’m getting A-plusses for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment,” Trumpsaid Tuesday. More than 16,000 babies were born in Texas in 2022 than in 2021, a newstudy from the University of Houstonshows. A bipartisan package of bills in Michigansigned by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, createsspecified criminal penalties for assaulting health care workers.

S. torched more dry forest landscape in Oregon on Sunday, one of dozens of major blazes burning across the West as critically dangerous fire weather loomed in the coming days. The destructive Bootleg Fire just north of the California border grew to more than 476square miles (1,210square kilometers), an area about thesize of Los Angeles. Erratic winds fed the blaze, creating dangerous conditions for firefighters,said Sarah Gracey, aspokeswoman for the firefighting operation.“We’restill facing a lot of weather issues,”shesaid Sunday. “The winds have been … hampering our efforts most of the time.”Authorities expanded evacuations that now affectsome 2,000 residents of a largely rural area of lakes and wildlife refuges. The blaze, which is 22% contained, has burned at least 67 homes and 100 outbuildings while threatening thousands more. At the other end of thestate, a fire in the mountains of northeast Oregon grew to more than 17square miles (44square kilometers) by Saturday night. The Elbow Creek Fire thatstarted Thursday has prompted evacuations inseveralsmall, remote communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers)southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. In California, a growing wildfiresouth of Lake Tahoe jumped a highway, prompting more evacuation orders and the cancellation of an extreme bike ride through the Sierra Nevada on Saturday. The Tamarack Fire, which wassparked by lightning on July 4, had charred nearly 29square miles (74square kilometers) of dry brush and timber as of Sunday morning. The blaze was threatening Markleeville, asmall town close to the California-Nevadastate line. It has destroyed at least twostructures, authoritiessaid. A notice posted on the 103-mile (165-kilometer) Death Ride’s websitesaidseveral communities in the area had been evacuated and ordered all riders to clear the area. The fire left thousands of bikers andspectatorsstranded in thesmall town and racing to get out. Kelli Pennington and her family were camping near the town Fridayso her husband could participate in his ninth ride when they were told to leave. They had been watchingsmoke develop over the course of the day, but were caught off guard by the fire’s quickspread.“It happenedso fast,” Penningtonsaid. “We left our tents, hammock andsome foods, but we got most of our things,shoved our two kids in the car and left.”Meteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather with lightning possible through at least Monday in both California andsouthern Oregon.“With the very dry fuels, any thunderstorm has the potential to ignite new firestarts,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California,said on Twitter. Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change haveswept the region, making wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.

653,Britney Spears: New documents about the star’s conservatorship should worry all women,-3.0,43.0,https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/britney-spears-conservatorship-court-documents-b1871464.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/independent-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,25,"The Independent's journalism issupported by our readers.

Thestar reportedlysaid thatshe wasn’t even allowed to repaint her own kitchen cabinets after being judged mentally unfit under legislation that usually applies to verysevere cases,such as late-stage dementia patientsFind your bookmarks in yourIndependent Premiumsection, under my profileFind your bookmarks in yourIndependent Premiumsection, under my profilePerforming in 2018According to aexclusive, Britney Spears told a court in 2019 thatshe felt her conservatorship — controlled by her father Jamie Spears — had forced her into a mental health facility against her will as punishment forstanding up for herself during a rehearsal. That particular detailsounds positively Victorian — because men wielding mental health as a weapon is nothing new. Jamie Spears was appointed conservator in 2008 after Britney had a public mental health crisis, brought on at least in part by years of public humiliation and harassment. She was twicesent to the hospital to undergo involuntary psychological evaluations. Conservatorships aresupposed to be used as a last resort for people who are totally incapacitated and unable to care for themselves,such as dementia patients. That’s why it wassurprising when a judge ruled that not only was Britney incapable of caring for herself,she was not even equipped to hire her own lawyer to represent her. Thearticle published this week reports that Britney vigorouslystressedshe did not want her father — whoshesays had a history ofsubstance abuse and domestic abuse — to be in charge. Butshe was consistently overruled. While under the conservatorship, Britney reportedlysaidshe was constantlysurrounded bysecurity, drug-testedseveral times weekly, and that her credit card was held by hersecurity team or assistant and used at their discretion. She evensaid that whenshe wanted to make changes assmall as re-staining her kitchen cabinets, her father forbid it on the grounds that it cost too much money. In the 19th century,men hired psychiatrists to investigate their wives and daughters for everything from exhaustion to PMS to remaining unmarried. And leveraging the medical field of psychiatry as a tool ofsuppression has continuedsince then. Moving into the 20th century, while involuntary commitments became less common, psychiatric drugs and antidepressants were frequently marketed toward and prescribed to women,believed to be more naturally inclined toward anxiety and neuroticism, as a means of helping them cope with day-to-day life as wives and homemakers after the Second World War. Even today, there is well-documented researchshowing that medical professionals are more likely to misdiagnose women’s physicalsymptoms as psychological. We can alsosee how the pervasive belief in women’s mental weakness and vulnerability plays into howsociety, and the legalsystem remainsso unwilling to trust women who make allegations ofsexual assault. Underpinning conversations between men about what constitutes “legitimate rape” and whether women can be trusted to have bodily autonomy is an assumption that women are inherently incapable of rationality onsome level; that we’re prone to exaggeration and misinterpretation, and overly guided by our emotions. That pervasive belief in female mental vulnerability plays out in interpersonal relationships. The term “gaslighting” has lately been used to refer to a wide range of narcissistic and manipulative behaviors, but its literal meaning is when one party makes another believe they are insane as a means of controlling them. Andsociologistssay that this dynamic generally plays out along gendered lines. In “The Sociology of Gaslighting,” Paige L. Sweet writes, “Gaslighting works when perpetrators mobilize gender-basedstereotypes, intersecting inequalities, and institutional vulnerabilities against victims. Thissecond point is critical because women do not typically have the cultural, economic, and political capital necessary to gaslight men — gaslighting is therefore a gendered phenomenon. In fact, whether or not it is exercised by a male-bodied person against a female-bodied person, gaslighting tactics construct victims in terms of feminized irrationality.”Writing forVox,Robin Sternsays, “It’s also worth noting that in my practice, the gaslight er is typically a man and the gaslightee is typically a woman. In my clinical experience, many women aresocialized to doubt themselves and continually apologize for disagreeing or upsetting their partners. Men are not.”Similarly, in the workplace or in politics, women whoshow emotion or raise their voices are routinely described as “crazy,” “unhinged,” “irrational,” or “angry.”In the case of an actual mental health crisis like Britneysuffered in 2007, the case for her mental unfitness was already halfway constructed by these institutional and cultural building-blocks. “Any time Britney wants to end her conservatorship,she can ask her lawyer to file a petition to terminate it;she has always had this right but in 13 years has never exercised it,” Jamie Spears’ attorney Vivian L. Thoreensaid in astatement toPeople. “Britney knows that her daddy loves her, and that he will be there for her whenever and ifshe needs him, just as he always has been — conservatorship or not.”Thisstatement, with its infantilizating use of the word “daddy”, is based on those building-blocks. That the judge, according to thereport, would consider ending the conservatorship but not guarantee it if Britneysaw a therapist and returned a year of clean drug tests is built on these principles as well. As is theTimes’ assertion that the judge and lawyers on bothsides worried Britney’s discontent with the conservatorship was provoked by her boyfriend. The case has not beensettled, and Britney’s allegations have not been proven. But, if true, the picture they paint appears toshow how easy itstill is to use a woman’s mental health against her.

A 30-second video uploaded to Trump’s website,donaldjtrump.com,seemed to tease justsuch a forthcoming platform:“In a time ofsilence and lies / A beacon of freedom arises / A place tospeak freely andsafely / Straight from the desk of Donald J.

Thesite will allow Trump to post content (like he does now) and followers will be able toshare his web posts onsocial mediasites (like they do now), but Trump’s “platform” does not allow users to like or reply to the content, which are features that most off-the-shelf b logging platforms had circa 1998.“This is just a one-way communication,” asource told Fox News. “Thissystem allows Trump to communicate with his followers.”For all intents and purposes, Trump has invented the website.

655,Trump deploys feds to more states under ‘law-and-order’ push,-0.1,46.4,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/22/trump-law-enforcement/112336528/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"— President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he willsend federal agents into Chicago and Albuquerque to help combat rising crime, expanding the administration’s intervention in local enforcement as he runs for reelection under a “law-and-order” mantle. Using thesimilar language to that he has employed in the past to describe illegal immigration, Trump painted Democrat-led cities as out of control and lashed out at the “radical left,” even though criminal justice expertssay the increase in violence insome cities defies easy explanation.“In recent weeks there has been a radical movement to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police department,” Trumpsaid at a White House event, blaming the movement for “ashocking explosion ofshootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence.”“This bloodshed must end,” hesaid. “This bloodshed will end.”The decision to dispatch federal agents to American cities is playing out at a hyper politicized moment when Trump is trying toshow that hestands with law enforcement and depict Democrats as weak on crime. With less than four months to go before Election Day, Trump has issued dire warnings that the violence would worsen if his Democratic rival Joe Biden is elected in November. In trying to explain thespike in violence, experts point to the unprecedented moment the country is living through — a pandemic that has killed more than 140,000 Americans, historic unemployment,stay-at-home orders, a mass reckoning over race and police brutality, intensestress and even the weather. Compared with other years, crime is down overall. Local authorities have also complained that deploying federal agents to their cities has only exacerbated tensions on thestreets. Hundreds of federal agents already have beensent to Kansas City, Missouri, to help quell a record rise in violence after theshooting death of a young boy there. Sending federal agents to help localities is not uncommon. Barr announced asimilarsurge effort in December forseven cities that hadseenspiking violence. Usually, the Justice Departmentsends agents under its own umbrella, like agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or the Drug Enforcement Agency. But thissurge effort will include at least 100 Department of Homeland Security Investigations officers working in the region who generally conduct drug trafficking and child exploitation investigations. DHS officers have already been dispatched to Portland, Oregon, and other localities to protect federal property and monuments as Trump has lambasted efforts by protesters to knock down Confederatestatutes. But civil unrest in Portland only escalated after federal agents there were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable case. Thespike in crime has hit hard insome cities with resources alreadystretched thin from the pandemic. But local leaders initially rejected the move tosend in federal forces. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot latersaidshe and other local officials hadspoken with federal authorities and come to an understanding.“I’ve been very clear that we welcome actual partnership,” the Democratic mayorsaid Tuesday afterspeaking with federal officials. “But we do not welcome dictatorship. We do not welcome authoritarianism, and we do not welcome unconstitutional arrest and detainment of our residents. That issomething I will not tolerate.”Detroit Mayor Mike Duggansaid Wednesday that he and police Chief James Craig talked with federal officials on Tuesday and there’s no indication that there will be any homelandsecuritystaffers coming to Detroit.“Certainly, the chief and I made it very clear thatsending in folks from the Department of Homeland Security to deal with protesters, we didn’t even accept the National Guard at the height of the protest,” hesaid. “We made a decision early on that the bond between the Detroit Police Department and this community wasstrong enough that we could handle the protests ourselves.”Detroit, which last year reported the highest violent crime rate in the United States,saw pockets of disorder and dozens arrested during the first few days of protests that began in the city May 29, after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Tensions flared June 28, when a police carstruck protesters during an anti-police brutality march, and again July 10 after police fatallyshot a man who fired a gun at them during an arrest. Butso far, Duggansaid, nostores have been looted or firesstarted.“We are continuing tosee Detroitersstand up in a very vocal way andsay, ‘you are not going to tear up our town,’” hesaid. The city would welcomesupport if it means adding more extra gun prosecutors in the U. S. Attorney’s office and more efforts by ATF to get illegal guns off thestreet, Duggansaid. In New Mexico, meanwhile, Democratic elected officials were cautioning Trump against any possible plans tosend federal agents to thestate, with U. S. Sen. Martin Heinrich calling on Bernalillo County Sheriff Manny Gonzales, who will be at the White House on Wednesday, to resign.“Instead of collaborating with the Albuquerque Police Department, the Sheriff is inviting the President’sstorm troopers into Albuquerque,” the Democraticsenatorsaid in astatement. But federal gun crimes generally carry muchstiffer penalties thanstate crimes – and larger-scale federal investigations that can crossstate lines tend to make a big impact. The Justice Department will reimburse Chicago $3.5 million for local law enforcement’s work on the federal task force. Through aseparate federal fund, Chicago received $9.3 million to hire 75 new officers. Two dozen agents will besent to Albuquerque, and the administration made available $1.5 million in funding for the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department for five new deputies and $9.4 million for 40 new Albuquerque officers. In Kansas City, the top federal prosecutorsaid any agents involved in an operation to reduce violent crime in the area will be clearly identifiable when making arrests, unlike what has beenseen in Portland.“These agents won’t be patrolling thestreets,” U. S. Attorney Timothy Garrisonsaid. “They won’t replace or usurp the authority of local officers.”Operation Legend – named after 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatallyshot whilesleeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month – was announced on July 8. The first arrest came earlier this week. Garrison hassaid that the additional 225 federal agents from the FBI, DEA, ATF and the U. S. Marshals Service join 400 agents already working and living in the Kansas City area. The Trump administration is facing growing push back in Portland. Multiple lawsuits have been filed questioning the federal government’s authority to use broad policing powers in cities. Onesuit filed Tuesdaysays federal agents are violating protesters’ 10th Amendment rights by engaging in police activities designated to local andstate governments. Oregon’s attorney generalsued last week, asking a judge to block federal agents’ actions. Thestate argued that masked agents had arrested people on thestreets without probable cause and far from the U. S. courthouse that’s become a target of vandalism. Federal authorities, however,saidstate and local officials had been unwilling to work with them tostop the vandalism and violence against federal officers and the U. S. courthouse.",2,2,Detroit News
656,Panic Time,-6.33,43.67,https://www.cjr.org/special_report/panic_time.php/,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,,18,"In November, just before I went tosee Jerry Brown at the annual meeting of theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists,some eleven thousand climate expertssigned astatement declaring “clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.” At eighty-one, Brown, the former governor of California, was retired, but not really, having committed himself to fending off environmental disaster. Recently, he had testified before a Housesubcommittee, calling an attack by President Trump on California’s auto emissions rules “just plain dumb, if not commerciallysuicidal.” A month before that, he’d announced the creation of the California-China Climate Institute, a bilateral research and training initiative “tospur further climate action.” And just before finishing his last term as governor, he’dsigned on as the executive chair of theBulletin, which was eager tostake out territory in the climate fight. I’d arranged to interview Brown about his choice to join theBulletin, a nonprofit magazine founded in Chicago in 1945 by conscience-stricken alumni of the Manhattan Project. TheBulletincovers all things nuclear and is best known for its annual Doomsday Clock announcement, which draws on expert opinion to report just how close we are to the “midnight” of man-made apocalypse. But the publication’s original remit—to help “formulate the opinion and responsibilities ofscientists” and “educate the public” about the many “problems arising from the release of nuclear energy”—has broadened considerably. It now devotes equal attention to the threat of the climate crisis, including in thesetting of the clock. In this regard, theBulletinand a post-gubernatorial Brown were an ideal match. The meeting I attended, at the regal University Club in downtown Chicago, was Brown’ssecond with thescience andsecurity board, a group ofsubject-matter experts whoset the clock and advise the editorialstaff. (TheBulletinalso has two other boards: the governing board, a corporate and philanthropic fundraising body, and the board ofsponsors, which boasts thirteen Nobel laureates.) A few hundred people arrived, palling around and getting ready to talk all things apocalypse. The dress code for the event had called for business attire, but Brown turned up in crumpledslacks and a navy-bluesweater—asuitcasescrewup, he explained. Why theBulletin? I asked. “Number one is, of course, the reduction of the nuclear threat, but climate is another huge threat to humanity,” hesaid. “And theBulletin, by linking the two threats, can increase public awareness, get people thinking about the big threats that humanity faces.” Brown complained, in his jocular, pugnacious way, that the American news media’s “servitude to the concept of the news of the day” is partly to blame for public ignorance about climate change. He asked me repeatedly, “How can journalism coversomething as diffuse and general and gradual as climate change?” As we chatted,searching for answers, I thought of the untold amount of carbon we’d all combusted to get to Chicago. I nextsaw Brown at the opening luncheon, in the buffet line amongBulletinfunders and fans. The crowd resembled that of a classical-music concert: old, white, intellectual. The day included threesets of workshops, led by eminentscientists and policy wonks, then a closing plenarysession and dinner banquet at Chicago’s Palmer House, a grand hotel dating to the late nineteenth century. At the dinner, Brown delivered an energetic, free-flowingspeech. “The worse it is, the more excited I am,” hesaid, the it being our current geopolitical, nuclear, and climate morass. “Let’s get it done!”Thatsecondit—the avoidance of total destruction—aptly distilled theBulletin’s mission. Since the atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the magazine has tried to convey the grave danger we’ve imposed on ourselves. Today, though the possibility of nuclear war remains real, the climate crisis feels just as daunting and consequential. Environmentalscientists know this, as do journalists who report on global warming. Yet theBulletin of the Atomic Scientistsmay be the only publication to cover climate change with an approach that is explicitly existential. What time is it? At the 2020 announcement of the Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin’s leaders declared us closer than ever to midnight. Lexey Swall Photography / Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsIn 2017, during aseemingly endless, ever-escalating row between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, theBulletin of the Atomic Scientistswas permanently tabbed in my browser window. Whatsome were calling a new “North Korean nuclear crisis” wasn’t really new or even a crisisso much as the crackling of a rather constant fire. Still, as a Korea watcher with family on the peninsula, and given the “statesmen” involved, I felt frightened and looked to theBulletinas a vitalsource of news and commentary. The magazine had, after all, invented the nuclear beat. From the very first issue, aslight, mimeographed newsletter published on the fourth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, theBulletinappealed to America and the rest of the world to eliminate nuclear weapons and establish “efficient international control” of atomic energy. Progress “will be useless if our nation is to live in continuous dread ofsudden annihilation,” the editorssaid at a conference in Moscow. “We can afford compromises, disagreements, or delays in other fields—but not in this one, where our verysurvival is atstake.” A few years on, theBulletinpublished the text of aspeech by Albert Einstein, delivered to journalists at the United Nations, in which he asked why global cooperation hadn’t yetstaved off the threat of apocalypse. Perhaps it would be different, hesuggested, if the atom bomb were not “one of the things made by Man himself.” Einstein later founded theBulletin’s board ofsponsors. TheBulletinevolved from a newsletter into a magazine, headquartered at the University of Chicago, and Martyl Langsdorf, a landscape painter and the wife of a Manhattan Project alumnus, designed asymbolic cover: an analog clock,set at 11:53pm, to represent the imminence of ourself-destruction. In 1949, when the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear device, Eugene Rabinowitch, theBulletin’s coeditor, decided to animate Langsdorf’s clock, winding it four minutes closer to midnight. It has ticked forward and backward eversince—through the proliferation of ballistic missiles; the catastrophes at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima; and the adoption of and American withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The Nuclear Notebook, a research column of hair-raising erudition, has appeared in every issuesince May 1987 and issecond only to the Doomsday Clock inBulletininfluence. Each Notebook installment analyzes a category ofstockpile—tactical nuclear weapons, for instance, or the Chinese nuclear arsenal—down to the quantity and types and locations of various arms and fissile materials. The interests of the magazine have always overlapped with those of environmentalists. EarlyBulletinscientists expressed a desire to make atomic energy a clean, limitless alternative to fossil fuels. That did not, of course, come to pass; more apparent were various kinds of long-term damage, from nuclear tests to plant meltdowns to radioactive waste buried on- and offshore, all of it documented in theBulletin. There’sstill no consensus on nuclear power. At the annual meeting, Robert Socolow, a member of thescience andsecurity board and a Princeton professor emeritus,said in a presentation, “I’mstill going back and forth on nuclear energy, because of the coupling of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.” There is always “some probability” of disaster, he added. Atomic energy, in any case, never came close to rivaling fossil fuels, and thesubject of climate change appeared in theBulletinas early as November 1961. “Climate to Order,” an article-cum–thought experiment by H. E. Landsberg, a German climatologist, described geoengineering—that is, hacking the atmosphere (reflectingsunlight, injecting chemicals into thestratosphere, etc.)—avant la lettre. In theory, Landsberg wrote, it would be great to customize our environment, but “When we are changing the climate of the whole world, a mistake could be disastrous.” In 1970, theBulletinran another piece on geoengineering, this time in relation to “polar ice” and “man’s inadvertent influences on global climate.” By 1972, a long, poetic account of the loss of forests and arable land would warn, “There is plenty of evidence that man is the principal cause of this change.”When I visited Rachel Bronson, the CEO and president of theBulletin, in the magazine’s Chicago offices,she plucked a bound library volume from hershelf and opened it to February 1978. “Is mankind warming the Earth?” William W. Kellogg, a meteorologist, queried in the magazine’s first climate-change coverstory. “The answer is, I believe, an unqualified ‘yes.’ ” Kellogg’s article might have been written today,sosalient are its arguments against delayed action and the conflating of extreme weather and atmospheric transformation. He included a message to colleagues who “maintain that weshould not publish any conclusions about the response of the climate to anthropogenic influences until we have done more homework,” expressing his disagreement “withsuch a conservative and noncommunicative attitude because thestakes areso great, the issuesso fundamental to the future ofsociety and most of all becausesome decisions are upon us that depend on everyscrap of insight we can muster.”By the end of the Cold War, mostscientists were aware of the dangers of climate change and its relation to atomic and geopolitical concerns. Around the time Bill McKibben publishedThe End of Nature, the first mass-market account of global warming, in 1989, theBulletinwas running pieces on thescience of climate change “side byside with heated denials that global warming posed any threat at all,” historians David Kaiser and Benjamin Wilson observe in aspecialseventieth-anniversary issue of theBulletin. The magazine also recast the debate over nuclear energy “amid new apprehension about greenhouse gas emissions and implications for global warming.” Len Ackland, the editor from 1984 to 1991, told me that it became clear “we needed to address longer-term environmental dangers.” To that end, he commissioned new artwork from Langsdorf: in her cover illustration for the October 1989 issue, the circle of the clock encloses a blue-and-white map of the world, the minute and hour hands radiating out from the North Pole. In 1992, theBulletinpublished a majorspeech by Mikhail Gorbachev thatset out environmental priorities for a post-Soviet world: “The prospect of catastrophic climatic changes—more frequent droughts, floods, hunger, epidemics, national-ethnic conflicts, and othersimilar catastrophes—compels governments to adopt a world perspective andseek generally applicablesolutions.”TheBulletinhas vacillated instyle over time, toggling between academic journal andscience magazine, but has always maintained a certainseriousness. When Ispoke to Bronson,she told me that tradition and expertise are no longer enough. “In the moment of populism in which we’re now operating, we’d better inform the populace,”shesaid. “Our power will come from having an educated and devoted following that’s larger than it is right now.” Recently, theBulletinhas adjusted its idioms; leaned more on interviews, explainers, personal essays, and multimedia; andstretched beyond an author base of older white male technocrats from Europe and the United States. There’s the Voices of Tomorrow column, which ran a moving essay by four teenage activists, including Isra Hirsi, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s daughter: “Adults won’t take climate changeseriously. So we, the youth, are forced tostrike.” There’s elegant multimedia reportage,such as deputy editor Dan Drollette’s “Tilting toward windmills,” about a test wind farm on Block Island, Rhode Island. And there’s refined polemic: for example, “Letscience bescience again,” by Yangyang Cheng, a Chinese physicist based in Chicago, onscience advocacy in the age of Donald Trump. A popular videoseries, “Say What? A clear-eyed look at fuzzy policy,” produced by multimedia editor Thomas Gaulkin, demonstrates that, even though theBulletinis nonpartisan, it’s religiously pro-science.“Some decisions are upon us that depend on everyscrap of insight we can muster.”Ticktock: Martyl Langsdorf, a landscape painter and the wife of a Manhattan Project alumnus, designed asymbolic Bulletin cover: an analog clock that would represent the imminence of ourself-destruction. That clock would become the magazine’s visual touchstone. Courtesy Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsIn recent years, theBulletinwebsite has more than quintupled its traffic, from about 42,000 visits per month in 2013 to 236,000 per month today. The audience remainssmall but is also—judging from the commentssection andsocial media—well connected and atypically informed:scientists, graduatestudents, journalists, the kinds of people whosubscribe toScientific AmericanandForeign Affairs. In response to a recent article on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that debunked thesupposed coming of a “little ice age,” commenter Cjones1 wrote: “You forgot to mention that lesssolar radiation allows more cosmic radiation which effects [sic] cloud cover. The IPCC predictions have been less accurate than a bone throwingshaman.” Fifty-five people responded to this with a thumbs-up. TheBulletindiscontinued its print edition in 2008 but maintains a distinction between its pay walled bimonthly magazine and other articles. A yearlysubscription costs eighty-six dollars and comes via Taylor & Francis, a profitable British publisher ofscholarly books and journals. Since 2011, John Mecklin hasserved as theBulletin’s editor in chief. Hesupervisessix editors,spread out across the United States, who commission and write;seven otherstaff members handle administration, public relations, and fundraising. Collectively, they aim to grow the magazine’s readership, assign more illustrations, and invest in narrative and investigative journalism. “I’m in the process of commissioning astory right now, payingsomebody two to three dollars a word,” Mecklin told me. “TheBulletinis doing well financially, but I can’t pay whatThe New Yorkerpayssomebody, or I can’t do it for very manystories a year.” Most pieces are written for nothing—“donated,” as Mecklin put it—by experts with day jobs. One of Mecklin’s predecessors, Mark Strauss, recalled compensating at least one contributor with aBulletinT-shirt. When Mecklin took the job, climate represented just “a quarter or 30 percent” of the magazine, he told me; it’s now “more like 40 percent nuclear, 40 percent climate.” As he explained, “What has evolved and changedsince I’ve been editor is that there are now three areas of focus: it’s nuclear, climate change, and this area we call disruptive technologies”—such as artificial intelligence and disinformation—asort of “threat multiplier of the first two.” Both Mecklin and Bronson described this expanded mission as logical and necessary, and in line with theBulletin’s history of tackling the impacts of cutting-edgescience. When I listened in on a recent editorial meeting, via Skype, I wasstruck by the magazine’ssimultaneously banal and illustrious character. The editors did what all editors do: they evaluated pitches and commissions, reviewedsocial mediastatistics (e.g., an “SUVshaming”story, by contributing editor Dawn Stover, that was “doing well on the interwebs”), brainstorm edstory ideas, and planned coverage. But everyso often,someone would refer to a famous politician orscientist (e.g., Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford physicist who has personally inspected North Korea’s nuclear arsenal) not as a dreamsubject or occasionalsource, but as a friend and adviser to the magazine. On questions of climate, for instance, they might consult Elizabeth Kolbert, a Pulitzer Prize–winningNew Yorkerwriter whosits on thescience andsecurity board. This is a publication with extraordinary history and reach. I thought ofsomething Mecklin told me when we firstspoke: “We want to be read in the White House, at the Kremlin, and at the kitchen table.”Among the prominentscientists closely involved with theBulletinis Raymond Pierrehumbert, a lavishly bearded and tweeded physicist, not of the nuclearsort. He joined the magazine’sscience andsecurity board while across campus at the University of Chicago. He hassince moved to Oxford, but remains heavily involved. In his work on “the early Earth” and planets around otherstars, he applies the “same physics we use to quantify the greenhouse effect on Earth,” he told me. “If you’re a climatescientist or paleontologist, you’vestudied the role of CO2in the Earth’s past history—you know that what humans are doing to the Earth’s climate is truly disturbing.” For his part, hesaid, “It would be irresponsible tostay in the lab.” Pierrehumbert once wrote a lively column onscience and politics forSlate; he also contributed to the websiteRealClimateand appeared in a well-intentioned rap video titled “We are climatescientists, Chicagostyle.” (He’s better as a folk musician.)In a recent coverstory for theBulletin, “There is no Plan B for dealing with the climate crisis,” Pierrehumbert argues in dramatic language against geoengineering. To pursue thatstrategy, he writes, would commit “generations yet unborn to continuously run a mechanical process, over a time-span longer than the age of the pyramids.… And if our offspring don’t, orsimply can’t, doso atsome point in the future, then they willsuffer the consequences of an unimaginably huge climateshock, accumulated over vast amounts of time.”When Isaw Pierrehumbert at the annual meeting, he wassheepish about thesin of his flight to get to Illinois. Yet heseemed energized by the company of his colleagues: fellow physicists, national-security experts, and politicians, including Jerry Brown, whom he admires. A few years ago, Pierrehumbert told me, he’d raised concerns with Brown about coal exports. If California allowed a proposed coal export terminal to be built, Pierrehumbert hadsaid, it would increase demand in China, putting all of our carbon reduction goals in jeopardy. The problems were confounding, the answer frustratinglysimple: “We need to put fossil fuel companies out of business, or at least their traditional business,” Pierrehumbert told me. “We will need to write down carbon to zero.” Brown heard him out, Pierrehumbert recalled, but “it was not on his radar.”In November, Pierrehumbert had California’s cap-and-trade program on his mind. A flaw of that and related markets, he told me, is that they apply an inaccurate equivalence “standard, mass for mass,” to methane and carbon dioxide, thereby exaggerating the role of methane in global warming. But “if we reopen the debate”—that is, rejigger the math of cap-and-trade—“we could lose the benefit on carbon dioxide. It’s politically complicated. I’m notsure it’s worth the risk,” he explained. “It’s too bad that Jerry Brown is no longer governor.” Even if he didn’t act on everything Pierrehumbert told him about, he had, at least, listened. Gavin Newsom, the new guy in Sacramento, has yet toshow up to aBulletinmeeting.“We want to be read in the White House, at the Kremlin, and at the kitchen table.”Illustration by Gaby D’AlessandroAt thestart of 2020, Bronson and herstaff flew to Washington, DC, as they do every January, to announce to the world what time it is. At the press conference, livestreamed to maximize virality, Bronson wore ascarlet dress andstood at a podium bearing theBulletin’ssomber black-and-white logo. In 2018 and 2019, the clock wasset at 11:58, the direst assessment by thescience andsecurity boardsince 1953, after both the United States and the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs. This year, alongside Brown; Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland; and Ban Ki-moon, a former UNsecretary-general, Bronson delivered an even grimmer report: the world was now a hundredseconds from apocalypse—“closer than ever to midnight,” as CNN would write. TheBulletin’s accompanyingstatement, authored by Mecklin and addressed to the “leaders and citizens of the world,” is aseven-page, reader-friendly recitation of man-made horrors andsuggested mitigations. Humanity is facing “astate of emergency that requires the immediate, focused, and unrelenting attention of the entire world,” it reads. The reasons are many. On the nuclearside, the US, Russia, and China retain theirstockpiles; Iran retreated from international cooperation, in response to America’s withdrawal from their nuclear deal and its assassination of a top Iranian military commander; the INF Treaty is no more and other arms agreements aresoon to expire. In terms of climate change, the US officially left the Paris Agreement; Brazil is allowing its precious rain forests to be destroyed; and greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise, zero-carbon rhetoric be damned. All this is made worse by a “corrupted and manipulated media environment” in which truth, let alonescientific reality, becomes increasingly unknowable. Still, theBulletinstatement offersshards of hope. “Climate change has catalyzed a wave of youth engagement, activism, and protest,” it observes. If we multiply this “mass civic engagement,” itstates, “there is no reason the Doomsday Clock cannot move away from midnight.”If the clock announcement invitessober reflection, it’s also an occasion to push for political action. Throughout its history, theBulletinhas balanced its journalistic mission with various forms of advocacy. Assoon as the atomicscientists in Chicago founded theBulletin, they joined with colleagues in Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Manhattan to lease an office in Washington, forming a Beltway collaboration that eventually became the Federation of American Scientists. Last year, just after the clock announcement, Bronson, Brown, and former defensesecretary William Perry, who now chairs theBulletin’s board ofsponsors, met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer—to lobby not for aspecific candidate or bill, but for arms control, diplomacy, and nuclear and climate policies rooted inscience. Bulletinstaff transmitted the ominous details of the clockstatement: North Korean nuclear proliferation, increasing carbon dioxide emissions, and information warfare. This year, alas, Congress was busy with impeachment proceedings. There is a tension, insuch conversations, between fear and hope. How much is too much apocalypse talk? “It’s very hard to find the words, even, to express the moment we now are in,” Brownsaid, during the clock announcement. “I myself am a person of limitless words, but I can’t find how tosay it insuch a way that it can be heard.” Back in November, at the end of the closing plenarysession, a tall, bespectacled woman in the audience raised her hand: Elizabeth Talerman, astrategic-communications expert, who offeredsome advice on framing. It’s best to avoid phrases like “existential threat,”shesaid, because they bum people out. The Doomsday Clock certainly has itsskeptics, mostly on the right. See: “Justskip the doomsday predictions, guys” (theNational Review); “Goose eggs: No climate change doomsday warning has come true” (theWashington Examiner); “The Climate Doomsday Trap” (the Cato Institute). Strauss, the former editor, told me that theBulletinhas played just as important a role in debunking “overhyped threats”—for example, “fears that terrorists mightstart massive forest fires”—as it has in playing up actual perils. When I asked Brown how theBulletinshould convey the urgency of the climate crisis, he didn’t have an easy answer. He brought up a document from 1992, a one-page “Warning to Humanity” published by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit whose members andstaff often write for theBulletin. “A great change in ourstewardship of the earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated,” thestatement reads. Brown’s point was that every climate messenger, not just at theBulletin,struggles to balance gloom and motivation. Meaghan Parker, executive director of the Society of Environmental Journalists, told me, “It’s notso much about the emotion—are you a doom writer or asolutions-and-hope writer?—but talking about thespecific, lived changes of real people.”SomeBulletinarticles punch and flail; others coax. Many do both, traipsing fromseemingly intractable problems to optimisticsolutions. In its March 2019 issue, theBulletinexamined “climate change action—from the right,” including an interview with Christine Todd Whitman, the former governor of New Jersey and head of the Environmental Protection Agency under George W. Bush, and an article about a Christian group, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action. Mecklin’s editor’s note offered practical guidance to “ungenerous corners” of the American left: “Republican officeholders are not likely to agree tosubstantive action on climate change until they feel it is clearly in their best political interest to doso. The best people to explain those best interests to Republican congressmen and women? Republicans who believe in climate action and vote their beliefs.” Recently, when Isat down to read a tallstack ofBulletinarticles, I felt a confusing combination of terror, depletion, and productive rage. Perhaps this is how the original atomicscientists felt, trembling from guilt, trying to pull us away from the abyss. Nuclear war,so overwhelming a concept, once needed its own metaphors to be understood. When theBulletinfirst took on climate change as an area of focus, it might haveseemed an odd fit. “As theysay, nuclear can do us in in an afternoon; climate change will take much longer,” Kennette Benedict, theBulletin’s former director and publisher, who oversaw the inclusion of climate change in the clock-setting, told me. But the two crises are now an inseparable apocalyptic pair. If memories of falloutshelters and air raid drills make risingsea levels and extreme temperatures feel more pressing, thenso be it.",1,1,Columbia Journalism Review

Focus on Michelle Fiscus, who had until then largely operated in the background of thestate health department, grew in mid-June when lawmakers became angry about a letter Fiscussent to medical providers who administer vaccines. The May letter was in response to questions from vaccine providers related to thestate's “Mature Minor Doctrine,"" a legal mechanism by which they are allowed to vaccinate certain minors above the age of 14 without consent from their parents. Fiscussaid the language in the letter was provided to her by the health department's attorney, whosaid at the time it had been ""blessed by the governor's office.""Later, lawmakers expressed concern the letter was unduly encouraging adolescents to get vaccinations without parental consent.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has racked up during her tumultuous first few months in Washington. She's also been pulling in big piles of cash. According to analysis of Federal Election Commission filings detailed atPolitico, the controversial freshman lawmaker has raised over $832,000 during the first quarter of this year. About half of that is from donations under $200 and the majority of it came via online donations from ActBlue - a wildlysuccessful online fundraising portal for leftist candidates and causes. Several people also gave maximum donations under federal law. A complete list of Omar's donors can be foundhere. Needless tosay, for a freshman to become one of House Democrats' top fund raisers in her first quarter is nosmall feat. However, most House freshmen also don'tspend their first few months getting as much national attention for controversialstatements like Omar has. Since beingsworn in back in January, the Minnesota representative has tweeted an anti-Semitic trope aboutJewish money, promoted a different anti-Semitic trope about dual loyalty, pushed for the release of a jailed Muslim Brotherhood leader, defended an older anti-Semitic tweet, avoided being the person named reason behind a Houseanti-hate resolution, and minimized 9/11 while flirting with a conspiracy theory about the attacks.

660,A Former Sony Employee Says She Was A Diversity “Token.” She’s Suing For Discrimination,-9.33,38.67,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/sony-racist-discrimination-lawsuit,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Monica Hill was among the employees Sony filmed to promote the company’s diversity. Butshesaysshe experienced racism in the workplace and was driven out forspeaking up. BuzzFeed News ReporterAstill from the Sony Black History Month videoshowing HillMonica Hill had worked at Sony for about three months whenshe and other Black employees were invited to appear in the company’s Black History Month video earlier this year andspeak about the power of Black voices as “Sonyshiningstars.” Actor Michael B. Jordan was featured in the video as well, which Hillsaid made her feel that the company was taking racial issuesseriously. Yet Hillsoon found that Sony’s representations of diversity did not match her reality,shesaid. She claimed that aftershe raised concerns about comments and treatment by hersupervisor thatshe found to be racist, Sony management retaliated against her, excluding her from meetingsshesaidsheshould have been a part of,stripping her of certain clients, and ultimately firing her whileshe was onsick leave after catching COVID-19. In a lawsuit filed this week in Californiastate court, the “Sonyshiningstar” claimedshe was hired “as a token to fill Sony’s diversity numbers.” “It was a lie,” Hillsaid in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Asked about Hill’s claims in the lawsuit, a Sonyspokespersonsaid “the company does not comment on confidential personnel matters,” but that “diversity, equity and inclusion are core to Sony.” Thespokespersonsaid the company takes complaints “seriously,” conducts proper and thorough investigations, and has a “committed focus” on thesuccess of all of its employees. Around the country, people of color are wondering whether the reckoning over racial inequality over the last year will have any meaningful impact, including in corporate America. BuzzFeed News recentlyspoke to people at nearly a dozen companies whosaid theyd read confronting racism in the workplace again when offices reopen. While Sonystatedon its diversity page that “diversity and inclusion are encoded in our DNA andshape a vibrant corporate culture” and last year expressedsolidarity with Black Lives Matter and the Black community at large, Hillsaid that in her experience the company did not live up tosuchstatements. Her experience at Sony was riddled with “microaggressions,” Hill, who is 40 and lives in Orlando,said in an interview. “It’s the disparaging comments that are often made, that people look past. It’s being blocked from opportunities that others would have.”After Sony asked Hill to appear in the Black History Month video in January, Hillsaid, hersupervisor,seniorsales manager Jaime Raffone, pushed back on Hill appearing in it. Hill claimed in her lawsuit that in conversations, Raffonesaid the “Black Lives Matter movement had made Blacks feel more powerful than they are and that Blacksshould feel grateful for whatever they are given,” that “she appreciates Blacks ‘who know their place’ and are willing to work hard instead of being given welfare,” and thatKamala Harriswas picked toserve as vice president “because of pressure from the Black Lives Matter movement.”Raffone, who is among the defendants listed in the lawsuit and has worked at Sony for more than 20 years, did not respond to multiple messagesseeking comment. Sony and Raffone have not yet filed a legal defense to the claims. A third-party investigation conducted for Sony earlier this year looking into Hill’s allegations of mistreatment and offensive comments concluded that there was no evidence that company policy had been violated, according to the lawsuit. Monica HillHillsaidshespoke tosales director Kevin O’Connor, company vice president of B2B Rich Ventura, and human resources manager Matthew Whelan about her manager’s allegedstatements and treatment of her, butsaid they dismissed her complaints. Hill later went back to Human Resources with concerns that Raffone, O’Connor, and Whelan were all personally close and therefore had a conflict of interest, according to the complaint. O’Connor, Whelan, and Ventura are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit. None of them responded to multiple requests for comment, and they have not yet responded in court to thesuit. Raffone and other members of Sony management “began a campaign of retaliation against [her] in an attempt tosabotage hersuccess at Sony and to cast her out,” according to the complaint. Her managerstarted a “success plan” on April 22 to improve Hill’s performance over the next 30 days but took opportunities away from her — like pulling her off certain accounts and excluding her from a meeting despite the client’s requests to include her, the complaintstated. Hillsaid that working for the company had been a dreamsinceshe’d gotten her first pair of Sony headphones years ago. Whenshe was interviewing for a position last October, Hillsaid, Sony emphasized diversity and inclusion. She was encouraged to apply and was hired for a job formingstrategic partnerships with companies that would buy Sony productssuch as projectors andscreens. In her complaint, however, Hillsaid thatshe had been hiredso that Sony could “fulfill its diversity requirements” but was not given “equal opportunities forsuccess.”As an affirmative action employer, a distinction granted to federal contractors, Sony is required to “recruit and advance qualified minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and covered veterans or lose its current contracts and eligibility for future contracts,” according to Hill’s attorney Nancy Abrolat. Hill claimed that despite these requirements, her managers at Sonysubjected her to racial and gender discrimination during much of her nearlyseven months at the company, a timeshespent working remotely, communicating over phone and video calls. She issuing Sony for damages, lost earnings, and injunctive relief to comply with affirmative action employment laws and tostop discrimination based on race and gender at Sony. An employee who worked with Hill and asked not to be named to protect their privacy echoed Hill’s claims, recounting that managers asked them to not explain certain business practices to Hill and exclude her on relevant calls unless otherwise necessary. Often, the employeesaid, Hill was passed up for work opportunities.“Itseemed very directed [against Hill],”said the employee, who was at Sony when Hill filed her complaints but hassince left the company. The employee who worked with Hillsaid that a representative contacted them as part of an HR inquiry involving Hill, but that the gist of the questions revolved around Hill’s behavior, according to their interpretation of the conversation: “Wasshe out of hand? Wasshe, you know, wasshe an angry Black woman?” the employee recalled. “They didn't ask that questionspecifically, obviously, but that's what it felt like.”BuzzFeed News also reached out to four other Sony employees in an effort to corroborate allegations made in the lawsuit, though none had responded by the time of publication. In May, Hill’s husband, daughters, and eventually Hill herself got COVID-19,shesaid. Shortly aftershe went onsick leave on May 19,she was let go, her lawsuitstated. According to her complaint, “Sony’s reasoning for her termination was [her]supposed failure to meet the requirementsset forth in her 'success plan.'”Hillsaw it differently.“Diversity and inclusion fraud is real,” Hillsaid in an interview. She hoped tospeak up for others experiencing discrimination despite their employers’ pledges,shesaid. “I want to give them a voice.”",1,1,BuzzFeed News

Nancy Rish, 59,saysshe was forced to participate with her boyfriend Danny Edwards in the kidnapping of Stephen Small because Edwards abused her and threatened to kill her. She claimsshe didn’t know what Edwards was intending to do. In an attempt to get Small’s family to pay a $1 million ransom, Edwards buried the businessman in a wooden box equipped with an air pipe — but Smallsuffocated. Rish drove Edwards around before and after Small was kidnapped. Small was an heir to a media fortune and the great-grandson of Len Small, Illinois governor from 1921 to 1929. Nancy Rish. Since 2017, Rish’s attorneys, Steven Becker and Margaret Byrne, have been trying to get the courts to reduce hersentence based on a 2015 change instate law. The change allows people convicted of felonies to challenge theirsentences if they can prove their crimes were linked to being domestic abuse victims. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul co-sponsored the change in the law when he was asenator, but his office has opposed Rish’s request for a newsentencing hearing,saying her life term was based on the “horrific nature of the crime in which [she] played an integral part.”A Kankakee County judge threw out Rish’s request for a newsentencing hearing,sayingshe failed toshow evidence of domestic violence that would likely “change thesentence imposed by the original trial court.”But on Thursday, the Illinois appeals court reinstated Rish’s case, finding the lower court judge erred. The lower courtshouldn’t have judged the facts of her case, butsimply whether her petition was properly filed, according to the appeals court, which has assigned Rish’s case to another judge. The appeals court added: “Here, defendant’s petition clearly alleges that no domestic violence evidence was presented at thesentencing hearing and the attached affidavits and exhibitssupport that allegation.”",2,2,Chicago Sun-Times
663,The unintended consequences of making Juneteenth a national holiday,-8.67,32.0,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/06/17/opinion/unintended-consequences-making-juneteenth-national-holiday/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-17,25,"On Wednesday, the House followed the Senate in passing a bill to make Juneteenth a national holiday. President Bidensigned it into law Thursday afternoon. After a century and a half, the oldest celebration of Black emancipation is now a federal holiday. Juneteenth is an occasion weshould all commemorate, but what are the risks of taking the celebration of Black freedom mainstream? As more organizations and communities across the nation recognize Juneteenth, there may besome unintended consequences that make it harder for people to recognize thesignificance of the occasion. The long effort to make Juneteenth a federally recognized holiday nearly became a reality in 2020 with momentum from historic protests for racial justice. Asingle lawmaker, Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, opposed the effort, and other GOP officials moved on to other matters. AdvertisementEven though Congress failed to make Juneteenth a national holiday last year, the holiday became more popularly recognized, and other organizations committed to recognizing the event. Just a few weeks ago my employer, Boston University, announced that all offices would be closed for Juneteenth. Last July, Governor Charlie Bakersigned legislation making Juneteenth astate holiday. Juneteenth is a portmanteau of the words June and 19. It recognizes the day in 1865 when enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, first learned of their freedom. Itstands as the oldest celebration of Black emancipation in the country. Commemorating Juneteenth is certainly appropriate. It marks the end of race-based chattelslavery, a massive economicsystem that enriched whiteslave holders at the expense of Black laborers; and asystem from which people across the country, not just the South, benefited. It also took the nation’s bloodiest war, the Civil War, to finally abolishslavery. It is, therefore, appropriate to annually acknowledge one of the most important events in US history. AdvertisementBut there are risks in taking what has historically been an event celebrated almost exclusively in Black communities to a broader public of 330 million people. Juneteenth isspecifically a celebration of Black emancipation. Race-based chattelslavery intentionally ensnared people of African descent and labeled them as property. While every racial and ethnic group has its ownstory of hardship and oppression, Juneteenth explicitly deals with Black experiences due toslavery and the joy earned through hard-won battles. As people other than Black Americans commemorate Juneteenth, it may losesome of itsspecific focus on Black people in exchange for a colorblindstory of American triumph. Juneteenth was made possible in large part because of the courage and resilience of Black people who persistently fought for their liberation. Sojourner Truth, Anna Murray Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and other heroes of American Black freedomstruggleshould occupy a central place in Juneteenth celebrations. In the clamor toshow that Juneteenth is important to all people, Black peopleshould maintain their central place in thestory. As more people recognize Juneteenth, there is also a risk that complicated historical eventssuch asslavery, the Civil War, and emancipation become flattened andsuperficial in the national memory. Historians and otherscholars have written thousands of books about the practice ofslavery, the war that led to its demise, and myriad related topics. But few people will have the patience or desire to develop a nuanced understanding ofsuch complicated events. It is easy to imagine a facile narrative that develops around Juneteenth in which people essentially tell themselves, “Slavery was bad. The ‘good guys’ won the Civil War. And now racism is over.” It would be asacrilege to the memories of those whosuffered to achieve freedom and the celebration of Juneteenth if people adopted asimplistic understanding of the history behind it. AdvertisementIn a related way, Juneteenth can become another talking point in the erroneous idea of American exceptionalism. The myths of popular memory tend to position the United States as a nation that has had its troubles and madesome mistakes, but one in which thespirit of democracy ultimately prevails. Even the unanimoussupport of both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate who passed the bill is a warningsign. The very Republicansenators whosupport making Juneteenth a national holidaysimultaneously oppose critical race theory and the1619 Project, whichseek to expose the roots of racism in this country. A more popular celebration of Juneteenth risks transforming the holiday into another peg on which to hang the cloak of mythic American greatness and one more way for people who obstruct racial progress to deny their racism. History is not an uninterrupted road to racial progress. After race-based chattelslavery, new forms of oppression arose: convict leasing,sharecropping, Jim Crowsegregation, and lynching. Slavery did not mark an end to all racial oppression. Racism never goes away, it adapts. AdvertisementInstead ofsuccumbing to lazy historical memory, Juneteenthshould be an opportunity to educate and reeducate people aboutslavery, racism, whitesupremacy, and Black resistance. There will be a need to talk about the partial progress that emancipationsecured as well as the unevensupport of white abolitionists and Northerners. We need tospeak of the monumental efforts Black people took to wrestle their freedom from the clutches of injustice. It is a truism of US history that whenever Black people assert their history, identity, and culture, there is a concomitant backlash from white reactionaries. As people across the nation proactive ly celebrate Juneteenth, there could be asurge of attempts to celebrate the Confederacy and the antebellum South — rallies at Confederate monuments, bills to glorify Confederate leaders with holidays and remembrances, a proliferation ofsigns andsymbols of whitesupremacy. A backlash has already occurred in the protests against initiativessuch as the1619 Projectand the manufactured outrage against critical race theory. In the eagerness to celebrate Juneteenth on a broaderscale, weshould not besurprised when others reveal how much they wish Black people would once again “know their place.”Every celebration of the Black freedomstruggle — from Martin Luther King Jr. Day to Black History Month — issubject to misappropriation. But that is not a reason to refrain from celebrating; it is a call to activelyshape the narrative. To cement the authenticsignificance of Juneteenth in the minds and hearts of people in this nation,supportersshould use everystorytelling device available toshape historical memories and present actions. Podcasts, videos, articles, books, poetry, music — any imaginative and creative effortshould be deployed inservice of preserving the truth and importance of Juneteenth. AdvertisementWhatever the merits of making Juneteenth a national holiday, those who care about Black freedom have the clear mandate to constantly tell the accuratestory of Juneteenth and protect it from the unintended consequences of taking this moment mainstream.
