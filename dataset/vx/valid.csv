0,The GameStop Craziness Pulls Back the Curtain on the Stock Market,-7.33,37.33,https://prospect.org/power/gamestop-craziness-pulls-back-curtain-on-stock-market/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-prospect-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-28,25,"STRF/STAR MAX/IPxGameStop wasn’t doing all that well, not as a business or a stock—until a couple of weeks ago. About a decade ago, we first heard the phrase “Occupy Wall Street,” which referred to groups of young people, fed up with a rigged economic system, taking over a small park in Lower Manhattan and demanding an economy that works for everyone and not just the one percent. It had a short shelf life, as police, in paramilitary mode, dismantled the encampments. And life went on. It went on until the past couple of weeks, when we’ve discovered yet another meaning for “Occupy Wall Street.” A group of online-investing enthusiasts, congregating on Reddit message boards and armed with the app-based trading device Robinhood, have busted into the Wall Street gambling hall and reduced the balance sheets of some well-established financial players to smoldering ruins. They did this through brute force, bidding up stocks that Wall Street had left for dead. In so doing, they used approximately the same tactics as the big-money boys to intimidate and pummel the competition. They’ve also revealed the public stock markets as essentially artificial—markets where anyone with capital behind them can just decide something has value. They’re using this power to pummel hedge fund short sellers, who gladly use the same tactics whenever it can help them. It’s one of the most hilarious bits of poetic justice I’ve seen in the past decade. I’ll briefly explain the situation. There’s a subreddit (essentially a message board) calledr/wallstreetbetswhere bored, quarantined day traders have been congregating. They have a mischievous bent: “Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal” is the subreddit’s motto. And at some point, they came up with the idea to coordinate buying of individual low-cost stocks, as a way to turn a profit. The first big one they identified was GameStop, a retail outlet where customers can rent video games. Given the depressing state of retail generally, GameStop wasn’t doing all that well, not as a business or a stock. Four weeks ago, it started the year atabout $17 a share. And the “smart money” on Wall Street, meaning institutional investors like hedge funds, had placed their bet on GameStop: They expected it to go down, and put billions of dollars toward that end on so-called “short” bets. The short sellers hadn’t anticipated the Robinhood guys, however. Because a stock like GameStop doesn’t trade very much, if you can just drive a lot of purchases into it, you can really move the market. Some Robinhood accountsallow for margin trading, which means a trader can use borrowed money to purchase shares, adding to the overall amounts. Add in the ease of trading, the “YOLO” (you only live once) mentality of the traders, and the internet’s boundless tendency to make things go viral, and the GameStop gambit quickly grew into a frenzy. On January 12, the buying spree began, distributed among thousands of traders. By January 13, GameStop was at $31. The next day, $39. On January 22, it leaped to $65. Four days later, it hit $147. By the end of trading on Wednesday, itclosed at $347 a share, an almost impossible run. That’s good news for these traders and good news for GameStop, which certainly can use the newfound surge in the stock price to its advantage. And GameStopisn’t the only beneficiary: AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry, and Bed Bath & Beyond are among the other YOLO stocks. On Wednesday, shares in Tootsie Roll—yes, you can apparently buy stock in the Tootsie Roll company—jumped 53 percentat one point. The only losers at this point are the shorts. If you bet on a stock to go up and it doesn’t, you lose some of the money you put into that stock. If you bet on the stock to go down, every time it goes up you lose more and more money. A hedge fund called Melvin Capital, which made heavy bets against GameStop, lost $3 billion of its assets under management in about a week, andpulled out of its position. Hedge fund pals Citadel and Point72 decided to prop up poor Melvin (the hobbled financier),investing billions to save it. Gabe Plotkin, the founder of Melvin Capital, used to work at the predecessor to Point72. Business journalists havereportedthat other hedge funds with ill-fated short bets are in similar trouble. Most of these firms use borrowed money to make short bets, and there’s an entire industry known as securities lending with an inventory of stocks to facilitate those trades. They could suffer as well. The only real difference here is that ordinary investors are driving the train, and the hedge fund guys are getting run over. This is, and there’s no other way to put it, hilarious. A bunch of people trading stocks on their phones have brought some of the lords of finance to their knees. They weren’t using some amazing or novel strategy: The run-up in GameStop is just the “pump” of a pump-and-dump scheme, where hype pulls people into a stock before the rug gets pulled out. In fact, that’s what hedge fund managers do all the time, making bets and using research to puff up a stock, then taking the profits off moving a stock, through force of will—theirs—rather than the inherent value of the company. The only real difference here is that ordinary investors are driving the train, and the hedge fund guys are getting run over. The hedge funders are mad because distorting corporate stock prices beyond the fundamentals is supposed to bething, not the work of the hoi polloi. Now, they’ve been outfoxed. If you can think of a better use of $600 stimulus checks, let me know. Never was there a more apt name for an app in this moment than “Robinhood.”Now, this will not stay hilarious forever; we still have the “dump” part of the pump-and-dump scheme to reach. And there appears to be a lot of institutional money front-running the whole thing, capitalizing on the populist story line to take their winnings. But that’s why this can also be a teachable moment, and a moment to fully re-regulate this entire casino. The idea that the stock market value represents a snapshot of a company’s true worth or expected future profits was always a little cockeyed, and now it’s just been revealed as absurd. Financial-market rigging was always discreetly lurking in the background of stock tickers, like the one that flashes across CNBC, and now it’s been screamingly placed into the foreground. The same dopamine rush that fuels sports betting and online poker has moved into retail market trading, but it was always there at the level of big money. These markets were always reckless and disconnected from reality. I’m certain that institutional investors will use this as a moment to demand regulation to stop the Robinhood frenzy. But that’s a slippery slope, as there’s not much difference between what the Robinhooders are doing and the normal course of Wall Street looting. Maybe all of that should be investigated. Maybe financial transaction taxes should be applied to encourage limits on trading, and pump-and-dumps strongly restricted. Maybe the real economy should be nurtured with public investment, and these private, more corrupt markets subject to root-and-branch overhaul. (It’s also funny to see the hedge fund guys super-mad that a stock is going up.)GameStop and these other companies really don’t have much of a future, and if those fundamentals mean anything, at some point the bottom will fall out. As righteous as it is, I don’t think app trading heralds some new dawn for our economy. But you can see it as the inevitable by-product of a system built on massive inequality. The little guys figured out how to band together and stick it to the big guys. In so doing, they protected retail companies with lots of workers who now get a reprieve, however brief. They revealed the rot in our system, essentially took over Wall Street, and made a lot of rich and amoral people cry. I’m going along for the ride.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0453754968228652,0.4684111478190426,1853,2,American Prospect
1,President Biden to Sign Bill Naming Pulse Nightclub a National Memorial,-1.33,44.67,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/president-biden-sign-bill-pulse-nightclub-national-memorial,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-13,25,"Five years after the mass shooting atOrlando’s Pulse Nightclub, President Joe Bidenhas pledged to sign a bill that will name the LGBTQ+ establishment as a national memorial. Ina White House statement on Saturday, June 12, Biden reported staying in touch with the many families of victims and survivors. “In the coming days, I will sign a bill designating Pulse Nightclub as a national memorial, enshrining in law what has been true since that terrible day five years ago: Pulse Nightclub is hallowed ground,” the president said. Pulse Nightclub was the siteof the deadliest attackon LGBTQ+ people in the country’s history, with 49 people killed and an additional 53 others wounded during the mass shooting on June 12, 2016. A memorialhas been in the works for some time, and the design for the tribute wasunveiled after a contestin 2019. In a statement at the time, Pulse co-founder and onePulse Foundation CEO Barbara Pomatoldthat she hoped the memorial would “honor the 49 lives taken and all those affected while also educating visitors and future generations on the profound impact the tragedy had on Orlando, the U. S., and the world.”When announcing the bill on Saturday,Biden emphasizedthe ongoing work that needs to be done when it comes to reducing gun violence in the United States, including closing loopholes surroundingbackground checks, banning assault weapons, and establishingextreme riskor “red flag” laws. The president also acknowledged the ways in whichgun violence disproportionately affects LGBTQ+ people, adding, “We must drive out hate and inequities that contribute to the epidemic of violence and murder against transgender women –especially transgender women of color. We must create a world in which our LGBTQ+ young people are loved, accepted, and feel safe in living their truth.”This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. As Biden noted, there is a long road ahead to combat the epidemic of gun violence. In an interview withCNN, Pulse shooting survivor Brandon Wolf shared that while he is hopeful and optimistic about Biden’s gun reform agenda, he is “existentially exhausted” from the ongoing instances of violence. “I am so tired of statements,"" he said. ""I am so tired of hashtags and thoughts and prayers. I am so tired of archaic senate procedure being used as an excuse to do nothing while people in our communities are dying. …. All I am asking is for the people that we have elected, the people we pay to get things done in Washington D. C. to actually do something.”Wolf also noted that the grief and loss of his friends is something that he still carries with him, five years later. “The people that I lost, they're still gone tomorrow and the day after that,” hetold CNN. “They're still missing faces at my birthday party. There are still empty seats at my dinner table.”Sign up for thedaily email.

2,Seoul's Mayor Championed Women's Rights. The #MeToo Allegations Against Him Have Bitterly Divided Korea,-0.5,49.0,https://time.com/5875265/seoul-mayor-metoo-south-korea/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-03,25,"Lee Eun Kyung remembers Park Won-soon from his work arguing South Korea’s first-eversexual harassment case, beginning in 1993. Lee was on the panel of judges that first presided over the case, and Park was the star lawyer for the woman’s legal team. In 1999, after six years of pro-bono work, he helped win a conviction, also a first for the country.“I remember how Park calmly gave his defense,” Lee recalls. Park’s high-profile record as a civil rights lawyer helped catapult him into public life. He was elected Seoul mayor in 2011 and was a leading contender to run for president in 2022. Park was widely seen as a champion of women’s rights—until July 10, when his body was found in the mountains of Seoul. Two days earlier, his former secretary had filed a police report, saying he sexually harassed her for four years. Park’s apparent suicide and the accusations against him have bitterly divided Korea, which must confront the uncomfortable questions behind the gleaming legacy of one of the country’s most powerful men. For Lee, who acknowledges the significance of Park’s work on the 1990s sexual harassment case, the priority now is clear. “We can’t let his death cover the error of his ways,” she says. “The truth must be uncovered. The victim must feel surrounded by enemies on all four sides. She must feel so lonely.”Lee now heads a law firm with an elegant office in Seoul. She isn’t affiliated with the case against Park, although as a long-time advocate of women’s rights, she feels compelled to speak out. “It’s risky for me to speak publicly to the press about this issue, but I wanted to talk. I wanted to give power to the victim in the small way that I can.”But, Park’s death has incited as much defensiveness as disappointment. The memories of his righteous past, including his role in the 1990s sexual harassment case, are deepening the divide. To his supporters, his past is vindication that he was a good man, that his accuser is in the wrong. To others, his “good man” image is a painful reminder of his alleged betrayal—and that hypocrisy isn’t always visible to the public.“He led the team responsible for making sexual harassment punishable by law for the first time in Korea. And now, just a few days after he was accused of sexual harassment, he was found dead. All this is very shocking,” says Lee. Few of Park’s defenders were willing to be interviewed about the allegations, but one of the fellow lawyers from the 1990s sexual harassment case spoke to TIME on the condition of anonymity, citing professional backlash: “That man dedicated his life to human rights. Which of us is 100% perfect?… We’re only hearing one side of the story.”Many of his supporters argue that the sexual harassment accusation shouldn’t erase the accomplishments he made during his life’s work. “Must we abandon everything he left behind for the women in this land?”wrotehistorian Chun Wooyong, who alsocriticizedpoliticians refusing to attend Park’s funeral service. “Tears flow ceaselessly down my face.”Still others, particularly on social media, have attacked Park’s former secretary for hurting him and his family. Park’s former secretary, who has not been publicly named, detailed her accusations on July 13—three days after he was found dead. At a press conference that was called jointly with prominent women’s organizations, her lawyer said the mayor touched her inappropriately in the bedroom attached to his office, sent pictures of himself in his underwear and asked her for pictures.“The day I mustered the courage to file my complaint, and was questioned throughout the night, the person that ruined my human dignity let go of his own,” she wrote in aletterread by her representatives. Especially troubling, are her accusations that he used his positions to continue abusing her. She says she was assigned to wake the mayor from his naps, because she was told he’d be less irritated by a female secretary. “The nature of the secretary’s job was to keep the mayor happy,”saidher representatives in a written statement.“Within the safety of a courtroom, I wanted to yell at him to stop. I wanted to scream that I am in pain,”wrotePark’s former secretary, who says she decided to report her boss after receiving counseling. Her legal team says it has screenshots of her conversations with the mayor on the messaging app Telegram. The 1990s sexual harassment case that Park argued was a milestone for women’s rights. It was also a personal one for Lee, who had just turned 30 in 1994, when her team first declared the perpetrator guilty. She was the only female judge in her team, in an era where women were so rare in the justice system that her court building didn’t even have bathrooms for women. “I was the only judge identified in the media by my gender, and age in parenthesis,” she recalls. Her team fined Shin Jeong-hyu, a chemistry professor from Seoul National University, 30 million won (about $25,000 today) for harassing a student. “Nowadays, sexual harassment is a familiar concept,” says Lee. “Back then, it was still very new. [At the time] people said, ‘Why does something like this need to be fined?’ The court even received telephone calls threatening to blow us up.”“Society was divided at the time,” says Lee Sooyeon, an honorary senior research fellow at the Korean Women’s Development Institute, a government think tank. “I remember being enraged by my husband, who was also a professor in the sciences. He said, ‘Professor Shin is a good person. There’s no way he’d do this.’”At the time, many minimized the victim’s experiences by highlighting the perpetrator’s good deeds and reputation, downplaying the damage of sexual harassment, or outrightcallingher a “flower snake”—a Korean term for a female con artist who exploits men through sex appeal. Shin, the perpetrator, even published abookin defense,Am I A Sexually Harassing Professor?In 1999, the Supreme Court finally upheld the original decision by Lee’s team (with a smaller fine). Since then, Korea has made leaps in women’s rights. There are various laws regarding sexual offenses and a vibrant feminist movement. But the current backlash surrounding Park’s former secretary feels eerily familiar to the rhetoric over two decades ago. She, too, has beenlabeleda flower snake—by some of Park’s defenders on social media. Prominent liberals havepublicly sidedwith the mayor, saying the harassment allegations are “lacking proof” and damaging to Park’s family. Doubting the credibility of#MeToo survivors—despite research that showsconsistentlylow rates offalse sexual violence allegations—is so commonplace worldwide that backlash seems to come with the territory, especially when an alleged perpetrator is as respected and powerful as Park.“Sexual harassment is extremely hard to prove. Usually the only evidence are witness testimonies,” says scholar Lee Sooyeon. “It also isn’t a matter of romance; it’s about power. When power is involved, it’s incredibly hard for people to reject the abuse. They don’t know when to say no. That’s how sexual harassment intensifies.”The power dynamics are especially rigid for secretaries and it wasn’t an easy environment to draw clear boundaries.“People accuse her why it took so long to come out,” says Lee Eun Kyung, the former judge. “But the fact that it took her four years shows how helpless a small individual feels within a powerful system.”“The victim requested a department transfer multiple times,” Song Ran-hee, secretary general of Korea Women’s Hotline,saidin a second press conference representing the former secretary on July 22. “What makes her suffer the most aren’t the online comments of utter strangers. It’s the fact that around 20 colleagues, who knew about the situation directly and indirectly, concealed, distorted and minimized the case.”Partisan national politics have been an undercurrent complicating the public reaction to the case. Park was one of the most prominent members of the ruling Democratic Party, in addition to being the leader of the South Korean capital. Afterinitiallydenying the harassment allegations as “rumors,” the Seoul government—which, ironically enough, had anexcellent manualon workplace sexual harassment under Park—has belatedlyvowed to“try its best in uncovering the truth.” Although the police case related to the woman’s original report was automatically closed with Park’s death, the National Human Rights Commission said it will conduct an independent probe. The former secretary’s first press conference coincided with the beginning of Park’s lavish five-day funeral organized by the Seoul government—despite nearly 600,000 people signing apetitionopposing the public ceremony. And national leaders have been inconsistent in their messaging. The head of the Democratic Partycame under firefor calling a reporter a “bastard,” when questioned at the funeral home about the centrist party’s response to the sexual harassment allegations. President Moon Jae-in has kept silent, despite running in 2017 as a “feminist president”; meanwhile, his press secretarypublicly expressedsupport for the victim, only to clarify a few hours later that it was his personal opinion, and “not the Blue House’s official position.”The #MeToo movement, which has swept the country since 2018, has brought down prominent men, most recently themayorof Busan, South Korea’s second largest city. Prior to Park Won-soon, the most prominent #MeToo scandal was that surroundingAhn Heejung, who was also a star in the Democratic Party and a strong presidential contender. Ahn is now in prison for raping and harassing Kim Ji-eun, his former secretary.“In order to #MeToo, I had to risk my life as a worker, which meant everything to me. I had to abandon the future I built,” Kimtold newspaperHankook Ilbo. “I felt wretched and distressed [seeing Park’s case]. Her situation is so similar to mine. Two years ago, I shouted #MeToo, hoping there would be no more victims. But reality hasn’t changed a bit. I couldn’t stop crying.”“The #MeToo movement in Korea is a work in progress,” says scholar Lee Sooyeon, who researches sexual abuse policies for the government. She says the budget related to sexual harassment prevention has increased in recent years, along with awareness. “But it’s still hard to systematize our ideas. We need to ride the current momentum to push for more change.”Publicly, Park Won-soon believed in justice for women. “I decided to volunteer as defense because I am certain the immovable truth stands with the victim,” hesaidin 1994. Yeta note, found not long after his death, says nothing of the alleged victim in the current case. Lee Eun Kyung, despite her respect for what Park did in the past, believes the case must be rigorously investigated. “Why do sexual harassment and violence continue in South Korean society? Park’s death cannot blur out the truth of the case. We must be brave.”If you or someone you know may be contemplating suicide, in the U.

5,Google employees angered by search giant's 'hypocritical' remote work policies,-0.67,40.33,https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-hypocritical-remote-work-policies-anger-employees/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnet-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,25,"As Google employees around the world make plans for post-pandemic work at the tech giant, Laura de Vesine won't be among them. For months, de Vesine, a senior site reliability engineer, went back and forth with the company over a potential relocation. Fed up with Google's inflexible policies, she handed in her notice. Her last day is Friday. For de Vesine, Google's attempt to corral its employees after a year of remote work has been marked by indecision and backpedaling. Last fall, her team was told it would need to relocate to North Carolina from the company's office in Sunnyvale, California, about 40 miles south of San Francisco. The prospect of ditching Bay Area housing prices and long commutes was a powerful draw. The move, however, came with a 15% salary cut, she said. Then in late March, the team was told it would be a 25% cut. About a month later, the team relocation plans were scrapped altogether.""This feeling that I can't realistically leave the Bay Area and work for Google is enough for me to have decided to leave,"" de Vesine said. ""It's the fact that Google doesn't prioritize the needs of human beings. The fact that we have lives outside of work, that people actually have families.""Though remote work is sweeping corporate America, Google has been reluctant to let employees do it permanently, an approach Twitter and Reddit have taken. Google isn't the only tech company wrestling with its workforce's increasing desire for flexibility. Apple is facing its own backlash from employees, while Facebook just extended remote work options to all of its employees. But the way the search giant has handled the rollout of its plans has drawn particular scrutiny. In May, CEO Sundar Pichaiunveiled plansfor a ""hybrid"" work environment that would require most employees to work from their offices at least three days a week beginning in September. Under the new structure, 20% of the company would work remotely. Another 20% could work from new locations. People who relocated would get salary adjustments based on the local market. The bulk of Google would pick up where it left off, working from the office. Google makes up almost all of Alphabet, a holding company that has more than 135,000 full-time employees. As the company sorts out who will work where and how much they'll be paid, Google employees say tension has broken out over office transfers, compensation adjustments and remote work. The competition for transfers and the prospect of pay cuts has provoked growing anger, they say. The dustup over the future of the company's workplace policies has the potential to affect every person at the tech giant. The rancor intensified last week, when Urs Hölzle, one of the company's longest-tenured and most senior executives, announced plans to work remotely from New Zealand, according to an email he sent to employees that was viewed by CNET. Hölzle's plans angered rank-and-file workers, who consider it special treatment for company leadership, while lower-level employees have had to wade through a drawn-out and uncertain application process. A Google spokesman declined to make Hölzle available for an interview. The spokesman said Hölzle's relocation request was submitted and approved last year, before Google's return-to-office policies were set, but the move was delayed because of travel restrictions. The agitation over remote work policies has provided a new source of friction for a company whose employees are already well-experienced in rebelling against leadership. Workers have protested Google's handling of sexual misconduct, its work in China and theousting of researcherswho criticized the company's artificial intelligence systems. What happens at Google doesn't necessarily stay at Google. For more than two decades, the search giant has set the tone for office culture in Silicon Valley, pioneering lavish employee perks like free food and gym service. The impact of Google's remote work policies could ripple far and wide, as other companies look to the tech titan as a guide.""Google plays a very key role in the industry,"" said Andreea Vanacker, CEO of Sparkx5, a company that works with corporate clients to improve employee culture. ""Certain organizations may be inspired by actions that Google is taking and say, 'Oh, very interesting. We should be doing the same thing.'""Hölzle, Google's senior vice president of technical infrastructure, is a revered figure at the company. He was one of Google'sfirst 10 employeesand is credited with building the tech giant's IT foundation of servers and networks. But for some Googlers, his relocation email, which was sent on June 29 and hasn't been previously reported, illustrated the inequities of the company's system for deciding remote work.""After three decades in the US, my wife and I both felt it was time to consider a new location,"" Hölzle wrote. ""We've decided to spend a year in New Zealand and see how we like it. To be clear: I am not retiring, just changing my location!""Google's leadership is pushing in-person work at the company's corporate campuses. In the email, he calls the move an ""experiment"" and says it won't be a problem for him to continue working in the Pacific time zone because he is an ""early riser."" He ends the note with ""Kia pai tō rā,"" or ""Have a nice day"" in Māori. Hi everyone,After three decades in the US, my wife and I both felt it was time to consider a new location. We've decided to spend a year in New Zealand and see how we like it. To be clear: I am not retiring, just changing my location! We're considering this an experiment; if things go well, we may decide to stay longer but with moves like theses, it's good to keep an open mind! :-)Despite its geographical remoteness, New Zealand is only offset 3-5 hours from California depending on the time of year, so I'll continue to work in my existing roll. I'm an early riser, so this won't be a big adjustment and I'll continue to work on California time. As things open up (travel to NZ is still complicated by their quarantine), I expect to be in the Bay Area on a regular basis so you will continue to see me around in 3D. Since many of you see me on GVC and might be wondering about my new home office background, I wanted to be transparent about my move ahead of time. I'm looking forward to this adventure and to sharing the results of our relocation ""experiment"" with you. Kia pai tō rā [have a nice day],-UrsTwo Google employees said Hölzle's situation encapsulated the company's ""hypocritical"" policies. Both complained that the relocation represented a double standard in which different rules apply to executives in senior ranks. While his approval came last year, Google employees now undergoing the remote work application process have been told decisions won't come until August, at the earliest. Approval for Hölzle's move came before the procedure was instituted. News of Hölzle's relocation especially stung because he has been particularly vocal against remote work, employees said. De Vesine, the resigning Googler, said Hölzle had a policy of not letting people work remotely unless they were assigned to an office and that he wouldn't consider remote work for people who hadn't reached a certain level of seniority. A Google spokesman declined to comment on those claims but said every employee is eligible to request remote work, regardless of their group or department. After publication of this story, the spokesman added that some employees from all levels of Hölzle's organization will be approved for remote work or office transfers. It's unclear if Hölzle's salary will be adjusted to the local market, as required for other employees relocating to a new place. The Google spokesman declined to comment on his compensation. If the rule applies to Hölzle, he would likely be taking a pay cut. Mountain View, California,where Hölzle is based, is 18% more expensive than Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, according toExpatistan. (It's unclear what city Hölzle is moving to.)Google's stance on salaries has drawn blowback within the tech giant. While some tech companies, like Reddit, have said they'll pay employees San Francisco or New York City salaries wherever they work, Google has taken a hard line on making pay adjustments. Last month, Googlereleased an internal toolthat gives employees estimates of how their salaries would be affected if they relocated. One Google employee based in San Francisco said they would like to move out of state to be with their partner. The employee would be relocating to an ""expensive tourist destination"" where the partner grew up. Google doesn't have an office in the city, so the employee applied for remote work. But it would come with a 25% pay cut, according to the salary tool. The employee, holding back tears in an interview, said the situation has made them consider leaving the company.""I will not choose Google over my partner,"" the employee said. ""If I can't either work with my manager or figure something out, I have to quit. Google is not that great.""The remote work policies have taken a toll on the people around Google workers, too. The partner of one Google employee who spoke to CNET said the employee moved to the East Coast during the pandemic so they could live together. Now, the couple may end their relationship because the Google employee is expected back in the Bay Area in September. Some employees have speculated about Google's motivations for emphasizing in-person work. Google has major real estate investments in its corporate hubs, including some still in development. A workforce sprawled around the globe makes those investments less useful. In May, San Jose, California, approved plans for an80-acre Google campusthat will include office space, housing and retail. For a company whose identity is in part associated with extravagant corporate facilities and whimsical culture, the stringent policies regarding office transfers and salary adjustments may be a way to nudge employees into staying put, said Jake Rosenfeld, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches compensation.""It could be an attempt to disincentivize people from moving,"" Rosenfeld said. ""One way to encourage employees without being seen as heavy-handed or reneging on earlier promises is to say, 'Look, there's going to be a different salary structure if you choose to leave our hubs.'""Employees say one of the most difficult parts of Google's return-to-office system is the inability to plan for a future with their loved ones. Google has been ""vague and unhelpful"" about the process for most of the year, one employee said. The confusion has meant workers have to leave crucial decisions, like schooling for children and apartment leases, up in the air.""A really big pain point for me has been the uncertainty,"" de Vesine said. ""It has been the unwillingness of Google leadership to commit to a policy and to commit to a policy that seems realistic.""",3,Reliable,0.041009256700746,0.434753898583686,2426,3,CNET
6,Impeachment Trial Moves Ahead After 56 Senators Fail Civics 101,24.67,24.0,https://www.libertynation.com/impeachment-trial-moves-ahead-after-56-senators-fail-civics-101/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,18,"A day before theimpeachmenttrial of former President Donald Trump gets underway in earnest, the Senate convened to hear debate on the constitutionality of trying a man who no longer holds public office. House impeachment managers – the prosecution – presented their case on Feb. 9 for the legitimacy of this trial, but Trump’s defense team dismantled that position, citing the constitutional flaw and the complete absence of due process for their client. They also presented the chamber with a stark warning about the implications for both future and past presidents and government officials. Still, the trial will go ahead after an almost party-linevote, with six Republicans agreeing that the proceedings were constitutional. It didn’t take long for lead manager Jamie Raskin (D-MD) to reveal a fundamental flaw in his case. He argued that, if a president can commit an impeachable offense during his final weeks in the White House and avoid a later Senate trial on the grounds that he is no longer in office, it creates a “January exception.” The implication is that a president would enjoy what Raskin described as “constitutional immunity” to commit crimes, knowing that he would avoid conviction in the Senate by virtue of his departure from public office. Immediately following his “January exception” argument, though, Raskin clearly claimed that Trump’s motivation in stirring his supporters to violence was to remain in office by derailing the certification of the 2020 election result and, thus, the commencement of the transfer of power. There can be no escaping a Senate impeachment trial if the president is still the president. Trump was either inciting insurrection, knowing that he would escape punishment by leaving office, or he was attempting to remain in office. Both things cannot be true simultaneously. The House impeachment managers made an admirable attempt to use precedent to argue that impeachment and conviction of a former public official were long-accepted practices. The historical record is not on theDemocrats’side, however. Tennessee Senator WilliamBlountwas impeached in 1797. His Senate trial began in December 1798, and the charges against him were dismissed because Blount had already been expelled from Congress. Mark H. Delahay, a federal judge, was impeached in 1873. He resigned before his Senate trial, which was then canceled. George English and Samuel Kent, both federal judges, were impeached in 1926 and 2009, respectively. Both resigned before the completion of their trials, and in both cases the proceedings were brought to a close prior to their conclusions. If a precedent has ever been established, then, it is that the Senate does not pass judgement upon accused government officials who have left office. The entire question of the constitutionality of putting a now-private citizen on trial is largely moot in the face of the facts. The real question is whether Trump committed the crime of which he is accused, namely, incitement of insurrection. The facts do not favor the accusation. Investigations into the events of Jan. 6 have uncovered a degree of pre-planning, which obviously negates the premise that Trump stirred the crowd to violent action with his speech. Then there is the inconvenient timeline. Activists were already at the Capitol, tearing down barriers and moving to breach the building itself while the former president was still addressing his supporters some considerable distance away. Finally, there is the even more inconvenient fact that left-wing activists, such as John Sullivan, who now faces several federal charges in connection with his involvement in the invasion of the Capitol building, are known to have been key instigators during the attack. No senator – or member of the public, for that matter – could possibly believe that these leftists were incited by Trump’s words. For the 45th president, attorney Bruce Castor opened the defense’s case for canceling the trial. In a rambling, folksy speech that sounded more like an old man regaling his grandchildren with stories of his misspent youth, Castor waffled on about what great patriots senators are. It became clear that the attorney was attempting to appeal to the better natures of the elected women and men in the chamber, but his remarks did nothing to advance Trump’s case. It was almost a standup routine, minus the humor. Castor’s colleague, David Schoen, recovered the fumble and headed for the end zone with a long presentation that meticulously dissected the argument that the Senate has the power to try a private citizen. Citing judges, acclaimed legal scholars, and state-level cases, Shoen asserted that, since the mandatory punishment for conviction in the Senate is removal from office, putting on trial an individual who cannot be removed from an office he or she no longer holds is entirely invalid. Schoen dwelt at length on the lack ofdue processafforded Trump throughout the impeachment. He described how House Democrats expedited the operation from the start, eliminating the steps that would have allowed the former president his constitutional right to hear the evidence against him and to test that evidence through his defense team. Equally concerning, the lawyer explained, is the fact that, due to a deliberate delay on the part of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in transmitting the article of impeachment to the Senate, Trump – now no longer the sitting president – was denied his right to have the chief justice of the Supreme Court preside over his trial. Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), as the president pro tempore of the Senate, will preside. Leahy has always been a vocal critic of Trump who has made clear in public statements that he feels the Senate should convict. In addition, Leahy himself gets to vote alongside his fellow senators, making him, literally, both judge and jury. Shoen pointed out that expanding the instrument of impeachment to include all former public officials regardless of how long ago they served in government could have a chilling effect. Someone serving in government today, the attorney explained, could find himself or herself impeached years in the future by a new Congress that decides some action taken by that official years earlier was somehow impeachable. As an example, Schoen suggested that Jimmy Carter could be impeached for his disastrous handling of the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Now that what was largely seen as a formality is over, the trial begins in earnest on Wednesday, Feb. 10. All that really remains to be seen now is whether the six Republican senators who voted to proceed will also vote to convict Trump, who will almost certainly not be convicted and not removed from the office he no longer holds.~Graham J.

Hetoldreporters Friday that he’s become “extremely doubtful that we will be able to make a deal if it goes well beyond Friday.”“Just because we’ve been spending so much time together, if you’re not making progress, there’s no sense to continue,” he added. Meadows, along with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, has been representing the Republican side in the negotiations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have been heading up the Democratic side. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), coming out of the GOP lunch where he was briefed by Meadows and Mnuchin, told reporters that they’d been told, “If there’s not a deal by Friday, there won’t be a deal.”The new cutoff seems to be a harder line than what the negotiators said Tuesday after their seventh meeting.“We’re not at the point of being close to a deal, but we did try to agree to set a timeline,” Mnuchin said then. “We’re going to try to reach an overall agreement, if we can get one, by the end of this week — so that legislation could then pass next week.”Pelosi too said Tuesday that she was hopeful they’d reach an agreement by the end of the week. By all accounts, the two sides are still far apart on many components of the relief package. Per Politico,Republicans budged on the unemployment insurance benefit, offering up $400 a week until mid-December to try to placate the Democrats who are insisting on $600 a week. They also reportedly offered to up funding for state and local governments to $150- 200 billion, still a far cry from Democrats’ ask of $1 trillion. Senate Majority Mitch McConnell (R-KY), for one, seems to believe that there will be reason to stick around next week, despite the scheduled August recess.“We’re certainly going to be in next week,” he said. “We’ll see what happens after that.”",3,Reliable,0.0365578049401578,0.3591259230965113,484,3,Talking Points Memo

Welcome back to’s Latin America Brief. The highlights this week: a look at adjustments to thethat could relieve Latin America’s crippling COVID-19 debt, aChinese economic blowto Venezuela, and new heights forNicaragua’s crackdown on political opposition. As some Latin American countries continue to battleCOVID-19 surges, many are also weighing how they will repay debt burdens that significantly increased during the pandemic. Latin America and the Caribbean’s regional debt-to-GDP ratiorosefrom 68.9 percent in 2019 to an estimated 79.3 percent in 2020, making it the most indebted region in the developing world. This week, Argentinaactivateda 60-day grace period to try to reach an agreement on debt it owes to countries in the Paris Club group of creditor nations. Argentina as well as other Latin American countries have faced public resistance to pre-pandemic International Monetary Fund programs to cut their spending; the tax hike that sparked Colombia’s ongoing protests was related to such a program as was the announcement of planned spending cuts in Costa Rica that prompted protests in October 2020. But spending cuts may exacerbate problems that pushed22 millionLatin Americans into poverty in 2020. Meanwhile, the green transitions required to meet countries’ Paris Agreement commitments require more, not less, public spending. And delayed recoveries in low- and middle-income countries could act as a drag on the entire global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is especially influential over the region’s more vulnerable indebted nations. It loaned upwards of$66 billionto Latin American countries during the pandemic and also holds sway with bilateral lenders and private bondholders. Despite the fund’srhetoric, after the 2008 crisis, it did notsignificantlyeaseausterity programs that were required for IMF loans, and stricter austerity was associated withgreater income inequality and povertyin borrower countries, according to research by Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. The IMF said it’s based its COVID-19 loans on expectations that countries will prioritize spending on issues like health, supporting the vulnerable, and climate change. To track that, Boston University’s research center created anindexof the extent to which ongoing loan documentation continues to emphasize those policy steps; in Latin America, loans to 16 countries scored an average of 2.14 out of 3 on health, 2.31 on protecting the vulnerable, and 0.67 on climate. Meanwhile, as the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) reported in March, most countries in the region have committed themselves to fiscal consolidation in the near future. The IMFprojectsmost Latin American countries will begin cutting their overall public spending beginning this year and continue to do so until at least 2026. Institutions like the IMF are only part of Latin America’s debt picture. On bilateral debt, China has agreed to cooperate with Paris Club creditors as part of aG-20 agreementto suspend debt for 73 low-income countries and build a common framework for debt restructuring—a departure from China’s usual style of negotiating debt relief apart from other creditors and withlittle transparency. This could be an important step toward more transparency on Chinese loans. The issue was discussed on a recentepisodeof thepodcast, featured on FP’s ownForeign Policy Playlist, in which researcher Bradley Parks said his team was able to examine rarely seen Chinese loan contracts because some countries, such as Ecuador, had laws on the books requiring transparency. Parks praised such laws, noting other lenders beyond China also fall short on this topic. On the eve of the pandemic, more thanhalfof Latin America’s external public debt was to private bondholders, according to the World Bank. The bondholders were not bound in any way to suspend or restructure debts along the lines of the G-20’s common framework, although the IMF has called on them to do so. Argentina, Belize, Ecuador, and Suriname have restructured private bondholder debt since the pandemic began. The details of all of the debt relief described above remain in flux, and together, they still fail to fully address sovereign debt pressures in Latin America. One more important measure on the horizon is the likely approval of $650 billion in IMF Special Drawing Rights, reserves that can be converted to currency. Additionally, World Bank chief economist Carmen Reinhartsaidon Tuesday she expects the G-20 framework for restructuring to be extended to middle-income countries. Could this moment lead to even more ambitious reforms of the global financial safety net? Proposals abound, especially after policymakers saw how effectively the U. S. Federal Reserve used swap lines to prop up some central banks and economies at the pandemic’s start. (In Latin America,Mexico and Brazil benefited. In many countries that did not benefit, capital rushed out.)Former Federal Reserve international finance director Edwin Truman proposed acentral bank swap networkto temporarily increase IMF lending capacity. Costa Rica proposed an emergencyfundfinanced by developed countries, offering 50-year loans free of fiscal and monetary conditionalities. Several Caribbean nations have proposed debt relief in exchange for steps toward climate adaptation and “hurricane clauses” that would adjust debt repayments after extreme weather events. For now, given existing responses to Latin America’s pandemic shock, ECLAC wrote in March that the region’s economic and social development is likely to be set back for at least a decade. Mexico holds legislative and local elections. Peru holds its presidential runoff election. U. S. Vice President Kamala Harris begins visit to Guatemala and Mexico. Venezuela was recently blindsided by an announcement that China, the final buyer of most of Venezuela’s oil so Venezuela can skirt U. S. sanctions, will impose a $30 to $40 per barreltaxbeginning June 12. Although China said the measure was based on environmental concerns, it could also be a sign ofdeteriorating relationsbetween the two countries. The finalpollsbefore Peru’s presidential runoff election this Sunday showed a very slight lead for left-wing candidate Pedro Castillo, though the gap between Castillo and his opponent Keiko Fujimori has narrowed over the course of the campaign. Fujimori was widely thought to have performed better in presidential debates.

She was accused of money laundering among other charges, which she called a sham, to keep her from running. Nicaragua’s attorney general has asked she be banned from the election. The arrest came around two weeks after police raided Chamorro’s brother’s independent media outlet and is in the wake of new anti-democraticrestrictionssurrounding the November election. (Chamorro has a political family; her mother defeated Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega in a 1990 election.) Nicaragua has mostly ignored calls from the Organization of American States (OAS) to implement meaningful electoral reform after its brutal repression of the 2018 protests that kicked off the current political crisis. Most Latin American leaders did not say anything about the dramatic turn of events, symptomatic of the region’s fragmentation and lack of international engagement. Exceptions included condemnations from Costa Rica’s foreign ministry and from Venezuelan opposition figure Juan Guaidó. The OAS issued a statement of concern, and U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkendenouncedthe ban on Chamorro’s candidacy in a tweet. As Ortega beats back challenges inside Nicaragua, international pressure may be one of the few ways to get him to change course. Washington, for its part, has focused much of its Central America messaging around anti-corruption and promoting good governance but until now has mostly steered clear of Nicaragua. Its response to Ortega’s crackdown will show how exactly it plans to address democratic backsliding in the neighborhood.

I couldn’t help but notice a tall, heavyset black man, arms folded, standing in the back. From time to time, I would look at him, only to see him frown and shake his head, I assumed disapprovingly, when I made what I considered important points. After the speech, he came up to me. “I am angry,” he said. “Not at you—at myself. I thought I was well-informed. I read the news. I watch the news. I now see I’ve been manipulated by the party that I voted for all my life.”He then ticked off some of the points I made in my speech that he said surprised or even shocked him. He said he had no idea that (according to a 2004 Thomas B. Fordham Institute study) 44% of Philadelphia public school teachers send their own school-age kids to private school. Yet the Democratic Party adamantly opposes school vouchers, which would give K-12 children of urban parents a chance at a better school. He did not know that Democrats, including President Barack Obama, tried to end the Washington, D. C.,Opportunity Scholarship Program. It is a lottery that allows fortunate parents to opt out of their local public school for a better private school. The program is so popular that there are far more parents who want to participate than there are seats.“What’s more important, ” he asked me, “than making sure are kids arewell-educated?”He did not know that, in 1965, 25% of black kids were born outside of wedlock, versus 70% today, a phenomenon that cannot be attributed to slavery and Jim Crow. He did not know that Obama once said, “Children who grow upwithout a fatherare five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.”He said he was unaware that out of the approximately 390,000 slave owners in 1860, no more than a “handful” were Republican, according to conservative Dinesh D’Souza. He did not know thatmore Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than did Democrats. Nor did he know that more Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than did Democrats. He did not know that Democrats founded the Ku Klux Klan and that one of its goals was to stop the spread of the Republican Party. He said he was unaware that, before 1938, when the first federal minimum wage law was enacted, a black teenager waslikely to be employed than a white teenager. He did not know that, according to Harvard economist George Borjas, illegal immigration creates winners and losers. But the big losers are low- and unskilled American workers of color who compete against low- and unskilled illegal immigrant workers—who place downward pressure on the wages of the native-born. The man did not know that, according to The Washington Post, in recent years, more unarmed whites have been killed by the police than unarmed blacks. He was unaware of studies, including one by a black Harvard economist, that found the police more hesitant, more reluctant, to pull the trigger on a black suspect than on a white suspect. He did not know that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, police killings of blacks declined almost 80% from the late ’60s through the 2010s, while police killings of whites have flatlined. He did not know that, about racism, then-Sen. Barack Obama said: “The previous generation, the Moses generation, pointed the way. They took us 90% of the way there. We still got that 10% in order to cross over to the other side.” This would be the same Obama who, when he became president, said: “The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives—you know, that casts a long shadow. And that’s still part of our DNA that’s passed on. We’re not cured of it.”According to MSNBC political analyst Steve Kornacki, 43,000 votes in just three states would have switched the winner from Joe Biden to Donald Trump. This means all Republicans need to do is change the minds of a small percentage of the electorate. The man at my speech proves this is more than doable. DISTRIBUTED BYCREATORS.

It has long been impractical to deploy robots at construction sites, because the environment is so varied, complex, and changing. In the past few years however, advances including low-costlasersensors, cheaper robotic arms and grippers, andopen source softwarefor navigation andcomputer visionhave made it possible to automate and analyze more construction. The more advanced machines marching onto construction sites will help make construction less wasteful. According toMcKinsey, productivity in construction has improved less than in any other industry over the past couple of decades. The arrival of more automation may also alter demand for labor in a number of building trades.“They love the fact that it’s so consistent, that the wall is gorgeous. But then the next question is, ‘When is it going to take my job?’”Kevin Albert, cofounder and CEO of Canvas, previously worked atBoston Dynamics, a company famous for itslifelike walking robots, and in the manufacturing industry. He says there’s great opportunity in construction, which generates about $1.4 trillion annually and accounts for around 7 percent of US GDP but has seen relatively little use of computerization and automation. “We really see construction as mobile manufacturing,” he says. “There's this natural extension of what machines are now capable of out in the real world.”Canvas is part of a boom in construction technology, saysAlex Schreyer, director of theBuilding and Construction Technology Programat the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He says some of the biggest progress is being made in prefabrication of buildings, using robotic processes to construct large parts of buildings that are then assembled on-site. But increasingly, he says, robots and AI are also finding their way onto conventional work sites. Autonomous vehiclesmade by Volvoferry materials and tools around some large sites. Technology from San Francisco startupBuilt Roboticslets construction machinery such as diggers and dozers operate autonomously. A growing array of robotic equipment can take over specialized construction tasks includingwelding,drilling, andbrick-laying. “There are some really interesting things happening,” Schreyer says. An IDCreportpublished in January 2020 forecasts that demand for construction robots will grow about 25 percent annually through 2023. One big opportunity in construction, Schreyer says, is using computer vision and other sensing technologies to track the movement of materials and workers around a work site. Software can automatically flag if a job is falling behind, or if something has been installed in the wrong place. “There is so much potential to do something with that using AI,” Schreyer says. “More companies are going to move into that AI space.”Doxel, based in Redwood City, California, makes a mobile robot that scans work sites in 3- so that software can calculate how the project is progressing. A four-leggedBoston Dynamicsrobot called Spot isbeing testedfor the same purpose at a number of sites. Several companies sell drones for automated construction site inspection, includingPropeller,vHive,ABJ Drones, andDJI. Buildots, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, sells software that uses cameras fitted to the helmets of site managers, which automatically capture a site and process the images to identify discrepancies between plans and ongoing work. The technology is being used on several large European construction projects.“It’s critical for skilled workers to have great resources in their tool kit, and we are excited to be on the leading edge of technology.”Roy Danon, Buildots’ cofounder and CEO, says the goal is to use the data collected from work sites to help companies design buildings and plan construction schedules better. “We believe we can have a huge impact on planning,” he says, “if we have enough projects that show how you plan and how things actually turn out.”“The adoption of technology in construction has lagged behind almost everything except hunting and fishing for the past decades,” says Josh Johnson, a consultant at McKinsey who follows the building industry. A McKinseyreportlast month predicts a big shakeout across the construction industry over the next decade, with companies adopting technologies and methodologies from the manufacturing world. Things have already begun to change, thanks to technological progress and an increasingly tech-savvy workforce, Johnson says. The pandemic is accelerating the shift too, by making it more difficult to bring workers to a site and forcing companies to reevaluate supply lines and processes. “It’s forcing many of these legacy [construction contractors] and large companies to begin investing,” Johnson says. Arevalo, who oversees deployments of Canvas’ robot, says the drywalling robot cannot tackle corners or angles like a human; she says many apprentices see working with the robot as an opportunity to learn how to use more advanced robotic machinery. The company also has the backing of the local union. “It’s critical for skilled workers to have great resources in their tool kit, and we are excited to be on the leading edge of technology in our industries by partnering with Canvas,” Robert Williams III, business manager at District Council 16, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, said in a statement. But this apparently hasn’t quelled concerns among construction workers who’ve seen the robot in action. “They love the fact that it’s so consistent, that the wall is gorgeous,” Arevalo says. “But then the next question is, ‘When is it going to take my job?’”",3,Reliable,0.1455700916730328,0.3975422290128172,1497,3,WIRED

15,Pregnant health care workers could get Pfizer vaccine after FDA emergency authorization,-0.67,44.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/pregnant-health-care-workers-could-get-pfizer-vaccine-after-fda-panel-votes-for-emergency-authorization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-10,25,"A top government panelvoted in favor of granting an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine candidate for people 16 and older, including those who are pregnant — a major step toward administering the first round of COVID-19 immunizations in the United States, and a notable departure from how British regulators addressed the pregnancy question. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee’s recommendation will now head to the Food and Drug Administration, which is expected to accept that advice. If the FDA grants emergency authorization, some Americans could start receiving vaccines within a matter of days, and the majority will likely be women. Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) are an interim way to make drugs available in crises, but they require less safety and efficacy data than does full government approval. At Thursday’s meeting, government scientists emphasized the need to track the health of people who receive the initial Pfizer vaccines, monitoring both their level of immunity and what kind of adverse reactions they have. Pfizer is planning to seek full government approval next spring, after submitting more vaccine data. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. Still, the authorization has major implications. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines be given to health care workers — particularly those in direct contact with people who have contracted the coronavirus — and residents of nursing homes. State governments will be charged with distributing vaccines to eligible residents. But there won’t immediately be enough vaccines to cover everyone, even in those groups. Women will likely constitute the majority of immediate beneficiaries. About 20 million Americans work in health care, and 75 percent of those workers are women. More than two-thirds of the nation’s 1.3 million long-term nursing home residents are women. Notably, the FDA advisory committee did not explicitly prohibit giving the vaccine to pregnant people otherwise eligible for the vaccine. That leaves open the door for health care workers who are pregnant and breastfeeding during the initial vaccine distribution — an estimated 330,000 people — to get the two-shot regimen when their states and hospitals receive the vaccine. Pfizer’s large-scale vaccine trial excluded those who were pregnant or breastfeeding.“We have really no data to speak to risks specific to pregnant women or fetuses, but also no data that would warrant a contra-indication to use in pregnancy at this time,” Doran Fink, an FDA deputy director who specializes in vaccines, said at the meeting. “In the interest of allowing women of child-bearing potential who would consider vaccination, who are in the population approved for use under an EUA – they would be free to make their own decision, in conjunction with their health care providers.”During the meeting, government officials acknowledged the particular challenge posed by vaccinating pregnant people, especially those who are more likely to be exposed to the virus through work.“The early indication is there may be a higher risk of preterm delivery for pregnant women infected with COVID-19 compared to women without COVID-19, but there’s ongoing efforts to assess those and other pregnancy-related risks,” Aron Hall, a CDC scientist, told the panel. On Thursday, Pfizer said it expected to have data by mid-December about whether animal trials of the vaccine would have negative repercussions on the reproductive system — something known as “reproductive toxicity” — which is an important question for pregnant people taking the vaccine. And though Pfizer excluded pregnant people from enrolling in the study, 23 participants became pregnant during the trial, according to company data. Twelve received the vaccine, and 11 were in the placebo group. That information isn’t enough to draw larger-scale conclusions. The FDA has required that Pfizer track and submit regular data about how people respond if they get the vaccine while pregnant, including whether they develop any adverse events. The company also intends to launch studies on pregnancy and the vaccine next year. Immediately, it’s likely that states and local health care systems will have to decide how to distribute a limited supply of vaccines. They could determine on their own whether to treat pregnant health care workers as part of the immediate priority immunization group. Medical groups, including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have argued that pregnant health care workers should be given the option of taking the vaccine. The technology behind Pfizer’s vaccine, messenger RNA, isn’t known to cause special problems for either pregnant people or their fetuses. (Messenger RNA is also the basis for the Zika vaccine.)In anop-ed published this weekat Stat News, three medical ethicists argued that pregnant health care workers should be given the option to take any early vaccine, factoring in their risk of on-the-job COVID exposure.“A restrictive policy would not only deny pregnant and lactating individuals the opportunity to work with the same protection afforded their co-workers, but would further strain available human health resources over the next few months, when pandemic cases — and the need for health care — are peaking,” the authors wrote.",3,Reliable,0.1592886537330982,0.4397062813729479,1113,3,19th News

Since the novel coronavirus spread from Wuhan, China,global deaths from COVID-19have surpassed 400,000. Economic loss estimates range from an optimistic$3.3 trillion up to $82 trillionin case of a depression. And social norms changed overnight as people adjusted to self-isolation, face coverings, and social distancing. Now imagine the world coping with a new pandemic every month. This is not a prophecy or a piece of dark fiction, and surely not a plot for an upcoming Hollywood flick. This is what the world’s leading climate scientists are warning will happen when, not if, the planet’s ecological balance with microorganisms tips over, unleashing waves of pandemics of varying severity.:At the heart of this cataclysmic scenario is the loss of global ecological reservoirs, such as the Amazon rainforest, which maintains the delicate balance between the natural world and the human colony. But despite the recent fires that ravaged the rainforest and drew global calls for action, Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing government is encouraging rapid deforestation to facilitate agribusinesses owned by political establishment figures with links to Brazil’s military and police. Antonio Oviedo, a researcherat the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), a nonprofit defending indigenous rights in Brazil,told The Real News that deforestation in the Amazon in the first three months of 2020 was 51% higher than in the corresponding period last year. “And it shot up by a whopping 170% in April compared to April 2019, and about 90% of this deforestation is illegal,” Antonio added worryingly. Terra Brasilis, another Brazilian organization, estimates the current year (Aug 2019—Jul 2020) is the worst ever for deforestation, with almost 6000 km2of the Amazon chopped down. That’s almost twice the area cleared last year. According to Greenpeace, the present waves of deforestation “pose a serious and imminent threat to the roughly one third of indigenous land that has not yet been demarcated by the state, and will encourage even greater deforestation.” Bolsonaro’s government has tried to pass legislation in recent weeks tolegalize huge land seizures, mostly comprising indigenous territories. The proposed law is still before Brazil’s congress and is expected to go to a vote in the coming weeks. Dismantling of Environmental Institutions and SafeguardsTo facilitate large-scale agribusinesses and other commercial use of the Amazonian forest, Bolsonaro’s government has employed tactics such as defunding regulatory bodies and relaxing environmental safeguards through executive orders. A number of indigenous lands in Brazil await formal approval from the president’s office for their protected status. On April 16, the government agency which implements policies relating to indigenous people, FUNAI, received instructions that those lands can be made available for agribusiness. Claudio Angelo, spokesperson for the Climate Observatory organization in Brasilia, estimates some 90 indigenous territories out of more than 700 lands are awaiting the president’s signing, the last step in a lengthy bureaucratic land claim process. The pressure on federal regulatory agencies to relax rules has emboldened illegal operators who have reportedly moved inside protected lands. Oviedo says an estimated 20,000 illegal gold miners are inside the Yanomami lands alone—the largest of indigenous tribes located in the north of Brazil, with lands equaling the size of Portugal—“and they are within 5 kilometers of local tribes.” He added that in March FUNAI enacted a law forbidding outsiders from entering the protected lands, “but illegal miners are crossing over freely, increasing the risk for native populations’ exposure to COVID-19.”Despite the attempts by native tribes to self-isolate and move deep inside the forest, COVID-19 has spread to indigenous communities, causing the deaths and suffering forewarned by experts. According to theSpecial Secretariat for Indigenous Health(Sesai), Brazil’s federal body for providing healthcare for the native peoples, 2085 indigenous people have tested positive for COVID-19, and 82 have died so far. But theBrazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association(APIB), which tracks all indigenous cases, has reported 2600cases and 247 deaths among 94 ethnic groups. APIB claims the actual count is likely much higher due to underreporting. And health provisions are nauseatingly inadequate because of the budget cuts that severely constrain Sesai and its suboffices from delivering healthcare to the native people. Problems caused by Sesai’s shoestring budget are compounded by low staffing and a dearth of ventilators, and the nearest healthcare units are located nearly 200 miles from native communities,reportssuggest. “Medical facilities are working as hubs for spreading COVID-19 because of untrained staff and indigenous people have reportedly contracted COVID-19 after visiting there,” Oviedotold The Real News. “Also, food security is becoming another problem and indigenous people are told to go to cities for food assistance, which serves as an invitation to get the virus and take it back to the community,” he added. A Pandemic A MonthThis systematic dismantling of regulatory bodies and healthcare systems that protect the Amazon and its native people has already resulted in massive deforestation and created conditions for environmental catastrophe of epic proportions. In an exclusive interview with The Real News,Dr. Carlos Nobre, the leading environmental scientist in Brazil, said all new COVID and SARS viruses that cause epidemics and pandemics are generated by the lack of ecological balance with microorganisms.“There are hundreds of species of coronavirus present in the Amazon and there are hundreds of thousands of other types of viruses found there,” Dr. Nobre said. “If we disturbed this most diverse sanctuary of biological diversity that would mean disturbing the ecological balance of millions of species of microorganisms. If we moved beyond the tipping point in the next few decades, we have to be prepared for one pandemic a month.”Dr. Nobre adds the native people of the Amazon survived in the forest for 11,000 years because of their sense of maintaining a balance with the natural world. “Given the number of microorganisms existing in the forest, you can be certain that a virus or bacteria would have exterminated them. But they are very smart and they evolved the vision of living with the forest. And for 11,000 years there was not a single pandemic across the indigenous communities.” He lamented that the number of indigenous people in Brazil fell from 10-15 million to a mere 70,000 in the 1940s. “We’re the ones to cause that imbalance and bringing viruses to these native tribes.”Dr. Nobre’s three decades of research also warn of the Amazon reaching a tipping point in the face of growing deforestation, urbanization and global warming. “Those three factors happening simultaneously are driving a very large portion of the forest becoming a dry savanna (a drier forest compared to tropical rainforest where it rains all year). In our estimates, we are seeing 50%-60% of the Amazon almost at the edge of suburbanization and the tipping point almost being crossed because the forest in those areas are becoming drier.” He warned that if global warming and deforestation is not halted, most of the Amazon will irreversibly begin the transition to savanna, inevitably disturbing the ecological balance. The Right-Wing Orchestration of Death and DestructionDr. Nobre blames the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro for encouraging illegal activity inside the Amazon. “The political discourse the president has been issuing since he came into office in January 2019 has been encouraging environmental criminals because they feel there will be no punishment.” He observed that Brazil’s law-enforcing agencies have shrinking budgets, and some of the heads of divisions were fired because they were acting lawfully. “So, the message that went to the Amazon criminals was, we are never going to jail anymore because we have a president who supports what we are doing, who supports opening up more areas, who supports invasion of indigenous territories for illegal mining for illegal selective logging.”Christian Poirier of Amazon Watch echoes Dr. Nobre’s sentiment. In an interview with The Real News, Poirier said the Bolsonaro regime has been an abject disaster for the Amazon, its peoples, and for the planet. “When we saw essentially fascists come into power last year with a package of regressions, regressive actions to cut down hard-fought human rights and environmental protections, we saw a process that has led us to the catastrophe we’re seeing today, which is actually not being talked about enough.” He lamented that not enough is being said about the catastrophic impact the Amazon’s destruction will have on the climate crisis, and that “all of this is being spurred simultaneously by this recklessly, this criminally irresponsible regime.”Highlighting the mitigation actions Amazon Watch is undertaking, Christian Poirier said: “We helped spearhead a moratorium on all industrial activities and criminal activities in and around indigenous territories during the COVID crisis that were signed onto by more than 200 global organizations and endorsed by all of the principal indigenous federations and organizations in the Amazon areas in which we work.” He said this action calls on governments to fulfill their duties, and for companies to be mindful of the consequences of their actions in the Amazon. “These businesses should know their activities are exacerbating this crisis gravely and they need to respect the moratorium at this critical moment,” he asserted",2,Generally Reliable,0.0207607001133786,0.3800203888373532,2061,2,Real News Network

Joining them is the social media giant Facebook which, in its general censorship of conservative thought and opinion, has now decreed that using their platform to communicate complaints about government overreach during the Wuhan virus crisis and to organize protests against said overreach violates Facebook’s Alice-In-Wonderland “community standards”In the age before cable, there was an iconic sci-fi program calledwhose opening featured a series of test patterns, flickering screens and a narrator known as the “control voice” who solemnly intoned, “Do not attempt to adjust your television set. We will control all that you see and hear.” Today that is a chilling reality as social media giants like Facebook routinely censor what people can see and hear on their sites. Today Big Brothers like Mark Zuckerberg conspire nor only to control what we see and hear, but what we can say to each other andwhat Constitutional rights we can enjoy and when:Facebook is working with state governments across the U. S. to tamp down organized protests that violate stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic, according to new reporting. CNN’s Donie O’Sullivanreported Mondaythat the social media website “has removed promotion of anti-quarantine events in California, New Jersey, and Nebraska after consultation with state governments.” The CNN report cited a spokesman from Facebook who said the protests were in violation of states’ guidelines. The spokesman, O’Sullivan reported, “said Facebook would take down posts created through the Facebook Events feature that promote events in California, New Jersey and Nebraska. Other Facebook posts, including Facebook groups about the protests, might not be removed.”…ABC’s George Stephanopoulos spoke to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on Monday about how the platform is addressing the pandemic, and Zuckerberg said the website is tackling content that promotes “harmful misinformation.”“If somebody’s trying to organize something like [a protest], does that qualify as harmful information?” Stephanopoulos asked.“We do classify that as harmful misinformation and we take that down,” Zuckerberg said. “It’s important that people can debate policies, so there’s a line on this, but more than normal political discourse, I think a lot of the stuff that people are saying that is false around a health emergency like this can be classified as harmful misinformation.”What about the harmful misinformation about death rates and viral spread from experts and politicians whose computer models have been spewing “projections” that have been wrong from day one and proposed mitigation strategies that change repeatedly? Only the sick should wear a mask, leaving the majority of them to the health care workers, we were told. Then we’re told everybody should wear a mask Millions will die, oh wait. We’re running out of ventilators and will never have enough, oh, wait. Their harmful misinformation has helped tank a booming economy, possibly causing more deaths due to suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, and postponing so-called “elective” surgeries and treatments. People postpone or can’t get doctor appointments that might diagnose a serious ailment. The experts push telemedicine in situations when only a doctor’s stethoscope listening to your heart or lungs will do.

Topping the list of assaults on our Constitutional freedoms is the war on our right to speak freely and peacefully assemble as governors warn their citizens to stay safe, stay home, and shut up. Joining them is the social media giant Facebook which, in its general censorship of conservative thought and opinion, has now decreed that using their platform to communicate complaints about government overreach during the Wuhan virus crisis and to organize protests against said overreach violates Facebook’s Alice-In-Wonderland “community standards”In the age before cable, there was an iconic sci-fi program calledwhose opening featured a series of test patterns, flickering screens and a narrator known as the “control voice” who solemnly intoned, “Do not attempt to adjust your television set. We will control all that you see and hear.” Today that is a chilling reality as social media giants like Facebook routinely censor what people can see and hear on their sites. Today Big Brothers like Mark Zuckerberg conspire nor only to control what we see and hear, but what we can say to each other andwhat Constitutional rights we can enjoy and when:Facebook is working with state governments across the U. S. to tamp down organized protests that violate stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic, according to new reporting. CNN’s Donie O’Sullivanreported Mondaythat the social media website “has removed promotion of anti-quarantine events in California, New Jersey, and Nebraska after consultation with state governments.” The CNN report cited a spokesman from Facebook who said the protests were in violation of states’ guidelines. The spokesman, O’Sullivan reported, “said Facebook would take down posts created through the Facebook Events feature that promote events in California, New Jersey and Nebraska. Other Facebook posts, including Facebook groups about the protests, might not be removed.”…ABC’s George Stephanopoulos spoke to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on Monday about how the platform is addressing the pandemic, and Zuckerberg said the website is tackling content that promotes “harmful misinformation.”“If somebody’s trying to organize something like [a protest], does that qualify as harmful information?” Stephanopoulos asked.“We do classify that as harmful misinformation and we take that down,” Zuckerberg said. “It’s important that people can debate policies, so there’s a line on this, but more than normal political discourse, I think a lot of the stuff that people are saying that is false around a health emergency like this can be classified as harmful misinformation.”What about the harmful misinformation about death rates and viral spread from experts and politicians whose computer models have been spewing “projections” that have been wrong from day one and proposed mitigation strategies that change repeatedly? Only the sick should wear a mask, leaving the majority of them to the health care workers, we were told. Then we’re told everybody should wear a mask Millions will die, oh wait. We’re running out of ventilators and will never have enough, oh, wait. Their harmful misinformation has helped tank a booming economy, possibly causing more deaths due to suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, and postponing so-called “elective” surgeries and treatments. People postpone or can’t get doctor appointments that might diagnose a serious ailment. The experts push telemedicine in situations when only a doctor’s stethoscope listening to your heart or lungs will do.

Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning. It’s been decades since a single political party swept a Montana election. Political watchers could be forgiven, then, for expecting the Nov. 3 results to continue the state’s long tradition of split-ticket politics. Instead, Republicans won every seat on the statewide ballot, from president to state auditor, and expanded their majority in the state Legislature for good measure.“I was completely shocked,” said Rep. Barbara Bessette, one of several Democratic lawmakers unseated last week in Cascade County, referring to the lopsided Republican wins there. The decisive victories across many counties surprised more than just Democrats.“I was as surprised at the margins as everyone else,” said Jeff Essmann, a former state lawmaker and GOP party chairman from Billings. Essmann noted that when he started in the state Legislature in 2005, Cascade County was dominated by Democrats. In the 2004 election, Cascade County voterschose seven Democrats and two Republicansto represent them in the Montana House. This year, every state representative elected in the county is Republican. Great Falls isn’t the only place in the state where Republicans made significant gains this year. Preliminary vote countsshow Republican Gov.-elect Greg Gianforte having beaten Democrat Mike Cooney by nearly 13 percentage points across the state — roughly the same margin by which Matt Rosendale took the U. S. House seat in his race against Kathleen Williams. Incumbent U. S. Sen. Steve Daines won his race against Gov. Steve Bullock by a slightly smaller but still substantial 10%. In the down-ballot races for attorney general, secretary of state, state auditor and superintendent of public instruction, Republicans beat Democratic candidates by margins ranging from eight to 20 percentage points. Only one Democrat, superintendent of public instruction candidate Melissa Romano, managed to keep the gap between her and her GOP opponent, incumbent superintendent Elsie Arntzen, to single digits. Montana voters have historically been ticket splitters — reliably supporting Republican presidential candidates over the past two decades, but often choosing Democrats for other offices. In 2004, for example, the state backed Republican President George W. Bush by more than 20 percentage points even as it elected Democrat Brian Schweitzer governor. Voters that year also sent Republican Rep. Denny Rehberg back to Washington, D. C. by 30 points while picking Democrats to serve as superintendent of public Instruction and state auditor by 10-point margins. But recent presidential elections, with Donald Trump atop the ticket, have seen Montana turn more red. In 2016, Gov. Bullock was the only Democrat to win a statewide race. This year, Republicans not only won every statewide race on the ballot, they did so by hefty margins. Longtime political watchers say the Republican dominance in 2020 can be attributed to a combination of factors.“It’s not what the Republicans did right. It’s what the Democrats did bad,” said one Republican official who requested anonymity to comment candidly. “It was kind of the perfect storm that just kicked the shit out of them.”In interviews with Montana Free Press, nearly a dozen elected officials, campaign strategists, and political analysts described what they believe are the reasons behind the results, citing the popularity of President Trump and national attacks against the Democratic Party and the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic fallout and the ways in which the virus complicated campaign strategy. Throughout the general campaign, Montana Democrats faced a slew of negative messaging that aligned them with divisive national figures and issues. One attack ad against Bullockfeatured a narrator saying the candidate was supported by “the liberal mob” and included images of people jumping on a police vehicle — a reference to protests against racial injustice that swept the country this summer. In her race for the U. S. House, Williams was depicted as supportingpolicies that were too “extreme” for Montanaand more ideologically aligned with California, where she was born. The coronavirus pandemic made it harder for candidates to defend themselves against those attacks by limiting their ability to campaign in-person, Democrats said.“Ultimately, it was less face-to-face time,” said state House Minority Leader Casey Schreiner, who has represented a Great Falls district since 2013 and was on the ballot this year as Democrat Mike Cooney’s running mate in the race for governor. Democratic campaigns still held in-person events, such as drive-in rallies, but decided against aggressive door-knocking and community engagement because they were worried about spreading the virus. Republicans, for their part,were less cautious about the virus, holdinglarger gatherings and ralliesthat allowed for more direct contact between candidates and voters. When Democratic candidates have won Montana in the past, Schreiner said, it’s been by diligent shoe leather campaigning — talking to enough of their neighbors that they get a critical mass of voters to see past national partisanship and cast ballots for candidates as individuals.“For some reason, voting for the individual didn’t seem to happen this time,” Schreiner said. Voter turnout was also a factor in this year’s election, though not in the way that many observers expected. While Montana Democrats have historically presumed that higher voter turnout would work in their party’s favor, this year’s record turnout — 100,000 voters more than the number who cast ballots in 2016 — appears to have benefited Republicans. In his unsuccessful bid for the U. S. Senate, for example, Bullock received more than 272,000 votes, 16,000 more than he received when he won re-election as governor in 2016. But Bullock’s opponent, Daines, received more than 333,000 votes this year — nearly 78,000 more than he’d won when he was first elected to the Senate in 2014. Increased voter participation was partly due to the fact that 46 of 56 Montana counties chose to conduct all-mail elections in light of the pandemic, mailing ballots to active registered voters regardless of whether they had previously signed up to vote by mail. Some prominent Democrats who were involved with statewide campaigns said the increase in new voters likely included Montanans who were not previously engaged with politics.“Low-information, low-propensity voters. People who don’t vote all the time and people who aren’t on Twitter and not reading the newspaper and not seeking new information,” said one Democratic politician who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the election. Many of those voters, the Democrat said, voted a ticket informed primarily by their preference for a presidential candidate who campaigned aggressively against the Democratic Party.“Trump truly has a unique way of nationalizing everything. Now there are newly engaged voters with a ballot on their doorstep. They’re going to know about Trump and not much else,” he said. This wave of new voters especially affected down-ballot candidates without substantial name recognition. Democrats hoping to ride the coattails of Bullock and Biden weren’t able to compete with Republicans enjoying the boosted turnout driven by Trump, Daines, and Congressman Gianforte.“I think that what we learned this election cycle is that Montana is a very conservative state and when new people vote in this political process, they vote in a very conservative way,” the Democrat said. Other politicians and strategists say the high mail-ballot turnout alone doesn’t account for the dramatic margins. Jake Eaton, a GOP strategist who worked on the Gianforte campaign, said he believes Republicans won by such large margins in part because their message was compelling to independent voters and the party was effective at getting its base to turn out and vote. Internal polling data, Eaton said, indicated Montana voters were worried less about the health care issues Democrats focused on than about their livelihoods, particularly given the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic. Other Republicans and some Democrats concurred, citing a perception that the Democratic Party has become increasingly disconnected from low- and middle-income people and communities.“[Democrats] kind of lost touch with who their voters have been over the years. They don’t really represent the working class voter anymore,” said Sen. Steve Fitzpatrick of Great Falls. “It’s kind of become the party of the narrow elite, highly educated people from university towns.”“To a certain degree, their base has just washed away,” he continued. “If that’s your party — rich liberals — you’re not going to win in the state of Montana.”Asked about Fitzpatrick’s analysis, the Democrat quoted earlier said, “I agree with all that. Of course you need a jobs message. Of course you need a working people’s message . . . it’s the economy, stupid.”Despite their failure to appeal to a winning coalition of voters statewide, Democrats did maintain strong support in university towns this year, as well as a majority of the vote in Butte and several counties with large Native American populations. Bullock, for example, won 64% of the vote in Missoula County and 55% of the vote in Gallatin County, around Bozeman. He also won 65% of the vote in Butte-Silver Bow County, down from 70% in 2016, as well as 70% of the 2020 vote in Glacier County, which includes most of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. With the 2020 election season in the rearview mirror, the Republican Party is turning its attention to the jobs Montana voters have handed its candidates:governing the state. Democrats, for their part, are facing a journey into the political wilderness, looking to recalibrate the party so it can compete in the next election cycle and further Montana’s legacy of purple politics. Some Democrats are hoping to change how the party organizes around the state, making the case that short-term campaign cycles don’t translate to sustained support or grassroots relationships.“I think it’s about empowering people to be connected to their community,” said Rep. Bessette. “And you can’t do that coming in six months before Election Day or before people get their ballot.”Bessette, who has spent years working on public health issues and substance abuse prevention, said she wants Montana Democrats to start thinking about political organizing in a similar way.“We use local organizing and coalition building,” she said about countering drug and alcohol abuse. “You’re going to the local level because they’re the ones who know what they need … We don’t think about long-term solutions and sustainability [in politics]. It’s short-term. Whatever big shiny campaign there is comes in — and then they leave.”Montana Free Press is a public-powered nonprofit newsroom, and it's thanks to readers just like you that we can bring Montanans quality, independent journalism.that can be put toward a free MTFP tote bag or a discount on t-shirts, hats and other MTFP merch.

In their decision to pursue charges, prosecutors reviewed over 1,300 pages of reports, and over 100 video clips of incident, including body camera footage and nearby surveillance videos.

25,Homeless encampment grows on Apple property in Silicon Valley,0.0,44.67,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/08/10/homeless-encampment-grows-on-apple-property-in-silicon-valley/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-10,17,"Apple promised to help quell the Bay Area’s homelessness crisis with a series of big-ticket investments, but the tech giant soon may have to get more directly involved — addressing a problem that has spread to the company’s front door. A large homeless encampment is growing on the site Apple earmarked for its North San Jose campus, two years after Apple made waves with a$2.5 billion pledgeto combat the Bay Area’s affordable housing and homelessness crisis. What started as a few RVs parked on the side of Component Drive has grown over the past year into a sprawling camp of dozens of people, a maze of broken-down vehicles and a massive amount of trash scattered across the vacant, Apple-owned property. People with nowhere else to go live there in tents, RVs and wooden structures they built themselves. At least two children call the camp home. Apple is trying to figure out what to do, but it’s a tough situation. Clearing the camp likely will be difficult both logistically — it’s more challenging to remove structures and vehicles that don’t run than tents — and ethically — there are few places for the displaced residents to go.“There are approximately 30-35 unhoused people living in the area with an estimated 200 tons of hazardous trash and debris on the private property, making this a complicated and challenging situation,” Daniel Lazo, spokesman for the city of San Jose’s department of Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services, wrote in an email. “There are also an estimated 65-75 operable and inoperable vehicles at the site.”Residents of the camp say there may be as many as 75 people living there. Apple is “in talks with the city on a solution,” company spokeswoman Chloe Sanchez Sweet wrote in an email, without providing additional details. The number of people living without homes in the region has grown dramatically in recent years — it’s estimated there are about 30,000 homeless people in the five-county Bay Area. The crisis has become even more noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cities cut back on clearing encampments, allowing unhoused people to shelter in place and camps to grow and become more entrenched. As the problem intensifies, local tech companies — some of the region’s main generators of jobs and wealth — have feltmounting pressureto intervene. GoogleandFacebookeach pledged $1 billion to fight the housing shortage and homelessness in 2019, andApplefollowed by committing $2.5 billion. The vacant land off Component Drive figured into Apple’s $2.5 billion commitment. Apple originally bought the land in apush to acquire real estate in North San Josefor a new tech campus, but so far, the company hasn’t done much to develop it. In 2019, the tech company promised to make $300 million of land it owns in San Jose available for new affordable housing — including a portion of the Component Drive property. But it’s unclear when anything might be built. For Tigs Smith, who has been living on Apple’s land for the past year, the tech company’s promises mean little when they do nothing to help her or her neighbors. Smith, a 40-year-old construction worker, lives in a tiny, one-room house she built herself on the Component Drive property — where she landed after her ex-boyfriend kicked her out of the home they shared. She recently moved her 16-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son into the tiny home with her. Now, Smith hopes Apple will do something to help.“All I need is a place to put me and my kids at night,” she said. “All I need is that one little push in the right direction.”Apple already has committed $50 million over five years to help San Jose-based Destination: Home reduce and prevent homelessness. So far the organization has used some of that money — plus $50 million from Cisco — to finance nearly 2,000 new units of housing for people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. That money also has funded a new online portal, set to launch next spring, that will help unhoused people track the status of their requests for housing help. And it helped the county expand its homelessness prevention system to serve 1,500 households per year, according to Destination: Home. But those efforts won’t necessarily help Smith and her neighbors.

Meanwhile, San Jose is gearing up to clear amuch larger campat West Hedding and Spring streets, near the San Jose airport. That clean-up, which comes at the behest of the Federal Aviation Administration, could displace more than 200 people — some of whom might move to the Apple camp or other nearby camps. In an attempt to shelter some of those people, city officials have proposed creating a new modular interim housing site near the San Jose Police Department headquarters on West Mission Street. The City Council is set to consider the proposal next month. Relocating people living in the Apple camp “will understandably create stress for many residents,” Lazo wrote. “It is important to City staff that the process be handled with compassion and respect for the people displaced.”",3,Reliable,0.0896297534165181,0.5088832123758592,1259,3,Mercury News

But as usual for Reid, the bitter, vile pundit refused to apologize and accept responsibility. Reid instead chose to put the onus on the American people, President Trump, and even the news media for refusing to put sufficient focus on the terroristic threat that wide swaths of Christianity and the right pose to a safe America. As far as she was concerned, Reid only conceded her claim that Trump supporters were beingin the way Muslims were, was“not exactly the most artful”point.hat does the radicalization of…Muslim extremists, why does that get so much more attention than the radicalization of white domestic terrorists like the Boogaloo Boys? My next guests will help us unpack that duel reality,”Reid said in a tease. Reid returned after a break for what would be almost 16 minutes of discussion and began with Reid complaining about Islamophobia for about four minutes before she brought up the whole reason why she was having the segment. Here were some highlights of her lead-in (click “expand”):For decades, America's Muslim community has endured blanket portrayals that focus on one thing, just one thing. Not their families or individual achievements or even anything about Islam. Nope! Just one thing: terrorism. Particularly after 9/11, profiling became a near American obsession for anybody brown God forbid with a beard or head scarf, whether they were Muslim or not, traveling through an airport could be hell. Physical attacks on not just Muslims but also Sikhs, who are not Muslim, increased.(….)To be clear, the vast majority of the more than one billion Muslims on the planet, and the millions in this country are decidedly unradical. Everyday people just living their lives when they're not getting profiled by the NYPD or banned by the Trump administration. It's the misportrayal that is the problem, not the people…. But when white Christians are radicalized, we don't react the same way. When is the last time Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign was asked if they are willing to condemn the boogaloo boys by name? Does Bill Barr ever get asked about them?I mean, one of them literally allegedly killed a federal agent in Oakland using a Black Lives Matter rally as cover. Experts, including the FBI, have been warning for years about the radical right-wing, and white nationalist groups seeking to radicalize white Americans and posing a threat of domestic terrorism, including using black lives matter rallies as both a scare tactic and as physical cover to wreak mayhem. And rather than stand up to that threat, the President of the United States is accelerating it. We are living in a time when the President is the fire starter. He is helping to radicalize his own followers, to try to help his re-election.(….)We have never had a president do that and he's getting help from his party and media outlets who are literally celebrating vigilantism and turning an alleged killer into their version of a hero. If Trump was a Muslim leader, not the leader of the Christian right, how would we in the media describe what he's doing?Should terrorism across the spectrum be denounced? Absolutely. Whether it’s Antifa or the Boogaloo Boys, it should all be denounced. But for Reid, she wants you to think the issue lies almost exclusive with the right. After that bout of whataboutism, Reid addressed her own rhetoric by stating that she wondered on Monday how else one could describe what Trump’s allegedly doing in priming millions to commit and/or support acts of terror and it spawnedReid took a shot at those criticizing her, condemningof those talking about the Monday shindig as having“not”engaged“in good faith.”Before bringing on’s Naveed Jamali and Institute for Social Policy and Understanding’s Dalia Mogahed to praise her as a true friend of Muslims, Reid added:Some of the conversation reflected the genuine feelings of people who have been subjected to the kind of stereotyping that I just described and who take matters like this to heart because of it and we should all be sensitive to that, and I certainly should have been sensitive to that. Having been on-set on Monday, Reid called on Jamali first and asked him to helptheir discussion since what she had originally said was“not exactly the most artful way of asking that question.”Jamali spoke to his military service following 9/11 and a desire to serve his country as a way of showing his fellow Americans that Muslims are patriotic and not to be seen as terrorists. But after that important and necessary reminder, he shifted to Reid’s comments and defended her by attacking the President. Before asking Mogahed to bail her out, Reid again appeared to admit that what she said on Monday didn’t “work,” but never apologized (click “expand”):REID: Well, Dalia and I want to let you in this and let you respond however you want to respond as well. I mean, you know, and by the way, for the audience, that was not what the entire segment was about. The segment was actually about Donald Trump radicalizing people and his rhetoric and you can go all the way back to, if you talk about Muslims, him lying about saying, you know, I know that, you know, Muslims were celebrating 9/11. I mean, he's done a lot of it. But in that particular instance it was about his relationship to the far, far, far right that he is not discouraging, we'll put it that way. But just to let people know that was not the entire subject of the piece because this would have been the panel and not that panel that we had yesterday that was about a different thing. But it did come up and Dalia, you know, I threw that question to Naveed. It is something he and I have talked about and been angry about for a long time. But I guess, you know, the way that I framed it obviously did not work, so I want you to respond to me how that was taken and how that can really be brought up and do you think it even is a fair analogy to make or a fair question to be asked?MOGAHED: Well, thank you so much, Joy. I want to first say that I have been on your show before and ---REID: Yes. MOGAHED: --- you have always given Muslim voices a fair shake. You --- you are a fair reporter. You give us air time to make our case. You let us speak for ourselves and you're fair to us when we are on your show, so I think that that's an important point to make. The way that I heard your statement was intended to make the analogy, which is a fair one, between radicalization of Muslim extremists and the radicalization of young, white men in this country. The way that it came --- the way that it landed and the way that it was heard by some people, many people, in fact, was unintentionally saying that Muslims were inherently violent or that Muslim --- the way in which Muslims act is violent and though that was not your intention, it is important to correct that notion for your millions of viewers and that's why I think it's so important to have this conversation[.]Reid then rehashed what’sbecome a fact-free cri de coeur in insistingthat Black Lives Matter groups and sympathizers are not to blame for any of the violence seen this summer across American cities, but it’s right-wing groups that have been the troublemakers. And in a truly farcical claim, she insisted that the two men killed in Kenosha were merelyout in the streets when Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot them. She described Anthony Huber as merely“a young skateboarder”(instead of a domestic abuser) and Joseph Rosenbaum as only“a dad”when, in reality, he was a convicted sex offender.

My next guests will help us unpack that duel reality. We'll be right back.(….)7:44 p.m. EasternREID: For decades, America's Muslim community has endured blanket portrayals that focus on one thing, just one thing. Not their families or individual achievements or even anything about Islam. Nope! Just one thing: terrorism. Particularly after 9/11, profiling became a near American obsession for anybody brown God forbid with a beard or head scarf, whether they were Muslim or not, traveling through an airport could be hell. Physical attacks on not just Muslims but also Sikhs, who are not Muslim, increased. And TV shows about Muslims like Homeland andpounded the terrorism theme 24/7.

REID: Average American Muslims have, for two decades, been pressed to answer for every act of terrorism committed by anyone, anywhere in the world, who claimed to be a Muslim. They're constantly asked, are you going to condemn terrorism, are you, are you? And unfortunately, that has too often been true of the media. According to a 2018 Institute for Social Policy and Understanding study, someone perceived to be Muslim, accused of a terrorism plot will receive 770 percent of the media coverage as somebody not perceived to be Muslim. To be clear, the vast majority of the more than one billion Muslims on the planet, and the millions in this country are decidedly unradical. Everyday people just living their lives when they're not getting profiled by the NYPD or banned by the Trump administration. It's the misportrayal that is the problem, not the people. And we're all too quick to call out those who seek to radicalize the small number of mostly young men who are vulnerable to be co-opted by violent people. There have been lengthy treatments of this all over cable news for years. But when white Christians are radicalized, we don't react the same way. When is the last time Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign was asked if they are willing to condemn the boogaloo boys by name? Does Bill Barr ever get asked about them? I mean, one of them literally allegedly killed a federal agent in Oakland using a Black Lives Matter rally as cover. Experts, including the FBI, have been warning for years about the radical right-wing, and white nationalist groups seeking to radicalize white Americans and posing a threat of domestic terrorism, including using black lives matter rallies as both a scare tactic and as physical cover to wreak mayhem. And rather than stand up to that threat, the President of the United States is accelerating it. We are living in a time when the President is the fire starter. He is helping to radicalize his own followers, to try to help his re-election. The same way that he gleefully encouraged violence during his initial presidential run. DONALD TRUMP [on 03/01/16]: Oh, get out of here. Get out of here. Look at these people. [SCREEN WIPE] Get out of here. Get out! Out, out, out. [SCREEN WIPE] In the old days, which isn’t so long ago, when we were less politically correct, that kind of stuff wouldn't have happened. Today, we have to be so nice, so nice. [SCREEN WIPE] [on 06/28/20] They're not protesters. Those aren't -- those are anarchists. They’re agitators. MARK MCCLOSKEY [on 08/24/20]: Anarchy and chaos on our streets. HARRIS FAULKNER: The NYPD is reporting 28 shootings from over the weekend. That’s a 600% increase. REID: We have never had a president do that and he's getting help from his party and media outlets who are literally celebrating vigilantism and turning an alleged killer into their version of a hero. If Trump was a Muslim leader, not the leader of the Christian right, how would we in the media describe what he's doing? I asked that question on Monday, and there was a lot of conversation, particularly online after the segment aired, some of which was frankly not in good faith. But some of the conversation reflected the genuine feelings of people who have been subjected to the kind of stereotyping that I just described and who take matters like this to heart because of it and we should all be sensitive to that, and I certainly should have been sensitive to that, so let's talk about it now. Joining me now is Naveed Jamali,editor at large, and my guest on Monday. And Dalia, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Thank you both for being here. And Naveed, I'm going to back to you. I’m going to play quickly the section of the interview that was in question. REID [on 08/31/20]: When leaders let's say in the Muslim world talk a lot of violent talk, and encourage their supporters to be willing to commit violence, including on their own bodies, in order to win against whoever they decide is the enemy, we in the U. S. media describe that as they are radicalizing those people, particularly when they're radicalizing young people. That's how we talk about the way Muslims act. When you see what president trump is doing, is that any different from what we describe as radicalizing people?REID: Not --- not exactly the most artful way of asking that question, obviously, based on the reaction, but Naveed, can you contextualize it a better way of making that point just from a national security point of view. NAVEED JAMALI: Let me just tell you what it meant to me and the actual visuals that I had in my mind. You know, I am someone that came of age as in the 9/11 generation. When I think of being a brown man in America, there are two-way points that define what it Americans for me and that is 9/11 and then the Muslim ban. And after 9/11, you know, when you talk about being radicalized, we all know the 19 hijackers, who they were, what they were I felt a very strong urge to counter this, that it wasn't enough to stand up and say something, but I wanted to do something and the best way I thought I could do that is join the military, and that's exactly what I did. I'm not alone. There are plenty of brown and Muslim men and women, whether they joined the military or anything else, wanted to speak out and address this, so to me, what I took that to be is a question of, you know, this double standard that exists when we talk about brown and Muslim people in this country and how we hold us to a monolithic standard. You know, as you said, when there is a terrorist act within our community, we are all expected to apologize, to condemn it, which we do because it’s the right thing to do. And that same standard is not often applied to other communties. It should be a standard that should be applied universally. So, I took what your question --- not just from a national security standpoint --- but I took it as a brown man whose father is Pakistani, whose father is Muslim, and by the way, who watched that segment. And I wanted to answer in that vein that I took it exactly as this idea that we are a country that has a double standard and even someone that can serve and prove his loyalty, be patriotic is then thrown the Muslim ban in his face, just like my --- you know, the fellow members of my community. And that's really that double standard that I think we really have to address. I thought that was what the question was and I think it's an important one to ask. REID: Well, Dalia and I want to let you in this and let you respond however you want to respond as well. I mean, you know, and by the way, for the audience, that was not what the entire segment was about. The segment was actually about Donald Trump radicalizing people and his rhetoric and you can go all the way back to, if you talk about Muslims, him lying about saying, you know, I know that, you know, Muslims were celebrating 9/11. I mean, he's done a lot of it. But in that particular instance it was about his relationship to the far, far, far right that he is not discouraging, we'll put it that way. But just to let people know that was not the entire subject of the piece because this would have been the panel and not that panel that we had yesterday that was about a different thing. But it did come up and Dalia, you know, I threw that question to Naveed. It is something he and I have talked about and been angry about for a long time. But I guess, you know, the way that I framed it obviously did not work, so I want you to respond to me how that was taken and how that can really be brought up and do you think it even is a fair analogy to make or a fair question to be asked?DALIA MOGAHED: Well, thank you so much, Joy. I want to first say that I have been on your show before and ---REID: Yes. MOGAHED: --- you have always given Muslim voices a fair shake. You --- you are a fair reporter. You give us air time to make our case. You let us speak for ourselves and you're fair to us when we are on your show, so I think that that's an important point to make. The way that I heard your statement was intended to make the analogy, which is a fair one, between radicalization of Muslim extremists and the radicalization of young, white men in this country. The way that it came --- the way that it landed and the way that it was heard by some people, many people, in fact, was unintentionally saying that Muslims were inherently violent or that Muslim --- the way in which Muslims act is violent and though that was not your intention, it is important to correct that notion for your millions of viewers and that's why I think it's so important to have this conversation because what the facts are is that while Muslims receive the vast majority of media coverage when it comes to ideologically-motivated violence, they are by no means the majority of --- they are not the ones that are committing most terrorism in America. The vast majority of terrorists casualties at the hands of terrorism are at the hands of white supremacists and far right extremists in the United States. Most people don't know that. Not only that, but Muslim publics around the world and in the United States are more likely than the general public to actually reject violence against civilians. So, you have this media portrayal on one hand implying and reinforcing the stereotype while the reality on the other hand says the exact opposite. REID: Yeah. I mean, and I guess this is why it annoys me to see the way that Donald Trump has talked about it because you’re absolutely right. Here is some statistics and this is from a Georgia State University study. Muslims 80 percent, are as likely as the general public, 74 percent --- so more likely to reject violence targeting civilians carried out by an individual or small group. That is just actual facts. Attacks by Muslims perpetrators received on average 357 percent more coverage than other attacks. So, you know, Dahlia it --- it is vexing because when I see the Boogaloo Boys, you have an officer who Donald Trump sometimes cite who was gunned down. They never tell you who gunned this person down. It was a Boogaloo Boys member. It sounds like a silly name, but they’re actually quite dangerous, using nearby peaceful protests that Black lives matter were holding as a cover. Federal authorities identified this man as an Air Force Sergeant, Steven Carrillo. He’s 32 years old. He's a member of this group. I ---- I mean, I guess when I don't hear that just described as domestic terrorism in the same way, it irks my spirit and I wonder for the Muslim community how does that land? The fact that we, in the media, don’t say immediately terrorism?MOGAHED: Well, I think that many of us don't necessarily want everyone to be called a terrorist and that is a legal term that the media really shouldn't be throwing around against anyone. What we want, though, is simply objective fair coverage of all communities, of all acts of violence, whether they're ideologically motivated or not. What we see is that the term terrorist is only used against Muslims, no matter what their motivation might be and before there is a legal assessment. And that really hurts ordinary people. I mean, we know from our research, Joy, that Muslim children are the most likely group, twice as likely as other children, to be bullied in school and for their faith and as was mentioned, people who aren't Muslim who are perceived to be Muslim has the same treatment, so it has real world consequences. Muslim is also the most likely faith group to report, you know, religious-based discrimination. It --- it matters how the media talks about these things because it impacts ordinary people. REID: Yeah, and Naveed, It also matters how our political leaders, and I think Dahlia is absolutely right that let's take that whole terrorism conversation off the table, just encouraging violence when it comes from a leader with as much power as the President of the United States, it feels, to me, more dangerous. I mean, you’ve had --- and let’s just show that --- people don't often show the two men killed in Kenosha. These were two innocent men. Their names are Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum. They were the victims in this case. They died as a result of somebody who came from out of state, allegedly, and shot three people, and they died. One of them was a dad. One of them was a young skateboarder. You have Donald Trump sharing a video on CNN, a white nationalist video that he retweeted falsely blaming Black Lives matter for a 2019 subway assault. So, you know, it’s sort of an all --- everybody in on getting blamed for things that they haven't done and I want you to listen to an ad by a woman named Elizabeth Newman who left the administration. She was a former assistant secretary for threat prevention in the Department of Homeland Security. Then I want to give each of you a response to respond, Naveed and then Dahlia. ELIZABETH NEWMAN [in RVAT ad]: From January until March 11th, what you saw instead was a number of good public servants attempting to do their job and the President telling them to stop because he didn't want the economy to tank and he didn't want a distraction from his campaign. I'm sorry, Mr. President. You're hired to handle America's worst day and you have absolutely failed. REID: I'm up against very little time. But Naveed, a very quick reaction from you and then I will give Dahila the last word. JAMALI: So, this is all about dehumanizing people, right? And, you know, when Trump goes on TV and talks about a man shot in the back seven times by a police officer and compares that to choking playing golf, that's who we're dealing with and it’s important to understand that really when we talk about this, brown people have been dehumanized. The only way to solve that is by treating us like equals. REID: Yep. Dahlia?MOGAHED: Joy, fair coverage is important for democracy overall. It is not just about how Muslims portrayed. It is about informing the public and giving them facts. REID: Indeed. Naveed Jamali, Dahlia Mogahed, thank you both very much.

28,Working a Suicide Hotline When the Caller Says ‘Gun’,0.0,45.0,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/02/working-a-suicide-hotline-when-the-caller-says-gun/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-02-12,16,"Helena Reid had worked at a suicide hotline based in Tallahassee, Florida, for only a few months when she answered a call that challenged her skills and quickened her pulse. The woman described how she had put a gun on layaway at a local store. Her plan was to make payments over the next few months and, eventually, take the gun home and use it to end her life. When a caller mentions a gun, Reid knows that situation is particularly fraught.“There’s just so much less forethought to pulling a trigger,” she says. “Any other method is so much more deliberate.”988Text 741741988, press 1, or text 838255Understandwarning signs. But this woman was operating on an unusual timeline. Reid thought back to the training she’d done to prepare her for this job. In two-and-a-half-hour sessions spread over 10 weeks, she had learned to listen to people’s stories without judgment. Her goal now was simply to be there for the woman. She didn’t try to persuade her that she should live, or press her to take any specific action. She sat and listened, bearing witness as the pain washed over her. Slowly, Reid heard the woman’s voice relax. Toward the end of the call, the woman told Reid that she would not make a payment on the gun that month. “It felt like a gift that she had given me,” she said. Suicide rates have beenrising steadilyin America over the last two decades, and are now at a record high. Just over half of all completed suicides are by gun. That’s partly because guns are so lethal: Only about 6 percent of suicide attempts involve a firearm,a 2012 study showed. Hotline workers are often paid to do this work, but — like Reid — they usually have a deeper commitment to it. In a situation with tremendous stakes, they must be calm and patient, and listen carefully. If the caller seems open to it, they may ask them to commit to a specific plan that will keep them safe for the next few hours. Often that commitment is as simple as going to bed, or vacuuming the living room rug. In most cases, the hotline worker never finds out what happened to the person they shared those intense, intimate moments with. But Reid says she can live with the uncertainty. She knows she was there to catch the person when they most needed a net, and that her compassion made it more likely they’ll call the next time they need to.“If you can keep them safe for the next 30 seconds, that could lead to the next 30 years,” she said. Reid, who is 26, decided to train to be a crisis hotline worker about two years ago, partly to figure out if she wanted to go back to school to become a therapist. After just a few sessions, she knew she had found her calling. Calls to the center where she works, which is called 2-1-1 Big Bend, come both from people who hope to be connected to social services, such as food pantries and utilities, and from people who call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline which connects callers to a counselor in their area. Reid trained with about 20 other people, but they spent most of their time in small groups doing role play and interactive exercises to help put themselves in the mindset of someone experiencing suicidal thoughts. “It felt to me like Learn-How-To-Be-a-Good-Person training,” Reid said. “Practice empathy, be nonjudgmental, learn good listening skills. Now I practice the same tenets all the time with my friends, because it’s just so effective.”Another central principle of suicide hotline work, Reid said, is to ask a distressed person directly whether they are thinking of killing themselves. That’s a strategy that should be used by anyone who knows someone they fear may be suicidal, Reid said. Experts agree that the question won’t spark an idea in a person’s head if it wasn’t there already, and it’s often a tremendous relief to be invited to talk about something that can be incredibly hard to broach. If the person answers “yes,” Reid’s next questions are “Have you attempted suicide before?” and “Do you have a plan?”If a person has a gun in the house, never mind in their hand, Reid will ask the caller to get a little distance from it — say, ask them to put it down and move to a different room. Reid might also ask the person to consider taking out the ammunition. If the person is feeling suicidal and has a gun in a safe or stored somewhere in the house, Reid might see if they’d consider giving it to a friend or family member to hold it until it feels safe to take it back. Reid said one call in particular taught her not to make assumptions about what anyone is going through. She was new and nervous, and she reached for a way to convince the woman to live. “How about your husband?” Reid asked, after the woman mentioned her spouse. “Don’t you want to live for him?” The woman replied flatly that her husband was abusive, and he was one of the reasons why she wanted to die. “I should have been holding her hand through telling that story instead of pulling her where I wanted her to go,” Reid said. After working at the hotline full-time for about a year, Reid recently cut back to 25 hours a week so she could go back to school for her master’s degree in social work. She hasn’t decided yet what kind of counseling she’ll do when she graduates, but she likes the intensity and impact of working with people in crisis. “You become part of the caller’s permanent safety plan. You know that they will call the hotline back because they know they’ll get someone who cares.”",3,Reliable,0.0813692115964842,0.362199827589438,1247,3,The Trace
29,We Need Help': Haiti's Interim Leader Requests US Troops,0.0,43.33,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/haiti-president-killed/2021/07/10/id/1028149/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Haiti’s interim government has asked the U. S. and U. N. to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries to stabilize the country and prepare for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination. Amid the confusion, hundreds of Haitians gathered outside the U. S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince pleading for a way out of the country. Women carried babies and young men waved passports and ID cards as they cried out, “Refuge!” and “Help!”“We definitely need assistance and we’ve asked our international partners for help,” Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. “We believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving the situation.”The stunning request for U. S. military support recalled the tumult following Haiti’s last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation — which lasted nearly two decades — as a way to avert anarchy. The request was received but there has been no decision, according to a US official familiar, speaking on condition of anonymity because not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But the Biden administration has so far given no indication it will provide military assistance. For now, it only plans to send FBI officials to help investigate a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutional standoff. Haiti also sent a letter to the United Nations requesting assistance, U. N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Saturday. The letter asked for troops and security at key installations, according to a U. N. source speaking on condition of anonymity because details of the letter are private. On Friday, a group of lawmakers announced they had recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti’s dismantled senate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government’s authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Moïse had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government. One of those lawmakers, Rosemond Pradel, told the AP that Joseph “is neither qualified nor has the legal right” to lead the country. Joseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Moïse’s murder for political gain.“I’m not interested in a power struggle,” said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. “There’s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that’s through elections.”Meanwhile, more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of an murky, international conspiracy: a shootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy, a private security firm operating out of a warehouse in Miami and a cameo sighting of a Hollywood star. Among those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed more than a dozen former members of Colombia’s military. Some of the suspects were seized in a raid on Taiwan’s Embassy where they are believed to have sought refuge. National Police Chief Léon Charles said another eight suspects were still at large and being sought. The attack, which took place at Moïse’s home before dawn Wednesday, also seriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami for surgery. She issued a statement Saturday implying the president was killed for trying to develop the country. “The mercenaries who assassinated the president are currently behind bars,” she said in Creole, “but other mercenaries currently want to kill his dream, his vision, his ideology.”Colombian officials said the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. U. S.-trained Colombian soldiers are often recruited by security firms and mercenary armies in conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and drug cartels. The sister of one of the dead suspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP that she last spoke to her brother late Wednesday — hours after Moïse’s murder — when the men, holed up in a home and surrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of a shootout.“He told me not to tell our mother, so she wouldn’t worry,” said Yenny Capador, fighting back tears. It’s not known who masterminded the attack. And questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president’s residence posing as U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president. Capador said her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank of sergeant, was hired by a private security firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti. Capador said she knew almost nothing about the employer but shared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security — a company based in Doral, a Miami suburb popular with Colombian migrants. The wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia’s W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month — a paltry sum for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, noncommissioned officers and professional soldiers, earned from their pensions. Uribe is under investigation in the alleged murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 who was presented as someone killed in combat, one of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia’s U. S.-trained army more than a decade ago. CTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated with several other Florida-registered entities, some since dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp. CTU’s website lists two addresses, one of which is a gray-colored warehouse that was shuttered Friday with no sign indicating who it belonged to. The other is a small suite under a different company’s name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionist said Intriago stops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an email seeking comment.“We are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened, so that my brother’s reputation does not remain like it is,” said Capador. “He was a humble, hard-working man. He had honors and decorations.""Besides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans. Investigative Judge Clément Noël told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noël said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday. Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his Haitian hometown of Jacmel. He worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organization set up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His now-deactivated Facebook page features photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag. Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages doesn’t have any military training and doesn’t believe he was involved in the killing. Joseph refused to specify who was behind the attack, but said that Moïse had earned numerous enemies while attacking oligarchs who for years profited from overly generous state contracts. Some of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate President Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged. Analysts say whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. The growing power of gangs displaced more than 14,700 people in Haiti last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.“This country has nothing to offer,” said 36-year-old Thermidor Joam, one of those thronged outside the U. S. Embassy on Friday. “If the president can be killed with his own security, I have no protection whatsoever if someone wants to kill me.”Prosecutors also want to interrogate members of Moïse’s security detail, including the president’s security coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri Hérard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.“If you are responsible for the president’s security, where have you been?,” Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. “What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?”",3,Reliable,-0.0118547197640118,0.373282764433207,2001,1,Newsmax

31,When will hip-hop start protecting Black women?,-19.67,36.0,https://www.mic.com/p/when-will-hip-hop-start-protecting-black-women-81080205,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"In 1977, the Combahee River Collective, a Black feminist lesbian socialist organization, wrote in astatement: “Black women are inherently valuable, that our liberation is a necessity not as an adjunct to somebody else's but because of our need as human persons for autonomy. This may seem so obvious as to sound simplistic, but it is apparent that no other ostensibly progressive movement has ever considered our specific oppression as a priority or worked seriously for the ending of that oppression.”As the decades have progressed, public discourse has molded itself to the perception of standing in line with these words. Hashtags like #ProtectBlackWomen and #SayHerName have expanded from social media into common nomenclature, andT-Shirts proclaiming fealty to Black feminist icons have become an en vogue method of virtue signaling. In practice, however, claims of “intersectionality” are often tossed aside when these principles run afoul of established social paradigms. This is particularly evident in hip-hop and the media surrounding it, with new music rollouts, podcasts and the wildly popular Verzuz continuing to prove that supportive words fail to be reinforced by corrective community action. In recent years, the podcast universe has rapidly expanded to hone in on the growing market of hip-hop lovers. The largest platforms and personalities in this space showcase just how pervasive misogynoir continues to be in the culture. The Joe Budden Podcast, whose eponymous anchor has himself beenrepeatedly accused of abuse by women not only recently invited viral sensation Kevin Samuels to his platform, a man who has built his profile repeating worn-out maxims about cishet Black women’sdesirabilityand thesilencing of Black men, but also recently put out a statement of apology for allegations of sexual harassment by Olivia Dope, a former host ofin his podcast network . Recently, it was announced that Dave Chappelle, Talib Kweli, and Yasiin Bey werelaunching a podcast calledThe Midnight Miracle,despite Chappelle being repeatedly criticized for his harmful language towards trans women and Kweli beingpermanently suspendedfrom Twitter for hisunceasing harassment of Maya Moody. Rapper and host of theDrink ChampspodcastN. O. R. E.recently invited Talib Kweli to the showand discussed ahighly-criticized episode of the podcastthat alleged serial rapist Russell Simmons was invited to participate in. During the conversation, N. O. R. E. remarked that “cancel culture” hadn’t given his large media platform the benefit of the doubt in being aware of complaints that had been leveled in the mainstream since November 2017. Simultaneously, he proceeded to offer Simmons the benefit of the doubt, highlighting both Oprah pulling out fromOn the Recordand his having failed to be charged in a criminal court to date. In the case of Swizz Beatz and Timbaland’s Verzuz, the cultural phenomenon has repeatedly given a platform to men who have been accused and convicted of harm against women without accountability or concern. Brooklyn-based rapper Fabolous, who wascharged in March 2018with multiple counts of aggravated assault and domestic violence after reportedly punching his partner, Emily Bustamente, several times and knocking out her two front teeth, was nonetheless honoredwith a Verzuz special of his ownalongside Yonkers rapper Jadakiss in June 2020. Nelly, who hasrepeatedly beenaccused ofsexual assault, was featured opposite Ludacris in May 2020. Grace has also been offered to R. Kelly, whosediscography is continuously featuredatvarious Verzuz events, highlighting how lauding individuals at the expense of Black women’s comfort and safety is an accepted calculus. As Verzuz has grown and made brand deals with Apple and Triller, the amplification of the works of harmful Black men has remained. In the April 20th event featuring rap legends andco-stars Redman & Method Man, both artistsrepeatedly celebrated alleged serial rapist Russell Simmons, allowing him to Facetime into the performance from his enclave in Bali – a place infamous for its lack of an extradition treaty with the United States. Furthering the insult is the fact that Method Man directly worked with Drew Dixon, one of Simmons’ accusers, on the seminal 1995 duet with Mary J. Blige, “I’ll Be There for You/You’re All I Need,” which he performed on the very same Verzuz stage. (Mic reached out to Verzuz to request comment on the criticisms of this story, and they did not immediately respond.)InMichelle Wallace wrote: “the history of the period has been written and will continue to be written without us. The imperative is clear: Either we will make history or remain the victims of it.” At the time, she was referring to the clear gaps in both the white women’s feminist movement and the Civil Rights movement. A through-line to the status quo, however, reflects that resistance persists in the effort to create a musical space that adheres to being grounded in the realities of our own identities.. As the Collective pointed out, “in the case of Black women this is a particularly repugnant, dangerous, threatening, and therefore revolutionary concept because it is obvious from looking at all the political movements that have preceded us that anyone is more worthy of liberation than ourselves.”Instead, as Wallaceexpressed in an essaytitled “A Black Feminist’s Search for Sisterhood” out of the essay collection“We exist as women who are Black who are feminists, each stranded for the moment, working independently because there is not yet an environment in this society remotely congenial to our struggle — because, being on the bottom, we would have to do what no one else has done: we would have to fight the world.” Indeed, that seems to continue to be the case — in hip-hop as it currently stands, preservation of “the culture” demands that Black women silence their dissent to alleviate everyone else’s discomfort and prioritize the enjoyment of the masses. On May 8, Verzuz produced a Mother’s Day weekend specialfeaturing SWV versus Xscape, despiteXscape member Tameka “Tiny” Harris currently being under scrutiny alongside her husband T. I.for alleged serial sexual assault by dozens of women. Not only was her photo featured on the promotional materials, but the performance also includedmusic from herhusband in the warm-up mixby the Xscape tour DJ, DJ AONE, as450,000 viewers looked on. Soulja Boy, who has recently made waves on Tiktok with his new single“She Make It Clap”,has beenrepeatedly accusedofbattery, sexual assault, and kidnapping. (Soulja Boy also recently announced anupcoming Verzuz battlewith Bow Wow, who hasalso been charged with assault.) All of these celebrations and accolades are upheld by demanding the silence and dismissal of Black women who have chosen to come forward about their respective traumas, reinforcing the uncomfortable truth that the utterance of #ProtectBlackWomen comes with terms and conditions that their experiences violated, the first one being a demand for a concession of power and influence. Hip-hop was predicated, amongst other factors, as a musical and cultural framework to give a voice to the voiceless. It is unendingly tragic, then, that Black women who have stood alongside its growth have failed to see any material gains in establishing a framework that truly respects the agency of Black women, instead choosing to continue to adhere to a utilitarian position of preservation in which we are ultimately expendable. Rhetoric is toothless if it is not superseded by collective action, and simply iterating a love for Black women is worthless if that love is transactional and conditional. This continued grievous oversight failing to cross the threshold into a publicly acknowledged harm that demands accountability serves as proof positive of a cognitive dissonance that relegates Black women as reluctant participants in a cultural landscape that they were fundamental in shaping.",2,Generally Reliable,-0.0136846405228758,0.4038085688820982,1752,2,Mic
32,6 Biden Lies About Trump's COVID Response,24.0,31.33,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/10/6_biden_lies_about_trumps_covid_response.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-10,18,"Joe Biden has struggled to remain relevant since he announced his presidential campaign in April 2019. That task became a lot more difficult since the outbreak of coronavirus. Before his campaign finally acknowledged the crisis, Team Biden was already limiting public appearances. From 10-minute campaign “rallies” to scripted television interviews, Biden was doing his best to run a campaign without appearing in public. When the establishment media was still working around the clock to save Biden’s campaign from Bernie Sanders, that plan was working. However, once 24/7 coverage transitioned to COVID-19, Biden remained stuck in his basement bunker, out of sight and out of mind. His solution to this problem? Attack President Trump’s response to coronavirus with no regard for the truth. Here are Joe Biden’s six most egregious COVID-19 lies:1. President Trump called coronavirus a hoaxEditing President Trump out of context is Democrats’ favorite way to exploit this national emergency for political purposes. Biden’s campaign took two separate statements made by the president at a rally to make it look like he said, “Coronavirus, this is their new hoax.” If you go through the transcript of the president’s statements that night, it is clear that it never happened. President Trump rightfully said the politicization of the crisis is a hoax, just like the Russia witch hunt and the impeachment charade. The Washington Post even awarded Biden four Pinocchios for manipulating the video. But President Trump never said, and never would say, the disease itself is a hoax.2. The Trump administration rejected WHO coronavirus test kits During the March 15 presidential debate, Biden asserted the Trump administration “refused to get coronavirus testing kits from the World Health Organization,” while attacking the president for his handling of the COVID-19 response. The truth? WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said, “No discussion occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States.” How could President Trump reject something that was never offered?3. Trump eliminated entities responsible for global health security and biodefenseOn March 19, Biden tweeted, “The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19. Donald Trump eliminated it.” This characterization, however, completely distorts what happened. After President Trump took office, the NSC established the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which included global health and biodefense. Tim Morrison, who ran the new directorate, claimed this change made America’s biodefense response even stronger.4. Trump made no effort to get medical professionals to China At the end of March, during an interview with Anderson Cooper, Biden said, “You should get into China and get our experts there. We have the best in the world. Get them in so we know what is actually happening. There was no effort to do that.” However, on January 6, the Trump administration began offering to send a CDC team to China, one week after China publicly acknowledged the virus. On January 7, the CDC set up its coronavirus incident management system before the first death was reported and while China was still claiming there was no evidence the virus could spread from human to human. And on January 8, CDC representatives visited Wuhan.5. Trump told governors they were on their own in getting medical equipmentDuring a CNN town hall, Joe Biden said President Trump told governors they were on their own in getting medical equipment. The problem? That’s not what the president said. Although many liberal news outlets ran with the first half of President Trump’s quote, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” the second half of the quote clearly said, “[The federal government] will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” Biden knew about the entire quote nine days before he repeated the lie on national television.6. Trump slashed the Centers for Disease Control budgetDuring an interview on ABC’s “This Week” in early March, Joe Biden asserted. “They’ve cut the — the Centers for Disease Control. They’ve cut the funding for — they’ve tried to cut the funding for NIH, the National Institute of Health.” He recently doubled down on his argument on Twitter. It’s important to note, however, that the Obama administration tried to cut the CDC’s budget five out of its eight years in the White House. In reality, the CDC’s budget is 7% larger now than under President Obama’s final years in office. History proves Joe Biden’s failed pandemic responses. While he likes to tout his leadership with handling the 2014 Ebola crisis for how he would lead the country through COVID-19, many former Obama officials have said Biden was not at the center of the Ebola response. Additionally, during the 2009 H1N1 crisis, administration officials repeatedly had to walk back false or misleading statements Biden gave about the virus. There is no good reason for Joe Biden to consistently lie to the American public. Perhaps it’s more of his senior moments that prove he has no concept of reality. Or maybe it’s just a failed attempt to stay visible during this crisis. No matter the rationale, Biden continues to remind voters every day that he is unfit to be president.",1,Questionable,0.1177678423580062,0.3431362808411989,1204,2,RealClear Politics
33,Pitkin County’s incidence rate is 3rd highest in Colorado,0.0,47.67,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/pitkin-countys-incidence-rate-is-3rd-highest-in-colorado/,https://adfontesmedia.com/aspen-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-31,15,"With one of the highest COVID-19 incidence rates in the state and the viral implications of Christmas and New Year’s festivities still to come, Pitkin County’s near-future prognosis appears forbidding.“Most public health experts across the country are identifying January as the grimmest month of the pandemic,” Josh Vance, Pitkin County’s epidemiologist, said Tuesday. “There’s a lot of concern over Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year’s.“The short-term picture for the next month is not too promising.”Pitkin County’s COVID numbers for the period between Saturday to Tuesday are some of the worst of the pandemic,according to local epidemiology data. The public health department received reports of 112 new positive cases during those four days, causing the incidence rate, based on population, to hit a stratospheric high of 1,824 on Sunday.“Pitkin County now has the third-highest 14-day incidence rate in the state,” according to a Monday note on the county’s daily epidemiology report. The incidence rate was above 1,700 on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, though it dropped to 1,593 on Wednesday, according to the local data. Only Bent and Crowley counties in the southeastern corner of the state had higher incidence rates, with both topping 2,000 as of Wednesday,according to the state COVID Dial. By comparison, anything above 350 is considered above the Red level restriction threshold. The spike in Pitkin County cases also prompted the county’s positivity rate — which is based on the total number of positive tests divided by the total number of tests conducted — to hit a high of 10.9% on Friday, and remain around 10% for the following three days. Anything above 10% is considered Orange level restrictions, while 15% and above is considered Red level restrictions. The positivity rate among children in Pitkin County has increased substantially in the past week, from 7.4% on Dec. 23 to 10.9% on Tuesday, for an overall rate of 10.2% over the past two weeks, according to the local data. Pitkin County’s hospitalization rate — the third metric tracked by the state — remains comfortable, though 10 people with COVID-19 symptoms were seen at Aspen Valley Hospital on Tuesday, according to the local data. Three of four ICU beds were available as well, according to the data. Beyond the rapidly increasing numbers, the troubling development for local public health officials was that Pitkin County’s neighbors were seeing the opposite trend. Eagle County’s 14-day incidence rate, for example, was 553 as of Wednesday, while Summit County’s was 742 and Garfield County was at 1,003, according to the state’s COVID Dial.“Pitkin County continues to see an increase in cases,” Vance said. “It used to be the opposite. Now it’s flipped on its head. We are really trying to dive into why that is the case.”The answer remains elusive, he said. Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock was a bit more optimistic Wednesday that furtherrestrictions put into place by the board of health starting Dec. 22, along with atraveler affidavit program, could bring numbers down in the near future.“We really need two weeks of a data run since the last restrictions to see what impacts there are,” he said. “It’s still too early to tell.”As for the trends in neighboring counties, Peacock said that Pitkin County’s numbers have generally lagged behind those other counties by two to three weeks. He said he’s hoping the county continues to follow that trend and the numbers start falling. The one bright spot in the latest batch of COVID numbers in Pitkin County is a drop in the percentage of positive cases attributed to community spread, or those cases where the point of transmission cannot be determined, Vance said. That rate has fallen from 35% of all cases on Dec. 16 to 23% on Tuesday, according to local epidemiology data.“(That’s) the lowest since September,” Vance said. “(It means) we are identifying the (origin of) majority of cases we find.”Increased local testing, while driving up case numbers, also is identifying more asymptomatic cases, he said. Previously, patients in 97% of positive cases in Pitkin County displayed symptoms of the disease. Now, 86% report symptoms, an important drop when talking about a virus where 15% to 20% of those infected register no symptoms.“That’s sort of the one upside to this data,” he said. Beyond the travails of the next month or so, the rest of the winter and early spring is “anyone’s guess,” Vance said.“February and March could continue to be dire and challenging, some say,” he said. “While others say vaccination of health care workers (and others) will bring case counts down.”The longer-term picture brings hope, though questions remain. Vance said he hopes the vaccine will be widely available to most people by late spring or early summer, though achieving “herd immunity” is contingent on how many are vaccinated. The other main question involves how effective the vaccine is in tamping down transmission, and whether the vaccine blocks symptoms or blocks both symptoms and transmission. In other words, Vance said, if a person who received the prescribed two doses of the vaccine is later exposed to the virus, does the vaccine merely block the person from feeling the effects of the disease while allowing the person to freely transmit it? Or does it prevent both, he said.“That could lead to quarantine if the person is exposed again,” Vance said. “It’s an important question.”However, he said the public should have “great confidence in the vaccine and the protection it will provide.”Feb 4, 2024The Aspen High School boys basketball team’s home game against Steamboat Springs on Saturday was postponed due to weather and travel concerns.

But there’s a simple way to test that claim: What do these Republicans think of early in-person voting? Unlike mail ballots, which in theory could be faked in ways that in-person ballots couldn’t (though inreality,mailballotsaren’t), early voting at a polling place is essentially identical, in terms of security, to voting on Election Day. So letting people vote early and in person doesn’t make it easier to cheat. It just makes it easier to vote. Former President Donald Trump, who is leading the charge to restrict ballot access, has called on states toeliminate no-excuse early voting. In some states, such as Iowa, Republican lawmakers have moved in that direction,shortening the time windowfor casting ballots. And despite the party’s claims of innocence, polls show that there’s a big constituency in the GOP—ranging from one-third of Republicans to 60 percent or more—not just for preventing fraud, but for making it harder to cast a ballot, even if you’re a demonstrably legal voter. This spring, over several weeks, Economist/YouGov pollsrepeatedlyaskedwhether “it should be easier or harder for people to vote in American elections than it is currently.” Each time the question was asked, more respondents said it should beeasierthan said it should be harder. But Republicans disagreed. By margins of 40 to 50 percentage points, they consistently said it should beharder. Even when pollsters don’t mention the word, Republicans bristle at the idea of routine early voting. In April, when the Pew Research Center asked Americans to choose between two statements on this issue, 63 percent chose the position that “any voter should have the option to vote early or absentee without having to document a reason.” But 62 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners chose the alternative answer: that voters should be allowed to cast their ballots early only “if they have a documented reason for not voting in person on Election Day.”From the standpoint of preventing fraud, it makes no difference whether the period for early voting, whether in person or by mail, is long or short. Either way, the same risks and security measures apply. Yet Republicans want to constrict this period. In May, when a Reuters/Ipsos survey asked about “shortening the time window for early or absentee voting,” more Americans opposed that idea than supported it. But Republicans strongly supported it, 65 percent to 23 percent. In March, when a Des Moines Register poll asked about a proposal to “change the early voting period in Iowa with fewer days allowed to request and cast absentee ballots,” most Iowa voters rejected that proposal. But Republicans endorsed it, 71 percent to 24 percent. The best way to filter out concern over mail ballots—and thereby measure how many Republicans just want to limit access to voting—is to put the words “in person” in the poll question. Last month, in a Monmouth survey, 34 percent of Republicans said “in-person early voting” should be “made harder.” In the Pew poll, 36 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners opposed “making early, in-person voting available to voters for at least two weeks prior to Election Day.” In Connecticut, North Carolina, and Missouri,30 percent,39 percent, and46 percentof Republicans, respectively, expressed opposition to similar questions about “in person” voting. When polls ask about “early voting” in general, the number goes up. Last month, in a Navigator survey, 47 percent of Republican voters opposed “expanding early voting access by requiring all states to offer 15 days of early voting.” In Texas, 60 percent of Republican voters supported “prohibiting counties from offering more than 12 hours a day of early voting during the last week of early voting.” In Pennsylvania, 59 percent of Republican voters favored a proposal to “ban early voting.”Another way to measure how many Republicans want to impede voting is to ask about making Election Day a holiday. That would allow people to go to the polls instead of being stuck at their workplaces all day. Inthreerecentsurveys, 37 percent to 42 percent of Republicans opposed this idea. They did so even when the poll question specified that the purpose was to give people “time off from work to vote.”A third way to measure the make-it-harder constituency is to ask about voting at a different place, as opposed to a different time. Security-wise, it makes no difference whether you vote at one precinct or another: Your residential records could still be accessed, and you would have to present thesame ID. Nevertheless, in June, when an Economist/YouGov poll asked what should be done with ballots cast in the wrong precinct, only 40 percent of Republicans said such ballots “should be counted in the correct precinct.” Forty-four percent chose the alternative answer: “Ballots cast in the wrong precinct should be thrown out, even if cast by eligible voters.”That phrase, “even if cast by eligible voters,” says it all. For many Republicans, and by some measures most Republicans, the crackdown on ballot access goes well beyond concerns about fraud. They object to people voting early, voting at alternative polling places, or getting Election Day off from work, even if the security measures are the same. They agree with Trump that “far too many days are given to vote.” That’s not a movement for ballot integrity. It’s a movement to constrictdemocracy.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1055164319248826,0.3464621059691483,1195,2,Slate

Racial justice groups are being flooded with money. Big companies made multimillion-dollar donations.“Bad idea,” says black radio host Larry Elder in mynew video.“It is condescending… and not helpful. I urge white people to chill. Stop helping us, because you’re making things worse!”Making things worse, he says, because it supports the activists’ claim that “blacks are victims of racism. (But) if racism were in America’s DNA, Obama never could have got elected. Racism has never been more insignificant a factor in one’s success than right now.”I push back. “It must be a huge problem or there wouldn’t be all this protest!”“Well, they’re being lied to,” Elder responds. Teachers, black activists, and the media give “young people the impression that racism remains this huge problem in America when it is not.”It’s not, he says, because today any person who does three things can succeed: “Finish high school, don’t have a kid until you get married, get a job. Do those things, you will not be poor.”The biggest problem facing the black community today, says Elder, is the absence of fathers. In the 1960s, most black children were raised in two-parent households. That changed when our government’s war on poverty began. The handouts sent the message that it’s the government’s job, not your responsibility, to take care of you and your kids. “A mother with two children makes more money than she would make on minimum wage because of all the goodies she gets through the welfare state!”Now, he says, Black Lives Matter actually encourages the breakup of families. Their website does say, “disrupt the Western-prescribed, nuclear family.”That’s a Karl Marx idea straight from “The Communist Manifesto.” Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors proudly describes herself as a “trained Marxist.”Elder calls her and the anti-capitalist protesters “phonies.”“Do they really want socialism?” Elder asks. “Do they really want inferior products? They are all wearing Nike and using Apple products. They’re hypocrites.”But they’re winning!They are even redefining what racism means. Today’s “anti-racists” say racism means “any policy with an effect that is disproportionate.” So even a tax deduction is racist because on average, whites deduct more than blacks.“Anti-racism presumes things about the world that simply can’t be true,” says Kmele Foster, lead producer at Freethink. “We are all at bottom, whatever our race, individuals. Anti-racism takes that and flips it on its head.”Recently, Washington’s Museum of African American History and Culture, part of the taxpayer-funded Smithsonian Institute, posted that “white culture” means things like “nuclear family,” “self-reliance,” “rigid time schedule,” and “delayed gratification.”The poster is “despicable,” says Foster. “It’s offensive to suggest that black people can’t aspire to or possess all the values outlined in a document like this. Black people can be punctual. Black people are, in fact, successful in this country.”The poster was removed, after complaints. I wanted to ask Black Lives Matter about things like that. We contacted all 14 U. S. chapters. Not one would agree to an interview. Too bad. I wanted to ask the “anti-racists” if they notice that they and white supremacists now support similar segregationist policies, like blacks- (or whites-) only spaces. Foster points out that both white supremacists and anti-racists believe “race is an immutable attribute of who we are.”He prefers Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision: a nation where “people are judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”“Black Lives Matter leaders don’t really want the vision of MLK,” says Elder. “They want a color-coordinated society—as long as they’re the ones who do the coordinating.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.0510983827493261,0.3955884995507637,929,1,Daily Signal

39,Fencer Alen Hadzic At Olympics Despite Abuse Claims,-3.33,45.33,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/olympics-fencers-safesport-abuse,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"The US Center for SafeSport was tasked with investigating sexual abuse claims at Olympic programs. But in the first Summer Games since the agency’s creation, Team USA fencers say the system failed them. BuzzFeed News ReporterBuzzFeed News ReporterTen days afterfencer Alen Hadzic secured a spot as an alternate on the US Olympic team, a group of women took their concerns about him straight to the top. The six women fencers, including two Olympic athletes, wrote to the Olympic committee that Hadzic should not be allowed to represent the US because he was under investigation for at least three accusations of sexual misconduct reported to the US Center for SafeSport, the nonprofit agency responsible for protecting athletes from abuse. His presence at the Games, they said, was a “direct affront” to fellow athletes and put them at risk.“We are gravely concerned about the impact Mr. Hadzic’s potential presence will have on other Team USA athletes,” they wrote on May 20. Two months later, Hadzic is one of 24 Olympic fencers in Tokyo, an alternate on the men’s épée team, attaining a rarefied spot at the pinnacle of his sport, to the dismay of his teammates. Though last month SafeSport had suspended Hadzic from the international competition, the 29-year-old from Montclair,New Jersey, fought to get that prohibition lifted through an arbitration process that ultimately permitted him to participate in the Summer Games. Acknowledging the severity of the allegations facing Hadzic, USA Fencing, the athletic federation in charge of selecting the country’s Olympic competitors, created a “safety plan” to keep him away from women and out of the Olympic Village: He flew in on a separate plane from his teammates, is staying at a hotel 30 minutes away from the other athletes, and won't be allowed to practice alongside women teammates. After he appealed those conditions, the entire roster of Team USA fencers signed a letter demanding the restriction stay in place. But to many of his teammates, he shouldn’t be representing the country at all.“We are pissed off that this is even a thing we had to deal with,” an Olympic fencer who filed a complaint against Hadzic alleging predatory behavior told BuzzFeed News from Tokyo. “He’s been protected again and again.”Complaints about Hadzic’s alleged behavior were no secret in the close-knit fencing community. Interviews with 30 current and former USA fencers and officials, including three women who have formally accused Hadzic of sexual misconduct, as well as a cache of documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, show a pattern of alleged sexual misconduct and violent behavior going back to 2010 when he was a first-year student at Columbia University. The question over whether Hadzic would be allowed to compete in Tokyo fell to SafeSport, the nonprofit agency Congress put in charge of investigating misconduct in Olympic sports in 2018 following revelations that former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted scores of athletes. But though three women formally filed reports this year to SafeSport, and at least 10 others submitted statements to support their allegations, Hadzic’s ability to temporarily circumvent his suspension and make his way to the sport’s most prominent platform has left many athletes skeptical of the organization’s capacity to act decisively on allegations of sexual misconduct — and prompted a reckoning on the sexual abuse, harassment, and male entitlement that some fencers say run deep within their sport’s culture. This comes at a time when other Olympic athletes, such asSha'Carri Richardson, have been barred from competing in the Games fortesting positive for cannabis.“If this had been dealt with in the way that it should have been, he should have not even had the opportunity to try to make the Olympic team,” the fencer told BuzzFeed News before leaving for Tokyo. “And now we have to deal with the consequences of having a predator on the team while simultaneously competing in the biggest event of our lives. And I think that's a very unfair position to put us in.”Hadzic has denied allegations of sexual misconduct, tellingUSA Todaythat “they’re untruths.” His attorney, Michael Palma, told the New York Timesthat his client had never committed any acts of sexual assault. By barring him from staying in the Olympic Village, Palma said USA Fencing was preventing Hadzic “from participating in the Olympic experience that he has rightfully earned.” Hadzic's lawyers didn't respond to BuzzFeed News' requests for comment. A spokesperson for the US Center for SafeSport said they could not speak on the case, citing the center’s commitment to confidentiality. In statements, both USA Fencing and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee told BuzzFeed News that they didn’t have the power to determine Hadzic’s eligibility. USA Fencing explained that SafeSport has the “exclusive authority” in cases involving sexual misconduct, and said it does not consider unproven allegations of sexual abuse when determining who qualifies for the Olympic team. Hadzic, it said, had earned enough points in competition to earn one of the coveted spots. Hadzic (left) fences Max Heinzer of Switzerland during the individual finals at the Peter Bakonyi Men’s Épée World Cup on Feb. 8, 2020, at the Richmond Olympic Oval in Richmond, Canada. Hadzic fell into fencinga little later than other elite athletes. In his first year at Montclair High School in New Jersey, he started a band, and his drummer convinced him to sign up for the fencing team. “He said it was cool, that it was part of ‘Pirates of the Caribbean.’ So I gave it a shot,” Hadzic told theMontclair Localback in 2018. In the 12th grade, he made the US Junior and Cadet World Championship teamas a member of themen’s épée squad(épée is a type of sword), and his success garnered him a reputation. The world of fencing is small and close-knit. Fencers, even across the country, grew up together at tournaments and camps, and athletes who went to college with Hadzic remembered watching him compete and hearing about his wins as they made their way through high school. But when Hadzic started at Columbia University in 2010, his reputation evolved. He was still gregarious and outgoing, but would often exhibit streaks of aggression, according to 25 of his peers and teammates. He could “turn off and on like a light switch,” a former captain said, and at times was “very scary to be around,” especially when he was drinking. In one report to SafeSport, a former teammate said that when they were walking home from a bar, she witnessed Hadzic kick an unhoused person while he was sleeping on the ground and “then laugh about it.”Katya English, a former fencer who dated Hadzic on and off for about a year before and during their first year at college, said their last physical interaction in 2010 left her upset and shaken. During a sexual encounter in his dorm room, when she told him she wanted to stop, he berated and pressured her to continue, she recalled. Looking back at what happened to her when she was 18, she said she has “come to understand what happened to me was a form of sexual coercion.”“If I were a woman in Tokyo, I would absolutely demand security if he was going to be on the premises,” said English, who now works at the EastLos AngelesWomen’s Center supporting survivors of rape and domestic abuse. She has also submitted a report to SafeSport. During his first year at Columbia, after several fencing parties and outings at bars, a whisper network developed among women on the team and in the community spreading a warning about Hadzic: He could be a little too pushy, so don't get too close or be alone with him, especially at parties, according to 12 women who knew him at the time. Their allegations include him following them into bedrooms at parties, ignoring multiple rebuffs while trying to kiss them, and touching them without consent. It became apparent, 10 sources who fenced with Hadzic told BuzzFeed News, that he had a simple M. O.: Find the drunkest woman at the party, preferably a first-year student, and she’ll “do whatever you want,” as one former classmate described. One Columbia fencer, who is currently in Tokyo with Hadzic, said she experienced that herself in 2013. At a fencing party her first year of college, when Hadzic was in his third year, she said she was feeling nauseated from drinking and wanted to lie down when he followed her into a bedroom and “tried to take advantage” of her, she said. She brushed him off multiple times, she recalled, until someone else came into the room, allowing her to leave. The athlete reported that incident to SafeSport this May, writing in her complaint, reviewed by BuzzFeed News, that her teammate “attempted to sexually coerce me when I was in no condition to consent to anything.”As one woman athlete explained, it was common for guys in college to be flirtatious or suddenly grab them; the women were usually able to laugh and push them off. But it was different with Hadzic, she said: “He would just keep going. Like, ‘I am going to keep pursuing this.’”Later in 2013, another fencer formally accused Hadzic of sexually abusing her in a dorm room during a party. After a Title IX investigation, Columbia suspended him from campus for a year. However, according to 10 Columbia fencers interviewed for this story, Hadzic ignored the rules of his suspension and would often linger around campus and pop up at parties and hangouts. A spokesperson from Columbia University declined to answer specific questions about Hadzic, citing “federal student privacy laws,” but in a statement said the “University condemns sexual misconduct in any form.” Leading up to the Olympic Games, Columbia’s social media accounts and website have highlighted students and alumni competing for Team USA, including every fencer, but never mentioned Hadzic. While he was suspended from Columbia, Hadzic would go to other schools to party, including Penn State. Three former Penn State fencers told BuzzFeed News that they saw him at their social events several times, but had no idea he had been suspended and kicked off his university’s team. That spring, after some collegiate athletes finished competing in NCAA championships, Penn State fencers hosted a party at what was known as the “UN House,” a bustling apartment near campus. According to two fencers present at a party one night, Hadzic had bragged, while laughing, that he had sex with a younger woman there who was seen crying later that night. Someone eventually filed a report to SafeSport about the incident, according to emails obtained by BuzzFeed News, and an investigator reached out to a former student and resident of the UN House last month to discuss the complaint. The former student was surprised to learn, though, that SafeSport had not reached out to any of his friends or teammates about the incident. In an interview with the New York Times, Palma, Hadzic’s lawyer, contended that the athlete had never been officially charged with rape or any civil or criminal complaint involving sexual misconduct. The Title IX investigation, he said, was about sexual consent, and the proceedings were a “Kangaroo court.”Although Columbia had suspended Hadzic for a year and expelled him from fencing, he was still able to return and complete his degree. But his name started appearing scrawled on bathroom walls, as part of a list of men whom the university had allegedly found guilty of sexual assault but still allowed on campus, according to English, his former fencing teammate, and Emma Sulkowicz, another Columbia fencer who also led a movement that year calling attention to the experiences of sexual assault survivors by carrying around her dorm mattress to protest going to school with her alleged rapist. While he pursued his degree, he was also able to continue fencing at a national level, earning silver at a North American cup in December 2013 and competing in four other high-level tournaments the following year, according toUSA Fencing. He was known for being a “freak athlete” with a long reach and small repertoire of masterful moves, which enable him to close fast and attack opponents “before they blink,” a former Olympic fencing coach said. The lack of lasting repercussions for Hadzic, 10 women fencers said, was emblematic of how their institutions and coaches handled complaints about their male peers. Three women fencing captains told BuzzFeed News that they had complained to their coaches multiple times about Hadzic’s attitude and behavior toward them during practices.“He made my life a living hell at Columbia because he was extremely emotionally and psychologically abusive,” one woman said, recalling several instances in which she brought up her concerns to her fencing coaches, including head coach Michael Aufrichtig, who did not respond to a list of questions sent to him by BuzzFeed News. “At the time, nothing could be done. We were all so helpless in the situation because he just continues to get what he wants because he is a really fantastic fencer.”Hadzic at the Challenge SNCF Réseau 2016, a men's épée World Cup event, in the Stade Pierre de Coubertin, Paris. When Hadzic beganhis postcollegiate athletic career, the USA Fencing board of directors served as something like a “Supreme Court” for cases of misconduct and would institute bans ranging anywhere from two years to life for serious violations, such as sexual assault. Among the members of that board was Michael Aufrichtig, Hadzic’s coach at Columbia. Though Hadzic was banned from representing his university, he wasn’t banned from fencing at large. Three members who served on the board with Aufrichtig said that Hadzic’s disciplinary record was never brought to their attention.""If his case would have been brought, he probably would have been banned,"" one board member said.""It should have been promptly investigated and appropriate action taken,"" said another. ""This is very disturbing.""Aufrichtig did not respond to a request for comment for this story. After college, Hadzic took a break from fencing after falling short of making the 2016 Olympic team. He worked and studied in Belgium before deciding in 2018 to dedicate himself full-time to making the 2020 Olympic roster. By that time, the revelations of sexual assault committed by former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar had changed the way Olympic sports handle reports of abuse, taking investigations out of the hands of athletic federations incentivized to protect their stars. In 2018, Congress enacted a law giving an independent nonprofit agency, the US Center for SafeSport, sole authority to investigate claims of sexual misconduct within teams or programs affiliated with the Olympics. In May 2021, Hadzic reached a No. 4 ranking among US fencers, good enough to qualify as an alternate for the Olympics, bringing his former teammates to the realization that there was a chance he’d end up securing a spot coveted by hundreds of fencers. “Just about any aspiring fencer would sell their souls to have it,” the former Olympic coach told BuzzFeed News. When USA Fencing announced Hadzic’s selection to the teamon Instagramwith an image of him giving a thumbs-up in celebration, some of his former teammates, including former Columbia captain Katie Angen, shared and commented on the post with outrage, calling out USA Fencing for supporting a “predator.” “Disgusting,” Angen wrote, “that US fencing let’s someone who actively preys on drunk and sober women represent our country.”The governing body quickly disabled comments on its Instagram post. Angen and two other women then filed complaints against Hadzic with SafeSport. But as weeks went by and the 2021 Summer Games approached, the fencers feared the investigation was moving too slowly. On May 20, Angen and a group of Team USA fencers, including two Olympians, emailed the US Olympic Committee expressing their “deep concern” about Hadzic’s potential presence in Tokyo. A few days later, in an email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, the Olympic Committee replied that they had shared the matter with SafeSport and provided a list of available mental health services, including a subscription to the meditation app Headspace and another “app that provides athletes with a suite of online tools and courses that help athletes identify, understand, and address their mental health.”“That was their only response,” Angen said. “It was unbelievable.”On June 2, SafeSport suspended Hadzic due to the ongoing investigation, preventing him from participating in the Olympics. But after Hadzic pushed for an arbitration hearing on June 28, the arbitrator sided with him, lifting his suspension until the final investigative report was complete and allowing the fencer to go to the Tokyo Games, but not on the same flight as his teammates and under the condition that he be sequestered from other athletes throughout the Games.“I just don’t want this to be for nothing,” Angen said. “While I’m saddened that it takes his qualification for the Olympics to make this a newsworthy story, I’m hopeful that those in positions of authority will finally begin to address this as the serious and systemic issue that it is.”To many in the fencing community, Hadzic’s case is only the most high-profile example of a broader problem stemming from a sense of entitlement among many athletes and officials, and of SafeSport’s inability to police the sport.“It’s a systemic culture of rich white males,” said Essene Waters, who has spent more than a decade as a fencer and referee. In interviews, 30 fencers, coaches, and referees described a climate in which some athletes say they’ve been told to sit on a coach’s lap, have been groped in hotel elevators at tournaments, or threatened with violence if they didn’t engage in sexual acts. A woman University of North Carolina fencing coach filed a civil suit last year alleging that a male assistant coach at Penn State groped her in view of other athletes on a flight from a fencing tournament. Asurveyof women fencers conducted in 2018 found that of 218 respondents, 129 said they’d been sexually harassed by another member of the fencing community. Forty-one of those respondents said they’d been sexually assaulted by someone within the sport. Yet, the survey found, only three sexual assaults had been reported to SafeSport. Much of the hesitancy to report to SafeSport is due to what dozens of athletes described as the center’s spotty reputation in the fencing community.“The quality of the investigations do vary widely, depending on the investigator that you get,” said Lindsay Brandon, a sports attorney who has represented both those lodging and defending misconduct claims. At least five fencers who have filed complaints to SafeSport told BuzzFeed News that the agency got basic facts of their case wrong, didn’t interview key witnesses before clearing an alleged abuser of wrongdoing, or took too long to investigate abuses.“It really just feels like the organization is being protected from liability,” said one woman, a longtime fencer who complained that it took three to four years ​​for a man suspected as an abuser through fencing’s whisper network to be banned for life. “A lot of us are very frustrated because it doesn't feel like the cogs work very quickly.”“SafeSport is a joke,” said a male fencer. “I have no faith in SafeSport.”Another woman fencer said she filed a complaint after a male referee had repeatedly stalked her. One night after a tournament, he cornered her in a bar and threatened to kill her dog if she didn’t have sex with him, she said. She said that months later, the man pressured her hotel roommate into giving him a copy of their room key “to assault me.” Another person intervened before the man could harm her, she said. She reported these incidents to SafeSport in 2019, and the case wasn’t closed until earlier this year, she said. She said she was shuffled among three different investigators, yet none of her witnesses said they were contacted. She agreed to drop her claim in exchange for the man agreeing to counseling. She summarized her experience with SafeSport: “horrible.”Waters, the woman referee and épée fencer, said she filed a SafeSport complaint in January 2018 after the coach at her club asked her to sit on his lap, then started moving his hand from her hip to her breast. The investigation concluded that he didn't violate SafeSport code, but when Waters received the investigative report, she found that basic facts in it were wrong, she said. The investigator wrote that Waters left the club, in part, because she wanted to follow her boyfriend. Waters said she didn’t have a boyfriend at the time.“I couldn’t even finish reading it,” Waters said of the report. SafeSport declined to comment on specific cases, citing confidentiality policies, and didn’t respond to questions for this story. Some of SafeSport’s perceived shortcomings stem from inadequate funding, said Brandon, the attorney. In 2018, SafeSport operated on an $11 million budget, with fees collected from the governing boards of various sports, as well as grants and donations. That same year, the center received over 1,800 reports of misconduct, all to be handled by a staff of fewer than 40 employees, according to SafeSport's annual report. In 2020, a new law required the US Olympic committee to increase its contributions to $20 million — a financial boost that has helped the agency hire new investigators and staff to help manage the caseload. Meanwhile, Olympic fencing competitions begin Saturday, and on top of trying to quell their nerves and prepare for the biggest moment of their lives, four fencers told BuzzFeed News the extra stress stemming from Hadzic’s presence has been infuriating and exhausting. If a member of the men’s épée team gets injured or sick, Hadzic will take his place on the international strip, for all the world to watch.“It’s very, very disappointing for me to be on the same team as him and to be representing the United Statesof America,” the Olympic fencer who filed a SafeSport complaint against Hadzic told BuzzFeed News. “I’ve worked my entire life to get here. And to see this awful human be able to share this moment and be able to represent Team USA is just deplorable.” ●This story has been updated with additional information from sources who reached out after publication.",3,Reliable,0.0363124019983225,0.4012374909486823,4884,3,BuzzFeed News
40,What Is Joe Biden's Stance on Abortion?,-4.0,46.0,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a34205908/joe-biden-stance-on-abortion/,https://adfontesmedia.com/harpers-bazaar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,16,"The last year was a fraught one for reproductive rights, betweenrestricted abortion accessamid the coronavirus pandemic, fights forbirth control access, and potential threats toRoe v. Wade. Now, with the election of Joe Biden to the White House, the future of reproductive health and abortion rights may be pushed to the forefront of the new administration's agenda. Though his views on a woman's right to choose have evolved over the years, Bidenrecently said, ""Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right.""Here's where the president stands on abortion and what he has planned. Now in the White House, Biden is expected to overturn many Trump-era decisions, including the restrictions on abortion rights,reported. He has voiced plans to nominate federal judges who support Roe v. Wade and would ""support a federal statute legalizing abortion if the Supreme Court’s conservative majority strikes down Roe,"" according to theAP. On January 28, just a week since being sworn in to office, President Biden signed anexecutive orderthat officially repealed Trump'sglobal gag rule, which restricts health organizations around the world from receiving U. S. assistance if they perform abortions or provide information about the procedure as a form of family planning.""The best way to describe [the executive orders] is to undo the damage Trump has done,"" Biden said in the Oval Office on Thursday, perBuzzFeed News. ""The memorandum reverses my predecessor's attack on women's health access, as we continue to battle COVID-19 it's even more critical Americans have meaningful access to health care.""Biden has also previously expressed that he wants to reverse the Trump administration's domestic gag rule, which restricts providers that offer abortion referrals from receiving Title X family planning funds. In 2019, Planned Parenthoodopted outof the Title X program over complying with the rule. Earlier this year, a federal appeals courtruledthat Trump can enforce this rule, but the restriction has beenblocked in Maryland. Inhis plan for health care, Biden said that he wants to build on the progress made by the Affordable Care Act, which covers access topreventive care and contraceptives. He proposes that ""the public option will cover contraception and a woman’s constitutional right to choose.""However, since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has blocked public funding of abortion under Medicaid, except in cases of incest or rape, or if the pregnancy is a danger to the mother's life, according to theKeiser Family Foundation. It's not a federal law, but rather a rule added to the annual Congress spending bill, which is approved every year. According to his plan, Biden supports repealing the amendment. Biden made headlines for dropping his support of the Hyde Amendment last year amid criticism from his Democratic rivals in the primary race. ""If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's ZIP code,""he saidin June 2019, when he made the change. He added that he had ""no apologies"" for his previous stance. And that's not the first time Biden's stance on abortion has changed over the years—especially during his time in the Senate.pointed out, ""In 1981, he supported a constitutional amendment that would enable states to overturnRoe v. Wade. In his 2007 book,Promises to Keep,he wrote that while he is 'personally opposed to abortion,' he didn't feel he had the 'right to impose [his] view on the rest of society.'""In 2006, Biden called himself the ""odd man out"" of his party, because he did not support federal funding for abortion and voted for bans on the procedure later in pregnancy,CNN revealedin a resurfaced video last year.""I do not vote for funding for abortion,"" he said, per CNN. ""I voted against partial birth abortion—to limit it—and I vote for no restrictions on a woman's right to be able to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade. And, so I am—I made everybody angry. I made the right-to-life people angry because I won't support a constitutional amendment or limitations on a woman's right to exercise her constitutional right as defined by Roe v. Wade. And I've made the groups—the women's groups and others—very angry because I won't support public funding and I won't support partial birth abortion.""""As president, Biden will work to codify Roe v. Wade, and his Justice Department will do everything in its power to stop the rash of state laws that so blatantly violate the constitutional right to an abortion, such as so-calledTRAP laws[or targeted restrictions on abortion providers], parental notification requirements, mandatory waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements,"" Biden's plan states. The Supreme Court ruling of Roe v. Wade in 1973 made abortion legal in the United States, but states were still able to place restrictions on the procedure. At this stage,more than 20 statesare poised to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Just this year, states likeFlorida and Mississippihave implemented abortion limitations. The former vice president said that he wants to ""codify"" Roe v. Wade, as it isn't included in the Constitution. In an NBC town hall, Biden addressed the possibility of Judge Amy Coney Barrett overturning Roe v. Wade if she is confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice. ""Number one, we don’t know exactly what she will do, although expectation is that she may very well move to [overrule] Roe,"" he said. ""And the only thing, the only responsible response to that would be to pass legislation making Roe the law of the land. That’s what I would do.""The former VP made this announcement in his health care plan, citing how the Obama–Biden administration repeatedly ""fought Republican attacks"" on the organization. For example, during Obama's final months in the White House before Trump's swearing in, his administrationpassed a regulationsaying that states with federal funding for family planning can't discriminate against Planned Parenthood and providers like it. Biden said he will release guidance to keep states from blocking Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, as well as reverse Trump's domestic gag rule. The organization announced its official endorsement of Biden for president in June.""Joe Biden is the only candidate in this race who will stand up for our health and our rights,"" acting president Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement. ""He was instrumental in the creation of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded birth control with no co-pay to 63 million women, and in helping to ensure that sexual and reproductive health care was accessible across the country. He has spoken out for LGBTQ+ rights, and against the systemic racism in this country that is costing Black people their lives. Biden has committed to champion access to sexual and reproductive health care — including access to abortion — and to fight for our communities. When he left the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden had a 100% voting record from Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and has been clear he is ‘100% for sexual and reproductive health.’ And we are going to hold him to that.""Read more of Planned Parenthood's endorsement of Bidenhere. According toThe New York Times, President Trump opposes Roe v. Wade and supports the Hyde Amendment, directly countering his opponent on these issues. The president also wants to restrict access to mifepristone and misoprostol, medications that induce abortions without surgery up to 10 weeks into pregnancy. Biden doesn’t explicitly address medication abortion, but has called the general procedure an “essential health service,” per NYT. President-elect Biden also opposes—and plans to reverse—Trump’s gag rules that withhold federal funding for family planning for organizations that give abortion referrals.""As we celebrate today, we are beginning a new chapter: one where we take full control of our bodies, our rights, our democracy, and our futures,"" said Alexis McGill Johnson, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in astatement. ""The work does not end, because our fight to protect and expand health care for millions of Planned Parenthood supporters, patients, and global partners cannot let up for even a moment. Voters’ voices were loud and clear, and they elected a new president, who is fully committed to protecting access to sexual and reproductive health care—including access to abortion.""Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

Bush defeated longtime incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay in Missouri's Democratic primary on Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2020. Video by Colter Peterson,cpeterson@post-dispatch.comActivist Cori Bush on Tuesday unseated longtime U. S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, ending his 20-year hold on Missouri's 1st Congressional District and putting her on a path to become the first Black woman to represent Missouri in the nation's capital. Before Clay's tenure, his father William Clay held the seat for three decades. That makes Bush, whose campaign grew out of protests against the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014, the first to topple the Clay political dynasty in 52 years. Bush, 44, of Florissant, first challenged Clay in 2018. She returned this year with the same message — that Clay hadn't been bold enough in tackling the district's challenges — but with more campaign funds and support from progressive groups challenging establishment Democrats in a bid to pull the party left.""Tonight, Missouri's 1st District has decided that an incremental approach isn't going to work any longer,"" Bush said in a victory speech late Tuesday. ""We decided that we the people have the answers, and we will lead from the front lines.""Not me, US. Bush, who has spoken openly about being evicted and failing to pay taxes, has said her background as a single mother of two children connects her to working families in the district. She has promised to continue participating in street protests as a sitting member of Congress. In her speech Tuesday, Bush said Black Lives Matter ""are not just words. … It is historic that this year, of all the years, we're sending a Black, working-class, single mother, who's been fighting for Black lives since Ferguson, all the way to the halls of congress.""Bush’s campaign focused on universal health care, radically reforming police departments, free public education and raising the minimum wage — policies advocated by U. S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who describes himself as a democratic socialist. Bush thanked Sanders for his endorsement and support Tuesday. In their first matchup in 2018, Clay defeated Bush by more than 28,000 votes — a 20-point margin that was the closest any challenger had come to unseating Clay until Tuesday night. This year, she defeated Clay by a 3-point margin, 72,812 votes to 68,201. Bush had more than triple the campaign donations than in 2018, and more name recognition from an appearance in “Knock Down the House,” a 2019 Netflix documentary that followed Bush and three other candidates seeking to replace incumbent Democrats with progressive women, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. Her campaign was supported by Justice Democrats, which elevated Ocasio-Cortez, and more recently, former school principal Jamaal Bowman’s upset against 16-term incumbent Rep. Elliot Engel in New York. Bush's campaign sought to leverage the wins, as well as inequities highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd. Clay, long a solid vote for Democratic policies, had touted his support for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, and for impeaching President Donald Trump — all positions that put him left of other centrist Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Clay has also pointed to his role in bringing the multimillion-dollar National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency campus to north St. Louis. The winner of Tuesday's primary is expected to coast to victory in November's general election, as the district typically votes overwhelmingly Democratic. A third candidate for the Democratic nomination, Katherine Bruckner, had captured about 6.3% of the vote — 5,142 votes as of 10:30 p.m. Winnie Heartstrong and Anthony Rogers both filed for the GOP nomination but did not mount active campaigns. Rogers was on track to win Tuesday with 25-point margin. There were no intraparty competitions in Tuesday’s primary for Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District, where Democrat State Sen. Jill Schupp is challenging U. S. Rep. Ann Wagner. Libertarian Martin Schulte, of Ballwin, is also running in the Nov. 3 general election. The 2nd Congressional District includes much of St. Louis County, and parts of St. Charles and Jefferson counties. In Missouri’s 3rd Congressional District, U. S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer soundly defeated four Republican challengers in a five-way primary. Luetkemeyer, of St. Elizabeth, had captured nearly 75% of the vote. Luetkemeyer is heavily favored to win the Nov. 3 general election in the heavily Republican district against the Democratic nominee and Libertarian, Leonard Steinman, who ran unopposed in the primary. Megan Rezabek, of Imperial, defeated Dennis Oglesby, of Warrenton, for the Democratic nomination. Rezabek won with a 29-point margin. The 3rd Congressional District includes parts of St. Charles County and Jefferson County and all of Warren, Franklin and Lincoln counties.

New York and Connecticut are ending mask mandates that have been in place for much of the past year, while New Jersey is removing limits on indoor gatherings. AdvertisementNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomoannounced that his state will adopt the new federal mask and social distancing guidance for fully vaccinated people, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His statewide order requiring masks had been in place since April 2020 and required everyone over the age of 2 to wear a mask when in public. New Jersey will keep its indoor mask mandate. RelatedTexas governor says no schools, gov't entities can require masksCOVID-19 vaccination rates lower in U. S. rural areas among all groupsCDC: COVID-19 variant strains increasingly circulating in New York, Colorado""I don't want to get burned. I don't want to go back,"" New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy said Monday, according toThe New York Times. AdvertisementMurphy lifted the state's outdoor mask mandate on Monday. The CDC issued updated guidance last week that says fully vaccinated people don't need to wear masks outdoors or indoors in most cases. Private businesses can still impose their own mandates and face coverings are still required in some settings like public transit, nursing homes, homeless shelters, correctional facilities and schools. People who are not yet fully vaccinated or whose immune systems are compromised should continue to wear masks and socially distance, Cuomo said.""We have to reopen. We have to reopen smart, with a cautious eye. We have to get back to life and living and we have to do it the way New Yorkers do it. Unvaccinated people should continue to wear a mask and social distance, but if you are vaccinated you are safe -- no masks, no social distancing,"" Cuomo said, according toWNBC-TV. New York City MayorBill de Blasiohas said he will lift all coronavirus restrictions for the city on July 1. Starbucks, Target and CVS are among the companies that no longer require masks in their stores for vaccinated customers unless it is required by law. The governors of all three states had previously announced that the restrictions would be lifted on May 19. They include removing capacity restrictions at restaurants, theaters, museums, gyms and other venues. Under the new rules, businesses are only limited by the space available for customers to maintain the required social distance of 6 feet. Restaurants can separate customers by less than 6 feet if there are barriers between tables. The easing of capacity restrictions includes Broadway, but show producers say they need time to advertise and market before the grand reopening on Sept. 14. Before the end of the year, about 30 shows are planning to begin performances in Broadway theaters. Under the new rules, the indoor social gathering limit in New York will increase from 100 to 250 people and the outdoor limit of 25 people expands to 500. The indoor residential gathering limit rises from 10 to 50 people. Large-scale indoor event venues in New York can now operate at 30% capacity, up from 10%. Large-scale outdoor event venues can operate at 33%.",3,Reliable,0.1030947227375798,0.3358070500927643,735,3,UPI
44,Jan. 6 Commission Will Be DOA in Senate,20.33,21.0,https://spectator.org/jan-6-commission-senate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,23,"On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed a resolution authorizing a probe into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. All too predictably, the “National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex Act” (HR 3233) would be neither bipartisan nor independent. The Democratic chairperson of the commission would enjoy unilateral power to appoint staff and set the investigation’s parameters without meaningful consultation with the Republican co-chair. Even worse, the “compromise” that created HR 3233 wascobbled togetherby Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and John Katko (R-N. Y.), both of whomin January to impeach then-President Trump for inciting “insurrection.”Inevitably, the purpose of the commission is less about conducting a legitimate inquiry into the riot than pursuing a political vendetta against Trump. Comments by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N. Y.)confirmedthat the exercise is all about the Bad Orange Man: “Republicans in both chambers are trying to rewrite history in fealty to—or in fear of—the former president, Donald Trump.” But even Trump antagonists like GOP Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) are queasy about the commission and moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who favors an inquiry,objectsto the lopsided power arrangement associated with this probe. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) described it asfollows:House Democrats have handled this proposal in partisan bad faith going right back to the beginning. From initially offering a laughable starting point to continuing to insist on various features under the hood that are designed to centralize control over the commission’s process and its conclusions in Democratic hands.… It’s not at all clear what new facts or additional investigation yet another commission could actually lay on top of existing efforts by law enforcement and Congress. The facts have come out and they’ll continue to come out. Nonetheless, according to areportin the Hill, “Senate Democrats are moving quickly to set up a vote on the House-passed bill to create a commission investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.” Meanwhile, Chuck Schumer continued his attempt to bully GOP senators into backing the commission. “My Senate Republican colleagues must now ask themselves: Are they going to join us in pursuing the truth, or are they going to cover for Donald Trump and his big lie?” The chances that enough senators will respond positively to such ridiculous hyperbole are infinitesimal, however. In order for the Senate to pass the bill, Schumer will need the votes of at least 10 Republicans, and few will be persuaded by Schumer’s verbal abuse. Yet that is the strategy that Schumer has adopted. If he and his Democratic accomplices were really after the truth concerning the January mayhem, they would stop claiming that the Capitol was broken into and overrun by armed insurrectionists. This video, posted two days after the riot, clearly shows Capitol police opening the doors for calm protesters and standing aside to let them in. Obviously some bad actors entered the building, and that is why ancommission should be created. The Democrats have no interest in such a commission because their goal is about destroying Donald Trump. Thus, as Julie KellywritesatAmerican Greatness, they continue to stand up in Congress and repeat long-debunked lies:The dramatic rhetoric about truth and facts comes amid a rapidly disintegrating narrative related to the Capitol breach — it wasn’t “armed,” it wasn’t an “insurrection,” it didn’t result in the deaths of five people, and it wasn’t orchestrated by “domestic violent extremists”.… But the most heinous lie about January 6, by far, is the one surrounding what happened to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who passed away at the age of 42 on January 7.… Brian Sicknick did not die of anything related to the mayhem at the U. S. Capitol on January 6. This wasreportedmore than a month ago by the, quoting the medical examiner to the effect that there was no evidence that Sicknick suffered internal or external injuries and that he hadn’t suffered an allergic reaction to any chemical irritants such as pepper spray. Yet prominent Democrats and at least one Republican stood on the floor of the House Wednesday and repeated the lie. This parade of prevarication included Reps. Yvette Clarke (D-N. Y.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N. J.), Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Val Demings (D-Fla.), and the resolution’s sponsors, Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and John Katko (R-N. Y.). How can GOP senators vote for anything proposed by such profoundly dishonest people?They obviously can’t. This is unfortunate. The Jan. 6 riot clearly wasn’t an attempt to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Biden, yet there was more to the mayhem than a few rambunctious meatheads wearing goofy hats and face paint. Some of us would like to know why two Capitol police officers committed suicide shortly after the riot and who killed unarmed veteran Ashli Babbitt. Oddly, the Democrats have little interest in these mysteries and have no intention of allowing any Republican foolish enough to serve on their commission to inquire into these matters. Thus, the National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex Act will be DOA when it reaches the Senate.",0,Problematic,-0.0569867933998368,0.4313805759457933,1220,0,The American Spectator

Last Saturday Trump appeared at the North Carolina GOP convention in what was called his"" coming out"" party after being exiled to first Florida and now New Jersey after losing re-election to now-President Joe Biden.

Hewasn't. Less remarked upon was the ex-president's surprise endorsement of Rep. Ted Budd (R) for an open U. S Senate seat representing North Carolina, that led to some awkwardness for the state's GOP leadership. According to the Times, Trump's endorsement held little sway with the convention attendees who took part in a straw poll on who should get the nod for the GOP nomination.""The North Carolina Republican Party sat on the results of a straw poll that former Rep. Mark Walker won by a country mile,"" the Times' David Drucker reported. ""Walker topped Budd 44% to 29.4% in a survey to gauge who grassroots Republicans support for Senate in the 2022 primary. Former Gov. Pat McCrory finished third, with 17.5%, in voting conducted at the annual state GOP convention.""While Drucker added, ""The North Carolina Republican Party insists the results were not withheld to avoid embarrassing Trump,"" he also reported that the timing of the release of the poll results was unusual.""State party officials shared the outcome privately with the candidates. But for two days, they refused to publicize to media outlets or the public. When the North Carolina Republican Party finally acknowledged the straw poll, the tally was buried at the bottom of a newsletter detailing the highlights of the weekend-long convention and emailed out in the evening after regular business hours,"" Drucker reported. As for the GOP leadership of the state, they distanced themselves from Trump's selection, with state party chairman Michael Whatley issuing a statement reading, ""When President Trump endorsed Congressman Ted Budd for U. S. Senate, he was not speaking on behalf of the NCGOP. He made the endorsement completely independently, and the NCGOP was not aware of the endorsement prior to his speech.

By empowering private citizens to enforce cruel abortion bans that the state cannot, Texas Republicans have not only found a way to circumvent the Constitution, they have essentially given anti-abortion activists a green light to harass clinics, abortion funds, abortion advocates, and even friends and family members of abortion seekers. Like other bans on early abortion passed in Republican-led states, the unconstitutional ban will likely be challenged in the courts and blocked, but it’s the latter provision that has most worried abortion providers and abortion advocates. They expect they will likely be the target of lawsuits by anti-abortion activists seeking to make them close their doors. As the Guttmacher Institute’s Elizabeth Nash put it in a statement on the bill’s private enforcement mechanism, “By allowing anyone, anywhere to sue people involved in providing or obtaining an abortion, this ban would open the floodgates for lawsuits, bury clinics under frivolous court cases and legal fees, and make it difficult for providers to remain open.”And while the ban on early abortion can and will almost assuredly be sued, the state’s abortion providers and advocates will have to, as constitutional law professor Josh Blackmantoldthe Texas Tribune, “sit and wait to be sued” in order to challenge the private enforcement mechanism. As Blackman put it, organizations like Planned Parenthood “can’t go to court and sue Attorney General [Ken] Paxton like they usually would because he has no role in enforcing the statute.”That Abbott’s signing comes on the heels of the Supreme Court’s announcement that itwill take up an abortion case that is a direct challenge tois yet another sign that the ever-more radical and emboldened anti-abortion movement is winning, and that activists have become more honest about their end goal. And get ready for these kinds of bills to be introduced in your state. As Kamyon Conner, the executive director of the TEA Fund, a Texas abortion fund, told Jezebel in a previous interview, “If it happens here, it will happen in other places, because Texas is a place to watch when it comes to abortion access and abortion restrictions.”If there’s ever been a good time todonate to your local abortion fund, it’s now.",1,Questionable,0.0510752688172043,0.5174731182795699,537,1,Jezebel

The new government, formed after more than a year of political deadlock, replaced a caretaker administration that had quit following last year’s huge explosion in Beirut. Mikati told the Cabinet that it would take will, determination and a plan to achieve the hopes of the population.“It is true that we don’t have a magic wand. The situation is very difficult,” the billionaire-turned-politician said, according to a statement. The 24-member Cabinet’s most pressing mission during the coming weeks will be to help improve conditions in the country of six million, including a million Syrian refugees. Lebanese people hope the new administration will finally plot a path out of a crisis that has sunk the currency by some 90 percent since late 2019 and forced three-quarters of the population into poverty. Mikati pledged to work hard to resolve shortages of fuel and medicine, supplies of which have dried up as the import-dependent nation’s hard currency reserves have run out. The government will have to manage public anger and tensions resulting from the lifting of fuel subsidies by the end of the month. Western governments, including the United States and France, have welcomed the cabinet’s formation, while urging it to quickly implement reforms that international lenders have demanded before loans can flow.“We need the help of the IMF, the World Bank, regional and international funds,” President Michel Aoun, who approved the new government after months of bargaining, told the Cabinet. “What is required are urgent, decisive steps to start reforms.”Mikati has previously said resuming IMF talks would be a priority. On Friday, he said divisive politics must be put to one side and that he could not go to IMF talks if he faces opposition at home. In a boost to the government, the finance ministry said Lebanon would receive a total of $1.135bn in IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), more than the $860m that had been expected as part of an IMF general allocation. In addition to the $860m from 2021, the sum includes $275m dating from 2009, the ministry said, adding the sum would be deposited with the central bank on September 16. Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr reporting from Beirut said that Lebanon, as a shareholder in the IMF, has special drawing rights. The more than $1bn Lebanon has withdrawn is “definitely a lifeline”, but the question is how the government will spend it.“Will it continue subsidising goods, a policy which has been criticised because it has led to smuggling and importers hoarding fuel and creating a black market?” Khodr said.“Or will it use this money to support half a million families, vulnerable families who are desperately in need of $100 cash assistance every month?“The economy has collapsed. More than 80 percent of the population is poor. The currency has collapsed. There are a lot of challenges ahead. But that $1bn – of course it will help – but that is a short term solution. What this government needs to come up with is a sustainable path to recovery,” Khodr said. Information Minister George Kordahi told reporters after the meeting that Prime Minister Najib Mikati plans to hold intense Cabinet meetings to work on improving matters that “have direct effects on citizens”. Kordahi quoted Mikati as saying during the meeting that “people are looking for actions and are not concerned anymore about talks and promises.”IMF talks broke down last year with politicians and banks disputing the scale of vast losses mapped out by a government financial recovery plan which the Fund endorsed. Aoun urged the government to include that financial recovery plan in its policy programme, as well as reforms set out by a French plan last year. The previous government failed to implement structural reforms which donors have been urging for years, including measures to address state corruption and waste at the root of the crisis.",3,Reliable,-0.0137351537351537,0.4226329226329227,927,3,Al Jazeera

That’s a great thing for the economy andanyone who wants a raise or new job. But then the COVID-19 pandemic came to America and that all changed. Fast. After hitting a new high in April, the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% in August. Finally lower than it was at the height of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, but definitely not ideal. Here’s what a high unemployment rate can mean for your wallet. When a lot of people are out of work, competition heats up for available roles. Which may be few and far between in some industries. Psst...here’s howto make sure your application stands out. High unemployment often goes hand in hand witheconomic downturns. When the economy’s bad, people generally spend less money. That hurts businesses...that probably won’t be in a hurry to hand out more money to employees. You can still ask. Just be prepared to hear “not now.”During really tough times – like now – the government could get more generous with things like direct payments (hi, $1,200 stimulus checks) and unemployment benefits.

54,Kamala Harris launched political career with $120K 'patronage' job from boyfriend Willie Brown,11.33,44.67,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/kamala-harris-launched-political-career-with-120k-patronage-job-from-boyfriend-willie-brown,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2019-06-01,25,"Kamala Harris’ first significant political role was an appointment by her powerful then-boyfriend Willie Brown, three decades her senior, to a California medical board that has been criticized as a landing spot for patronage jobs and kickbacks. Then 30, Harris was dating 60-year-old Willie Brown, at the time the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly, when he placed her on the California Medical Assistance Commission in 1994. The position paid over $70,000 per year, $120,700 in current money, and Harris served on the board until 1998. The medical commission met twice a month, and Harris, a United States senator for California since 2017 and now a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, missed about 20% of the meetings each year, according to commission records obtained by the Washington Examiner. The seven-member board was largely comprised of late-career former state officials who were semi-retired or biding time before retirement. At 30 years old, Harris was the youngest appointee by some three decades. Harris, now 54, and Brown, now 85, started dating in the spring of 1994, showing up arm-in-arm at numerous high-profile functions, including Brown’s lavish parties and celebrity galas. He has been separated but not divorced from his wife Blanche Vitero since the 1980s and has maintained a string of girlfriends over the years. That June of 1994, Harris took a leave of absence from her job as a deputy prosecutor at the district attorney’s office in Alameda County, where she had worked for four years after graduating from law school. Brown appointed Harris to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, a position that paid $97,000 annually, which would be $167,000 in 2019. Five months later, Harris resigned from the insurance board, and Brown immediately appointed her to the California Medical Assistance Commission. Brown, in a letter to Harris, wrote that he was “pleased to appoint” her to the board, which oversaw the payment of insurance providers for state-subsidized MediCal recipients. “I am confident that your knowledge and experience will contribute significantly to the important work of the Commission,” he wrote. Harris had no medical background, according to a copy of her resume that she submitted to Brown at the time. Her experience consisted of four years as a deputy prosecutor, a handful of summer jobs and internships, and a volunteer position at a hospital fundraising group. According to state records of the time, members of the committee had to be “selected from persons with experience in management of hospital services, risk management insurance or prepaid health programs, the delivery of health services, the management of county health systems, and a representative of recipients of service.”Brown’s decision to appoint Harris raised eyebrows in political circles. “Both boards are reserved for political payback or occasionally for personal rewards for personal service,” said Brett Granlund, a former California Republican state assemblyman who worked closely with the commission while Harris was on the board. “The boards are considered plumb appointments as they require no work, no policy credentials, and are paid the equivalent of a full-time [state] senator for arriving at a one- to two-hour meeting each month.”Granlund said the appointment seemed brazen at the time because of the relationship between Harris and Brown. “Screwing the speaker has its rewards,” he said. “Stevie Wonder could have seen through that play.”However, Sandra Smoley, a registered nurse who served on the California Medical Assistance Commission from 1999 to 2004, said many of the appointees did not have medical backgrounds and there were no criteria governing appointments.“I had a health background, but [the commission] wasn’t necessarily health related,” she said. Smoley said the commission was primarily run by nonappointed staff members who worked full time out of an office and handled all of the negotiations with hospitals. Although the medical commission has since been disbanded, Smoley said the board did important work at the time. Its role was oversight. “I think the work of the Commission was highly positive,” she said. “The work that we did was necessary, and I do think it did effect access to care for MediCal recipients and also cost containment of hospital rates.”Brown recently acknowledged in an op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle that he “may have influenced” Harris’s career. “Yes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker,” he wrote. He noted that he had helped other politicians throughout his career, and said Harris was the “only one, who after I helped her, sent word that I would be indicted if I ‘so much as jaywalked’ while she was D. A.” He added: “That’s politics for ya.”Brown was one of the most powerful politicians in California when he and Harris began their relationship. He was a member of the California State Assembly for three decades, half of that time as its speaker, and later went on to serve as mayor of San Francisco. A charismatic and shrewd politician, Brown was also known for his slew of attractive girlfriends and apparent inability to stay with one woman for very long. Although he faced several allegations of pay-to-play and corruption while he was speaker and mayor, multiple FBI investigations turned up empty and he was never indicted. Harris was first described as the “speaker’s new steady” in a column written by the late San Francisco gossip columnist Herb Caen, a close friend of Brown’s, in March 1994. Photos from the time, obtained from Brown’s personal archives in San Francisco, show the couple cozying up and dancing at parties, including Brown’s birthday and his annual fete known as “The Reunion.”According to Caen’s columns, friends of the couple were hopeful that Harris could convince Brown to finally settle down. To their surprise, the two broke up shortly after Brown was elected mayor of San Francisco.“This news came as a shock to many, including those who found Kamala Harris attractive, intelligent and charming,” wrote Caen on Dec. 26, 1995. “Also flabbergasted: the brain-trusters who found Kamala the perfect antidote to whatever playboy tendencies still reside in the mayor-elect’s jaunty persona.”The breakup reportedly happened shortly after Brown met 32-year-old San Francisco socialite Carolyn Carpeneti, a woman with whom he would later have a daughter. While the two were dating, Carpeneti was paid $2.33 million for campaign work from a network of nonprofit groups and committees run by Brown and his associates,accordingto the San Francisco Chronicle.“If this doesn’t cross the line, it comes awfully close,” Jim Knox, executive director of California Common Cause, told the San Francisco Chronicle at the time. “At the very least it seems questionable for [Carpeneti] to have free use of a public resource in her role as private campaign consultant.”That wasn’t the last time Brown would face scrutiny for steering benefits to women he was dating. In the 1980s, he reportedly hired his girlfriend Wendy Linka as a fundraiser, and she was later hired as a marketing director for city commissions after Brown became mayor. Brown also continued to aid Harris’s political career after their split, supporting her successful 2003 campaign for district attorney. But publicly, Harris attempted to distance herself from the San Francisco mayor. ShecalledBrown an “albatross hanging around my neck” in a 2003 San Francisco Weekly profile, which reported that the “mere mention of their former liaison makes her shoulders tense, her hands clench, and her eyes narrow.” Harris said: “His career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing … Willie Brown is not going to be around. He’s gone — hello people, move on.”Brown recently joked to the Washington Examinerthat if Harris wins the presidential election he would have to “leave the country.”Harris’ campaign did not respond to requests to comment.",3,Reliable,0.105940578141665,0.4103165976535542,1706,2,Washington Examiner

A Biden administration source revealed to Fox News on Saturday that the very public callout of Facebook followed months of frustration with the platform for failing to stamp out ""dangerous"" information about the vaccinations that have spread online. The White House has been seeking help from Facebook and other social media sites since February on stopping misinformation from going viral, such as the myth that getting the shot will cause infertility. While Facebook has made positive public statements on how they've partnered with the government and taken aggressive action to curb vaccine misinformation, the White House believes that the Big Tech company has fallen short.""They’ve been withholding information on what the rules are, what they have put in place to prevent dangerous misinformation from spreading [and] how they measure whether it’s working,"" a Biden administration official told Fox News. The tensions reached a boiling point amid the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, vaccine hesitancy among young people and polls showing the majority of unvaccinated people believe myths about the vaccine. As coronavirus cases are on the rise and vaccination rates have slowed in the United States, the White House launched this week an effort to crack down on misinformation, starting with a warning from U. S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy on Thursday that bogus information about coronavirus is an ""urgent threat"" to public health. The Surgeon General's office issued a new report titled, ""Confronting Health Misinformation,"" that makes recommendations for social media platforms to ""impose clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies.""White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also announced Thursday that the Biden administration has been ""flagging"" content for Facebook to remove.""We're flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation. We're working with doctors and medical experts…who are popular with their audience with accurate information,"" she said. ""So, we're helping get trusted content out there.""Biden took the effort one step further Friday by claiming inaction by Facebook and other platforms to take down false information is costing people their lives to a preventable illness.""The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and they’re killing people,"" Biden said. The White House comments drew a quick rebuke from Facebook.""The White House is looking for scapegoats for missing their vaccine goals,"" a Facebook spokesperson told NBC's Dylan Beyers. And while the White House is having a public spat with the Big Tech giant, some Republicans and critics are accusing the White House of being too cozy with Facebook in their efforts to take down posts they deem as problematic.""Democrats are all about the First Amendment except when they don’t like what’s being said,"" Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, told Fox News Saturday.

56,"Israel’s Military, Made in the USA",-16.33,39.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/world/israel-military-united-states/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,25,"Israel’s latest attack on Gaza—with a death toll of over 200 Palestinians so far, including more than 60 children—has once again raised the question of the US role in enabling Israeli killings of civilians. But while it is well-known that the United States is a major aid supplier to Israel, the degree to which the Israeli military relies on US planes, bombs, and missiles is not fully appreciated. According to statistics compiled by the Center for International Policy’s Security Assistance Monitor, the United States has provided Israel with $63 billion in security aid over the past two decades, over 90 percent of it from the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, a grant program that provides funds to buy US weaponry. But US support of the Israeli state goes back much further—total US military and economic aid to Israel exceeds $236 billion (in inflation-adjusted, 2018 dollars) since its founding—nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars. Not only has US financial support helped Israel outfit its military, but it has been used to subsidize Israel’s development of its own military industry, which produces, among other things, armed drones that have been used for attacks on targets in Gaza. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is a case in point. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Israel has 324 fighter and ground attack aircraft, all of US origin: 83 Boeing F-15s, 224 Lockheed Martin F-16s, and 16 Lockheed Martin F-35s. So, if someone asks whether US-supplied planes have been involved in bombing Gaza, it doesn’t require a research project to answer with an emphatic yes. Israel also possesses US attack helicopters, transport planes, precision-guided bombs, and air-to-surface missiles. And US aid powers the IAF, providing billions of dollars’ worth of fuel under the government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Despite Israeli conduct, the aid spigot remains wide open. Israel is in the third year of a 10-year, $38 billion aid memorandum of understanding negotiated under the Obama-Biden administration. The United States does not make any comparable written agreement regarding a decade-long future financial commitment for foreign or domestic appropriations. And earlier this month, on May 5, Congress was notified of a planned $735 million deal for precision-guided bombs destined for Israel. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N. Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) have introduced a resolution of disapproval to try to stop the sale, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has introduced a parallel measure in the Senate, the first time such a step has been taken with respect to an arms transfer to Israel. From its bombing of Beirut during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon to December 2008’s Operation Cast Lead, which resulted in the deaths of at least 1,383 Palestinians in Gaza, including 333 children, Israeli has largely escaped consequences for its misuse of US weaponry to harm and kill civilians on a large scale. That may be changing. The recent general strike by millions of Palestinians that was reinforced by large demonstrations across the United States is just the latest manifestation of years of organizing by Palestinians and their allies to change US policy towards Israel. Organizations like the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Adalah Justice Project, who have long been calling for a cutoff of US military aid to Israel, have been joined by allies throughout the broader US progressive movement, including the Movement for Black Lives, which has stated, “The fight for Palestinian rights and dignity is integral to the fight for human rights everywhere” and demanded that “the US divest the $3.8 billion of public dollars that goes to Israel in military funding each year.” Human Rights Watch recently released a groundbreaking report that asserted that some of Israel’s actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories led to “deprivations [that] are so severe that they amount to crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.” And last month, the prominent centrist think tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace issued a report calling for a “rights-based approach” to US policy on Israel/Palestine that “would prioritize protecting the rights and human security of Palestinians and Israelis.” The political landscape in Congress is beginning to change as well. There’s still plenty of uncritical support for Israel on Capitol Hill, but the ground is shifting. One used to have to look far and wide for vocal support for Palestinian rights in the House or Senate, but on May 14 a group of House members—including Democratic Representatives Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pocan, Cori Bush, and Ayanna Pressley—took to the floor of the chamber to make a plea for the Biden administration to recognize the basic humanity of the Palestinians and to press harder for Israel to stop the killing. In a searing speech, Tlaib said, “We can’t have an honest conversation about American military support for the Israeli government without acknowledging that for Palestinians the catastrophe of displacement and dehumanization has been ongoing in their homeland since 1948.… We must condition aid to Israel on compliance with international human rights and end the apartheid.” And Senator Sanders took to the pages of The New York Times to call for “an evenhanded approach, one that upholds and strengthens international law regarding the protection of civilians, as well as existing U. S. law holding that the provision of U. S. military aid must not enable human rights abuses.” Even enforcing existing US human rights laws with respect to Israel’s use of US weaponry could go a long way toward ending impunity in the use of US armaments. Perhaps the greatest sign of progress in Congress comes from the new bill by Representative Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), which prohibits the use of US funds to enable violations of international and human rights law. The bill, which has 18 cosponsors, will face an uphill battle in Congress, but hills are made for climbing, and as public pressure for accountability over Israel’s use of military aid grows, so will support for the legislation. In McCollum’s words, “Now is the time to send a clear message to the Israeli government: Not one dollar more of U. S. military aid can be used to demolish Palestinian homes, annex Palestinian lands, and torture or kill Palestinian children.” As of late yesterday, the Israeli government and Hamas had announced a mutual cease-fire in Gaza, a goal the Biden administration had pressed in private conversations with Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. Hopefully the cease-fire will hold, but it is far from the only issue raised by the US arming of the Israeli military. On the whole, the Biden administration has been far too quiet in the face of ongoing Israeli atrocities. It should use the leverage provided by US aid to Israel to press forcefully for an end to the repression throughout Israel and the occupied territories, and to hold the Israeli government accountable for what Amnesty International has suggested may be war crimes committed in Gaza.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0449610624882363,0.3062841144362884,1511,2,The Nation

Anadolu Agency/Getty ImageIf you search for “Federal Reserve” on YouTube, one of the first videos to surface is titled “Century of Enslavement.” Using archival footage and the kind of authoritative male voice heard in countless historical documentaries, the 90-minute video espouses the idea the Federal Reserve was formed in secret by powerful, often Jewish, banking families in the early 20th century, causing America to spiral into debt. With over 1.6 million views, the video is categorized as “News and Politics.” It was created by a channel called the Corbett Report, which also boasts documentaries touting conspiracy theories, including that 9/11 was staged by the US government and that global warming is a hoax. Watching the video quickly leads users down a rabbit hole of “recommended videos” that detail Illuminati conspiracy theories and blame Israel for 9/11. The incendiary Federal Reserve video, flagged by MSNBC hostChris Hayesearlier this month, is just one of many examples of how political extremists have mastered YouTube’s algorithms and monetization structure to spread toxic ideas ranging from conspiracy theories to white supremacy. The video “Why Social Justice is CANCER,” for instance, appears after searching for “social justice.”According to a new report entitled “Alternative Influence: Broadcasting the Reactionary Right on YouTube,” researcher Becca Lewis details how the site has also become home for live-streamed, difficult-to-moderate debates on topics such as “scientific racism,” where the two sides typically seem to reach agreement with no alternative position discussed. Over 10,000 active viewers watched a four-hour January debate between several YouTube creators, including white nationalist Richard Spencer and his opponent, Carl Benjamin, a commentator who criticizes identity politics and goes by the name Sargon of Akkad. “Spencer has had years of experience arguing his racial theories and spoke with more confidence than Benjamin,” Lewis writes in the new report characterizing YouTube as a largely uncritical platform for racist ideology. Benjamin asserts that his position in the debate did not advance any white nationalist or racist theories.*YouTube’s parent company, Google, had a limited presence duringJuly’s Congressional hearingson social media’s role in propagating misinformation and political bias, while Facebook and Twitter were the primary targets. But YouTube as an individual company has managed to avoid much scrutiny. With nearly 2 billion unique users a month, the platform is used by 94 percent of 18-24 year olds regularly, and one in five members of this group go to YouTube first to get their news, according to the Pew Research Center. With such a large audience and little oversight, many political extremists have turned to YouTube to spread their views and make money doing it. In thereport, released todayby tech instituteData and Society, Lewis examines how political extremists have created a deeply connected “alternative influencer network” on YouTube. They have used collaborations, like staged debates, to tie together users who promote a range of political positions, some of which are extremist. YouTube posters like “Roaming Millennial” co-opt language from the left to try to radicalize viewers. YouTubeLewis, who is a doctoral candidate in communications at Stanford University, spent a year analyzing more than 80 YouTube channels that connected users with positions ranging from mainstream liberalism to white supremacy. She found that YouTube hasn’t just provided a platform for ideas formerly relegated to anonymous internet forums like 4chan—it’s helped monetize them. Through YouTube’s network, content from so-called “dark web intellectuals”—like anti-feminist psychology professorJordan Peterson—quick leads users to more radical ideologues, like white nationalist Richard Spencer, who broadcast what Lewis describes as “extremely harmful—in many cases, racist and sexist—content.” Content creators adopt the position of being marginalized cultural underdogs while reaching an audience of millions. By appearing on each other’s channels and collaborating on staged debates, these alternative content creators have created an intricate network that makes political extremism easily accessible on YouTube.spoke to Lewis about her report and how YouTube has become a breeding ground for political extremism. It seems YouTube gets much less attention than Facebook and Twitter when we talk about political extremism and misinformation. Why is that?We’ve gotten a really clear picture of the type of fake news that disseminates on Facebook [when it’s]created by Macedonian teenagers. We’ve gotten a really clear idea of what can happen when Donald Trump retweets a tweet that originated from an anti-Semitic meme on an anonymous forum. We don’t have as clear a picture of what’s happening on YouTube and Google. It is important to bring to the fore some illustrations of the problems that do exist on these platforms. I’m trying to show there are fundamental issues we need to be addressing with YouTube in the same way we have recognized fundamental issues with Facebook and Twitter. YouTube is also one of the only platforms that offers financial incentives to creators through its Partner Program, which allows them to make money off ads on their videos. Can you explain how this incentivizes more extreme behavior?One of the troubling implications of the report is that these issues can’t be fixed with a simple tweak here or there because they are built into the monetization structure of YouTube. One thing that makes YouTube so appealing to influencers and viewers alike is the fact that viewers can interact directly with the people making content and have a more intimate relationship than viewers or readers have with mainstream news outlets. At the same time, an influencer who is making content, in most cases, is also trying to make money off it. So when they have viewers whoare telling them to keep making more and more extremist content, they have a direct financial incentive to do so. It speaks to the larger culture of metrics in newsrooms and the emergence of clickbait, but it’s particularly pronounced in a very specific way on YouTube. And I think you see people going down these [ideological] paths they might not otherwise because they’re financially incentivized to do so. One way these posters define themselves is by saying they are underdogs who are being attacked by mainstream society. Do you have any thoughts on how to de-platform or de-monetize these creators if they just turn around and point to those efforts as examples of the very discrimination they can use to bolster their claims?That’s a fundamental question that has been plaguing academics and tech firms alike. My interpretation is that the framing of social underdog paranoia thrives when content moderation and platforming happens inconsistently and without a clear explanation. And the fact is that if [extremists] were being consistently de-platformed, they wouldn’t be able to make content about it. Someone who has talked a lot about censorship is Paul Joseph Watson, an influencer on YouTube who is affiliated with. Most recently, after Alex Jones was removed from YouTube, Watson made a video called “(((Censored))),” which signals anti-Semitic themes while discussing alleged conservative bias on social media platforms. But at the same time, he has over 1 million followers, 1 million subscribers on YouTube. And as part of the YouTube Partner Program, he has received a plaque from YouTube for influencers who passed 1 million followers. So here he is able to provide that narrative of censorship while getting influencer treatment from the platform. There’s been a lot of discussion in Congress about how to best regulate social media platforms. Do you have any thoughts on what actions should be taken by either tech companies or lawmakers to rein in this problem?Up until now these platforms have largely been given carte blanche; they have evaded regulation to a large extent. So even the shifting nature of the conversation, the fact these platforms are now facing pressure externally, is a promising sign. Even though you could debate how much actually came out of the congressional hearings, I think it’s a promising sign that they have started. In terms of talking about solutions, we need to be approaching these problems from multiple tracks. I absolutely think reassessing the algorithms [that surface extremist content] is one step that needs to be taken. Assessing what government regulation options are available is absolutely worthwhile, and then thinking about how YouTube monetization structures incentivize certain behaviors is something that needs to be done. It needs to be a multi-pronged solution.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1223014963561181,0.3394466294676379,1804,2,Mother Jones
58,This Could Be the Moment to Help the Poorest Among Us: Our Nation's Children (Opinion),-14.33,34.67,https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-this-could-be-the-moment-to-help-the-poorest-among-us-our-nations-children/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,25,"Across our nation, getting to a place where every child has the opportunity to thrive requires work both inside and outside of schools with whole communities involved. In the wealthiest nation on earth, it seems ridiculous to have to make the case that—in order for children to learn—they need access to nutritious food, good quality health care, safe and secure housing, clean water and air, and the kinds of policies that support their families’ economic viability. But, given that our country has allowed widespread childhood poverty to persist—children remain thepoorestage group in America—and given the lack of leadership we’ve seen on these issues at the federal level during the Trump administration, we do have to make that case. To be sure, our nation needs a new, bold social compact to support the well-being of our children, particularly the most vulnerable. This new compact will require federal action. It will require new investments in “people power.” And it will require the support and expansion of collaborative action in local communities. Schools cannot do all this work alone. In terms of federal action, national leaders who are talking about equity and social justice should seize this moment of heightened public consciousness to drive significant policy changes that can eliminate food insecurity; assure increased access to high-quality health and mental-health services amid a pandemic; and expand the supply of stable, affordable housing across America. We’re encouraged to see President Joe Biden’s recentexecutive actionthat helps working families keep a roof over their heads, increase Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for as many as 12 million Americans, and expand the program that provides low-income families food dollars equivalent to the value of school meals that are no longer available because of COVID-19 school closures. On February 27, the House of Representatives passed the American Rescue Plan, sending the $1.9 trillion stimulus package to the Senate. We hope that the Biden administration will take additional federal action to ensure that part ofthe bill’s proposed $130 billion fund for K-12 schoolsdirectly supports state and local efforts to create and expand community schools. We know that community schools offer families a one-stop hub for vital connections to health and social services that help children get what they need to succeed. A new social compact for our kids also requires investments in those professionals who can nurture healthy childhood development, putting caring, expert adults to work in service of our children in innovative ways. For example, every child should be assigned an “adult navigator” to connect them and their families with supports and opportunities inside and outside the school system. This work is starting to happen in Nashville, Tenn., where the public schools now guarantee that every child will have an adult navigator. This could and should happen everywhere. We also need to support and advocate legislation in states, like the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, which allocates substantial resources to place a community schools coordinator and a health-services practitioner in schools that are serving 55 percent or more students living in poverty. Similarly, we need a federal commitment to invest in people power to overcome the challenges children are facing with learning that has been interrupted as a result of COVID-19. We believe America needs a national tutoring corps, which could be created through a dramatic expansion of national service. We are heartened that just such an effort wasproposedlast year by Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and a bipartisan coalition. Congress should pass this proposal immediately. Doing so would provide both the people and the urgency necessary not only for children to recover and accelerate their learning amid the pandemic but also to transform our education system so that it more equitably serves students of color and students from low-income backgrounds. Having dedicated tutors would provide the right pathway to link students back to their schoolwork, to keep families at the center of the education process, and to connect children to needed supports and opportunities. Finally, we need to create opportunities for collaborative action in local communities. Children’s cabinets,collaborative coalitions of government agencies, and community representatives devoted to the shared goal of child well-being, represent outstanding local- and state-level examples of this work. These cabinets, now in place in dozens of cities, larger metropolitan regions, and some rural areas, help community-based leaders, nonprofits, and government agencies coordinate and communicate policies, funding, and services to close significant gaps in support. And they also offer ideal opportunities for business leaders to step up and begin to make progress for the children in their communities. These and other strategies are urgently needed if we want to expand opportunity to all our nation’s children, grow our economy, strengthen our communities, and preserve our democracy. This is the crusade for equity and social justice to which many recently have offered tribute and for which we need decisive action now. Let’s all get to work.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1511205461205461,0.3828377178377178,1035,3,Education Week

This is in spite of the fact that the Feds at the SDNY are sitting on an already fleshed-out and widely-documented criminal case against “Individual-1” Trump for campaign finance fraud. It’s not clear if the Feds are merely waiting until New York State is done indicting Trump (prosecutors often go one at a time), or if the Feds don’t intend to criminally pursue Trump at all. But over the past week we’ve all learned that Trump had his DOJ illegally spying on the personal data of House Democrats and his own White House Counsel, and that Trump illegally pressured then-Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to try to overthrow the 2020 election results. At this point the Feds hadbetterbe planning to criminally prosecute Trump for these crimes. Richard Signorelli, former Assistant U. S. Attorney at the SDNY, tweeted this today: “There is no criminal being prosecuted by The Justice Department including @SDNY who has done more harm to this country than Donald Trump. If that is not a good reason to throw the book at Trump, I don’t know what is.”Signorelli is absolutely right. Trump is on a path to state prison for his financial crimes, and he’s under criminal investigation in Georgia for election fraud, but that’s not enough. He must be federally prosecuted for his crimes in office. It’s worth pointing out that the Feds at the SDNY are known to be aggressively criminally targeting Rudy Giuliani, having recently raided his home and seized his communications. That criminal probe has reportedly expanded to include Giuliani’s role in the Trump-Ukraine scandal, giving some hope that the Giuliani case is a pretext for a Trump federal criminal probe.

63,How Mitch McConnell killed the US Capitol attack commission,-11.0,41.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/29/mitch-mcconnell-us-capitol-attack-commission-senate-republicans,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"Days before the Senate voted down the creation of a 9/11-style commission to investigate the Capitol attack, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, was adamant: he would oppose the bill, regardless of any amendments – and he expected his colleagues to follow suit. The commission that would have likely found Donald Trump and someRepublicansresponsible for the insurrection posed an existential threat to the GOP ahead of the midterms, he said, and would complicate efforts to regain the majority in Congress. McConnell’s sharp warning at a closed-door meeting had the desired effect on Friday, when Senate Republicans largely opted to stick with the Senate minority leader. All but six of them voted to block the commission and prevent a full accounting into the events of 6 January. But it also underscored the alarm that gripped McConnell and Senate Republican leadership in the fraught political moments leading up to the vote, and how they exploited fears within the GOP of crossing a mercurial former president to galvanize opposition to the commission. The story of how Republicans undermined an inquiry into one of the darkest days for American democracy – five people died as a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and sought to hang Mike Pence – is informed by eight House and Senate aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Surrounded by shards of broken glass in the Capitol on the night of 6 January, and as HouseDemocratsdrew up draft articles of impeachment against Trump, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, made her first outreach to canvas the prospect of a commission to investigate the attack. In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, Pelosi had reason to be hopeful. Spurred on by the threat felt by many Republicans to their personal safety, a swelling group of lawmakers had started to agitate for an inquiry to reveal how Trump did nothing to stop the riot. But what was once heralded as a necessary step to “investigate and report” on the attack and interference in election proceedings unravelled soon after, with the commission swiftly reduced to an acrimonious point of partisan contention in a deeply divided Capitol. The main objection from House and Senate Republicans, at first, centered on the lopsided structure of Pelosi’s initial proposal, that would have seen a majority of members appointed by Democrats, who would have also held unilateral subpoena power. And only weeks after the riot, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, was already advancing the complaint for his ultimate opposition: that the scope of the commission did not include unrelated far-left violence from last summer, a political priority that stalled talks. With little progress three months after the Capitol attack, Pelosi made a renewed effort to establish a commission on 16 April, floating a revised proposal that mirrored the original 9/11 commission with the panel evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Pelosi briefed her leadership team that included the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, the assistant speaker, Katherine Clark, and notably, the chair of the House homeland security committee, Bennie Thompson, about the proposal the following Monday. During that meeting, Hoyer first raised the prospect of also extending equal subpoena power to Republicans – a concession that would allow Democrats to meet all of Republicans’ demands about the structure of the commission – which Pelosi adopted a few days later. By the penultimate week of April, Pelosi had deputized Thompson to lead talks as she felt the homeland security committee was an appropriate venue, and because the top Republican on the committee, John Katko, was one of only 10 House GOP members to vote to impeach Trump. With the House on recess, Thompson made enough progress in negotiations to brief Pelosi and her leadership team on 8 May that he secured a tentative deal on the commission, though Katko wanted to wait on an announcement until Liz Cheney was ousted as GOP conference chair. Tensions within the House Republican conference had reached new highs the previous week after Cheney continued her months-long criticism of Trump’s lies about a stolen election at a party retreat in Florida, and Katko was wary of injecting the commission into the charged moment.“As soon as the vote on Liz Cheney is taken, he will be prepared to do a joint statement,” Thompson said in remarks first reported by CNN. Minutes after House Republicans elevated Elise Stefanik to become the new GOP conference chair on 14 May, Thompson and Katko unveiled their proposal for a bipartisan 9/11-style commission. The ouster of Cheney solidified Trump’s outsize influence on the Republican party, and set the scene for the weeks to come. McCarthy almost immediately sought to distance himself from the commission and was non-committal about offering his endorsement. Asked whether he had signed off on the deal, McCarthy was direct: “No, no, no,” he told reporters in the basement of the Capitol. By the following Tuesday, top House Republicans were urging their colleagues to oppose the commission bill, with McCarthy positioned against an inquiry on the basis that its scope focused narrowly on the Capitol attack. As Hoyer had anticipated when he suggested that Pelosi also offer equal subpoena power to Republicans, McCarthy struggled to demonize the commission, and several House Republicans told the Guardian that they found his complaints about the scope unconvincing. The Senate minority leader, meanwhile, had until then denounced Trump, who he faulted for inciting the insurrection, and publicly seemed open to a commission. But as it became clear the scores of House Republicans would vote for the bill, his calculus quickly changed. Two days after the Senate returned for votes on 17 May McConnell informed Senate Republicans at a private breakfast event that he was opposed to the commission as envisioned by the House, and made clear that he would embark on a concerted campaign to sink the bill. Underpinning McConnell’s alarm was the fact that Democrats needed 10 Senate Republicans to vote in favor of the commission, and seven had already voted to impeach Trump during his second Senate trial – a far more controversial vote than supporting an inquiry into 6 January. Cognizant that Senate Democrats may find three or four more allies in uncertain Republicans, McConnell cracked down. After announcing at the breakfast event that he would oppose the commission, McConnell railed against the bill as being “slanted and unbalanced” on the Senate floor, in biting remarks that represented a clear warning as to his expectations. He kept up the pressure all afternoon on that Wednesday, so that by the evening, McConnell had a major victory when Senator Richard Burr, who voted to impeach Trump only four months before, abruptly reversed course to say that he would reject the commission. In the end, only six Senate Republicans – Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Bill Cassidy, Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski and Ben Sasse – voted to move forward on the commission. As the final vote hurtled towards its expected finale, the Senate minority whip, John Thune, who also switched his position to side with McConnell, acknowledged McConnell’s arguments about a commission jeopardising Republican chances to retake majorities in the House and Senate. Summarising his concerns, Thune said: “Anything that gets us rehashing the 2020 elections I think is a day lost on being able to draw a contrast between us and the Democrats’ very radical leftwing agenda.”This article was amended on 31 May 2021. John Katko was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, not one of three as stated in an earlier version.",3,Reliable,0.0716560445727112,0.4502144460477792,1625,3,The Guardian
64,Derek Chauvin Convicted on all Charges in Death of George Floyd,1.0,46.33,https://www.voanews.com/usa/derek-chauvin-convicted-all-charges-death-george-floyd,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,24,"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of all charges Tuesday in the death of George Floyd nearly a year ago. Chauvin had been charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. After hearing closing arguments Monday, the 12-member jury – comprising six white people and six people who are Black or multiracial -- spent about 10 hours over two days discussing information from the three-week trial before coming to a decision. In their final arguments, a prosecutor accused Chauvin, who is white, of killing Floyd, an African American, by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. A defense attorney, Eric Nelson, contended that Floyd died partly from drug use and that Chauvin was following his police training in the way he arrested Floyd last May on the curb of a street in Minneapolis. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher summed up the case against Chauvin, who held down the handcuffed Floyd as Floyd lay prone on a city street and gasped — 27 times, according to videos of his arrest — that he could not breathe.“He was trapped…a knee to his neck,” Schleicher said, with Chauvin’s weight on him for nine minutes and 29 seconds.“George Floyd was not a threat to anyone,” Schleicher said. “All that was required was some compassion, and he got none.”“No crime was committed if it was an authorized use of force,” Nelson argued.“The state has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt,” the legal standard for a conviction, the defense attorney concluded as he asked the jurors to acquit Chauvin of murder and manslaughter charges. Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby convenience store. The routine police investigation of a minor case last May 25 and Floyd’s subsequent death have resulted in one of the most consequential U. S. criminal trials in years. Chauvin pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. Last week, Chauvin invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and did not take the witness stand. Under U. S. law, the prosecution must prove the allegations against defendants, and defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Trial judge Peter Cahill told the jury not to draw any inference on Chauvin’s innocence or guilt from his declining to testify. After dismissing the jury Monday, Cahill criticized Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who is Black and a member of Congress since 1991, for recent remarks regarding the trial. Waters told protesters in Minnesota to “stay on the street” and to become “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin is found not guilty.“I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that’s disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,” Cahill said. Despite Cahill’s plea, U. S. President Joe Biden Tuesday described the evidence against Chauvin as overwhelming.“I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict,” Biden said during an Oval Office meeting with Latino lawmakers. “I think it’s overwhelming in my view. I wouldn’t say that unless the jury was sequestered now.”As the case nears its end, authorities in Minneapolis are bracing for possible street protests after the verdict. Many stores are boarded up to prevent a recurrence of the damage and looting that took place after Floyd’s death almost a year ago.“We cannot allow civil unrest to descend into chaos. We must protect life and property,” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said Monday. “But we also must understand very clearly, if we don’t listen to those communities in pain and those people on the streets, many of whom were arrested for speaking a fundamental truth that we must change, or we will be right back here again.”Protests, some of them violent, broke out in many cities in the United States and throughout the world after Floyd’s death. The Black Lives Matter movement was at the forefront of the demonstrations, but thousands of people who had no previous connection to the Black-led protests joined in to condemn Chauvin’s actions, and more broadly, police treatment of minorities. The same issues raised by Floyd’s death came to the forefront in the community again when a now-resigned police officer in a Minneapolis suburb fatally shot a 20-year-old African American man during a traffic stop on April 11. Meanwhile, Republicans in the U. S. Congress said they planned to hold a censure vote Wednesday over comments made by Representative Maxine Waters of California. On Saturday, Waters was in the Minneapolis suburb where another Black man had been killed by a police officer earlier this month. Waters told protesters who had gathered in Brooklyn Center over the death of Daunte Wright that she wanted to see a murder conviction against Chauvin. She added, “We gotta stay on the street, we’ve got to get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational, we’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.”On Monday, Judge Cahill called Waters’ comments “abhorrent” and that and they could lead to a verdict being appealed and overturned.

The original police report detailed that three black women from Texas got into an altercation with a 24-year-old restaurant hostess on Thursday after she asked them to provide proof of vaccination to eat indoors. However, subsequent information from the attorneys for both Carmine’s and the women revealed that the trio did, in fact, present verification of vaccination to enter. Shortly after the women’s group was seated, three men arrived to join the party inside, but two were denied entry because they failed to provide vaccination documentation, lawyers from both sides confirmed to the New York Times. A fight broke out outside when a hostess allegedly used a racial slur and made derogatory remarks directed at the female customers, accusing them of carrying fraudulent vaccination cards, the lawyer who represents one of the women, Kaeita Nkeenge Rankin, who is a doctor, told the Times. Justin Moore, the lawyer, said the women claim the hostess “spewed out” the N-word. After the brawl, NYPD arrested the three black women for investigation of criminal mischief and assault. Organized by Black Lives Matter Greater New York, demonstrators congregated Monday to clarify the story from their perspective. At the rally, the speakers railed against the racial obscenity that was allegedly uttered as well as the perceived discrimination against the black unvaccinated patrons. While protesters claimed the hostess was white, invoking “white supremacy” multiple times, Carmine’s owner Jeffrey Banks told the New York Post that the employees who he says were violently attacked were black, Latina, and Asian American. BLM NYC co-founder and chairman Hank Newsome alleged that the restaurant staff treated the black women with hostility and accused Carmine’s of covering up “their employees’ actions by using the vaccination passport as an excuse.” He demanded that Carmine’s release its video footage of the incident, which he believes will settle that the hostess was the antagonizer and that the three women were wrongfully charged. On Tuesday, Carmine’s owner Jeffrey Bank released the surveillance tape, which shows one of the Texas tourists, rather than the hostess, throwing the first blow.“This attack was entirely unprovoked,” Banks told the Post. He also unequivocally denied that any one of his employees made a racial slur. Chivona Newsome, the other co-founder of BLM NYC, targeted Mayor Bill de Blasio’s vaccine mandate more specifically in her remarks. She implied that the edict has resulted in repeats of historical episodes when blacks were disenfranchised from society.“Being a doctor does not protect you from anti-blackness. Having a vaccination card does not protect you from discrimination. The 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits the actions of Carmine’s. It says it is illegal to discriminate against you on the basis of race,” she said.“Seventy-two percent of black people in this city from ages 18 to 44 are unvaccinated. So what is going to stop the Gestapo, I mean the NYPD, from rounding up black people, from snatching them off the train, off the bus?” she added. Chivona Newsome suggested that if these incidents continue, Black Lives Matter could revolt to exact justice like it did after George Floyd’s death.“We’re putting this city on notice, that your mandate will not be another racist social-distance practice. Black people are not going to stand by, or you will see another uprising. And that is not a threat; that is a promise,” she said. “The vaccination passport is not a free passport to racism.”Kimberly Bernard, the co-founder of the Black Women’s March, echoed the charge that COVID restrictions are being weaponized against minorities.“We are serving notice on the mayor, on the governor, on the restaurant industry that we will not allow for you to use this pandemic, vaccination cards, and masks as another reason to be racist, to put us in prison. Because there’s enough of us in there,” she said. A man from Rise and Resist, a direct-action group that formed in resistance to the 2016 election of former president Donald Trump, turned the conversation to the partisan blame game that’s exploded amid the pandemic.“The Republican Party and elected officials and pundits on Fox News try to blame the entirety of the unvaccinated COVID crisis on black people, even though black people are twelve percent of the population,” he said. But while the speaker said the political Right is guilty of pinning the pandemic on the unvaccinated, of whom many are blacks, a female African American in the crowd told National Review a different tale. Amaya Perez, a college student with experience in the restaurant industry, said her community is struggling to recognize that Democrats, not Republicans, are spearheading vaccine mandates and therefore resurrecting racial discrimination and conflict.“Most black people aren’t going to acknowledge that the Democratic Party has disenfranchised us. Malcom X said it’s foxes and wolves. The fox pretends to be your friend to your face but passes laws behind your back to harm you. The wolf is not your friend, they don’t like you, and they treat you as such. But who do you respect more? Black people tend to fall for the fox,” Perez said. She said her job is in jeopardy now because she’s refused the vaccine, another issue of economic equity that she says Democrats are not acknowledging.“This vaccine mandate is disproportionately affecting people of color. People shouldn’t be forced to do it. It’s ‘for your health,’ but they’re willing to ruin people’s lives to protect against a virus with over a 99 percent survival rate. . . This is going to be the new Jim Crow, and it’s going to affect mostly people of color,” she said.",1,Questionable,-0.0114884559884559,0.3688347763347763,1334,2,National Review
66,Safe Banking Act Reintroduced to Protect Pro-Pot Banks,-4.0,48.0,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/18/safe-banking-act-reintroduced-to-protect-pro-pot-banks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-18,17,"The effort to provide the cannabis industry access to financial institutions and services returned to Capitol Hill on Thursday as the SAFE Banking Act was reintroduced in the House of Representatives. The bill would protect banks offering services to state-legal operators. It’s widely regarded as the most bipartisan cannabis effort in Congress and this year, two Republicans and two Democrats are taking the lead. The first-round sponsors are Reps. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), Steve Stivers (R-OH), Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) and Warren Davidson (R-OH). Many more names are expected to be added to that list. In the last Congress, 206 co-sponsors led to a very lopsided bipartisan vote of 321-103. An impressive feat for any bill during the politics of that moment. Unfortunately for the previous rendition of the bill, COVID-19 stalled its progress. But the House never let up the pressure, including the bill’s language in two pandemic relief bills. Cannabis Caucus Co-Chair Rep. Earl Blumenauerpreviously toldL. A. Weeklythat the SAFE Banking Act was the biggest win for cannabis on Capitol Hill until the MORE Act passed in December.“Thousands of employees and businesses across this country have been forced to deal in piles of cash for far too long,” said Rep. Perlmutter. “It is time to enact SAFE Banking to align federal and state laws and reduce the public safety risk in our communities. I appreciate the partnership of the cannabis industry and businesses across this country who have added their voice to this effort. The SAFE Banking Act is an important first step to treating cannabis businesses like legal, legitimate businesses and beginning to reform our federal cannabis laws.”Supporters of the safe banking act have noted for years just how dangerous it is for the cannabis industry to remain a cash-only business. Even prior to the events of last summer, when thieves used the cover of protests to ransack dispensaries around the state, organized bands of criminals were using publicly available licensing information to target operators. Thieves made off with a ton of product and cash, in one instance scoring a six-figure tax payment the company was prepping for the state. Rep. Blumenauer spoke to how bad things have got for Portland cannabis businesses.“Addressing the irrational, unfair and unsafe denial of banking services to legal cannabis businesses is not just an economic issue, but an urgent public safety issue that will save lives and livelihoods. In the past year, Portland’s cannabis shops were robbed, burglarized or looted more than 100 times,” Blumenauer said. “During these violent attacks, cannabis workers have been threatened at gunpoint, zip-tied, and repeatedly targeted for simply doing their jobs. Tragically, we have already lost one Portland cannabis worker to this violence. Thousands more people will continue to have a target on their back if Congress does not address the lack of banking access that is posing a real danger to cannabis workers, businesses and our communities. It is a critical element of cannabis reform that can’t wait.”There is a lot of incentive for operators to see the bill pass beyond being able to cut a check from a reputable financial institution. It will also make it easier to access traditional forms of lending and capitol. This would have a major impact on the mom-and-pop operations that have bootstrapped this far since it would open up additional legit lines of credit and money to expand their businesses. The National Cannabis Industry Association has been working on the bill since its inception. Aaron Smith, NCIA’s co-founder and CEO, weighed in on the news.“At a time when small businesses need all the support they can get, and after cannabis businesses specifically have been providing essential services and generating significant tax revenues for states and the federal government with little to no financial relief, it is more imperative than ever to get the SAFE Banking Act passed into law,” said Smith. Smith went on to not just cover the public safety side, but the simplification of oversight in attempting to track the billions of dollars in revenue flowing across the cannabis supply chain from state to state.“Lack of access to banking services continues to create serious unnecessary issues for public safety, transparency, and access to traditional lending that smaller operators desperately need,” Smith said. “These businesses are contributing billions of dollars to the national economy every year, and need to be treated like any other legal regulated industry. We are grateful to the sponsors of this legislation who have generated strong and consistent bipartisan support year after year, and we are confident that it has a clear path to approval again.”The newly formed U. S. Cannabis Council sent out a statement from interim President Steve Hawkins.“While the SAFE Banking Act is not the only cannabis legislation the U. S. Cannabis Council (USCC) expects this session, it is integral to the success of the responsible cannabis industry of the future,” Hawkins said. “This essential step forward will positively impact social equity candidates often redlined from receiving financial backing and even access to traditional banking services. The SAFE Banking Act provides access to financial services such as small business loans, which create equal opportunity, ensuring more diverse representation within the industry. The Act also protects public safety as the billions of dollars in annual retail revenues are from mostly cash transactions, creating targets for crime and unnecessarily endangering communities.”❖More:cannabisNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

67,“We’re Not Allowed to Hang Up”: The Harsh Reality of Working in Customer Service,-7.67,44.67,https://www.propublica.org/article/not-allowed-to-hang-up-the-harsh-reality-of-working-in-customer-service,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,24,"Last year ProPublicawroteabout the world of work-at-home customer service, spotlighting a largely unseen industry that helps brand-name companies shed labor costs by outsourcing the task of mollifying unhappy customers. As we reported on the industry,we invitedcurrent and former customer service representatives to contact us. They did. We heard from more than 100 and interviewed dozens. Often, their stories disturbed us. One woman, afraid to take a bathroom break, kept a jar under her desk in case she needed to urinate. Another, afraid to call in sick, paused calls to vomit. A third, afraid to hang up on a customer, didn’t know what to do when she realized a caller was masturbating to the sound of her voice. These accounts captured how agents are simultaneously ubiquitous and invisible. Customers talk to them all the time but know little about their work conditions. So we’re providing accounts from seven agents, many of whom describe the experience of being caught between abusive callers and corporate directives to appease. These seven are highly representative of the 100-plus agents we heard from, as well as the agents we interviewed in our first article. The agents, including some who told us they love their setups, laid out common themes, describing problems that people at various levels of the industry, including managers, have told us are endemic. We’ve also found echoes of these complaints in lawsuits and arbitration claims. Abusive callers are such a concern that, a few years ago in Canada, a union for telecommunications workers launched a campaign called “Hang Up on Abuse.” Airbnb, recognizing the emotional strain of taking such calls, offered their in-house customer service agents free therapy sessions. The reps we spoke to needed these jobs, which allowed them to work from home even before the pandemic. They included people with disabilities, caretaking obligations or limited opportunities in rural towns. Recruitment ads touted flexibility and the chance to be your own boss. But many agents discovered the roles came with limited hours, close monitoring and strict performance measurements that put them in constant fear of losing their jobs. A Department of Labor investigatorconcludedthat one contractor, Arise Virtual Solutions, exerted an “extraordinary degree of control” over agents. Most customer service agents are women. Many describe being sexually harassed. One said a caller told her, “I really like the way you type.” Their work belongs to a grim history of women in outsourced roles stretching back to the piecework manufacturing era. A half century ago, temp work exploded, driven by companies hiring women to cut costs compared with full-time employees. These magazine ads from 1970 and 1971 show how women temps were viewed at the time, and the attitudes have certain parallels to how customer service agents are viewed today. While many agents work full time, a growing segment are independent contractors who don’t get paid holidays, vacation time or fringe benefits. In the accounts below, most of the agents asked not to be identified, citing nondisclosure agreements that are common in the industry. (To work for some companies, agents must sign NDAs before they can even accept the job.) We’ve condensed for clarity and verified details wherever possible, collecting Facebook screenshots, email exchanges, company performance review forms, tax records and other proof of employment, along with contemporaneous recollections from agents’ relatives or friends. But there were instances in which we couldn’t get such documentation, owing in part to the premium placed on privacy and security by the companies. Some agents said they weren’t even allowed to have their personal phone in their workroom while helping customers. Some lost access to their email and the company platform when they quit or were fired, and they hadn’t made copies or screenshots beforehand. In every case we invited the companies that these agents worked with to comment. Christine Stewart has social anxiety and depression. “I have a really hard time being out in public,” she said. She wanted to work from home, so she became an independent contractor for Sykes from 2017 to 2018. The company bills itself as “a leading provider of multichannel demand generation and customer engagement services for Global 2000 companies.” At Sykes, she helped customers using Intuit’s TurboTax.“I was actually sick one day, I called, they have a supervisor line, and told them I was going to be [out] sick. And without actually saying it, the lady said, you’re going to be in trouble if you don’t show up. And me, I don’t like to get in trouble at work, I’m a good employee. I went to work. I kept hitting my mute button every time I had to throw up.”During training, she said, “they told me if you wanted to work nights, you could work nights. If you want to work days, you can work days. Once you finish the training they’re like, ‘This is your schedule.’ I said I can’t work that and they were like, ‘Well, this is the schedule, and if you can't work the schedule, you don’t want the job.’ I was like, ‘I need the job, I do want the job.’ I said, ‘I can do 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.’ They wanted me to do 12 to 12. I have to get my kids on the bus in the morning, I was like, ‘I need to take a five-minute break when the bus pulls up.’ Even that was a huge problem for them. They would say, ‘You can’t keep taking these five-minute breaks.’”Customers berated her. “One person called me the C-word. I’d call my supervisor. They’d say, ‘Calm them down.’ … They’d always try to push me to stay on the call and calm the customer down myself. I wasn’t getting paid enough to do that. When you have a customer sitting there and saying you’re worthless … you’re supposed to ‘de-escalate.’”“There can be no background noise, no nature noises or cars passing by. I had a den. I had to insulate my den,” she said. (To confirm the expense, she shared a tax form with ProPublica that showed a $100 deduction.) “I had to turn the AC off; you could hear the AC blowing. They called me out on that. When I was training, the lady said she could hear the air conditioner in the background.”One time, she said, “my kid broke his hand.” She dropped her call, dropped everything, to help him, but then she needed a story, because, she said, had she told her supervisors the truth — that her kid broke his hand and needed her help — “I would’ve gotten in trouble even if I had a hospital note.”“I said my internet went down. I pulled the plug on everything, because it was their equipment. ... I didn’t know if they had any kind of monitoring software that wasn’t on the webcam or anything. It was better not to take any chances and unplug the whole thing.”full statement.)She needed money for a medical procedure, so, during the pandemic, she began working for Liveops as an independent contractor, helping customers for Bath & Body Works. She worked from home. For online orders, Bath & Body Works allows shoppers to use just one promotion per order. A customer, for example, can use a code to knock down the price of a particular item, but they can’t combine multiple codes. Customers can get upset when this is explained to them.“We encounter customers who ordered the wrong items and want us to send them the right items for free. We receive calls from customers who have had their packages stolen. And then we get customers all the time who find out we don’t sell a particular fragrance anymore, and they can be just incredibly abusive.”“I may as well say it out loud. We get called bitches all the time. One woman called me a ‘stupid fucking cunt.’”“It can wear on you. We’re not allowed to answer back in the same way, nor are we allowed to hang up on them. Nor can we hang up on them after giving them one warning. The policy I am told is, we’re not allowed to hang up on any customer under any circumstances, even if they question our race or ethnic background or anything like that. My understanding is that we’re not even allowed to give people a warning.”“We have to sit there basically and listen to these people until they run out of steam. It’s like they don’t see us as a person.”With the pandemic, she said, a lot of agents are young women who lost their jobs and are desperate for anything. A lot of her fellow agents are Black women. “I’ve heard them say they were called ‘stupid n-----,’ ‘you stupid Black bitch.’”Read MoreWhile some customer service reps are pressed to work more hours than they want, she got too few. Last fall, she signed up to work for four and a half hours during one day. She was paid 31 cents per minute of talking time. So when she wasn’t getting calls, she wasn’t getting paid. For those four and a half hours, she said, she sat there with her headset plugged in.“No calls in those four and a half hours. Nothing. … I got some personal budget stuff done. Surfed websites unrelated to work. Familiarized myself with products on the website. I hate to say it, but I think I dozed off at one point.”Were there other days in which you got no calls? we asked.“Oh, yes.”“How many?”“I lost track.”Liveops has quality auditors who listen to at least four of an agent’s calls per month, she said. They score agents using an audit form, which she shared with ProPublica. It says agents should make a “connected recommendation for each opportunity throughout the interaction” based on the customer’s orders. Say a customer buys soap. The agent should ask, “Did you want a soap holder, too?” If a customer buys candles, the agent should also pitch candleholders.“A customer calls to say, ‘Hey, I didn’t get my package.’ So I’m supposed to say, ‘Hey, do you want to buy some more products when you still don’t have your package?’ Oh, for crying out loud. Really.”The audit form has 20 questions. They include: “9. Did the agent compliment the customer’s selections, reassure about the fragrance choices and/or give general positive reinforcement about the items? … 18. Did the agent apologize when necessary, show empathy and/or recognizes customer emotion? 19. Did the agent let the customer know that we have ‘heard’ them, that we genuinely care, and did the agent remain engaged throughout the entire interaction?”A Liveops document said that if an agent’s scores fall within the “unacceptable” range for three months in a calendar year, “the agent may be subject to removal from the program.”She said she recently received an email saying she had used profanity on a call, so Liveops was terminating her contract. She didn’t remember saying anything profane. The company provided no recording for her to listen to. She emailed Liveops and called corporate to ask for details or a chance to hear whatever it is she was supposed to have said, but she got no response. (She said she didn’t make copies of these emails before her email account was closed.)“No appeal,” she said.full statement.)She worked as an independent contractor for Arise Virtual Solutions, a company that bills itself as a pioneer in the work-from-home industry. Customers, she said, “get mad at us. They start cursing at us. They start threatening to report us to the main office.” One customer, she said, told her he was going to keep her on the line until he got what he wanted; he “started with the F-word,” then apologized, then carried on. He “wouldn’t stop and wouldn’t stop” until finally, realizing the agent wouldn’t give in, he gave up. At one time she handled calls from Barnes & Noble customers. “A lot of cursing, a lot of crying — crying — believe it or not. I’ve been called every name in the book. And I do mean from A to Z. Everything in between. I’ve been hung up on, threatened, told I’m going to lose my job. I had one woman tell me, ‘I hope you have a miserable day.’ You can’t laugh. I can’t laugh. I’m thinking to myself, ‘You ordered the Bible. You’re some Christian person?’ She’d ordered a Bible! Those are the worst! Those are the worst hypocrites! They scream, curse, yell, carry on, threaten. They’re the worst.”“The women, their mouths are unbelievable. Or they start crying. They’re worse than the men. I’m like, ‘It’s a book, for God’s sake.’”full statement.)She was employed by iQor (pronounced I-core) as a retention specialist and sales agent, taking calls from customers for Sprint (which has since merged with T-Mobile). She worked in a call center.“If the customer is angry and wants to completely cancel, you have 14 minutes to resolve their issue, get them to stay and sell them a new phone,” she said. A unit called workforce management would push agents along. One workforce management monitor would sit at a computer, checking the length of each agent’s call. Another would walk the floor. These two would communicate by walkie talkie, one alerting the other to any agent whose call was running long.“At 10 minutes you had somebody tapping on your shoulder. At 12 minutes you had someone tapping on your shoulder and saying, ‘Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.’ At 14 minutes, ‘What’s going on? You need to wrap this up. You need to move on.’”“We had this guy who would run around on the floor yelling, ‘Move it along, people, all hands on deck, move it along, move it along.’”Agents would have management in one ear and customers in the other. Customers would often be insulting, sometimes shockingly so. She remembered one customer in particular. “He was very, very upset. And it’s personal. You get called names. ‘I hope you fucking die.’” Another Sprint customer told her: “‘I hope when T-Mobile takes over, you all lose your fucking jobs, your fucking families, your fucking homes, and you all kill yourselves.’”She said she was not allowed to hang up. Only a supervisor could do that. “Where’s the line where you no longer have to take that?” she said. “I spent more than one instance in the bathroom, crying, then shaking it off and going back to work.”“I’m pretty thick-skinned, and I had nightmares. It beats you down. Everybody is angry. Eight out of 10 calls, they’re angry and they’re cursing by the time they get to you. Usually it’s the men who make it personal. That’s why I coined the term AngryWhiteManistan. ‘I have another resident of AngryWhiteManistan here.’ They’ll say things like, ‘Well, then, you better get me someone who is not incompetent.’”In her nightmares, she said, she would be doing some mundane task, such as making dinner in the kitchen, when the phone would ring. She’d pick up and hear: “Are you done yet? We need to move on. We need to move on. We need to move on.”heavily prioritizes customer and agent experience over more traditional call center metrics.”The company’s statement added, “We have a long-held policy that all of our experts do not have to tolerate abusive speech or behavior.” (Read the company’sfull statement.)did not respond to requests for comment. She’s lived in “many, many states” and worked in many call centers. Now she lives out west in a rural setting where jobs, and options, are scarce. A few years ago she found a job that lets her work from home. She started as an agent at Convergys (since acquired by Concentrix), then became a supervisor.“It’s just enough of a wage that you’re going to be ineligible for most public support. I’m not eligible for any financial aid whatsoever. And yet I go to the food bank every month because I don’t make enough money. … I don’t go to the doctor, even when I should.”She said the job attracts a lot of new parents. And retirees. And people with medical issues. She said that in her experience, the turnover is “tremendous.” Within months, many people get fired, or “termed,” short for terminated. “We fire more than they resign. A lot more.”Most firings are over attendance. What counts as an attendance infraction? “Anything. It doesn’t matter if it’s in your control or not. … Your power goes out and, bam, you’re absent. ... Doesn’t matter if you had a hurricane.”“You don’t know if you’re going to have a job tomorrow.”Once, as a supervisor, she listened to a recording of a call that had been made to an agent working at home, answering calls from customers for DirecTV. “DirecTV had a policy, you never hung up on a customer, ever. You simply weren’t allowed to, no matter what they said.” (ProPublica interviewed another agent who also understood this to be the case.)“There was a guy who called in and masturbated on the phone. It was awful. … Just imagine being a woman in your office in your home, alone. And here’s this guy doing this, and it takes you a few minutes to figure out what that sound is, and when you do you’re horrified, and you don’t know what to do. All you know is, you’re not allowed to hang up the phone. That would be horrible. I felt so terrible for her.”The agent, crying, asked if she could quit for the day without an attendance infraction. “We had the recorded call, it’s not like it was ever in doubt. My boss was a man, at first he didn't understand why that was an issue.” He didn’t understand why the agent was so troubled. “I had to go to HR to get them to explain to him why it was an issue.” Only then could the agent stop taking calls.: “We recognize that the work-at-home environment isn’t foreveryone. … We take the health and safety of our staff very seriously and do not have a no hang-up policy. Our staff are given extensive training to manage each interaction with techniques to deflect anddiffusesituations should they arise. If subjected to harassment or abuse they are trained and empowered to end the conversation.” (See Concentrix’sfull statement.)She’s in her 60s and wanted a work-from-home job to keep her family safe during the pandemic. She saw a company called Arise Virtual Solutions mentioned online, but she was skeptical. She would be an independent contractor, required to absorb substantial startup costs. (ProPublica’sprevious articleon customer service noted that Arise’s agents often spend more than $1,000 on training and equipment.)Then she saw Bob Wells, a real-life nomad featured in the movie “Nomadland,” talking about Arise on YouTube. She decided to give it a chance. “I was like, ‘I need work.’ … I’d kind of given up on finding something more legit, frankly, because of the pandemic. So it was a pandemic Band-Aid for me.”She answered calls from customers for Home Depot. One, a nurse’s aide, had ordered a portable toilet for a client. “This woman was like, ‘I have a 90-year-old lady who needs this thing like, yesterday, and you haven’t delivered it for three weeks, what is your problem?’” To the agent, this was urgent. “When it became a humanitarian issue, and there were plenty of humanitarian issues, especially during the pandemic,” she would send the matter to people above her, who would then send it to Home Depot to do something. The customer’s problem might then be resolved. “But my stats would go down,” she said, because she hadn’t resolved the matter herself. (She shared Arise’s performance metrics with us.)On days when the phone didn’t stop ringing — and there were many — she couldn’t step away from her desk. “I had a bottle I kept under my desk in case I had to urinate. I never used it, but I had it there if I needed it. I’m in my 60s. … There could be an emergency.”The work was isolating. She joined Facebook groups (and provided screenshots to ProPublica) and began to talk with other frustrated agents. She realized she was among the few white women in her work cohort. And she realized customers were nicer to her — an immigrant with a British accent. “When I first came to this country, I couldn’t believe people could tell the color of a person over the phone. That was a culture shock. ... When people are calling in, I think they find it easier to yell at a Black woman. … I’m not the most evolved person, but I began to look at the work through a racial lens. ... I answered the phone, and there were people who called, and right at the beginning of the call, they were full of white-hot rage.” Then they would hear her accent. “Well, the amount of comments I got from people who were like, ‘Wow, they’ve got classy people here!’ … I was born in a British colony. People think I’m a butler or a classy servant.”network of agents, whom it callsservice partners. “Arise does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the statement said. “Service Partners interacting with individual customers through the Arise® Platform are protected by both client and Arise policies and processes that include the ability to disconnect callers without penalty or transfer these calls to support resources if they are unable to de-escalate the situation.” (Read Arise’sfull statement.)Mara M. was a hairstylist and cosmetology teacher when her health began worsening. “Probably in about 2015, I started sleeping a lot. Any time I would stand up I would get really dizzy, really lightheaded. One of the requirements to teach hair is to be able to stand. I couldn’t stand up. It was a walker and wheelchair for me. … I have postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.”Mara eventually discovered Concentrix, a global customer service outsourcing company, while searching for work-from-home jobs on Indeed.com. She signed on at age 23, hoping she might be matched with a company that sold beauty products. At her orientation three weeks later, Mara learned which account — that is, which of Concentrix’s corporate clients — she would be matched with. She would be working part time, doing video calls and live chats for Intuit. She would be helping people use TurboTax. Mara didn’t have an office. But she did have a closet. So she turned her closet into an office. (She sent us photographs.) “They sent me a blue screen to put behind my chair,” she says. That way, customers wouldn’t know she was working from home, much less from inside her closet. She bought a computer, a monitor, a headset.“We were not supposed to hang up. … You’re supposed to hear them out, then empathize with them, then acknowledge that the problem was made. I had tried all that. They say, you know, apologize, but the people stay angry.”One customer called her, moaning. “I was very uncomfortable. I couldn’t tell if he was sick; I couldn’t tell if he was watching porn in the background. I just tried to get through the guy’s questions.” Afterward she told a friend that she thought the man on the other end of the line had been masturbating. (The friend confirmed this conversation.)She learned that agents were monitored. “We had a webcam, and [the monitors] can see you through the webcam. … I’m not sure how often you were watched. But the trainer did say you should shut down your computer after your shift because they can still see you. I was like, that’s really Big Brother. … That freaked me out because I spend a lot of time in my room.” And she learned there were no built-in breaks for part-timers. “You can’t step away when you’re on the clock.” She said it felt confining, like her closet was a prison cell. She struggled to answer questions about complicated tax forms. She would Google for answers in a different window while trying to look confident to the customer, who could see her on the video call. “I had a nightmare so bad that I’d wake up at 6 in the morning over this job. I cried.

69,Republican operatives Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman are charged with voter suppression robocall scheme,3.0,43.67,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8796649/Republican-operatives-Jacob-Wohl-Jack-Burkman-charged-voter-suppression-robocall-scheme.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,25,"Two conservative operatives were charged Thursday with felonies in connection to robocalls that aimed to dissuade residents in Detroit and other US cities from voting by mail, Michigan's attorney general announced. Jacob Wohl, 22, and Jack Burkman, 54, each face four felony counts in Detroit, including conspiring to intimidate voters in violation of election law and using a computer to commit crimes, Attorney General Dana Nessel said. The calls falsely warned thousands of residents in Detroit and urban areas in at least four other states – New York,California, Pennsylvania and Ohio - that voting by mail in the November 3 election could subject people to arrest, debt collection and forced vaccination. In total, at least 85,000 calls were believed to have been made across the nation. The men, who have a history of staging hoaxes and spreading false smears against prominent Democrats and government officials, are not in custody and no date for their arraignments has been set.

A judge found probable cause Thursday to support the charges, which carry the potential for years in prison and thousands of dollars in fines upon conviction. The computer charges carry up to seven years apiece while election law violations could bring up to five in all. The robocalls falsely claimed that voting by mail would put voters into a database that would later ‘be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debt’ and force voters to ‘get mandatory vaccines.’The voice on the robocall in question identified itself as part of ‘a civil rights organization founded by Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl.’‘Don't be finessed into giving your private information to the man,’ the caller said. ‘Beware of vote by mail.’Nessel's office warned the public about the calls and launched an investigation in late August after thousands of Detroit residents received them. Wohl and Burkman both denied involvement at the time. Burkman didn't immediately reply to a Thursday voicemail seeking comment about the charges and Wohl didn't immediately reply to an email. Nessel said her office would work with local law enforcement to secure their appearances if necessary, saying the men could face arrest and extradition or could voluntarily come to Michigan to face the chargesNessel said the investigation found that Burkman and Wohl created and funded the robocalls in an attempt to deter voters of color from participating in the November election. Michigan is a key battleground state that Trump narrowly won in 2016 in part due to a drop in turnout for Hillary Clinton in heavily Democratic Detroit. In Michigan, voters can cast an absentee ballot for any reason, either by mailing it in, dropping it off or filling one out at a clerk's office.‘We´re all well aware of the frustrations caused by the millions of nuisance robocalls flooding our cellphones and landlines each day, but this particular message poses grave consequences for our democracy and the principles upon which it was built,’ Nessel said. ‘Michigan voters are entitled to a full, free and fair election in November, and my office will not hesitate to pursue those who jeopardize that.’Nessel said 85,000 calls were believed to have been made across the nation. She said nearly 12,000 residents in the 313 area code received the calls in Detroit, and that similar calls also blanketed urban pockets of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and New York. The Attorney General encouraged anyone who received such a call to file a complaint with her office. Wohl has been banned from most social networks, including Twitter and Instagram, for operating fake accounts and peddling misinformation. Along with Burkman, the pair have made a name for themselves for orchestrating political dirty tricks and hoaxes on President Donald Trump's political opponents. The stunts often attempt to paint their designated targets as rapists, criminals or deviants – even frequently using hired actors who were unaware that they were being used for political stunts. Such failed schemes have targeted the likes of vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, former special counsel Robert Mueller and Elizabeth Warren, each with elaborate conspiracy theories which were all discredited almost as quickly as they arose. Just last month, the Washington Post said that it was duped into falsely reporting that FBI agents had conducted a raid at Burkman’s home in Arlington, Virginia, when it was actually a staged event featuring actors. Wohl and Burkman have a history of supporting President Donald Trump and attacking his political opponents, often attempting to pain them as rapists, criminals or deviants – even frequently using hired actors who were unaware that they were being used for political stuntsWohl (above) has been banned from most social networks, including Twitter and Instagram, for operating fake accounts and peddling misinformationMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, like Nessel a Democrat, in August called the robocalling effort ‘an unconscionable, indefensible, blatant attempt to lie to citizens about their right to vote.’She praised Nessel for a swift investigation Thursday, saying the charges show the state will ‘use every tool at our disposal to dispel false rhetoric’ and protect voting rights. Investigators served search warrants in California, where Wohl lives in Los Angeles, as part of the inquiry last week, Nessel said. In August, Wohl told The Associated Press that they suspected ‘leftist pranksters’ were behind the robocalls because recipients were shown a caller ID that was Burkman´s mobile number. Burkman called the situation ‘a joke,’ saying nobody would use their mobile number for a robocall and threatening to sue Benson for defamation. This isn't the first time the two have come under scrutiny in Michigan. Last year, a Michigan college student said the duo recruited him to falsely claim he was raped by Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg and then published the smear without the student's permission.",3,Reliable,-0.0166196122717862,0.4096720308676833,1439,1,Daily Mail
70,Panic Time,-6.33,43.67,https://www.cjr.org/special_report/panic_time.php/,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,,18,"In November, just before I went to see Jerry Brown at the annual meeting of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, some eleven thousand climate experts signed a statement declaring “clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.” At eighty-one, Brown, the former governor of California, was retired, but not really, having committed himself to fending off environmental disaster. Recently, he had testified before a House subcommittee, calling an attack by President Trump on California’s auto emissions rules “just plain dumb, if not commercially suicidal.” A month before that, he’d announced the creation of the California-China Climate Institute, a bilateral research and training initiative “to spur further climate action.” And just before finishing his last term as governor, he’d signed on as the executive chair of theBulletin, which was eager to stake out territory in the climate fight. I’d arranged to interview Brown about his choice to join theBulletin, a nonprofit magazine founded in Chicago in 1945 by conscience-stricken alumni of the Manhattan Project. TheBulletincovers all things nuclear and is best known for its annual Doomsday Clock announcement, which draws on expert opinion to report just how close we are to the “midnight” of man-made apocalypse. But the publication’s original remit—to help “formulate the opinion and responsibilities of scientists” and “educate the public” about the many “problems arising from the release of nuclear energy”—has broadened considerably. It now devotes equal attention to the threat of the climate crisis, including in the setting of the clock. In this regard, theBulletinand a post-gubernatorial Brown were an ideal match. The meeting I attended, at the regal University Club in downtown Chicago, was Brown’s second with the science and security board, a group of subject-matter experts who set the clock and advise the editorial staff. (TheBulletinalso has two other boards: the governing board, a corporate and philanthropic fundraising body, and the board of sponsors, which boasts thirteen Nobel laureates.) A few hundred people arrived, palling around and getting ready to talk all things apocalypse. The dress code for the event had called for business attire, but Brown turned up in crumpled slacks and a navy-blue sweater—a suitcase screwup, he explained. Why theBulletin? I asked. “Number one is, of course, the reduction of the nuclear threat, but climate is another huge threat to humanity,” he said. “And theBulletin, by linking the two threats, can increase public awareness, get people thinking about the big threats that humanity faces.” Brown complained, in his jocular, pugnacious way, that the American news media’s “servitude to the concept of the news of the day” is partly to blame for public ignorance about climate change. He asked me repeatedly, “How can journalism cover something as diffuse and general and gradual as climate change?” As we chatted, searching for answers, I thought of the untold amount of carbon we’d all combusted to get to Chicago. I next saw Brown at the opening luncheon, in the buffet line amongBulletinfunders and fans. The crowd resembled that of a classical-music concert: old, white, intellectual. The day included three sets of workshops, led by eminent scientists and policy wonks, then a closing plenary session and dinner banquet at Chicago’s Palmer House, a grand hotel dating to the late nineteenth century. At the dinner, Brown delivered an energetic, free-flowing speech. “The worse it is, the more excited I am,” he said, theitbeing our current geopolitical, nuclear, and climate morass. “Let’s get it done!”That secondit—the avoidance of total destruction—aptly distilled theBulletin’s mission. Since the atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the magazine has tried to convey the grave danger we’ve imposed on ourselves. Today, though the possibility of nuclear war remains real, the climate crisis feels just as daunting and consequential. Environmental scientists know this, as do journalists who report on global warming. Yet the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientistsmay be the only publication to cover climate change with an approach that is explicitly existential. What time is it? At the 2020 announcement of the Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin’s leaders declared us closer than ever to midnight. Lexey Swall Photography / Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsIn 2017, during a seemingly endless, ever-escalating row between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientistswas permanently tabbed in my browser window. What some were calling a new “North Korean nuclear crisis” wasn’t really new or even a crisis so much as the crackling of a rather constant fire. Still, as a Korea watcher with family on the peninsula, and given the “statesmen” involved, I felt frightened and looked to theBulletinas a vital source of news and commentary. The magazine had, after all, invented the nuclear beat. From the very first issue, a slight, mimeographed newsletter published on the fourth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, theBulletinappealed to America and the rest of the world to eliminate nuclear weapons and establish “efficient international control” of atomic energy. Progress “will be useless if our nation is to live in continuous dread of sudden annihilation,” the editors said at a conference in Moscow. “We can afford compromises, disagreements, or delays in other fields—but not in this one, where our very survival is at stake.” A few years on, theBulletinpublished the text of a speech by Albert Einstein, delivered to journalists at the United Nations, in which he asked why global cooperation hadn’t yet staved off the threat of apocalypse. Perhaps it would be different, he suggested, if the atom bomb were not “one of the things made by Man himself.” Einstein later founded theBulletin’s board of sponsors. TheBulletinevolved from a newsletter into a magazine, headquartered at the University of Chicago, and Martyl Langsdorf, a landscape painter and the wife of a Manhattan Project alumnus, designed a symbolic cover: an analog clock, set at 11:53pm, to represent the imminence of our self-destruction. In 1949, when the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear device, Eugene Rabinowitch, theBulletin’s coeditor, decided to animate Langsdorf’s clock, winding it four minutes closer to midnight. It has ticked forward and backward ever since—through the proliferation of ballistic missiles; the catastrophes at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima; and the adoption of and American withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The Nuclear Notebook, a research column of hair-raising erudition, has appeared in every issue since May 1987 and is second only to the Doomsday Clock inBulletininfluence. Each Notebook installment analyzes a category of stockpile—tactical nuclear weapons, for instance, or the Chinese nuclear arsenal—down to the quantity and types and locations of various arms and fissile materials. The interests of the magazine have always overlapped with those of environmentalists. EarlyBulletinscientists expressed a desire to make atomic energy a clean, limitless alternative to fossil fuels. That did not, of course, come to pass; more apparent were various kinds of long-term damage, from nuclear tests to plant meltdowns to radioactive waste buried on- and offshore, all of it documented in theBulletin. There’s still no consensus on nuclear power. At the annual meeting, Robert Socolow, a member of the science and security board and a Princeton professor emeritus, said in a presentation, “I’m still going back and forth on nuclear energy, because of the coupling of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.” There is always “some probability” of disaster, he added. Atomic energy, in any case, never came close to rivaling fossil fuels, and the subject of climate change appeared in theBulletinas early as November 1961. “Climate to Order,” an article-cum–thought experiment by H. E. Landsberg, a German climatologist, described geoengineering—that is, hacking the atmosphere (reflecting sunlight, injecting chemicals into the stratosphere, etc.)—avant la lettre. In theory, Landsberg wrote, it would be great to customize our environment, but “When we are changing the climate of the whole world, a mistake could be disastrous.” In 1970, theBulletinran another piece on geoengineering, this time in relation to “polar ice” and “man’s inadvertent influences on global climate.” By 1972, a long, poetic account of the loss of forests and arable land would warn, “There is plenty of evidence that man is the principal cause of this change.”When I visited Rachel Bronson, the CEO and president of theBulletin, in the magazine’s Chicago offices, she plucked a bound library volume from her shelf and opened it to February 1978. “Is mankind warming the Earth?” William W. Kellogg, a meteorologist, queried in the magazine’s first climate-change cover story. “The answer is, I believe, an unqualified ‘yes.’ ” Kellogg’s article might have been written today, so salient are its arguments against delayed action and the conflating of extreme weather and atmospheric transformation. He included a message to colleagues who “maintain that we should not publish any conclusions about the response of the climate to anthropogenic influences until we have done more homework,” expressing his disagreement “with such a conservative and noncommunicative attitude because the stakes are so great, the issues so fundamental to the future of society and most of all because some decisions are upon us that depend on every scrap of insight we can muster.”By the end of the Cold War, most scientists were aware of the dangers of climate change and its relation to atomic and geopolitical concerns. Around the time Bill McKibben publishedThe End of Nature, the first mass-market account of global warming, in 1989, theBulletinwas running pieces on the science of climate change “side by side with heated denials that global warming posed any threat at all,” historians David Kaiser and Benjamin Wilson observe in a special seventieth-anniversary issue of theBulletin. The magazine also recast the debate over nuclear energy “amid new apprehension about greenhouse gas emissions and implications for global warming.” Len Ackland, the editor from 1984 to 1991, told me that it became clear “we needed to address longer-term environmental dangers.” To that end, he commissioned new artwork from Langsdorf: in her cover illustration for the October 1989 issue, the circle of the clock encloses a blue-and-white map of the world, the minute and hour hands radiating out from the North Pole. In 1992, theBulletinpublished a major speech by Mikhail Gorbachev that set out environmental priorities for a post-Soviet world: “The prospect of catastrophic climatic changes—more frequent droughts, floods, hunger, epidemics, national-ethnic conflicts, and other similar catastrophes—compels governments to adopt a world perspective and seek generally applicable solutions.”TheBulletinhas vacillated in style over time, toggling between academic journal and science magazine, but has always maintained a certain seriousness. When I spoke to Bronson, she told me that tradition and expertise are no longer enough. “In the moment of populism in which we’re now operating, we’d better inform the populace,” she said. “Our power will come from having an educated and devoted following that’s larger than it is right now.” Recently, theBulletinhas adjusted its idioms; leaned more on interviews, explainers, personal essays, and multimedia; and stretched beyond an author base of older white male technocrats from Europe and the United States. There’s the Voices of Tomorrow column, which ran a moving essay by four teenage activists, including Isra Hirsi, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s daughter: “Adults won’t take climate change seriously. So we, the youth, are forced to strike.” There’s elegant multimedia reportage, such as deputy editor Dan Drollette’s “Tilting toward windmills,” about a test wind farm on Block Island, Rhode Island. And there’s refined polemic: for example, “Let science be science again,” by Yangyang Cheng, a Chinese physicist based in Chicago, on science advocacy in the age of Donald Trump. A popular video series, “Say What? A clear-eyed look at fuzzy policy,” produced by multimedia editor Thomas Gaulkin, demonstrates that, even though theBulletinis nonpartisan, it’s religiously pro-science.“Some decisions are upon us that depend on every scrap of insight we can muster.”Ticktock: Martyl Langsdorf, a landscape painter and the wife of a Manhattan Project alumnus, designed a symbolic Bulletin cover: an analog clock that would represent the imminence of our self-destruction. That clock would become the magazine’s visual touchstone. Courtesy Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsIn recent years, theBulletinwebsite has more than quintupled its traffic, from about 42,000 visits per month in 2013 to 236,000 per month today. The audience remains small but is also—judging from the comments section and social media—well connected and atypically informed: scientists, graduate students, journalists, the kinds of people who subscribe toScientific AmericanandForeign Affairs. In response to a recent article on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that debunked the supposed coming of a “little ice age,” commenter Cjones1 wrote: “You forgot to mention that less solar radiation allows more cosmic radiation which effects [sic] cloud cover. The IPCC predictions have been less accurate than a bone throwing shaman.” Fifty-five people responded to this with a thumbs-up. TheBulletindiscontinued its print edition in 2008 but maintains a distinction between its paywalled bimonthly magazine and other articles. A yearly subscription costs eighty-six dollars and comes via Taylor & Francis, a profitable British publisher of scholarly books and journals. Since 2011, John Mecklin has served as theBulletin’s editor in chief. He supervises six editors, spread out across the United States, who commission and write; seven other staff members handle administration, public relations, and fundraising. Collectively, they aim to grow the magazine’s readership, assign more illustrations, and invest in narrative and investigative journalism. “I’m in the process of commissioning a story right now, paying somebody two to three dollars a word,” Mecklin told me. “TheBulletinis doing well financially, but I can’t pay whatThe New Yorkerpays somebody, or I can’t do it for very many stories a year.” Most pieces are written for nothing—“donated,” as Mecklin put it—by experts with day jobs. One of Mecklin’s predecessors, Mark Strauss, recalled compensating at least one contributor with aBulletinT-shirt. When Mecklin took the job, climate represented just “a quarter or 30 percent” of the magazine, he told me; it’s now “more like 40 percent nuclear, 40 percent climate.” As he explained, “What has evolved and changed since I’ve been editor is that there are now three areas of focus: it’s nuclear, climate change, and this area we call disruptive technologies”—such as artificial intelligence and disinformation—a sort of “threat multiplier of the first two.” Both Mecklin and Bronson described this expanded mission as logical and necessary, and in line with theBulletin’s history of tackling the impacts of cutting-edge science. When I listened in on a recent editorial meeting, via Skype, I was struck by the magazine’s simultaneously banal and illustrious character. The editors did what all editors do: they evaluated pitches and commissions, reviewed social media statistics (e.g., an “SUV shaming” story, by contributing editor Dawn Stover, that was “doing well on the interwebs”), brainstormed story ideas, and planned coverage. But every so often, someone would refer to a famous politician or scientist (e.g., Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford physicist who has personally inspected North Korea’s nuclear arsenal) not as a dream subject or occasional source, but as a friend and adviser to the magazine. On questions of climate, for instance, they might consult Elizabeth Kolbert, a Pulitzer Prize–winningNew Yorkerwriter who sits on the science and security board. This is a publication with extraordinary history and reach. I thought of something Mecklin told me when we first spoke: “We want to be read in the White House, at the Kremlin, and at the kitchen table.”Among the prominent scientists closely involved with theBulletinis Raymond Pierrehumbert, a lavishly bearded and tweeded physicist, not of the nuclear sort. He joined the magazine’s science and security board while across campus at the University of Chicago. He has since moved to Oxford, but remains heavily involved. In his work on “the early Earth” and planets around other stars, he applies the “same physics we use to quantify the greenhouse effect on Earth,” he told me. “If you’re a climate scientist or paleontologist, you’ve studied the role of CO2in the Earth’s past history—you know that what humans are doing to the Earth’s climate is truly disturbing.” For his part, he said, “It would be irresponsible to stay in the lab.” Pierrehumbert once wrote a lively column on science and politics forSlate; he also contributed to the websiteRealClimateand appeared in a well-intentioned rap video titled “We are climate scientists, Chicago style.” (He’s better as a folk musician.)In a recent cover story for theBulletin, “There is no Plan B for dealing with the climate crisis,” Pierrehumbert argues in dramatic language against geoengineering. To pursue that strategy, he writes, would commit “generations yet unborn to continuously run a mechanical process, over a time-span longer than the age of the pyramids.… And if our offspring don’t, or simply can’t, do so at some point in the future, then they will suffer the consequences of an unimaginably huge climate shock, accumulated over vast amounts of time.”When I saw Pierrehumbert at the annual meeting, he was sheepish about the sin of his flight to get to Illinois. Yet he seemed energized by the company of his colleagues: fellow physicists, national-security experts, and politicians, including Jerry Brown, whom he admires. A few years ago, Pierrehumbert told me, he’d raised concerns with Brown about coal exports. If California allowed a proposed coal export terminal to be built, Pierrehumbert had said, it would increase demand in China, putting all of our carbon reduction goals in jeopardy. The problems were confounding, the answer frustratingly simple: “We need to put fossil fuel companies out of business, or at least their traditional business,” Pierrehumbert told me. “We will need to write down carbon to zero.” Brown heard him out, Pierrehumbert recalled, but “it was not on his radar.”In November, Pierrehumbert had California’s cap-and-trade program on his mind. A flaw of that and related markets, he told me, is that they apply an inaccurate equivalence “standard, mass for mass,” to methane and carbon dioxide, thereby exaggerating the role of methane in global warming. But “if we reopen the debate”—that is, rejigger the math of cap-and-trade—“we could lose the benefit on carbon dioxide. It’s politically complicated. I’m not sure it’s worth the risk,” he explained. “It’s too bad that Jerry Brown is no longer governor.” Even if he didn’t act on everything Pierrehumbert told him about, he had, at least, listened. Gavin Newsom, the new guy in Sacramento, has yet to show up to aBulletinmeeting.“We want to be read in the White House, at the Kremlin, and at the kitchen table.”Illustration by Gaby D’AlessandroAt the start of 2020, Bronson and her staff flew to Washington, DC, as they do every January, to announce to the world what time it is. At the press conference, livestreamed to maximize virality, Bronson wore a scarlet dress and stood at a podium bearing theBulletin’s somber black-and-white logo. In 2018 and 2019, the clock was set at 11:58, the direst assessment by the science and security board since 1953, after both the United States and the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs. This year, alongside Brown; Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland; and Ban Ki-moon, a former UN secretary-general, Bronson delivered an even grimmer report: the world was now a hundred seconds from apocalypse—“closer than ever to midnight,” as CNN would write. TheBulletin’s accompanying statement, authored by Mecklin and addressed to the “leaders and citizens of the world,” is a seven-page, reader-friendly recitation of man-made horrors and suggested mitigations. Humanity is facing “a state of emergency that requires the immediate, focused, and unrelenting attention of the entire world,” it reads. The reasons are many. On the nuclear side, the US, Russia, and China retain their stockpiles; Iran retreated from international cooperation, in response to America’s withdrawal from their nuclear deal and its assassination of a top Iranian military commander; the INF Treaty is no more and other arms agreements are soon to expire. In terms of climate change, the US officially left the Paris Agreement; Brazil is allowing its precious rain forests to be destroyed; and greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise, zero-carbon rhetoric be damned. All this is made worse by a “corrupted and manipulated media environment” in which truth, let alone scientific reality, becomes increasingly unknowable. Still, theBulletinstatement offers shards of hope. “Climate change has catalyzed a wave of youth engagement, activism, and protest,” it observes. If we multiply this “mass civic engagement,” it states, “there is no reason the Doomsday Clock cannot move away from midnight.”If the clock announcement invites sober reflection, it’s also an occasion to push for political action. Throughout its history, theBulletinhas balanced its journalistic mission with various forms of advocacy. As soon as the atomic scientists in Chicago founded theBulletin, they joined with colleagues in Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Manhattan to lease an office in Washington, forming a Beltway collaboration that eventually became the Federation of American Scientists. Last year, just after the clock announcement, Bronson, Brown, and former defense secretary William Perry, who now chairs theBulletin’s board of sponsors, met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer—to lobby not for a specific candidate or bill, but for arms control, diplomacy, and nuclear and climate policies rooted in science. Bulletinstaff transmitted the ominous details of the clock statement: North Korean nuclear proliferation, increasing carbon dioxide emissions, and information warfare. This year, alas, Congress was busy with impeachment proceedings. There is a tension, in such conversations, between fear and hope. How much is too much apocalypse talk? “It’s very hard to find the words, even, to express the moment we now are in,” Brown said, during the clock announcement. “I myself am a person of limitless words, but I can’t find how to say it in such a way that it can be heard.” Back in November, at the end of the closing plenary session, a tall, bespectacled woman in the audience raised her hand: Elizabeth Talerman, a strategic-communications expert, who offered some advice on framing. It’s best to avoid phrases like “existential threat,” she said, because they bum people out. The Doomsday Clock certainly has its skeptics, mostly on the right. See: “Just skip the doomsday predictions, guys” (theNational Review); “Goose eggs: No climate change doomsday warning has come true” (theWashington Examiner); “The Climate Doomsday Trap” (the Cato Institute). Strauss, the former editor, told me that theBulletinhas played just as important a role in debunking “overhyped threats”—for example, “fears that terrorists might start massive forest fires”—as it has in playing up actual perils. When I asked Brown how theBulletinshould convey the urgency of the climate crisis, he didn’t have an easy answer. He brought up a document from 1992, a one-page “Warning to Humanity” published by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit whose members and staff often write for theBulletin. “A great change in our stewardship of the earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated,” the statement reads. Brown’s point was that every climate messenger, not just at theBulletin, struggles to balance gloom and motivation. Meaghan Parker, executive director of the Society of Environmental Journalists, told me, “It’s not so much about the emotion—are you a doom writer or a solutions-and-hope writer?—but talking about the specific, lived changes of real people.”SomeBulletinarticles punch and flail; others coax. Many do both, traipsing from seemingly intractable problems to optimistic solutions. In its March 2019 issue, theBulletinexamined “climate change action—from the right,” including an interview with Christine Todd Whitman, the former governor of New Jersey and head of the Environmental Protection Agency under George W. Bush, and an article about a Christian group, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action. Mecklin’s editor’s note offered practical guidance to “ungenerous corners” of the American left: “Republican officeholders are not likely to agree to substantive action on climate change until they feel it is clearly in their best political interest to do so. The best people to explain those best interests to Republican congressmen and women? Republicans who believe in climate action and vote their beliefs.” Recently, when I sat down to read a tall stack ofBulletinarticles, I felt a confusing combination of terror, depletion, and productive rage. Perhaps this is how the original atomic scientists felt, trembling from guilt, trying to pull us away from the abyss. Nuclear war, so overwhelming a concept, once needed its own metaphors to be understood. When theBulletinfirst took on climate change as an area of focus, it might have seemed an odd fit. “As they say, nuclear can do us in in an afternoon; climate change will take much longer,” Kennette Benedict, theBulletin’s former director and publisher, who oversaw the inclusion of climate change in the clock-setting, told me. But the two crises are now an inseparable apocalyptic pair.

Congressman Steve Stivers (R-OH) intends to make the next stimulus check contingent upon receiving the controversial and novel vaccinations. Stiversaims to deny $1,400 for ailing Americansdesperate for economic relief unless they are stuck with the Big Pharma shots.“It should be debt for the right things,” Stivers said. “The quickest thing we need to do if we really want to help the American people, is get this economy turned back on — get people back to work, get kids back in school, get ourselves some herd immunity, get the vaccine distributed as quick as we can and get the uptake rate up. That’s why I’d be willing to accept a $1,400 stimulus check if people are willing to take the vaccine.”Stifers apparently has no qualms about Americans being used as guinea pigs for these experimental shots pushed quickly through the“Operation Warp Speed” programthat have many troubling side-effects.has reported on how men are being warned to freeze their sperm before receiving the COVID vaccine due to fertility concerns:It will not be known for years exactly the negative health impacts that these vaccines will bring about to the public, and Big Pharma will beexempted from all liabilitycoming from the shots. Many Americans have legitimate cause to have concerns about vaccines, and skepticism towards personally receiving it.

72,Proud Boys founder worked as government informant: report,-5.67,42.0,https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-proud-boys-tarrio-informant-20210127-bfhiifk5yfe2pdeguko27bhgta-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-daily-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"Here’s one thing extremist group leader Enrique Tarrio might not be so proud of — being a snitch. According to a new report, the Proud Boys chairman worked undercover as an informant for federal and local law enforcement authorities after he was arrested in 2012. Officials said Tarrio helped authorities prosecute more than a dozen people in various cases involving drugs, gambling and human smuggling, according to Reuters, which cited a former prosecutor and a transcript of a 2014 federal court proceeding. But Tarrio said his cooperation was news to him.“I don’t know any of this,” Tarrio told Reuters when asked about the transcript. “I don’t recall any of this.”But the former federal prosecutor in Tarrio’s case, Vanessa Singh Johannes, confirmed that “he cooperated with local and federal law enforcement, to aid in the prosecution of those running other, separate criminal enterprises, ranging from running marijuana grow houses in Miami to operating pharmaceutical fraud schemes.”The right-wing Proud Boys organization has come under increasing scrutiny following its role in drumming up support for the Jan. 6 U. S. Capitol building riot which resulted in the deaths of five people, including a law enforcement officer. At least five Proud Boys members have been charged in the riot. Tarrio, who vocally supported former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the election results, did not participate in the government assault; he was arrested two days ahead of the unrest. He was accused of burning a Black Lives Matter banner that was stolen from a historic Black church in Washington during a December demonstration. The report said Tarrio’s law enforcement cooperation in 2014 stemmed from a fraud case in which he pleaded guilty to relabeling and selling stolen diabetes test kits.",3,Reliable,0.1171831955922865,0.4475550964187327,375,3,New York Daily News
73,Republicans Stumble Trying To Show More Urgency About COVID-19 Vaccines,-10.0,42.67,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-vaccine-hesitancy-message-change_n_60f9cdeee4b0ddf0097d10ea,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,25,"Several high-profileRepublicanshave recently embraced thecoronavirusvaccine, finally getting their shots or encouraging others to get theirs. Fox News hostSean Hannity, who previously called COVID-19 a “hoax,” promoted the vaccine on his show this week. House Minority WhipSteve Scalise(La.) received the shot this week after saying months ago that he would be getting it “soon.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantishas beenurging Floridiansto get vaccinated. And Senate Minority LeaderMitch McConnell(Ky.) has repeatedlyencouraged vaccinationsin recent days. But House Minority LeaderKevin McCarthy(R-Calif.) rejected the idea Thursday that Republicans have been speaking differently about vaccines.“I don’t think we shifted in our tone,” he said, explaining that the rapid development of the vaccine has always been a top Republican achievement under former President Donald Trump. And some other Republicans aren’t quite ready to ditch the doubt and skepticism they’ve sown in the public about the danger of the virus and the effectiveness of the vaccines. House Republicans gathered for a news conference with doctors Thursday morning, which was billed as a push to get more Americans vaccinated and to discuss the new delta variant, which is more contagious and spreading rapidly around the country. But they spent most of their time blaming China for creating an “evil virus,” as Scalise put it, and criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for not doing enough to examine its origins.“Why is she trying to do the work of the Chinese communist party in covering this up?” asked Scalise. When the Republican lawmakers did talk about the need to get vaccinated, they framed it as a personal decision rather than an imperative in the midst of a deadly pandemic.“We urge all Americans to talk to their doctors about the risks of COVID, talk to their doctors of the benefits of getting vaccinated and then come to a decision that’s right for them about the vaccine,” said Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), a doctor and co-chair of the House Republican Doctors Caucus. “If you are at risk, you should be getting this vaccine.”“One of these days, if we’re not careful, we’re going to get a variant that isn’t something that we can handle with the vaccine we’ve already got.”The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone eligible for the vaccine get the shot as soon as possible, not just people who are at higher risk of illness. Republicans have been far less likely to get vaccinated than Democrats,according to survey data. Pollingalso showsthat doctors are the most trusted source of vaccine information and that unvaccinated adults put relatively more trust in doctors than in the government, which is likely why elected Republicans are telling people to talk to their doctors when they promote the vaccine. Though Scalise attended the news conference that strayed from its advertised vaccine-boosting message, earlier this week heposed for a photowhile finally getting his shot. Scalise told HuffPost he hadn’t gotten vaccinated until now because he’d previously tested positive for antibodies ― meaning he thought he had some protection from COVID-19 from a mild or asymptomatic prior infection ― but with the new variant spreading, he decided to get vaccinated.“I’ve talked to the hospital directors in my state, and over 98% of the people that are being admitted to hospitals right now for COVID are unvaccinated,” he said, “and I just felt this was the right time to get that extra level of protection and also thought it was important to publicly encourage people.”“Ultimately it’s everybody’s choice and, you know, if they have questions, talk to their doctor, but at the same time it’s safe and effective and I’m glad I got it,” he added. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N. C.), who got the shot as soon as he could earlier this year, said he didn’t think there was necessarily more enthusiasm for the vaccine within the House Republican conference because of the delta variant.“If you weren’t scared of the original COVID, you shouldn’t be scared of the delta,” Hudson told HuffPost. “I think most of the outbreak we’re seeing is non-vaccinated people, but even among the non-vaccinated, the hospitalization and death rates are extremely low.”Hudson added: “I do see, from the left, kind of a growing hysteria about the variant, which is concerning.”Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S. C.) also said he didn’t think there’s been any increase in pro-vaccine sentiment among Republicans, though he said he had gotten his shot immediately.“It’s no change. I’m still thrilled,” he said. “It’s the success of Mike Pence and Operation Warp Speed.”Even if most Republicans aren’t publicly admitting that there’s a shift, the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus seems to have people nervous, according to GOP strategists. The stock marketrecently tumbledamid concerns about the virus’s resurgent spread, and there are fears of returning to the lockdowns and restrictions of the past year. Cases are also on the rise inunvaccinated areas― including many districts represented by Republicans in Congress. That reality may be prompting some lawmakers to push vaccinations with more urgency. For example, in Plaquemines Parish in Scalise’s district, there has been a929% increase in COVID-19 casesover a recent 14-day stretch and a 57% jump in hospitalizations. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said there indeed had been a shift.“Seems to me both Republican elected officials and some conservative news people are talking about having vaccines that weren’t a couple of weeks ago,” Blunt told reporters. Blunt suggested the rise of the delta variant could explain the rhetorical change and noted the available vaccines work well against the newer strain of the virus.“One of these days, if we’re not careful,” he said, “we’re going to get a variant that isn’t something that we can handle with the vaccine we’ve already got.”At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

74,SFUSD middle school and high school students ‘unlikely’ to return to school this year – The San Francisco Examiner,0.0,45.33,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/sfusd-middle-school-and-high-school-students-unlikely-to-return-to-school-this-year/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-28,19,"Most middle school and high school students will likely not return to physical classrooms for the remainder of the academic year, San Francisco school officials said Wednesday evening.“As we think about any return to in-person learning, we have to think about the intersections between safety, students, staff and space,” San Francisco Unified School District said in an email to parents. “Also, the public health guidelines for middle and high in-person learning are different than for younger students. With the community spread of COVID and our current timeline for returning any students in Phase 2A, it is unlikely that we’ll be able to offer most middle and high school students the opportunity for in-person learning this school year.”Grades 7-12 aren’t permitted for in-person learning until a county reaches the red tier. Under the purple tier, which San Francisco is in, grades K-6 are permitted by the state to have in-person classes unless cases are more than 25 new cases per day 100,000 people. San Francisco had23.3 new cases per day per 100,000 peopleas of last week. Meredith Dodson, a parent organizer with the group Decreasing the Distance, said the news wasn’t a surprise for families paying attention and watching school board meetings, but tough for those who still had hope things would come together. The district should have been more transparent about the reality sooner, she said.“It’s been sort of a sad day witnessing a lot of families who were holding out hope for their middle school or high school students,” Dodson said. “For those of us who were plugged in, it was pretty obvious. I think that the leadership knew that, [but] they took a long time to share it.”SFUSD previously sought to begin bringing back young students and those with disabilities, known as phase 2A, by Jan. 25, butcalled the return offamid a coronavirus surge from holiday gatherings when it could not reach a labor agreement with staff unions. Those deals have still not been finalized, but if readiness preparations go according to plan, the soonest those younger students could come back now would be March 25. The school district is planning for phase 2A students to be in class five days a week. Phase 2b students — homeless and foster youth, students in public housing, and those with limited online engagement — will likely have a modified schedule depending on space and the number of students. School officials have been under intense pressure to reopen immediately, with parents and city officials citing the toll distance learning is taking on students and families and support from health experts who say it can be done safely.“We are committed to opening as soon as we can in a safe way,” said school board Vice President Alison Collins earlier this week. “It’s just definitely continuing to get more complicated. What’s been frustrating is we’re talking about our ability to implement those recommendations based on the current conditions.”The Department of Public Health conducted site inspections this week, which is one of the final stages to receive local clearance to reopen. But there are several items left to check off, like finding a new testing provider after a previous partner,Curative, was deemed to post a high risk for false-negative resultsby federal health officials. State guidelines also now include surveillance testing of students if a county is in the red or purple tiers, which would greatly expand the district’s needs. There are also multiple coronavirus variants, including one from California that is still being analyzed for how it fits into current guidelines and vaccinations. Gov. Gavin Newsom suddenly lifted regional stay-at-home orders on Monday andSan Francisco officials subsequently lifted several restrictions, to the dismay of United Educators of San Francisco President Susan Solomon, who expressed concern that cases will rise again. Unions have proposed returning to school when The City reaches the orange tier. As it’s become more clear that many students will spend the rest of the academic year relying on distance learning, Solomon said the district needed to provide them more support. Dodson said there needed to be more wellness checks and creative planning some in-person enrichment outdoors so pre-teens and teens could spend time together safely in some capacity.“I think everyone has to recognize, from [Supervisor] Hillary Ronen to the superintendent to the state, that middle and high school students won’t be returning,” Solomon said earlier this week. “What are we going to do for them? Suicidal ideation is up, mental health crisis is up. That can’t just be the responsibility of educators. We can’t do this alone.”",3,Reliable,0.0942627042627042,0.389608342108342,968,3,SF Examiner
75,Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema: the centrists blocking Biden’s agenda,-7.67,44.33,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/03/joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema-democrats-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-03,25,"Donald Trump’s favorite insult for political opponents inside his own party is “Rino” – Republican in name only. By such logic, SenatorsJoe Manchinof West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the epitome of Dinos, two elected Democrats whose dogged resistance to Joe Biden’s social agenda threatens to upend his entire presidency. Their standoff with the party’s progressive wing over the price tag of Biden’s ambitious reform package has become almost more of a hazard to his legacy than anything the Republicans, currently in a narrow minority in both chambers of Congress, can throw at it. That resistance – and threat – to Biden’s domestic ambitions is now set to continue for the month of October as House speaker,Nancy Pelosi, set a new deadline of 31 October for the House to pass a major infrastructure spending bill after a week of negotiations left massive social and environmental policy overhaul plan in a limbo. Progressive Democrats in the House haverefusedto vote on the infrastructure bills leverage in negotiations over a separate bill that contains huge spending on issues increased access to childcare, help with college tuition and major action on climate change. Analysts, meanwhile, question if the senators’ resistance to programs that Biden ran and won an election on is rooted more in a need for political self-preservation. Manchin is a moderate Democrat in a state where the governor’s mansion and both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans; Sinema is seen as vulnerable in Arizona where she captured the Senate seat that previously belonged to the Republican Jeff Flake before he decided not to run again. Both face sticky re-election challenges in 2024. Meanwhile, New York magazine’s Intelligencer coined a phrase for the oversized power resting in the hands of the two otherwise unremarkable Democratic holdouts:Manchema. “They are, in effect, holding the president’s priorities hostage to their personal whims,” the article’s author, Sarah Jones, wrote.“That’s not a new story in politics. But their stubbornness in the face of contemporary challenges reveals the bottomless emptiness of their brand of centrist politics.”Manchin, 74, has been in the US Senate since 2010, and became a controversial figure during the Trump administration by allying himself on several key votes and eventoying with an unprecedented cross-party endorsementof the former president for reelection. If Senate Democrats were frustrated with him then, it morphed into impatience when the party seized control of the chamber in 2020 but became reliant on him for every vote so vice-president Kamala Harris could break a 50-50 tie. Manchin has always insisted he is not against Biden’s desire to enact social reforms, but balks at the $3.5tn cost and has indicated he would be comfortable with $1.5tn. Last month he called for Democrats to “hit the pause button” for more negotiation.“I could say that I’m against this and that and everything. I’m for an awful lot of the things. I’m for also putting guardrails on,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press. Sinema made headlines in 2018 not only for becoming Arizona’s first Democrat senator for more than two decades but also as thefirst openly bisexual memberof the chamber. Yet despite being from the same party as Arizona’s other senator Mark Kelly, who ousted the incumbent Republican Martha McSally in last year’s special election to make it the first time in 70 years the state was represented in the Senate by two Democrats, she has taken amuch more conservative stanceon several issues. In March, she angered colleagues by giving athumbs-down gestureon the Senate floor as she voted against raising the federal minimum wage. Unlike Manchin, Sinema, who rarely gives interviews, has not indicated publicly what parts of the $3.5tn bill she objected to. As an indicator of her importance to the process, she has become a regular visitor to the White House, getting more face time with the president and senior Democratic leadership than any other senator with only three years’ standing. In Arizona, Democrats have become weary of Sinema. The state’s Democratic partypassed a motionpledging a no-confidence vote if she votes against the bill, while some members areplotting a primary challenge. In Washington, the Hawaii senator Mazie Hirono encapsulated congressional Democrats’ frustration. “I and others are waiting for Kyrsten and Joe to tell us what is it that they like or don’t like, and then we can get it done,” she said. Manchin, meanwhile, drew the personal ire of the Senate’s most prominent progressive, the former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, in a recent interview on ABC’s This Week.“Is it appropriate for one person to destroy two pieces of legislation?” he asked. “It would really be a terrible, terrible shame for the American people if both bills went down.”",3,Reliable,0.0645229965652501,0.4598715056461535,1044,3,The Guardian

Village trustees voted 5-0 Wednesday morning to grant a special use authorizing the pot shop and sign code variances for Verilife, which takes over the single-story, 4,800-square-foot brick building shell in Parkway Bank Park. Despite the family-friendly daytime image of the park - now host to its annual winter ice skating season - Mayor Brad Stephens said the location between the AMC movie theater and iFly indoor sky diving venue is ""in the open, but discreet enough.""""I think when you look at the outside of the building, I don't think it screams, 'Come get high,'"" he said. ""The world has evolved to the point of having it be acceptable.""Pete's Dueling Piano Bar opened in the space a little over a year ago, closed in March due to state COVID-19 orders, and briefly reopened for outdoor dining and limited indoor seating in June. That was the same month the village board signed off on new zoning rules that opened up the possibility of a marijuana dispensary within the prominent 200,000-square-foot complex east of the Tri-State Tollway. It followed an advisory referendum in March in which 59% of Rosemont voters said they were OK with pot sales in the village. By the fall, Stephens announced the piano bar likely wouldn't be coming back, while the board approved a $225,000 sale of the land to a development partnership led by Braden Real Estate Chairman/CEO Marc Offit and Chicago bar owner Kevin Killerman. A closing on that purchase is scheduled for Thursday. The buyers, in turn, inked a long-term lease with Verilife parent company PharmaCann Inc., company officials confirmed. The Rosemont board's unanimous vote Wednesday morning didn't include Trustee Jack Dorgan, a registered lobbyist for PharmaCann, who was absent from the meeting. The village stands to make at least $600,000 a year from its 3% local tax on Verilife's sales, according to a company estimate. Similar revenues could be seen from another recreational marijuana shop, EarthMed at 10441 W. Touhy Ave., which the board granted special use approval in August and is now doing interior renovations. The entertainment district shop will be the fifth in Illinois for PharmaCann, which operates 14 dispensaries and has about another dozen under development in six states. The firm also operates five cultivation centers, including one in downstate Dwight, which ships product to its stores in Arlington Heights, North Aurora, Ottawa and Romeoville. Other shops proposed for Chicago's River North neighborhood and Galena have received zoning approvals. The Rosemont store will only sell to recreational - not medical - users, as the location will serve as a state-permitted secondary site to an existing medical dispensary. Customers will be required to make online reservations for pickup, in an effort to avoid the lines seen at competing pot shops, officials say. Company officials consider the new Rosemont shop to be their flagship suburban location.""We love the robust business community that you all folks have developed here,"" Jeremy Unruh, PharmaCann's senior vice president of public and regulatory affairs, said during a Rosemont zoning board meeting Tuesday afternoon.""We very much believe that there is a synergy between what we do and what you all folks are doing,"" he added. After a planned $700,000 interior build out, the store could be open as soon as February.

77,Groups worry about tapping COVID relief for infrastructure,-1.0,45.33,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-d3a23a50e5cdc37ea6e51a38b3cc1ba8,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Organizations representing long-term care facilities on Friday urged lawmakers working on a bipartisan infrastructure plan to avoid dipping into COVID-relief funds to help pay for the roughly $600 billion in new spending sought for the public works buildout. The request comes as lawmakers are struggling to finish up negotiations over the package amid stubborn disagreements over how to pay for the new spending. Lawmakers and staff are expected to work through the weekend, sorting through the flurry of tensions over funds for water resources, public transit and other details in what they hope are the final stages of their work. The groups representing the long-term care facilities said tapping virus relief dollars would be “short-sighted, especially as COVID-19 variants continue to spread.” They noted the Delta variant that now accounts for most of the new cases and threatens “the safety of our nation’s seniors and their caregivers.”Senators working on the infrastructure plan hope to have a bill ready to be voted on next week. President Joe Biden has made passing the bipartisan plan a top priority, the first of his two-part $4 trillion proposal to rebuild, but a Senate test vote failed this week after Republicans said they needed more time to finish the package and review the details. Negotiators have struggled over how to pay for the new spending without raising income taxes or user fees such as the federal gas tax. They’re looking at other sources, including undoing a Trump-era rule on pharmaceutical rebates, redirecting billions of unspent dollars from last year’s COVID relief and tapping other potential funding streams. Even if the negotiators strike an agreement, it’s not at all clear the funding sources will pass muster with the Congressional Budget Office, the chief arbiter of many bills in Congress. If the final accounting shows the package is not fully paid for, some lawmakers may balk and use that as another reason to vote against it.“Folks will always find a problem with our pay-fors,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said on Bloomberg Television. “On the other hand, we will have it paid for and we will be able to not just pay for it, but point towards long-term gains the society, the economy will benefit from, according to multiple economists from across the political spectrum.”Groups representing nursing homes and other long-term care facilities called on the negotiators Friday not to redirect money from a fund established to reimburse health care providers for expenses and lost revenue due to COVID-19. The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday there is about $24 billion not yet allocated to providers, out of about $178 billion Congress approved for the fund through various relief measures. The groups said some of their members have not been able to get reimbursement for expenses and lost revenue incurred in the latter months of 2020 and this year and were anxiously awaiting another round of funding from HHS. A Democratic aide granted anonymity to discuss the negotiations confirmed that how to redirect certain COVID relief dollars is still among the issues that have not yet been resolved. Another is the amount of money that would be dedicated to public transit. There are also disputes over broadband funds and labor laws, the aide said. Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the chairman of the Banking Committee, and Tom Carper of Delaware, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, released a joint statement saying that “robust funding” for transit is a must.“We will not support any package that neglects this fundamental part of our nation’s infrastructure,” the two senators said. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said that 20% of funding from the Highway Trust Fund traditionally goes to transit versus 80% for roads and bridges, and there is concern from Republicans that the bipartisan framework changes that ratio to the advantage of transit. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., has also voiced concerns about the water and wastewater segments of the bill. She warned that she can’t commit to supporting a final bill if didn’t fully fund a $35.9 billion water bill that she sponsored and which passed the Senate by a vote of 89-2. Carper said senators were assured that the legislation would be fully funded, but “now we’re hearing it may be moved around.” He said that $15 billion may be specifically allocated for lead pipe removal, rather than giving the states and local governments the flexibility to use that money as they deem most appropriate, which could include lead pipe removal. The final package would need the support of 60 senators in the evenly split 50-50 Senate to advance past a filibuster. Last week’s test vote failed along party lines. The package would next go to the House, where some Democrats are fearful that their priorities have been overlooked during the Senate negotiations and are warning that their votes should not be taken for granted. Congress would next turn to Biden’s broader goals that are being drawn up in a $3.5 trillion package that Democrats plan to pass on their own under special budget reconciliation rules that would allow for a 51-vote threshold in the Senate.",3,Reliable,0.0590681248575985,0.4443457127667654,1095,3,AP
78,Fights over COVID-19 vaccines are spilling over to other types of shots,-6.2,42.0,https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"The Tennessee Department of Health is suspending outreach for all types of childhood and adolescent vaccinations, thereportedthis week. Along with stopping COVID-19 vaccine events at schools, the department will no longer do outreach for the HPV vaccine, isn’t planning for flu shot clinics at schools, and is taking the department’s logo off of back-to-school vaccination information sheets. The shift in policy came after Republican lawmakers in the state got upset that the department was promoting COVID-19 shots for teenagers. It’s a strong signal that the politicization and backlash around the COVID-19 shots, driven by conservative politicians andright-wing commentators, is spilling over to other types of vaccinations. It’s not the first time politics has impacted unrelated public health work during the pandemic — over a dozen states have proposedlimiting public health powersas part of backlash to pandemic-related restrictions. But it’s the first time the target has been standard vaccines.“It’s insane,” says Seth Kalichman, a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut who’s studied anti-vaxxers. “It’s exactly the kind of overgeneralization that can occur with misinformation.”“It’s insane.”The initial trouble in Tennessee started when conservative lawmakers criticized Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey for recommending COVID-19 vaccines to teenagers. The health department alsofired Michelle Fiscus, the state’s top vaccine official, after she circulated a memo to doctors explaining a state law that allows minors to get medical care without parental consent. Fiscussaidshe was a scapegoat, fired to mollify the angry lawmakers. Around the same time that Fiscus was fired, the department also stopped all vaccine outreach targeting teens or children. Health department spokesperson Sarah Tanksleytold thethat the state has high childhood vaccination rates. “We are simply mindful of how certain tactics could hurt that progress.” She said the department is planning to research vaccine hesitancy and that the changes are in response to “an intense national conversation that is affecting how many families evaluate vaccinations in general.”The jump from COVID-19-specific rollbacks to generalized rollbacks concerns Adriane Casalotti, chief of public and government affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “This is a very clear case of COVID-19 vaccination policy impacting other vaccinations,” she says. “We’re really concerned about the news that’s coming out of Tennessee.”Carryover from concerns around one vaccine to others has happened before, particularly with the HPV vaccine, Kalichman says. There’swidespread misinformationaround the cancer-preventing shot, and parents turn it down for their kids at high rates. “The vaccine for HPV was politicized, and the politicization and misinformation absolutely undermined vaccine confidence for a new segment of people who were not necessarily vaccine hesitant before,” he says. The situation in Tennessee isn’t unique. At least 15 state legislatures are considering or have passed laws to restrict public health powers, according to an analysisfrom the National Association of County and City Health Officials. In Kansas, a new law would prevent the governor from closing businesses during a public health emergency. In Ohio, the legislature would be able to override any actions by the state health department taken to control infectious diseases.“The fact that traditional, day-to-day public health activities have been impacted in such a blunt way squarely due to politics is really concerning,” Casalotti says. In Tennessee, at least, the law hasn’t changed: the state still haslawsrequiring that kids get vaccinated before school. Instead, the policy changes could make it harder for families to get the information they need to keep track of vaccine schedules and make sure their kids are ready for school in the fall, says Jennifer Reich, a sociologist who studies vaccine hesitancy at the University of Colorado. “Right now I just see a chilling climate for public health officers who are trying to do their best to inform people of how to stay safe during the pandemic, and also how to protect their children from life threatening and disabling illnesses,” she says.“Right now I just see a chilling climate for public health officers”The COVID-19 pandemic isn’t the first time lawmakers have tried to limit public health authority or challenge things like vaccine mandates. Those proposals usually don’t go far, says Casalotti. “The real difference that we’re seeing recently is this traction that so many of them are getting.”It shows that the messaging and misinformation from anti-vaxxers and others on that spectrum are having more of an impact. “The most frightening thing to people like me, and people in public health is when the denialists, the anti-vaxxers, and the anti-science people get the ear of the highest levels of government,” Kalichman says. Kalichman says he wouldn’t be surprised to see what happened in Tennessee happen in other states, particularly in places with heavy resistance to COVID-19 vaccination. It’s easy to predict what could happen next: if state health departments stop promoting or helping people get childhood vaccinations, those vaccination rates could drop.“You’re going to have outbreaks. It’s inevitable that there will be outbreaks of measles, rubella, whatever else if vaccines take a dip,” he says. “It’s just how it works.”",3,Reliable,0.0692957567957568,0.4569621894621893,1223,3,The Verge

Haitian President Jovenel Moise waskilled last Wednesday in an operationthat Haitian authorities say involved at least 28 people, many of them Colombian mercenaries hired through a Florida-based security company. At least one of the men arrested in connection to the assassination by Haitian authorities previously worked as an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA said in a statement in response to CNN.“At times, one of the suspects in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise was a confidential source to the DEA,” the DEA said in a statement. Haitian police arrest suspect accused of orchestrating President's assassination“Following the assassination of President Moise, the suspect reached out to his contacts at the DEA. A DEA official assigned to Haiti urged the suspect to surrender to local authorities and, along with a US State Department official, provided information to the Haitian government that assisted in the surrender and arrest of the suspect and one other individual,” the DEA said. The DEA said it is aware of reports that some assassins yelled “DEA” at the time of their attack. The DEA said in its statement that none of the attackers were operating on behalf of the agency. Other suspects also hadUS ties, including working as informants for the FBI, the people briefed on the matter said. The FBI said in response to CNN’s reporting that it doesn’t comment on informants, except to say that it uses “lawful sources to collect intelligence” as part of its investigations. Authorities on Monday announced thearrest of a suspectwho they say orchestrated the assassination. Haitian-bornChristian Emmanuel Sanon, 63, entered the country on a private jet in June, Police Chief Leon Charles said at a news conference. Haitian authorities say that Sanon hired the Florida-based company CTU Security, which they alleged recruited men initially to provide security for Sanon, though their mission appears to have changed thereafter.“He came to Haiti accompanied by a few people in the beginning of June, these people were supposed to ensure his security and his business,” said Charles at the news conference. “He came with the intention to take over as President of the Republic.”Two Colombian suspects who were killed in Haiti by police also had links to CTU Security, which is owned by a Venezuelan national, said Colombian police on Monday. They have requested assistance from the US Interpol office to investigate the company’s data. It’s not clear that the men who worked as US law enforcement informants wittingly participated in the assassination plot or were aware of the mission, the people briefed on the matter said. Haitians hope 'the truth will come out' as foreign investigators probe assassination of their PresidentCNN has not been able to reach Sanon or his representatives for comment since his arrest. A delegation from the US, including representatives from the State Department and Department of Homeland Security, returned from Port-au-Prince on Monday and briefed President Joe Biden,according to the White House. Biden said later on Monday that he was “closely following the events in Haiti,” and that the US was “ready to continue to provide assistance.”Haitian authorities have provided limited details on the investigation, but the growing number of Florida connections to the plot appears to portray an operation at least partly hatched in the United States. Three American citizens have now been arrested in Haiti for their alleged involvement, according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price. That may increase the likelihood that the US Justice Department could bring charges against any US participants in the plot. On Monday, the Justice Department said it would “investigate whether there were any violations of US criminal law” in connection with the assassination. Senior officials have conducted an initial assessment, and the department would continue assisting Haitian authorities to investigate “the facts and circumstances surrounding this heinous attack,” said a spokesperson in a statement.

The council announced last week it had reached an agreement with A2Dominion, which provides student housing, to lease its Canterbury House until July 2021. It has also extended its current lease on the youth hostel run by the nonprofit YHA until the end of March. In March, the government issued an ‘everyone inside’ direction for local English councils to provide emergency housing for rough sleepers and vulnerable homeless people to prevent the spread of coronavirus—and to date, there have been no confirmed cases of the virus among homeless people in Oxford. The council has been working closely with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to deliver interim accommodation and has applied for funding from the £105 million pot unveiled last month.:City in Alaska is Housing its Homeless – Which Makes It Possibly The ‘Nicest Place’ in America“The lockdown period gave us a unique opportunity to engage with people in emergency accommodation. For many of them, the certainty of a safe bed gave the bit of stability they needed to start having conversations about leaving the streets behind for good. We’ve already helped 76 people to move on into more sustainable housing, and this is something we want to keep doing,” said Councillor Mike Rowleyin a statement on July 30. Canterbury House and the YHA provide 76 and 42 rooms of self-contained accommodation respectively. A further six rooms are available in a block already leased from University College for people displaying symptoms of coronavirus, which so far, has not been needed. Interim housing is a bridge between emergency lockdown arrangements and more sustainable housing. The acquisition of Canterbury House and extension of the YHA lease mean the council will be able to maintain accommodation for people housed during lockdown as existing agreements with hotels and colleges come to an end this month.:Hotel Stays Open During Lockdowns to House Homeless Locals; And They’re Repaying the Favor With Odd JobsIt will also allow the council to provide accommodation and support for people who become homeless over the coming months. This will include winter beds that were provided in shared spaces before the pandemic. A total of 203 people have been housed in hotel and student rooms in Oxford over the past four months. Of these, 76 have been supported into more permanent housing and this includes a number of people who had been sleeping rough on a long term basis. Consolidating the current patchwork of hotel and student rooms into two main locations will make it easier to provide intensive personal support that helps more people off the streets for good. St Mungo’s will continue to manage this interim housing from these two locations in addition to the outreach, assessment and support services it currently provides for the council.:People Are Installing Portable Hand-Washing Sinks for the Homeless in Cities Across the USConverting Canterbury House from student accommodation to interim housing will require planning permission for a temporary change of use. The council is arranging the consultation necessary to facilitate a planning application. It is also working with Thames Valley Police and other partners on plans to inform local residents about the change of use and give them an opportunity to express their views.“We believe that nobody should have to sleep rough in Oxford and I’d like to thank Oxford Brookes University, A2Dominion, the YHA, University College and St Mungo’s for helping us to provide the interim accommodation that could make our ambition a reality,” added Rowley. Luke Hall MP, Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, said: “We now have a real opportunity to ensure that as many people as possible do not return to a life on the streets. Nationally, we are delivering 6,000 longer-term, safe homes for former rough sleepers. Together with our Rough Sleeping Initiative this amounts to over £500m funding to help break the cycle of homelessness and end rough sleeping for good.”:Canadian Government Buys Hotels to House Homeless People—And Also Rehire Workers()",3,Reliable,0.0950471698113207,0.437814465408805,858,3,Good News Network

Barely two months into the Biden presidency and we are suddenly seeing a concentrated campaign to convince the nation that there is some sort of major crisis unfolding at the border as thousands of undocumented migrants, many of them children, arrive in search of asylum and opportunity. The “crisis” narrative is quickly being picked up even by usually somewhat objective media outlets.“There’s a new surge of kids at the border, but the Biden administration won’t call it a crisis!” warns Zachary B Wolf at CNN.com, while Reuters announced, “Number of migrant children in U. S. border facilitiessoars amid growing crisis.” Congressional Republicans were delighted and continued pounding the message, spending the past week holding press conferences and border-wall photoshoots warning about the “Biden Border Crisis.”What's happening at the border is more than a crisis. This is human heartbreak. And it was created by the policies of President Biden.pic.twitter.com/PNUUoXy6NZ— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader)March 15, 2021The inherently negative framing of the reality that there are more people arriving than the immigration system is currently capable of handling is extremely problematic in and of itself. Obsessively labeling the situation as a “crisis” inherently designates the arrival of migrants as a negative event and flies in the face of the values we like to pretend this nation was founded on. What itis is a problem of logistics and red tape that can and must be aggressively dealt with by the government, but it is not a “crisis.”The insistence on calling it a crisis is a reflection of the right-wing’s need to rile up xenophobes and smear all undocumented migration as an implicit threat to economic stability and white livelihoods, ironically representing the white supremacist values our nation wasfounded on. It’s painfully clear that the status quo among the Very Serious News Media is that they consider undocumented migration as inherently a negative thing and that deportations, asylum rejection, and disincentivizing migration are somehow a “moderate position.”Even worse, the media is playing into the false Republican narrative that Joe Biden’s reversal of the sadistically cruel policies of the Trump administration is being interpreted as a green light for anyone and everyone to come to the United States, because this time they know that they won’t have their children torn away from them or be dumped across the border in a Mexican shantytown. Every so-called “patriot” or Beltway bozo who criticizes the Biden administration for treating immigrants with a modicum of basic human decency should take a long look in the mirror and reflect on what it actually means to be an American and what they want this country to stand for. There is nothing moderate or good about turning our back on people seeking safety and economic opportunity, especially since the instability and violence in their home countries can inevitably be traced back to American imperialism in the first place. Yes, there are too many people at the border for our inherently racist and cruel immigration system to take care of at the moment. Much of the blame for that rests with Donald Trump, whose administration deliberately fought to create the perception of a “crisis” and thus justify the vicious “solutions” that skull-faced freaks like Stephen Miller concocted to punish migrants for seeking safety and opportunity in the United States. This does not make it “Biden’s fault,” nor does it change the fact that the Biden administration will not be able to flip a switch overnight —especially since the outgoing Trump officials did everything they could tosabotage the incoming administration. It is true that the Biden team needs to act decisively and quickly to unstick the gears on processing immigrants and finding them good lodging, and all indications show that the Biden team is working to do so. But too many “people want to emigrate to America” should never be considered aand playing into this rhetoric accomplishes nothing but promote white nationalist narratives and distortions.",1,Questionable,0.0403670323928944,0.414254615116684,909,1,Occupy Democrats

When wildfires break out during “wildfire season,” scorching thousands of acres of mismanaged, overgrown forests, expect climate alarmists to claim human-caused climate change is causing them, even though wildfires have always been sparked at this time of year (thus the existence of the term “wildfire season”). The third in the trifecta of weather-related horror stories we can expect to read about every summer is drought. Droughts are normal and natural. At any point in time, portions of the United States and the world suffer from a drought of some length and severity.

But that a drought is occurring somewhere, sometime is almost a certainty. Some regions of the world and places in the United States are more prone to drought than others, of course. Those same areas are also more prone to prolonged droughts of multiple months, years, and sometimes even decades or millennia. The western United States is one such area. This year’s drought-scare climate hype season has begun. A recentYahoo! Newsarticle promoted the false claim human-caused climate change is responsible for a “historic” drought in California and the western United States.“Back-to-back dry years in conjunction with above-average temperatures have exacerbated drought conditions across the American West, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on its website,” notes Yahoo News. “The extent of the drought is unprecedented in recorded history…”Data show “back-to-back” dry years are not unusual in California or the western United States, even in recorded history. Neither California nor the western United States is experiencing a mega-drought. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) resurrected Climate Change Indicator series mid-May post titled“Climate Change Indicators: Drought,”undermines Yahoo News’ “historic” drought fairy tale.“Average drought conditions across the nation have varied over time,” writes EPA. “The 1930s and 1950s saw the most widespread droughts, while the last 50 years have generally been wetter than average [see the figure below]. Over the entire period… the overall trend has been toward wetter conditions,” wrote EPA. EPA’s report confirms what other sources of data demonstrate. As reported in,for example, the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports America is currently undergoing its longest period in recorded history with less than 40 percent of the country experiencing “very dry” conditions. Also, the United States in 2017 -- and then again in 2019 -- registered its smallest percentage of land area experiencing drought. In California, for example, 2019 ranked among the state’s wettest years since official records have been kept. Interestingly, Yahoo News excludes the western states of Colorado and Wyoming from its analysis. Perhaps that’s because had Yahoo News included data from these two states, it would have further undermined the claim that the drought in the American West was historic. In less than six months, the area of Colorado experiencing some level of drought fell from 100 percent to less than 50 percent. The area of Colorado experiencing severe drought conditions or worse, declined from 93 percent of the state to approximately 35 percent at present. By contrast, in June 2020, nearly 99 percent of Wyoming was drought-free. This has changed. At present, 24 percent of Wyoming is experiencing at least severe drought, still far below Yahoo News’ assertion that 72 percent of the western United States was suffering from a severe, multi-year drought. Colorado and Wyoming’s precipitation records show how dramatically drought conditions can change in short periods. The lesson: drought comes and goes, lingering in some places longer than in others. Research conclusively demonstrates the current drought in the western United States is not historic in length or severity. In the bookThe West Without Water,the authors note, “Prolonged droughts -- some of which lasted more than a century -- brought thriving civilizations, such as the ancestral Pueblo (Native Americans) of the Four Corners region, to starvation, migration, and finally collapse.”Indeed, research shows decade-long droughts happen once or twice a century in the western United States. What’s more,droughts lasting for multiple decadesoccur a few times each millennium. To conclude, “back-to-back” years of drought are hardly uncommon, and don’t count as mega-droughts. Also, because mega-droughts in the western United States have lasted for decades and even centuries, it is impossible to attribute current drought conditions, barely two years old, to human-caused global warming. Americans should know these facts. Especially as the mainstream media and radical climate alarmists bombard the public with reports claiming human-caused climate change is causing a historic mega-drought in the West and that conditions will become worse in the future unless Americans cede power to international climate experts and cease using fossil fuels.

S. Capitol on Wednesday, I went, “hmm, I know that name.”I know that name, as do West Virginia’s abortion advocates, because before Evans won his election in November, Evans was most-known as the ringleader of the weekly protests by anti-abortion radicals at the Women’s Health Center, the sole abortion clinic left in the entire state. Before a restraining order was filed against himby a volunteer clinic escort, Evans would regularly show up outside of the clinic, and, according to the clinic staff, would harass and threaten both patients and the clinic’s staff. The Women’s Health Center in Charleston, West Virginia is an unassuming, single-story beige brick…Last June, I went to Charleston to write about the clinic as well as Evans and his crew of dangerous activists:The recent protests at the Women’s Health Center, first organized by Derrick Evans, an attention-hungry anti-abortion activistwho began livestreaming the protests on his Facebook page, are part of anationwide uptickof harassment at abortion clinics. While it’s unclear why they began organizing, clinic staff speculated that it’s partly due to the passage of theReproductive Health Actin New York state. “They are misogynists, they’re racists, they’re homophobes. They’re just the ultimate bigots,” Lewis said bluntly of the protesters. She remembered one particularly unsettling moment during one of Evans’s early protests: “He’s livestreaming his conversation with this other friend of his who is saying, ‘I’m on my way. I’m bringing my 9mm [gun].’”It should come as no surprise that there is some overlap between the rightwing Christian extremist anti-abortion movement and those who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday. Both groups believe in the use of force and violence towards their aims, both believe their individual reality to be the only truth, and their particular goals the only righteous ones. Evans, for his part, is now belatedly realizing the consequences of his actions. After posting the video of him and a crew of others entering the Capitol, he then deleted it from his Facebook page anduploaded a statementwhere he attempted to claim that he was simply there to film the coup attempt “as an independent member of the media.”Unfortunately for him, othersdownloaded his videobefore he deleted it. In it, he can be seen shouting, “Trump! Trump! Trump!” and whooping before he pushes through the doors and, in a lucky break for investigators, screams, “Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” once inside. Democrats in West Virginia are nowcalling for Evans to be prosecuted and to resignfrom office. According tonews reports, Evans now faces federal charges for illegally entering the Capitol. Over the weekend, Evanswas arrested and subsequentlyreleased on bond. In a video taken during his arrest, Evan’sgrandmother praised both Evans and Donald Trump.“He’s a fine man,” she said of her grandson, before adding, “And thank you Mr. Trump, for inviting that riot at the White House.” (She perhaps meant the U. S. Capitol, but point taken.)On Saturday, after initiallyrefusing calls from even the Republican Governor Jim Justiceto resign, Evansannounced his resignationfrom the West Virginia House of Delegates, effective immediately. In a statement, Evans wrote, “The past few days have certainly been a difficult time for my family, colleagues and myself, so I feel it’s best at this point to resign my seat in the House and focus on my personal situation and those I love.”",2,Generally Reliable,-0.0048602439227439,0.4208868055021902,816,1,Jezebel

S. military involvement there. Taliban fightersenteredKabul Sunday demanding unconditional surrender after wresting nearly the entire country from government control in a matter of weeks. Biden had justpledgedsupport for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and other leaders ""as they seek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a political settlement."" But by Sunday, Ghani had fled the country. It seemed all that was left for the Biden administration at that hour was damage control. ""This is not Saigon,"" U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arguedon CNNSunday morning, rejecting comparisons to the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 two years after U. S. troops were pulled out. But even as he spoke, helicopters were rushing toevacuatepersonnel from the U. S. embassy in Kabul.'Forever war' in Afghanistan resulted in fewer terror attacksAnd behind the broad news of bedlam were voices of thousands reduced to living in abject fear with the Taliban's arrival; many, if not most, of them women who face a crushing and uncertain future of subjugation under a famously mysogynistic regime.""Keep us in your prayers,"" a terrified woman hiding in Kabul texted her sister, an Afghan-American living in the United States, as terrorists raged through the capital. That was her last message. A brief history of Biden's Afghanistan decision-making since taking office makes one thing abundantly clear – the disaster that unfolded Sunday didn't have to happen. After 20 years of war, there was palpable frustration by most Americans with the failure of three successive presidents to achieve anything other than a stalemate in Afghanistan. George Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 drew valuable military resources away from the Afghan fight. One outside chance for peace, however, was apledgeby Taliban leaders last year to open negotiations with the Kabul government. President Donald Trump used this as an excuse to pull all but a few thousand troops out of Afghanistan. This July Fourth, America will leave Afghanistan independence in its death throesBiden could have conditioned any further drawdown on good faith efforts by the Taliban to reach a peaceful settlement with Kabul. But over theobjectionsof military leaders who warned that the Afghan government would collapse without U. S. security assistance, Biden decided in April toendmilitary involvement by September. He promised troop withdrawal wouldn't be hasty. But, in fact, most were gone by early July. (The largest U. S. airbase was abandoned so suddenly that Afghan troops couldn't evenfigure outhow to turn the electricity back on.)It was a choice with disastrous consequences. Any incentive for the Taliban to negotiate peace was gone. A security umbrella of U. S. air cover that had staved off battlefield defeats for Afghan troops evaporated. (A small Afghan air force with pilots overworked and targeted for assassination has not been up to the task.) And crucially, the morale disintegrated among frontline Afghan troops already poorly fed, denied pay and deprived of bullets and fuel. Hundredssurrenderedwithout firing a shot. Biden needs to learn the lesson of Operation Linebacker""Brother, if no one else fights, why should I fight?"" one Afghan soldier said, according to a Washington Postreport. A Taliban offensive that began with vacuuming up countless district centers manned by small numbers of security personnel in July accelerated inAugustto the capture of all major cities north, south and west until insurgents reached the gates of Kabul. Shortly before those fighters reached the city, Biden had ordered5,000U. S. troops into Kabul to assist evacuating U. S. personnel, and it was unclear Sunday just exactly what was developing on the ground there. But here is where there is no ambiguity:► Since the Taliban offensive, a growing humanitarian crisis has unfolded with250,000people fleeing their homes, all in the midst of a pandemic. And there are troublingreportsof Taliban atrocities and score-settling.►The White House said20,000Afghans were seeking special immigrant visas fearing for their lives because of working with Americans. They have tens of thousands of family members. How many got out and how many were left behind?►Others in danger include womenactivistswho also should have been included in any evacuations.►Biden's ""America is back"" foreign-policy pledge to the world after years of Trump's global fecklessness now lies in ruins. The president may have decided in April to militarily abandon Afghanistan to avoid further U. S. troop casualties. But he may wind up with the blood of U. S. friends and freedom activists on his hands, not only because of his decision to so rapidly exit, but because of his ensuing failure to carry out that mission before the Taliban aggression he unwittingly unleashed changed everything.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0277588813303098,0.3664115646258504,1098,3,USA Today
88,New First Daughter Ashley Biden Plans ‘Social Justice’ Agenda,0.33,42.0,https://heavy.com/news/joe-biden-daughter-ashley-biden/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,21,"GettyAshley BidenPresident-electJoe Biden’sdaughter is a fairly private figure, but she plans to advocate for the cause of “social justice.”That’s what she told former President George W. Bush’s daughter, Jenna Hager, in an interviewwith. On January 20, 2021, Ashley becomes the new First Daughter when her father is sworn in as the nation’s 46th president. Ashley Biden told Hager that she plans “to advocate for social justice, for mental health, to be involved in community development and revitalization.” According to CNN, the new First Daughter is so private that she doesn’t even have social media accounts and, unlike Ivanka Trump, she doesn’t plan to hold a position in the new administration. Ashley Biden is the only daughter of former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden. The Bidens also raised Joe’s sons from his first marriage, Beau and Hunter. Joe Biden did have another daughter, who died very young. Tragically, Beau died at age 46 of a brain tumor. Biden’s first daughter, Naomi, died young with his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, in a tragic car crash. Ashley is Joe’s surviving child, along with Hunter, who was the son of Joe and Neilia. Here’s what you need to know:To Hager, Biden explained why she doesn’t have social media accounts, saying, “The cruelty and the meanness, that’s why I’m not, I don’t have a social media account that’s public. Part of it is also having boundaries for myself, because I believe in kindness. I believe in the humanity of all of us.”The List once describedAshley Biden as “a social worker, activist, and entrepreneur with a passion for creating permanent change,” especially issues relating to poverty. The Washington Examiner reported that Biden was working for a Delaware nonprofit organization, the Delaware center for Justice, that received a $166,000 federal grant supported by Joe Biden. Then 38, Ashley Biden had worked for the group for a year and was promoted to executive director,according to Examiner, which added that the grant is designed to “strengthen local law enforcement.”In 2019, Biden announced she was leaving the group througha statement on Facebook.“Working with DCJ has been one of the great honors of my life,” she said. “Together we have changed the landscape of justice reform, violence intervention, and victim services for the State of Delaware. I leave DCJ in capable hands, with a passionate and committed staff, a talented board and the infrastructure to continue to support DCJ’s vision. I am confident that the organization will continue to thrive and provide essential services to our community.” She didn’t explain why she was quitting, but it came as her dad was said to be considering a presidential run. Being the daughter of a prominent politician who has served for so long has come with challenges for Biden.“Any achievement that I accomplished, many people attributed to the fact that I was his daughter,” she once said,according to The List. She praised both her mother and father, saying, “I was taught by both of my parents to work hard, to be passionate about whatever I did, and I felt that I did that and kind of got to where I am today because of hard work and passion and determination.”Biden told Glamour magazinethat public service was in her DNA, saying, “The passion started at a very young age. My dad is a lifelong public servant; my mom was a public-school teacher—it’s in my DNA.”Vice-President Joe Biden walks with daughter Ashley, right, as wife Jill waves to the crowd in the Inaugural Parade January 20, 2009, in Washington, D. C. Vice-President Joe Biden walks with daughter Ashley, right, as wife Jill waves to the crowd in the Inaugural Parade January 20, 2009, in Washington, D. C. To Hager, Biden discussed the tragic loss of her brother, Beau. She said he “will be there with us,” adding, “He was 46 when he passed. Dad will be the 46th president.”She also revealed that Joe Biden has a rule relating to his children: “We have a rule, still today, that no matter where Dad is, no matter what meeting he’s in, if one of the kids’ call, you have to get him out.”Biden has worked for years on animal welfare issues.“When I was a kid, I always really loved animals, and I found out that Bonne Bell lip gloss was testing on animals, so I organized my school to start writing letters to [the company],” she told the magazine. “Then I became obsessed with the plight of dolphins getting stuck in tuna nets. My dad connected me with Congressman Barbara Boxer, who I nicknamed the ‘dolphin lady,’ and she got me onto the floor to help lobby Republican congressman for The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act.”Biden told Elle that she was motivated by her parents’ jobs. “I got a real sense that some people had a lot, and some had nothing at all,” Biden told Elle. “Even as a child, I had a hard time reconciling the inherent unfairness of it all.”On LinkedIn, Biden lists experience as an education and employment liaison with the Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families from 2007 to 2012; employment and education specialist at West End Neighborhood House in Wilmington, Delaware, from 2006 to 2007; and a clinical support specialist at NHS Children’s Reach Clinic in Philadelphia from 2003 to 2006.

She also said Dr. Jill Biden reminds her husband to put his cereal bowl away. According to Elle magazine, Biden started Livelihood, an “ethically produced, American-made clothing company.” The fashion line contained “supersoft organic cotton hoodies.”Her debut collection proceeds were going to “alleviate poverty through education, training, and job placement,” Elle reported.

89,"No Matter Who Biden Chooses as VP, It Will Be a Bittersweet Win for Women",-22.67,36.33,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/suffrage-female-vice-president/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"Once upon a time, many American women looked forward to a euphoric 100th anniversary celebration of the 19th Amendment, which belatedly granted us the vote, to be led this month by the nation’s first woman president. We still celebrate, though that much-anticipated president lost to a confessed sexual predator whose administration is dedicated to rolling back women’s rights. As I write, we are also preparing to celebrate the Democratic Party’s second nomination of a woman for vice president, though I don’t know who she is yet. (Readers might by the time they read this.) But we know that Joe Biden, who might have skipped a third run for president to back one of the four women senators who ran in 2020, promised to pick a female running mate before he sealed the nomination—a consolation prize of sorts for the largest bloc of American voters. We will, of course, accept that consolation prize and go forth to save American democracy, as women voters have been doing since Donald Trump’s election shocked many of us (too many of us, especially white women) into passionate activism almost four years ago. And not just activism: An unprecedented number of women ran for and won offices around the country, inspired by the Women’s Marches that heralded the rise of a real resistance. Whomever Biden chooses, it will be a victory for women, though bittersweet (especially if his choice is a centrist). If a woman is ever to occupy the Oval Office, it seems, even 100 years after we won the vote, even after we powered the anti-Trump resistance, she will have to spend some time directly apprenticing to a man, living at a safe distance from actual power at the Naval Observatory. And whoever gets the nod from Biden, we all know, has had to endure the same sexist stereotyping as did the women senators who had the audacity to run for president against him and as Hillary Clinton did in 2016. On this happy centennial, though, let’s not be bitter. Nobody likes a bitter woman. Also, let’s not be too ambitious. An early front-runner to become Biden’s pick, 2018 Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, got dinged for appearing to campaign for the job. And let’s not be too smart. Another early contender, Senator Elizabeth Warren, was a policy wonk who, we were warned, would serve her own agenda and not necessarily Biden’s. Let’s not criticize our male competitors, either, as Senator Kamala Harris did running against Biden last year—though he did the same running against Barack Obama in 2008 (the year Biden became his running mate). Despite that history, former senator Chris Dodd, who is helping Biden with the VP search (and who also ran against Obama, as well as Biden), was offended by Harris’s lack of “remorse” for critiquing Biden’s anti-busing stance in one of the primary debates. That appeared to create an opening for former national security adviser Susan Rice, who is also Black and worked closely with Biden in the Obama administration. But some critics lament that the former diplomat has sharp elbows, another thing women should avoid. The issues with Harris and Rice led Dodd and others to begin pushing California Representative Karen Bass, a former state House speaker, with some suggesting she is a kind of multicultural Goldilocks: Black but not too competitive or abrasive or wonky. Just right to be No. 2. Which is insulting to the assertive, confident Bass. By the end of the vetting period, it seemed the 11th commandment of women’s politics, 100 years after we won the vote, was “Thou shalt never be just right.” I am nonetheless looking forward to celebrating the centennial of suffrage—and to voting for the Democrats’ second female vice presidential nominee. But I am just so tired of fighting all we’ve had to fight to get here. Is this an inspiring anniversary message? Not entirely. Is it rage-inducing? I hope so. We should use that rage to work for the female candidates running this year, from VP on down, so the women coming after us have a different story to tell 100 years from now.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0800309389292439,0.4213814904492871,891,2,The Nation

91,The Case for Removing Donald Trump,-5.67,42.67,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-case-for-removing-donald-trump,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-09,25,"One day after a mob incited byDonald Trumpstormed and ransacked the Capitol, disrupting Congress’s certification of election results, Chuck Schumer, the soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader, and Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, said the President should be removed from office. Both proposed theTwenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution, with Schumer describing it as the most effective legal means of removal. Under Section 4 of the amendment, which has been asubject of discussionthroughout Trump’s Presidency, if a majority of the Cabinet were to join with Vice-President Mike Pence to declare to Congress that Trump is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” Pence would “immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.” As Schumer said, “it can be done today.” The Cabinet was said to be considering it, but Pence reportedly opposes it. On Friday, Pelosi announced that the House would begin impeachment proceedings if Trump does not immediately resign. On Monday, at least a hundred and seventy House Democrats plan to introduce an article of impeachment charging Trump with “willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States.”There is little doubt that Trump did incite a mob to attack the Capitol in order to interfere with Congress’s performance of its constitutional duty in our democracy. On Wednesday, he gathered a crowd of thousands of supporters, fomented anger at an election that he falsely said had been stolen, and urged them to “walk down to the Capitol” and “fight much harder.” He goaded, “You’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.” Thereported that Trump was initially pleased as his supporters stormed into the Capitol and that he resisted requests to call in the National Guard to help stop them. Just after 4P. M., when the rioters had been terrorizing the Capitol for nearly two hours, Trump posted a video in which he urged them to go home, but told them, “We love you. You’re very special.” Pipe bombs were found at both parties’ headquarters, and a cooler of Molotov cocktails was recovered from the Capitol grounds, underscoring the fact that the violence could easily have been far worse. There will be time to assess Trump’s criminal liability for his leadership of the insurrection; right now the urgent issue is the danger of having him remain President until January 20th. For weeks, Trump considered imposing martial law in order to use military force toward overturning the election. Senior military officials were so concerned about the possibility that all the living former Defense Secretaries made ajoint statementdenouncing it. Trump remains Commander-in-Chief, even as we face the risk of further riots incited by him; the government would need to mount an effective, disciplined, strategic response, which he can’t possibly be entrusted to lead. He still has access to nuclear codes; simply hoping that military or other personnel would disobey his commands highlights how insecure and untenable the situation is. He may yet issue destructive and self-serving executive orders—if we have to wish for officials to ignore or thwart them, that, too, promotes an air of lawlessness in our governance. He may attempt topardon himselffor crimes, and now has even clearer incentive to do so. In the coming days, we can expect Trump’s rage and instability to intensify, as former allies blame him for the violence, members of his Administration leave their posts, and House Democrats once again prepare for impeachment, this time expecting some Republican support. His own Justice Department has suggested that it will not rule out charging him under federal laws against inciting riot. Trump has already attempted to remain in power without regard to law or reality, and has consistently shown vengefulness toward those who thwart him. Even after Wednesday’s calamity, he is said to have remarked that he was happy that the two Republican Senate candidates in the Georgia runoff elections had lost their races, because they didn’t adequately defend him. In his statement on Thursday, forecasting “an orderly transition on January 20th,” he also vowed that “it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!” It’s no longer reasonable to believe that his stated intent to fight on is mere rhetoric. As Pelosi said, “any day can be a horror show.”By Thursday, the Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao, and the Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, had resigned from Trump’s Cabinet. But this is not the time for Cabinet secretaries to be resigning in horror. It is, instead, time for them to take seriously their responsibility under the Constitution to determine whether Trump is able to govern until the new President is sworn in. If Pence and a majority of the Cabinet were indeed to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment, and declare that Trump is unable to serve, Pence would automatically become the acting President. Trump presumably would then insist that “no inability exists,” as the Constitution allows the President to do, but Pence and the Cabinet majority could immediately override that claim with a second declaration, all while Pence would continuein the Presidential role. To complete the removal, the amendment then requires a two-thirds vote by Congress that the President is unable to serve—and the vote must be taken within twenty-one days of the Cabinet’s second declaration. But, in our current situation, Congress need not act at all, because in less than two weeksJoe Bidenwill become President. The antidemocratic implications of removing a duly elected President should make us extremely wary of invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment. But the violence that Trump has caused, and his resistance to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power, justify its implementation. At this point, it appears most likely that the Cabinet will not act, and that Congress will, for the second time, impeach Trump. A benefit of removal via impeachment is that the Senate could, as part of its remedy for conviction, prohibit Trump from running for federal office again. The process would take longer than the Twenty-fifth Amendment route. Congress could vote to adopt much simpler procedures than the ones used in 2019. However, the fact that a hundred and thirty-nine congressmen and eight senators went through with objecting to valid Electoral College votes for Biden, even after a violent siege on their workplace and on democracy, suggests that Trump loyalists are likely to resist haste in removing him. The Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, has indicated that, according to Senate rules, an impeachment trial would likely not begin until the day of Biden’s Inauguration. Still, achieving a House majority for impeachment would not be difficult, and even the two-thirds vote needed for conviction in the Senate is not out of the question. This kaleidoscope of legal possibilities brings into focus the key example of Richard Nixon, who resigned the Presidency on the eve of his impeachment, after a delegation of his own party’s lawmakers informed him that the Senate would remove him from office if he did not resign. Nixon soon received a pardon for federal crimes that he might have committed in office, from President Gerald Ford. Ford denied that there had been any deal to exchange the resignation for the pardon, but it strains credulity to think there was no understanding at all. If McConnell were to put it to Trump that he could be removed by the Senate, but that if he resigned, then Pence, as President, could consider a pardon, it’s conceivable that Trump would take that deal. He might even brag about it. It might strike McConnell and Pence, too, as an advantageous pact. If Trump resigns voluntarily, his supporters and cultists are less likely to falsely believe that their beloved leader was removed by a Republican coup, which Pence and McConnell may well be concerned about. And given the precedent of the Nixon pardon having been left unchallenged, the Biden Administration is unlikely to want to challenge the validity of Pence’s pardon of Trump by attempting to bring a federal prosecution. However the legal drama ends, the worst option for the country is allowing Trump to remain in office until Inauguration Day.",3,Reliable,0.0109184796684796,0.4949249824249824,1760,3,The New Yorker

93,Mike Golic’s long ESPN career will come to a close at Fiesta Bowl,-0.33,43.17,https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2020/12/mike-golics-long-espn-career-will-come-to-a-close-at-fiesta-bowl.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-31,18,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Mike Golic’s 22-year tenure at ESPN comes to an end Saturday. The Cleveland native will serve as analyst for the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl game between Oregon and Iowa State in what will be his last assignment for the network. Golic, the pride of St. Joseph High School and a National Association of Broadcasters Broadcasting Hall of Famer, confirmed on Twitter his contract is up. When asked by a follower why he is leaving ESPN,Golic replied, “You’d have to ask them.”In November,the network announcedit was laying off about 300 employees and leaving 200 open positions unfilled due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the Associated Press reported some contracts would also be allowed to expire. Trey Wingo, Golic’s former co-host, left ESPN last month. Dan Le Batard, another longtime on-air personality, will host his last show at the network on Monday. Golic worked several college football games this season after his morning radio show with Wingo was canceled in July after less than three years on the air. Golic spent the previous 18 years alongside Mike Greenberg on “Mike & Mike.”In a Twitter post last week, he reflected on his career during one last visit to the ESPN campus.“There have been many changes since it became my work home in Oct. of 1998. Some good, some not so good,” Golic wrote. “I’ve made many friends through the years and have had many great experiences, but what seemed most fitting to me was the last person I saw when I left, it was my son Mike, and while he and Chiney (Ogwumike) are stars on the rise, I can honestly say my most enjoyable years were sharing a mic with him and sharing my family with all of You!!! To those who listened and watched for so many years, THANK YOU, I’m not done, this just closes a chapter, I look forward to what’s next.”Stay tuned. Weird day this Dec. 22nd. While I still have Alamo bowl and Fiesta bowl on my ESPN schedule, I was at ESPN today for the last time. There have been many changes since it became my work home in Oct. of 1998. Some good, some not so good. I’ve made many friends through 1/3and sharing my family with all of You!!! To those who listened and watched for so many years, THANK YOU, I’m not done, this just closes a chapter, I look forward to what’s next.

94,‘This Is a Classic Defense’: Ohio Deputy Who Gunned Down Casey Goodson Has Yet to Submit to Questioning as He Claims Goodson Pointed Gun at Him,-5.67,44.67,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/12/18/this-is-a-classic-defense-ohio-deputy-who-gunned-down-casey-goodson-has-yet-to-submit-to-questioning-as-he-claims-goodson-pointed-gun-at-him/,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,15,"It has been two weeks since a Franklin County sheriff’s deputyshot and killedCasey Christopher Goodson Jr., a 23-year-old Black man, as he walked into his north Columbus, Ohio home. In the days since, national fervor has grown over Goodson’s death, several conflicting accounts have emerged publicly, rallies and protests have stepped off, and at least one law enforcement official has walked back his initial comments about the Dec. 4 shooting. One thing has not happened in that span. Jason Meade, the officer who squeezed the trigger to fire the shots that killed Goodson, has yet to be questioned by investigators. The Columbus Dispatch broke the news Wednesday that Meade had not been interviewed. The 17-year Franklin County Sheriff’s Office veteran remains on paid administrative leave, the newspaper reported. It’s not clear when he will give an official statement to investigators. There are indications what Meade will say when he finally does sit down with investigators. Mark Collins, the deputy’s Columbus attorney, issued astatementDec. 10, claiming Meade fired after Goodson pointed his gun at the deputy.“At no time did deputy Meade mistake a sandwich for a gun,” Collins said. “Mr. Goodson pointed his gun at deputy Meade. There has been confirmation that our client gave verbal commands for Mr. Goodson to drop the gun.”Attorneys representing Goodson’s family issued a statement to counter that claim, saying Meade’s story did not align with previous reports from authorities immediately after the shooting.“Despite what Jason Meade now claims were the circumstances surrounding this shooting, the public should not forget that neither the city of Columbus nor any other investigatory agency has alleged that Casey Goodson pointed a gun before Meade pulled the trigger,” read the statement from the Watson + Brown law firm. “With Meade’s statement issued nearly one week after he killed Casey, it is critical to note that this is a classic defense often claimed by police after they shoot and kill someone. It is also critical to remember that often the evidence does not support these claims.”Meade, a SWAT Team deputy, was assigned to a U. S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force that was searching for violent suspects near Goodson’s home the afternoon of Dec. 4. As they were wrapping up for the day, Meade claimed he saw Goodson driving by waving a gun and followed him to his home, according to federal marshals. Goodson was licensed to carry a concealed weapon and was not the target of the U. S. Marshals fugitive manhunt. Authorities claim Goodson brandished a gun. But family members said he was carrying keys, a face mask and Subway sandwiches in his hands when Meade opened fire as he unlocked the door to his family’s home. Franklin County Corner Dr. Anahi M. Ortiz announced on Dec. 10 that she ruled Goodson’s death ahomicide. Peter Tobin, head of the U. S. Marshals’ Southern District of Ohio, told reporters the shooting appeared to be “justified” on the day of the incident. Tobin issued a statement this week calling that initial assessment “premature.”“I previously provided commentary after arriving at the scene of the incident and made statements based on insufficient information that I received prior to the beginning of the official investigation into the shooting incident,” Tobin said. “It was premature for me to provide any opinion, conclusion, or other information about the facts of the incident. Other law enforcement agencies are engaged in an independent, thorough investigation of this incident.”Tobin went on to say Meade was no longer acting in his capacity with the U. S. Marshals Service when he pursued Goodson, because the task force had stopped working for the day, The Associated Pressreported“The officer was acting on his own and in his independent authority as a Franklin County sheriff’s deputy within his home jurisdiction when he encountered Mr. Goodson, and throughout the subsequent incident leading to Mr. Goodson’s death,” the statement read. Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin responded to Tobin’s backpedaling via a Dec. 12 video on the Sheriff’s Office’s Twitter page.“When I read the statement about the U. S. Marshal Tobin now saying that Deputy Jason Meade was acting as a Franklin County deputy and not as U. S. Marshal during the recent shooting incident, I was more than surprised,” Baldwin said. “It’s been eight days. And if that was the correct decision eight days ago, I should have been informed. And at that point, I would have immediately contacted BCI [Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation] to conduct the investigation, because that’s our policy. I don’t know why it took eight days, but here we are.”A Statement from Dallas Baldwin.pic.twitter.com/IRuKBTubXgMeade, 42, had a history of violating use-of-force procedures during his career. An investigation bylocal news outlet6 On Your Side found the deputy received an oral reprimand in March 2019 for “violating rules and regulations for deploying his taser on a suspect and didn’t notify his supervision or communications about the use of force.”Additional records showed Meade received less than satisfactory marks on his 2010 performance evaluation, where it was noted that he seems to be “content with only doing the bare minimum to get by.” A more recent evaluation noted he was “highly motivated.”Collins noted that Meade was the only person who witnessed the shooting. No bodycam footage from the incident is available because Franklin County Sheriff’s deputies assigned to the task force aren’t outfitted with them. On Wednesday, Franklin County Commissioners earmarked $2.5 million to fund bodycams for the Sheriff’s Office, according to theMidland Daily News. The board began talking about funding for the devices over the summer following the worldwide wave of protests in the wake of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. But the discussions picked up steam after Goodson’s homicide, the newspaper reported. Goodson’s family is calling for murder charges to filed against Meade. The shooting is being investigated by the Columbus Division of Police’s Critical Incident and Response Team. The U. S. Department of Justice launched a concurrent federal civil rights investigation into Goodson’s death on Dec. 8. Meade had not been charged as of Thursday, Dec. 17. Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan issued a statement Dec. 10 calling for patience from the community.“We hear your questions. We hear your cries for more information and more answers. We hear your demands for justice,” it read. “The difficult reality is, very often in police work, information and answers are necessarily unavoidably slow to come. That is not in the interest of secrecy. It is in the interest of justice.”🚨Media Advisory🚨pic.twitter.com/DIh2crR57C“We understand the painful history evoked by the death of Casey Goodson,” Quinlan continued. “We take to heart, the demands from our community to do better, to be more transparent to be more accountable. We understand the trust gap borne of centuries of injustice against communities of color in our country. And yes, right here in our hometown. … But please understand – fast answers cannot take priority over complete answers.

The closely watched gauge of professional investors indicates that Wall Street is in line with the Federal Reserve's view thatrecent price pressures will lighten upas the year goes on and eventually recede to normal levels. Some 73% of respondents said they see inflation as ""transitory,"" while just 23% say it is permanent. The survey covers 224 panelists with $667 billion under management, and it ran June 4-June 10. The poll covers a gamut of investor issues, from where the economy and markets are heading to how much cash portfolio managers are holding and which trades they see as most overdone. On that last point, investors view commodities as the most-crowded trade, replacing last month's leader, bitcoin. Commodities generally attract big cash when inflation fears are running high, and the most recent readings have shown peaks not seen in well over a decade. The most recent indication came Tuesday, when prices on products and services that companies userose 6.6% over the past year, the biggest gain since the Labor Department started keeping track in August 2010. Even though investors largely agree with the Fed's characterization that the inflation burst will pass, they still see the central bank soon taking the first steps to tightening policy. Respondents see the Fed likely to begin talk of tapering its $120 billion of monthly bond purchases in the coming months. Sixty-three percent expect a signal in August or September, with 38% seeing it coming at the annual Jackson Hole summit in August and 25% expecting it to start at the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The move to reduce bond purchases, however anticipated, could generate a negative market reaction. Survey respondents rated a taper tantrum in the bond market — that is, a sharp uptick in yields — as the biggest ""tail risk,"" or unlikely event that could cause substantial damage. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Investors generally see the market rally continuing. In fact, they've cut cash levels down to 3.9%, which Bank of America says is a contrarian ""sell"" signal.

On Monday, he celebrateda U. S. Supreme Court decision striking down a Louisiana abortion law that would have protected women from shoddy abortion practices.“Today’s decision reaffirmed that states can’t put in place laws that unduly burden a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions—but the fight isn’t over,” Biden wrote. “As President, I’ll codifyRoe v. Wadeand protect a woman’s constitutional right to choose.”Biden claimed the law was “extreme,” but it actually had strong bi-partisan support. Its lead author is a pro-life Democrat woman, state Sen. Katrina Jackson. Passed in 2014, the law required abortionists to have hospital admitting privileges to treat patients with potentially life-threatening complications. Though the state provided evidence of women being abandoned while suffering from abortion complications and abortion facilities failing to meet basic health and safety standards,the high court struck down the law Monday inJune Medical Services v. Russo. The majority ruled that the law was an “undue burden” on women’s access to abortion. LifeNews.comBiden, hoping to win the White House in November, promised to support abortion on demand.“Women’s health care rights have been under attack as states across the country have passed extreme laws restricting women’s constitutional right to choice under any circumstance,” he said in a statement after the ruling. “As President, I will codifyRoe v. Wadeand my Justice Department will do everything in its power to stop the rash of state laws that so blatantly violate a woman’s protected, constitutional right to choose.”He slammed pro-life Republicans for trying to “get rid ofRoe” by passing pro-life laws that President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court justices will support. Both Trump’s nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, dissented from the majority opinion, along with fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.“It’s wrong. It’s pernicious. And, we have to stop it,” Biden insisted. But Biden’s position on abortion better fits those descriptions. By supportingRoe v. Wade, he supports some of the most radical pro-abortion laws in the world. The 1972 ruling made the U. S. one of only seven countries in the world that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It prevents states from passing even modest protections for unborn babies prior to viability, and, if Biden takes office, protections for unborn babies post-viability could go away, too. Unlike most Americans,Biden also supports taxpayer-funded abortions. If he would succeed in this goal, tens of thousands more unborn babies could be slaughtered in abortions every year in America. Evident by his praise of the Supreme Court decision Monday, Biden also opposes protections for women against shoddy abortion practices. In his dissent, Justice Gorsuchsaid Louisiana lawmakers had good reasons to pass the admitting privileges law. He said they heard testimonies from women and emergency room physicians about abortion practitioners’ record of abandoning their patients. One woman told lawmakers that the abortionist kicked her out while she was hemorrhaging, saying: “You’re on your own. Get out.” Later, at a hospital, an emergency room doctor found body parts from her aborted baby still inside her womb, according to the ruling. Another woman who complained of severe pain after her abortion said she was told to go home. But when she went to the emergency room, she said they found a tear in her uterus and “a large hematoma containing a fetal head.”Gorsuch also pointed to new evidence of potential criminal conduct by state abortionists, including failing to report the rape of a minor and performing an abortion on a minor without parental consent. The Louisiana law and others abortion clinic regulations protect women, and they protect unborn babies. But the abortion industry does not want to be accountable to anyone. A Biden presidency would be bad for women and unborn babies. Ignoring vital protections for women and children, he is aligning himself with the interests of the billion-dollar, profit-driven abortion industry.",0,Problematic,0.099767777442196,0.5218646598879157,932,0,Life News

McDonald’s recentlyraised its hourly wagesin some outposts, but many say those concessions are inconsistent and don’t go far enough, particularly given the challenges ofworking through a pandemic. Members of theFight for $15will walk out of locations in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Flint, Houston, and a host of other cities, demanding increased wages across the board as well as union protection and adequate PPE. Below, find the personal stories behind why three McDonald’s workers across the country—Precious Cole, Doneshia Babbit, and Imelda Rosales—are striking on May 19. I’ve been working at McDonald’s for about a month, but I’ve been working in fast food my whole life. I’ve worked at Wendy’s, Freddy’s [a fast-food chain based in Kansas], Little Caesar’s, my first job was at Taco Bell. I’ve pretty much worked at all of them, except for KFC. When I was working at Freddy’s, we had an employee that contracted COVID-19, and the managers knew because we all worked with her. The managers were like, “You have to quarantine yourself for two weeks or go get tested,” and we were all really upset because they basically let her come back to work without getting her negative test results back. Then, when her test results came back, she found out she was positive, and then the whole night crew had to be out for two weeks with no pay. We had to figure out a way to get COVID tested just to come back to work. I’m going out on strike to stand in solidarity with all McDonald’s workers, even though I’ve only been there a short while. McDonald’s has been around forever, and they set the standard for these other fast-food companies to pay us poverty wages. These corporations need to listen to their workers! Whenever I give a speech, I always tell people that these companies are nothing without us. Without us, these jobs would crumble, so we need to stand together and fight for a union and $15 dollars an hour. It’s not enough, but it’s a start. I’ve been working at McDonald’s for over seven years now, and it’s gotten a lot worse since the pandemic. A lot of our employees have quit, so we’re short-staffed most of the time. I started working with the Fight for $15 when I first started at McDonald’s, back in my teens. It just felt like the right thing to do. We said what we need, and we haven’t gotten it, so I’m still fighting. We’re getting paid nickels and dimes, and the shareholders and million-dollar corporations are making money off of our backs. With this strike, I hope to get into the minds of people who haven’t yet seen what we’re working toward. A lot of workers feel unwanted or unneeded based on what they’re being paid or how they’re being treated, so I want to change that. I’ve worked at McDonald’s for over a decade, and I’m on strike today—again—because I know the work I do, the work we all do, is worth $15 per hour. McDonald’s made billions off our labor during a global pandemic, while workers suffered through unsafe working conditions and unlivable wages. I’m tired of McDonald’s putting profits above our safety and keeping workers like me down, and I’ll continue striking and speaking up until workers get a voice on the job.",3,Reliable,0.0913971775578918,0.3941283584140727,827,3,Vogue

C., federal criminal defense att0rneys is that a former member of Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel’s Office (SCO) has “flipped” and is providing information to the investigators regarding the work of the SCO. This is the earliest Tweet I can find on the subject:RUMINT: Talk From Many DC Lawyers Saying One Of Special Counsel Robert#Mueller's Prosecutors Has ""FLIPPED"" & Is Now Cooperating With US Attorney John#Durham's Investigation Into The Origins Of#RussiaCollusionInvestigation. A Single Name Is Being Repeated…Developing…pic.twitter.com/2ulUVGAlHU— John Basham 🇺🇲 (@JohnBasham)October 1, 2020This kind of “rumor” very often turns out to be true, because it is nearly impossible for the legal staffs involved — the Gov’t and the cooperator — to keep a lid on everything. Earlier today, before the Basham Tweet, there was this:Can’t say why without betraying a confidence, but I just had a BIG restoration of faith moment in AG Barr and Durham.— John Cardillo (@johncardillo)October 1, 2020Cardillo is former NYPD and has 200k+ followers on Twitter. He has pretty decent connections in New York law enforcement circles. This rumor follows on the heels of the release last week of records showing several members of the Special Counsel’s Office “wiped” their SCO-issued cell phones clean on one or more occasions. In his book, which was released two days ago, Andrew Weissmann covers this question, writing that Jeannie Rhee cautioned everyone that everything they committed to writing during their work for the SCO would be subject to a later “investigation of the investigators” that was sure to follow, based on her years of experience working in Washington, D. C. JUST SPECULATING, but Weissmann has been agitated almost from the moment he took to Twitter a few months ago over the investigation being conducted by Durham and AG Barr. But his agitation went into overdrive when U. S. Attorney Jensen began looking at the SCO’s handling of the prosecution of General Flynn. It cannot be overlooked that, while most of the more senior DOJ “veterans” on the SCO went to lucrative careers in private practice after departing, several of the younger members of the SCO returned to positions in the Department of Justice. That means they have been subject to potential investigation by internal DOJ disciplinary offices like the Inspector General or Office of Professional Responsibility. Issues like “wiping” their SCO- issued phones without authorization, likely in violation of DOJ policy, might not mean much to Andrew Weissmann and Jeannie Rhee, but for younger attorneys still in DOJ like Brandon Van Grack, Aaron Zelinsky, and Adam Jed, their DOJ careers might hang in the balance — and potentially their licenses to practice law. It is possible they were directed or encouraged to take some actions they now regret, or for which they are now vulnerable to leverage by Durham or other government investigators.

100,New York’s Trumped-Up Tax Evasion Charges,13.0,28.33,https://spectator.org/new-york-tax-evasion-charges-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-06,23,"Using the hyperbolic and sensationalist language of the American ruling class, the New York Timesgleefullyannouncedthat President Trump’s real-estate company and its 73-year-old CFO, Allen H. Weisselberg, have been charged with “running a 15-year scheme to help its executives evade taxes by compensating them with fringe benefits.”“To put it bluntly, this was a sweeping and audacious illegal payments scheme,” said Carey Dunne, general counsel for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., during the arraignment. After more than four years of going after Donald Trump with every weapon in its considerable arsenal, the best the state of New York could come up with is a charge that requires it to prove that the Trump Organization provided fringe benefits to its employees with the intent to allow them to commit tax fraud. Now, I’m aware that a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich if asked to do so, but can someone tell me what might conceivably constitute proof of intent in this case? This sandwich isn’t filled with ham; it’s filled with hog manure. Trump’s accountant Weisselberg stands charged with tax fraud for “accepting secret perks,” which is to say for failing to report the monetary value of fringe benefits. These benefits allegedly include the use of a company car and apartment. Trump is also alleged to have personally paid tuition for the Weisselberg’s grandkids to attend the same private school where his own child was enrolled while in New York. Needless to say, the media is outraged. Bribes tograndkids?School tuition? To what depredations will Donald Trump not descend?One of the problems attendant to aging is the accumulation of memories. A millennial reporter might not remember the name Timothy Geithner, Obama’s 2008 nominee for Treasury secretary, who managed to beignorant of the laweven while he’d been working for the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But a boomer would, and so I did. The IMF considered Geithner to be self-employed and repeatedly gave him specific direction on paying his Social Security and self-employment taxes on IMF income. Yet he failed to pay these taxes from 2001 to 2004. In 2006, an IRS audit revealed the failed payments in 2003 and 2004, on which it imposed interest but waived penalties. A mistake is a mistake, right? Even tax-savvy folks charged with working out substantial loan agreements with foreign countries might be ignorant of their own tax obligations. As for the directions on how to pay taxes provided by his employer, what important, high-ranking person has the time to read every little memo in his inbox? So Geithner paid his back taxes, and that was that. But then, when Obama nominated him to the office of Treasury secretary in 2008, Geithner was again audited, and the earlier delinquencies of 2001 and 2002 were revealed. Inquisitive minds wondered why he hadn’t paidallhis back taxes in 2006, when he was made aware of the obligation to do so. Could it be that the interposition of an IRS statute of limitations gave him cover to keep some of his unpaid taxes? That might be legal, but it’s surely not honorable. But the bipartisan swamp is careful to protect its own, especially when it comes to tax matters. Who amongst us is without sin? Who should escape whipping when subjected to a tax audit?And so the Senate Finance panel in charge of Geithner’s confirmation met in a secret session and issued a report designed to fudge his improprieties, noting only that he had recently filed amended tax returns without questioning why he had put off amending his 2001 and 2002 returns until after his nomination. Committee members were reluctant to criticize. Democrat Max Baucus and Republican Chuck Grassley thought the matter serious but not disqualifying. Republican Orrin Hatchwent further: “I still support him. He’s a very competent guy.”But there were other issues as well that cast a shadow over Geithner’s nomination. He failed to report that a portion of his income was made up of an early withdrawal from a pension plan, thereby avoiding the penalty that accrues in such cases. Other miscellaneous trivia included an improper small business deduction, a claim for a charitable contribution in respect of an ineligible item, wrongly expensing personal use utility costs, and laughably including payments over a three-year period for his kid’s overnight camp to calculate dependent care deductions. And, oh yes, there was the housekeeper whom he’d continued to employ after he’d become aware that her work visa had expired. Still, there was a strong bipartisan consensus that a man who claimed to be ignorant of his tax obligations should be put in charge of a department that included control of the IRS. Obama and his aides leaped to Geithner’s defense. These were minor infractions, they said, given the importance of the position to which he’d been nominated.“Now’s not the time to think in small political terms. I think he’s the right guy,”opinedthe ever-genial Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. You’d think the opposite, wouldn’t you? The more important the position to be occupied, the higher the standard to which an individual should be held. But it appears that “too big to fail” applies not only to financial institutions but also to those who run them. The case against Weisselberg and Trump’s real estate company on the state level is as trumped up as the Mueller investigation was on the federal level. The American taxpayer will bear the financial cost and reap no benefits. Both are textbook cases of politically motivated prosecution. As thenotes in a recenteditorial, “disguising compensation as expenses is far from unusual in corporate America. It’s typically handled as a civil matter and settled with the payment of back taxes, interest and fines. It is rarely the basis for a criminal indictment.”And the individuals bringing these charges don’t have clean hands. Cyrus Vance Jr. is a disgraced district attorney who earned notoriety by offering shamefully lenient plea deals to rich and powerful men likeHarvey Weinstein,Jeffrey Epstein, andOB-GYNDr. Robert Hadden,men who for many years were allowed to play out their perverted sex fantasies on vulnerable women and children. Vance might be tossing this scrap to a Democrat mob hungry for Trump blood in a bizarre attempt to atone for his misdeeds before he retires from politics.“Give me a man and I will find the crime,” Andrey Vyshinsky, a Soviet prosecutor under Stalin, said. New York Attorney General Letitia James echoed that sentiment,sayingshe will shine “a bright light into every dark corner of [Trump’s] real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn,” shamelessly campaigning on a promise of selective prosecution. We are watching the disgusting criminalization of political opposition in America.

In June, the city began a contact tracing initiative for certain “coronavirus clusters.” While the tracing results showed that more than a thousand cases of COVID-19 were discovered to be highly transmissible for people on construction sites and in nursing homes, bars and restaurants combined only had 22 cases. According to emails obtained by the local news station anda subsequent Tennessean factcheck, the mayor’s senior advisor and a health department employee discussed how much information to release to the public, including deciding not to release information about transmissions linked to individual businesses.“This isn’t going to be publicly released, right? Just info for Mayor’s Office?” health department employee Leslie Waller asked.“Correct, not for public consumption,” senior advisor Benjamin Eagles replied. When asked about the low numbers produced from supposed transmission in bars and restaurants by a reporter, health department official Brian Todd didn’t know how to respond and asked other officials for assistance.“Please advise how you recommend I respond,” he wrote. A reply from an unidentified source on the email chain clearly stated that the department did not “want to say a specific number” because the numbers were “low.”“My two cents. We have certainly refused to give counts per bar because those numbers are low per site,” the email read.“We could still release the total though, and then a response to the over 80 could be because that number is increasing all the time and we don’t want to say a specific number,” it continued. closed bars and restaurants earlier in the year due to rising COVID-19 concerns. While neither the mayor’s office nor the Metro Health Department responded to the allegations, a Metro staff attorney verified the emails at the request of a local councilmember Steve Glover.“I was able to get verification from the Mayor’s Office and the Department of Health that these emails are real,” the staff attorney said. According to Glover, the emails and lack of response by the mayor’s office and health department indicate deception.“We raised taxes 34 percent and put hundreds, literally thousands of people out of work that are now worried about losing their homes, their apartments…and we did it on bogus data. That should be illegal,” Glover said.“They are fabricating information,” Glover added. “They’ve blown there entire credibility…It’s gone. I don’t trust a thing they say going forward …nothing.”Instead of responding to a comment request on the issue to Fox 17, the news outlet reports that it was “told to file a freedom of information act request” to confirm and verify the emails. When an investigative reporter at Fox 17 News pressed the mayor’s office for comment on the issue at apress conferenceon Thursday, Cooper’s spokesman Chris Song accused the station of having a “lapse in journalistic judgment” by not following up again.“When you asked for comment, there was absolutely no context for the comment that you requested,” Song said.“We’re asking you now,” the reporter replied. “We asked you before, we’re asking you afterwards. It’s so funny that a metro staff attorney validated these emails in one hour that you told us to FOIA.”After these news reports came out, Mayor Cooper’s office put out the followingstatementsaying his office had publicly released the low transmission rates in July:Following an exchange of emails dating June 29, 2020 between the Mayor’s office and Metro Public Health in which our administration gathered information about the sources of COVID-19 spread in Davidson County, the number of cases and clusters linked to Nashville bars was shared with media in response to a question during apress conferenceon July 2, 2020. FOX17 Nashville was at this press conference. Among others, TheTennesseanand NewsChannel 5’s Phil Williams have fact-checked and debunked the allegations within FOX17’s September 16 report. Mayor Cooper calls on the station’s general manager, Noreen Parker, and the reporter, Dennis Ferrier, to apologize to all Nashvillians for misleading the city and eroding public trust through negligent reporting. Fox 17 removed its story and apologized Sept. 18 for calling the email discussion a “cover-up,” because the information had in fact already been publicly released. This Federalist article’s headline and original text has been updated accordingly. Yet a lawyer for local bars and restaurants still says the city has used its COVID data as a weapon.“They misrepresented the number of cases to the public just by using general terms in order to hide the fact that they were actually retaliating against the bar owners that chose to sue them for being closed without any scientific data,” attorney Kirk Clementsalleged to Fox 17. According to the Tennessean factcheck of this local controversy over shutting down bars and restaurants despite low COVID-19 spread connected to them, on Thursday “Cooper defended the decision-making on bars, insisting that restrictions were less about how many cases had been traced to bars and more about their potential to become ‘super-spreaders.’ The closure of bars, he said, was a large contributor to Nashville’s dramatic progress against the virus.”This story from Fox 17 Nashville has been taken down because it turned out that the data in question had been disclosed publicly last summer. That data, however, did indicate very little Covid 19 spread from bars and restaurants. Officials shut down such establishments anyway.— Brit Hume (@brithume)September 19, 2020(Thread) The Nashville story is insane. The city had actually moved to Phase 3 in late June but then right before July 4 weekend, when bars and restaurants were planning to recoup lots of lost revenue, the mayor went BACK to phase 2 and shut all bars down for two more weeks.— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog)September 17, 2020",2,Generally Reliable,0.0131941483060886,0.3623477848850983,1299,1,The Federalist

105,The True Story of Jessica Krug,-3.0,46.33,https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/01/27/the-true-story-of-jessica-krug-the-white-professor-who-posed-as-black-for-years-until-it-all-blew-up-last-fall/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washingtonian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,17,"“I am a coward.”Jessica Krug’s confession started ricocheting across screens one brutally muggy afternoon in late-summer Washington. “For the better part of my adult life,” it began, “every move I’ve made, every relationship I’ve formed, has been rooted in the napalm toxic soil of lies.” Krug, a faculty member at George Washington University, had taken toMedium, the online forum, to reveal a stunning fabrication. Throughout her entire career in academia, the professor of African history—a white woman—had been posing as Black and Latina.“I have thought about ending these lies many times over many years, but my cowardice was always more powerful than my ethics. I know right from wrong. I know history. I know power. I am a coward,” she wrote. “You should absolutely cancel me, and I absolutely cancel myself.”The statement, posted September 3, 2020, went viral immediately, unleashing a tidal wave of across the text chains of Krug’s GW colleagues and other academics. “We were all blindsided,” says GW history-department chair Daniel Schwartz. Distraught em ails from Krug’s students—less than a week into a virtual semester already upended by the coronavirus pandemic—began piling up in faculty in-boxes. Meanwhile, an online mob went to work churning up old photos of Krug and tanking the Amazon ratings of her book. By the end of the day, a now-infamous video of Krug calling herself “Jess La Bombalera” and speaking in a D-list imitation Bronx accent was all over the internet. The next morning, Schwartz convened an emergency staff meeting on Zoom. The initial shock of their colleague’s revelation had quickly given way to anger, and now the GW professors who logged on were unanimous: The department should demand Krug’s resignation right away. If she refused, they’d call for the university to rescind her tenure and fire her. That afternoon, they issued their ultimatum in a public statement. Five days later, Krug quit. It was a dizzyingly fast fall for a woman who’d been among the most promising young scholars in her field. The 38-year-old had a PhD from one of the nation’s most prestigious African-history programs. She’d been a fellow at New York’s famed Schomburg Center, done research on three continents, and garnered wide praise for her book. She’d achieved all of it, as far as her GW colleagues knew, despite an upbringing that was nothing short of tragic. As Krug told it, she’d been raised in the Bronx, in “the hood.” Her Puerto Rican mother was a drug addict and abusive. The tale was just the latest version of one Krug had been evolving for more than 15 years, swapping varied, gruesome particulars into the made-up backstory (a rape, a paternal abandonment) for different audiences. It was a heart-tugger—and, it turns out, incredibly flimsy. Minimal online sleuthing would have unraveled any of the lies in minutes—something Krug, who was still an undergrad when Facebook debuted, surely knew. But she’d also learned that the harrowing history she’d crafted was a useful line of defense against the kind of probing that could have easily exposed her. After all, who wanted to pry into such a delicate situation?“To everyone who trusted me, who fought for me, who vouched for me, who loved me, who is feeling shock and betrayal and rage and bone marrow deep hurt and confusion, violation in this world and beyond: I beg you, please, do not question your own judgment or doubt yourself,” Krug wrote in her confession. “You were not naive. I was audaciously deceptive.”Krug’s high-school yearbook photo from her private high school, the Barstow School. She grew up in Overland Park, Kansas, an upper-middle-class, overwhelmingly white suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. She had a bat mitzvah when she turned 13. She attended some of the area’s best private schools, including the elite Barstow School, which counts the current Kansas City mayor, a cofounder of Tinder, and former Obama press secretary Josh Earnest as alums. But while Krug was surrounded by preppiness and tradition, she fashioned herself as the class rebel, thrilling at opportunities to test a boundary or make a spectacle. She favored a hippie look—flannel shirts and tie-dyes, Birkenstocks, unkempt dirty-blond hair—and championed causes that seemed radical at the time. In an interview with theKansas City Star,her schoolmate Quinton Lucas, now the city’s mayor, remembered her “once standing up at an all-school assembly and announcing, ‘There’s going to be a giant gay prom this weekend, and you’re all invited.’ This was 1999, so all of our jaws dropped.”At one point, Krug forced her way onto the boys’ baseball team, in protest that there was no girls’ team. (Never mind that she apparently had never played.) On another occasion, she planned an on-campus flag-burning to make a statement about free speech. “We all had to have a moment of a group of students and a group of teachers talking her out of it,” says a former classmate who was on the debate team with Krug and considered her a close friend. A more troubling incident had to do with the school’s literary magazine. “Her work was always so different from everyone else’s,” recalls Miranda Lenz, an old friend who still lives in the area. “There were times where our teacher would be like, ‘You really need to tone it down,’ because her stuff would be borderline [sexually] inappropriate.” Everyone assumed it was at least original—until the day Krug got caught plagiarizing, something reported in theKansas City Staras Krug’s hometown media swarmed on the story last summer.“It was at that point that I really lost all respect for her,” says Lenz, remembering the incident. “It just seemed like she was more upset about being caught than she was about what she had done.”For as much as she hogged the spotlight at school, Krug’s home life was a mystery, even to close friends. Some remember meeting her mother during pickup at the end of the day, but no one could recall ever going inside her house. Krug never talked about her dad. In fact, a couple of friends told me they’d thought her father was dead. According to a family member, her dad worked in the grocery business. Her parents were not wealthy—classmates say Krug attended Barstow on a scholarship. In the course of her childhood, according to the relative, her parents divorced, remarried, the n divorced again. Her father moved to Las Vegas in 1999. The same year, when Krug was a junior, she was clamoring to graduate early and get out of Overland Park. “She would say it was too conservative for her and she hated all the traditions . . . of the school,” says her friend from the debate team. Krug left for college at age 17, and no one heard from her again—including most of her own family. “When I tell you she lost contact,” says her relative, “it was like, off the face of the earth.”Some eight years later and 500 miles away, a grad student at the University of Wisconsin, whom I’ll call Julia, was in downtown Madison when a stranger approached. The woman introduced herself as Jess Krug and said she recognized Julia from a class they had together. Somehow, as they made small talk, the conversation turned to race.“She started to identify herself with the ‘us’ and ‘we’ pronouns,” says Julia, who is Afro-Latina. She had assumed that Krug, with her pale skin and nearly buzzed-off blond hair, was white. But as Krug kept talking, says Julia, “I soon came to realize that she was identifying herself as Black.”After leaving high school early, Krug (first row, second from left) spent her undergrad years at two different universities. When Krug had vanished from home after high school, she’d enrolled at the University of Kansas in Lawrence and still identified as white. But midway through her degree, a college friend remembers, she decided to follow a boyfriend out west and finish undergrad at Portland State. There, halfway across the country, she appears to have launched her transformation, occasionally slipping into conversation that she was Black. By the time she arrived in Wisconsin to get her master’s and PhD, she was fully inhabiting the lie. On the day she met Krug in downtown Madison, Julia felt a bit bewildered by the conversation. But she decided her Black classmate could just be exceptionally light-skinned. The two became friends, to a point. “The minute we would try to deepen our friendship,” Julia says, “she would just say or do something very off-putting about my own class position or my own Blackness.” For example, at that time Krug was telling people she came from “the ghetto” of Kansas City, went to mostly Black schools, and had been conceived when her Black mom, an abusive drug addict, was raped by her white dad. She lorded this tough upbringing over her friends, Julia says, as evidence that she was authentically Black, while calling Julia, who grew up middle class, “bougie.”Julia remained friendly with Krug out of pity. Besides her sad past, Krug claimed to be in the midst of a crumbling long-distance marriage to a Nigerian man, turning to Julia for a shoulder to cry on. Another former friend says her relationship with Krug revolved around the sob story. She and Krug hadn’t known each other long, but she says Krug would call constantly to agonize about how the guy had cheated on her with a white woman. “She made me invest a lot of emotional labor—I mean, a lot.”“I joked with others that she thinks she knows the history of anybody who was Black in the world, at any time, in any place, in any language.”Krug would repeat the same pattern throughout her fraud, attaching herself to Black friends, the n using her supposed traumas and race-based victimhood to prey on their sympathies and manipulate them into believing her con. Eventually, though, her neediness and mean streak had a way of wearing people down. A few years into their friendship, Julia and Krug were chatting online when Krug made another of her comments questioning Julia’s Blackness. By the n, other friends had been urging Julia to accept what, to the m, seemed obvious: Krug looked like a white woman because she probably was one. Julia hadn’t known what to believe. But she says Krug’s cutting remark that day was the push she needed to finally see through the act. “I just blocked her,” says Julia. “There was no big falling-out. It was just a moment of reckoning for me where I just said, ‘Enough.’ ”Without any real proof, though, Julia says she had no idea what she could do about Krug’s secret. So she tucked it away. It would be years before she thought about Krug again. Krug’s book, pictured, won praise from others in her field. She had been a rising star, one of two experts worldwide in the area of Africa she studied. As she worked toward her PhD,Krug hobnobbed with some of the top scholars of African history and landed impressive fellowships. She often went to do research in New York, where she would hang out with another prominent student in her field, Akissi Britton. Britton was surprised when Krug, with her sandy-hued buzzcut, identified herself as Black. Her explanations of her background were inconsistent, too. Once, over a meal with Britton and Britton’s the n husband, Krug said she came from the Tuareg people, a seminomadic group in North Africa. “My ex-husband, though, he lived and studied on the Continent for a few years, so he was very familiar with the Tuareg, and he had questions,” says Britton. Krug struggled to supply answers. She never brought up the Tuareg to Britton again. After that, Krug implied she was African American. “We heard about her being at her grandmother’s house with her other cousins,” says Britton, who is now a professor of Africana studies at Rutgers. “Her growing up around other Black people and how she was the only one that looked like her.”“It was all ‘F whites, F the police, F capitalism.’ I feared she was ready to fistfight me if I challenged any of her views.”Even so, Britton says she was loath to “police” Krug’s Blackness. She was juggling school and parenting and didn’t have a lot of time for social drama. Her quiet doubts were also outweighed by how woke Krug claimed to be. “She mimicked a militant, pro-Black politic to get people on her side,” Britton says. Around 2010, Krug moved to New York to finish her dissertation and live with a new beau and his family in the Bronx. It was the n that yet another twist in her narrative emerged. “She did begin totalk about a Puerto Rican grandfather,” says Britton. “I was like,Where did this come from?”The friend who consoled Krug through her relationship troubles remembers when Krug introduced this new backstory, to o—abruptly announcing one day that Krug wasn’t actually her family’s name. “She passed it off as her grandmother, who was supposedly suffering from some form of Alzheimer’s or dementia, had a very lucid moment in which she said, ‘Oh, you know, our last name is Cruz.’ ” In reality, as the friend explains, “the only thing Puerto Rican about her was her boyfriend.”Krug had been estranged from her family for more than a decade and was writing her dissertation at the time. She dedicated the work to her boyfriend. “Gary Kemp,” she wrote in her acknowledgments, “you have given me a home.”Kemp declined an interview withWashingtonian,but in a short email after Krug outed herself, he told me, “When I found out, it was a gut [punch] to my stomach. I don’t know what I can add. She made me feel like a damn fool. She stole my Afro Latino identity—for what? Tenure?”In 2012, Krug walked into Phillips Hallto deliver her final pitch for a job at GW and placed a blank sheet of paper on a podium—fake notes. She’d learned that it sometimes made people anxious when she spoke at length from memory, according to a former colleague. Dressed in an understated suit, she was confident and poised as she explained her research, deftly fielding queries during the Q&A round. Krug didn’t talk about her own race in front of the audience that day. But once she was hired, says Erin Chapman, one of a small number of Black faculty members at GW, Krug made her colleagues aware that she identified as Black and Puerto Rican, or Afro-Latina. Happy to have another woman of color in the history department, Chapman says she befriended Krug. They went out dancing and to karaoke, and they’d grab lunch and drinks together, sometimes chatting about the challenges of dating as high-achieving Black women. Krug had an apartment in Bloomingdale but said she hated DC. “[She’d say] the city is not diverse enough—New York is so much more dynamic,” says Chapman. “The men in DC were too conservative.”Krug’s story about her difficult childhood had changed: She had now abandoned all ties to Kansas. Instead, she was telling people she’d been raised in the Bronx. Once again, Krug found a sympathetic ear. But Chapman realized she couldn’t maintain the friendship out of pity alone, given the way Krug frequently tried to shame her. “I’m fairly light-skinned . . . so Jess wanted to know if I had issues with my coloring and identifying as Black,” Chapman says. When she told Krug she had put those insecurities to rest when she was much younger, Krug recoiled. “Basically,” says Chapman, “[she] felt like that indicated that I was somehow trying to be white.” She says Krug would make insulting comments—for instance, if Chapman chose to sit in the shade, Krug would accuse her of not wanting to get too dark. Some students at GW liked the unconventional profile she cut compared with other profs. Photograph via George Washington University. Krug cut a divisive profile among other GW faculty as well. She’d decamped back to New York by her second year at the school, telling colleagues that her brother had gone to prison and that she had to help care for his several children in the Bronx. From the n on, she commuted on Amtrak to her lectures. She was rarely on campus, holding office hours via Skype, and when she did make it to faculty meetings, she was combative and dogmatic, to the point of offending some colleagues. If anyone broached the idea of hiring another expert on the African Diaspora, she would pounce. “Jess would assert that she already did that,” says Chapman. “I joked with others that she thinks she knows the history of anybody who was Black in the world, at any time, in any place, in any language.”Some of Krug’s students despised her for how harshly she graded. Others found her refreshingly different. She showed up for class in tight tops and dresses, leather leggings, and heels. Her wavy hair was artificially black, she wore a ring in her nose, and she sometimes slipped into Spanglish. She spoke frequently about her Puerto Rican heritage and her devotion to the Bronx. Krug encouraged her students to inject their personal stories into class, too. “She was just very relatable,” says Léocadia Tchouaffé, who took Krug’s world-history course. “She helped me embrace my Cameroonian heritage. It was the first time, really, that I was learning about my history in an academic setting.”In 2018, Krug got tenure. After that, Chapman remembers, she was seen around campus even less. Up in New York, though, where she lived in Spanish Harlem, Krug seemed to be everywhere. “Jess La Bombalera” was a brash, salsa-dancing, Afro-Latina activist known for railing against gentrification and police brutality. In the video that went viral after her confession, in which she’d dialed into a city-council meeting, Krug introduces herself by the nickname, the n drops F-bombs while vilifying the NYPD as “a colonial occupation force.”Even the guys who swiped right were flattened by Jess La Bombalera. A 30-year-old musician named Ken Pazn told theDaily Mailthat his Tinder date with Krug was such a disaster that he gave up on the app. After Krug refused to go to any “gentrifier spots,” the pair settled on a walk. “It was all F whites, F the police, F capitalism, all of that stuff,” Pazn, who is Afro-Latino, told the paper. “I feared she was ready to fistfight me if I challenged any of her views. I would have liked some physical action—but not that kind.”Krug was skilled at blowing up her friendships—otherwise, she never would have pulled off her ruse for so long. Years earlier, she had alienated her New York friend Akissi Britton amid a feud when she broke her foot. Britton schlepped from Brooklyn one night to bring groceries and help tidy Krug’s Harlem apartment, but when she couldn’t swing the same favor a few days later, she says Krug “just flipped out. . . . She was acting as if she’d gotten a diagnosis that she had to have her foot amputated.” Britton felt so taken advantage of that she never spoke to Krug again. Around the same time, in 2013, Krug lashed out at the friend who’d counseled her through her relationship troubles. Krug had gotten word that her mother had died, and she had gone back to the friend for sympathy. After hearing for years about Krug’s supposedly horrific upbringing, the friend says she didn’t know how to react: “I’m thinking this is a woman you didn’t want a relationship with.” Yet suddenly, “this was her Mother Dearest.” The friend says she tried to comfort Krug, but Krug accused her of not being supportive enough and eventually cut her off altogether. Photograph courtesy of Angola Resgate Group. Four years later, the friend, also a professor, saw that she and Krug were both slated to present at the same conference. She woke up early to make it to Krug’s 9 am slot, thinking it could be a chance to patch things up. “But the n I get there and she’s not the re,” says the friend. “They said for whatever reason, she didn’t make it.” The last time the friend had seen Krug, Krug was posing only as Black. In hindsight, the friend wonders if Krug—fully occupying her new Afro-Latina identity—noticed her name on the conference program, too, and skipped out. At least one friend whom Krug had pushed away, though, was keeping tabs on her—and growing increasingly alarmed. Julia, from Madison, had begun seeing Krug pop up in her Facebook time line and noticed that her identity had taken on some new contours. “I remember seeing a byline of hers inEssencemagazine on the Puerto Rican struggle. That was when I knew, yeah, this woman had definitely morphed.”Julia privately shared her concerns with a couple of mutual friends from grad school, who’d also suspected back the n that Krug was white. But Julia says she still felt powerless to act on the secret. Krug had become a well-established scholar; Julia worried that people wouldn’t believe her and that outing Krug could backfire. “Academia can be brutal,” says Julia, a professor herself. “One wrong move and you can ruin your career.” (It was for this reason that Julia asked to be identified by a pseudonym.)One day last August, Julia found herself engaged in a back-and-forth with other academics on Twitter about another scholar, Hermán “Hache” Carrillo, who had lied about his race. Carrillo had been a respected novelist—and remarkably, until 2015, also a professor at George Washington University. He died from Covid-19 complications in April 2020. Upon seeing his obituary in the Washington Post—which detailed the biography that Carrillo had given for years about being an immigrant from Cuba—his family in Michigan called in a correction: Carrillo was actually African American, born in Detroit. The online conversation motivated Julia to finally speak up. She text ed another academic, Yomaira Figueroa, with the information she had on Krug. Figueroa didn’t know Krug personally and is more senior in her career, so Julia says she felt she could trust her to help. The Michigan State professor wasn’t just receptive—she was enraged. “It hit home in so many ways, because I actually am a Black Puerto Rican woman from the hood,” says Figueroa. “I felt personally hurt that she had been able to put on this minstrel show.” As for Krug’s nickname: “Bombalera is not even a word. I’m like, this is ridiculous.”Some quick online digging led Figueroa to obituaries for Krug’s mom and dad, who died in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The write-ups revealed Krug’s real origins as a white Jewish kid from Overland Park. Julia and Figueroa both insist they didn’t predict the massive fallout that came next. They say they weren’t out to ruin Krug and had no intention of alerting GW or the media. “What we really wanted was for her to apologize and stop doing it,” says Figueroa. “Just stop lying.” But before she did anything to alert Krug, Figueroa wanted to be sure she’d been thorough. So she began reaching out to contacts who knew Krug to ask if they had additional evidence and to gauge their reactions to what she and Julia had already uncovered. Soon, Krug started deleting or locking her social-media accounts, presumably having been tipped off. But the n, instead of trying to navigate the matter privately, potentially lessening the blowback and public shaming, Krug chose the spectacle. Eight days after Julia first text ed Figueroa about her, Krug hit “publish” on the Medium confession:To an escalating degree over my adult life, I have eschewed my lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City under various assumed identities within a Blackness that I had no right to claim: first North African Blackness, the n US rooted Blackness, the n Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness. I have not only claimed these identities as my own when I had absolutely no right to do so—when doing so is the very epitome of violence, of thievery and appropriation, of the myriad ways in which non-Black people continue to use and abuse Black identities and cultures—but I have formed intimate relationships with loving, compassionate people who have trusted and cared for me when I have deserved neither trust nor caring. Nowhere in her 1,234 words did Krug find space simply to say she was sorry. Before her downfall, Krug was a rising star in her field, one of two experts in the world on a little-known region of Angola. Her scholarly contributions were never in question. Why, the n, did she construct this alternate universe when there was arguably so little to gain?In her online confession, she hinted at one possible reason: “mental health issues” connected to “abuse within . . . my birth family,” she wrote. “Professionals from whom I have been so belatedly seeking help assure me that this is a common response to some of the severe trauma that marked my early childhood and teen years.” She didn’t elaborate (and didn’t respond to requests for an interview). According to therapists I spoke to, childhood trauma could lead to issues of identity, including cultural appropriation. “In the case of someone who claims to be affiliated with a race or group of people who are fundamentally disenfranchised, it might be an attempt to indirectly show their own victimization,” explains Lisa Ferentz, a clinical social worker who trains therapists in helping survivors of trauma. “Lying about one’s racial identity might also be an attempt to completely disavow and abdicate any connection to one’s abusers and extended family if that affiliation evokes embarrassment, shame, or rage.”Before she changed her identity, Krug mentioned childhood abuse to at least one person she was close with. Novotny Lawrence, a friend at the University of Kansas, told me Krug shared that her mother had physically abused her. To him, though, nothing she described would explain her behavior. Instead, Lawrence, who is Black, the orizes that Krug may have gotten too immersed in the cultural experiences that were the focus of her research.“I just feel like when you study oppression, it’s easy, perhaps, for some people to start feeling very connected to that oppression,” says Lawrence, now a professor of media, pop culture, and race at Iowa State University. “I’d like to believe that maybe she just got caught up . . . and not that it was something malicious.”There is an eerily on-the-nose connection between Krug’s fraud and the work on which she built her career. She studied a geographic area of Angola called Kisama, chronicling how the region is not just a place but a social, cultural, and, above all, political, identity. Her work looked at how fugitives escaping violence and slavery were drawn to Kisama, turning it into “the home of fierce, intractably resistant warriors and runaways.” They did not just live in Kisama, she explains; they chose to “self-identify”asKisama. Krug, in short, devoted her research to runaways who forged new identities. If she had fled home because of abuse herself, it wouldn’t be hard to see how she might be drawn to the subject. But did she also draw inspiration from it—did she use it to justify her decision to change her own identity?Five days after Krug outed herself, GW’s history department hosted a Zoom town hall for students. “There were more history majors of color [on the call] than I’ve seen in one place,” says Chapman, her former colleague. Many of the students cried. Some of the professors got emotional, too. To the m, Krug’s confession wasn’t just shocking but laid bare a deeper problem. “The students were, and are, hungry for a sense of safety, and Jess seemed to provide that,” Chapman says. “That hunger is born of the fact that GW is very elitist. . . . It’s a place that’s unapologetic in its elite, white identity.”For students who found a safe space in Krug’s classroom, the violation was profound. Besides trafficking in some of the worst stereotypes of the cultures she claimed, Krug had spoken for years from a perspective that did not belong to her. “From her, I got a sense of authority,” says Sally Kim, who studied the Haitian revolution in Krug’s world-history course. “If she’d taught it as a white woman, I think I would’ve taken it with a grain of salt.”The debacle has sparked an examination of the history department. Chair Daniel Schwartz says he has assembled a committee to work on diversifying the faculty and making course work more inclusive. The five-person committee doesn’t have any Black members. A spokesperson for GW would not comment on whether diversity was a factor in Krug’s hiring. But one thing driving much of the outrage over her deception is that she undoubtedly consumed space and resources that otherwise could have been allocated to an actual person of color. That notion is especially infuriating in academia, where just 6 percent of full-time faculty are Black, according to the Department of Education. Against this backdrop, it’s easy to see another reason—beyond the awkwardness and the academic-world taboos about questioning someone’s identity—why so many supposedly skeptical scholars were conned for so long: In a culture that admires diversity and a profession that struggles with it, people wanted to believe. Since her confession, Krug has all but vanished again. The last public photos of her that you can find—paparazzi shots in theDaily Mail—appeared a couple of days after she outed herself. They show Krug trudging up the stairwell of her apartment building, her hair disheveled, dark aviators covering her eyes. Five months later, she hasn’t been heard from.“I have not lived a double life. There is no parallel form of my adulthood connected to white people or a white community or an alternative white identity,” she wrote on Medium. “I have lived this lie, fully, completely, with no exit plan or strategy.",3,Reliable,0.0497796677959721,0.4324167529330575,6899,3,Washingtonian

S House of Representativeson Wednesday. U. S. Rep. Garret Graves, R-Baton Rouge, inserted the Louisiana projects – ranging from speeding the deepening of the Houma Navigation Canal in Terrebonne Parish and the Baptiste Collette Bayou Canal in Plaquemines Parish to requiring a long-dormant federal-state task force to identify new ways of funding coastal restoration within a year -- into the bill during a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee meeting two weeks ago. The bill, the Water Resources Development Act, contains language authorizing the Army Corps of Engineers to begin or continue water control, navigation and levee system projects and studies across the nation, and to determine how money is used to operate and maintain existing and new projects. A Senate version of the bill, which includes several of the same Louisiana projects, was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in May. It has not been scheduled for a vote on the Senate floor. Assuming that bill is approved, differences between the two versions must be worked out in a joint conference committee before final approval, something that would have to happen before Congress enters a recess in late October in advance of the national elections. The summertime low-oxygen “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to cover at least 6,700 square miles along the Louisiana and eastern T…The Graves amendments to the House bill included language requiring the Corps to include a review of the Mississippi River’s contribution to algae blooms that create the low-oxygen “dead zone” along Louisiana’s coast. Another Graves amendment is designed to allow the Corps to issue long-term contracts – up to five years – for dredging the lower Mississippi River to prevent shoaling and sand bars. Present rules require the Corps to issue contracts on an as-needed basis, and the change could both reduce dredging costs resulting from those shorter contract periods, and assure that the Corps budgets more accurately. Called the Zandmotor, or Sand Motor in English, the project in The Netherlands is the world’s largest experiment in coastal storm and flood defense. Called the Zandmotor, or Sand Motor in English, the project in The Netherlands is the world’s largest experiment in coastal storm and flood defense. Repeated high river periods during the past 10 years have resulted in shoaling that has required ocean-going vessels to reduce the amount of cargo they can carry on entering the river, costing millions of dollars in transportation costs. Graves was unsuccessful in adding an amendment that would have said that past federal appropriations of about $30 milllion for the $14 billion Morganza-to-the-Gulf project gave it the status of a ”new start” under water resources law. Such a designation would have allowed the project to be considered for funding in the Corps’ annual budget. The state, plus Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, have already contributed more than $450 million to the project, which has been used to build initial lifts of the 92-mile levee system. The House took up the bill Wednesday under a suspension of its rules, which prohibits floor amendments, and allowed it to be approved by voice vote.

A new letter attacking Rice’s “poor judgment” is being widely circulated among delegates to the Democratic National Convention, calling Biden’s inner circle of foreign policy advisors a “horror show” with track records supporting “disastrous” U. S. military interventions. The letter hasalready received more than 275 signatures from delegates, almost all of whom had been pledged to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The letter highlights Biden’s long-time chief aide on foreign affairs Antony Blinken as well as several other prominent former members of the Obama Administration who would likely hold cabinet-level appointments in a Biden administration, HuffPostreports. Blinken co-founded acompany called WestExec Advisors, that aided a Pentagon effort toenhance drone warfare. The presumptive Democratic nominee is relying on former Obama aides and Libya war cheerleaders Samantha Power and Jake Sullivan, as well as a bevy of other military-industrial complex beneficiaries, including former Defense Department official Michèle Flournoy, who worked several years for the Boston Consulting Group, while the firm accrued multi-million dollar contracts with the military, and Avril Haines, a former CIA deputy directorreviled on the leftfor her role in making redactions to a report on President George W.

They have so far succeeded in gathering approximately a third of the signatures of Sanders’ delegates. A Sanders aide declined to comment to HuffPost.

111,Reports of forced labor are driving brands to abandon Chinese cotton,0.0,47.0,https://fortune.com/2021/07/18/china-cotton-forced-labor-xinjiang/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"Early last year, amid mounting reports of forced labor and human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), U. S. outdoor apparel maker Patagonia resolved to stop sourcing cotton from China. From April 2020 on, the brand’s global suppliers had to vet and eliminate any links to the world’s largest cotton producer. The decision wasn’t easy. China accounts for roughly 20% of global cotton supply, and Xinjiang produces some of the highest-grade cotton in the world.“We had to walk away from business partners, we had to redesign styles to fit the substitute cotton, and we had to do away with styles that we could no longer make because the quality of cotton was no longer available,” says Wendy Savage, director of social responsibility and traceability at Patagonia, which declined to say what products it had discontinued. Patagonia isn’t alone. U. S. retailer L. L. Bean pledged to eliminate Chinese cotton from its supply chain by the end of this year, citing “extremely troubling” reports about Xinjiang. Victoria’s Secret parent companyL Brandshas committed to eliminating Chinese cotton from its supply chains, too. L Brands toldit used tools provided by supply chain analytics firm Sourcemap to map most of its apparel supply chain in 2019 and cross-referenced its suppliers against a list of companies prohibited by U. S. sanctions related to Xinjiang.“In 2020, we started conducting chain of custody audits on cotton products to ensure cotton fiber does not come from China and will continue to conduct these audits to ensure cotton fiber is from an approved country,” an L Brands representative said. California-based women’s-wear maker Reformation—which launched in Los Angeles in 2009 and bills itself as a sustainable fashion brand—is another retailer that’s stopped using cotton from China because it couldn’t guarantee cotton sourced elsewhere in China hadn’t been mixed with stock grown in Xinjiang. The XUAR produces over 85% of China’s cotton crop.“Unfortunately, it’s not even as simple as just saying that you’re not going to source within the XUAR. The opaque nature of supply chains in the region means it really has to be the entire country,” says Kathleen Talbot, Reformation’s chief sustainability officer and vice president of operations. U. S. fashion brands and retailers are facing an unprecedented supply chain crisis over Xinjiang, but few are willing to talk about it for fear of disrupting their operations in China. Beijing fervently denies allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and tacitly threatens companies that speak against it. Fortuneasked more than two dozen apparel companies how they’ve responded to reports of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Only Patagonia and Reformation—which earn little to no revenue in China—made representatives available for interviews. But regulatory action has forced all apparel companies that do business in the U. S. to address the possibility that their cotton supply is corrupted by forced labor, whether they speak publicly about it or not. In January, U. S. Customs and Border Protection implemented a seizure order on all goods containing cotton sourced from the XUAR,citing“the Chinese government’s exploitation of modern slavery.” The Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights organization,estimatesthe seizure order will disqualify $20 billion of apparel sales in the U. S. per year—about 5% of thetotal$368 billion U. S. clothing and footwear market. To release a seized shipment, importers must prove the goods are free of Xinjiang-sourced cotton. But that seemingly straightforward requirement has exposed a hidden truth about the fashion industry: Few brands know for sure where their cotton comes from. According to the UN Economic Commission for Europe,only 34%of fashion brands implement tracking and tracing in their supply chains, which means they can follow raw materials as they go from farm to shop floor or retroactively determine where exactly a product came from. Most retailers only strike partnerships with so-called Tier 1 suppliers—factories that sew finished products—and leave the business of sourcing materials to those suppliers. The materials are delivered along a winding value chain of merchants, known as Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 suppliers, with Tier 4 representing the farm level. Adopting a deliberately myopic view of the supply chain cuts costs for a brand, but it also limits its ability to respond to crises—such as a sudden order to exclude cotton from a region in China. Of the 16 brands that responded to’s request for comment, most provided links to public statements in which they expressed concern over reports of abuses in Xinjiang and pledged to conduct reviews of their supply chain, in some cases revealing what little oversight they had before. Patagonia and Reformation—brands built on the ideal of responsible sourcing—maintain more comprehensive supply chain oversight than the majority of fashion retailers, which helped them respond to and investigate the issues in Xinjiang. But such diligence is demanding, requiring audits, interviews with factory workers, reams of documentation, and careful nurturing of relationships.“It can sometimes feel like a wild goose chase, because when we make a demand of our suppliers, they have to then enforce it among their suppliers,” Talbot says. In the garment industry, a single company might have thousands of sub-suppliers and contractors spread across its supply chain. Talbot says it’s taken Reformation “a few years to feel like we have the systems and tools in place to trace effectively.”Some of those tools are fairly high-tech. In March, Reformation launched a line of jeans spun from a cotton featuring a pigment that only shows up under UV light. The dye is introduced at the cotton gin—where fibers are separated from seeds—and is tracked all the way to the store floor. The owner of the cotton gin sources cotton from its own cotton farm, so Reformation feels confident saying this technology tracks cotton all the way to the farm level, and proves the finished product was sourced from an approved supplier.“Having that level of visibility and partnership at the farm level is really challenging for brands to develop,” says Talbot. Even with deep insight into their supply chains, Patagonia and Reformation found too many unanswered questions to comfortably continue sourcing cotton from China and pulled out.“Between the scale of the issue and the lack of access to information we can rely on, there’s no way for us to control what’s happening in China,” says Patagonia’s Savage. “This situation is unprecedented.”Retailers ordinarily rely on third-party audits and documented receipts to verify the origin of raw material supplies. But the auditing system has flaws. Amelia Pang, author ofsays even trusted factories may cover up where they source their cotton from by blending crops from different fields together and then forging documents to passaudits. In Xinjiang, government surveillance has made it impossible for auditors to conduct candid, off-site interviews with workers, which are key to determining whether labor is voluntary. In July 2020, a U. S. governmentreportsaid auditors had reportedly been “detained, harassed, threatened, or stopped at the airport” by Xinjiang authorities. The local populace, meanwhile, is under surveillance from facial-recognition cameras and phone-tracking apps, which policereportedlyforce Uyghurs to install. According to the,the government’s policies in Xinjiang compelled at least five auditing firms to stop working in Xinjiang entirely by September 2020. Patagonia and Reformation had the tools to assess the risk Xinjiang posed to their supply chains and still cut the country’s cotton from their goods. Most other brands don’t have the capacity to judge how vulnerable their supply chains are to the alleged abuses in Xinjiang; if they directed manufacturers to eliminate Xinjiang cotton from their products, they would be hard-pressed to prove whether manufacturers followed through or not. Yet not every brand is leaving China, or even Xinjiang. Japanese fashion giants Muji and Uniqlo continue to use “Xinjiang cotton” as a tagline in advertisements, playing up the “superb quality” of the region’s bounty. Both companies believe their auditing work is sufficient to weed out forced labor. Muji’s parent company, Ryohin Keikaku, toldit had conducted “enhanced” audits of its supply chains in Xinjiang and found “no significant issue…except for those issues that can be corrected by farms or ginning factories [themselves].” The company also said it no longer ships products made with Xinjiang cotton to the U. S., owing to the seizure order—suggesting Muji is confident it can separate Xinjiang cotton from its other supply sources. Tadashi Yanai, the CEO of Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing,saidin an earnings call in early April that the company would “keep an eye” on its cotton supply chain and halt business with suppliers if it finds evidence of forced labor. However, U. S. customs agents seized a Uniqlo shipment in January over concerns the garments had been produced by forced labor in Xinjiang. According to the,customs agents said documentation provided by Uniqlo contained “numerous deficiencies” including “unsigned, undated, and generally illegible China customs declarations.”Uniqlo did not respond tos request for comment. In a statement online, the companysaidit had submitted “appropriate documentation” to Customs and Border Protection but admitted “the CBP did not give clearance” to a shipment of cotton shirts. Muji and Uniqlo, which bring in a hefty portion of sales from their home market, are under less economic pressure to eliminate Xinjiang cotton than U. S. brands. Japanaccountedfor 61% of Muji’s revenue in 2020, while Europe and North America contributed 6.5%, combined. Sales at Uniqlo parent Fast Retailingskew similarly: Japan made up 40.9% of revenues in the first half of fiscal 2021, while North America and Europe combined contributed only 8.4%. The Japanese government has not placed import restrictions on materials sourced from Xinjiang, so there’s little legal pressure for Japanese brands to switch sources, and both Muji and Uniqlo have a compelling financial incentive to continue sourcing from the region: access to the Chinese market. Beijing dismisses the accusation that the government is persecuting ethnic minorities in the XUAR as a political smear campaign orchestrated by “the West.” The government has leveraged China’s massive consumer spending power against brands that, in Beijing’s view, show too much support for the Western narrative. In March, China’s tech titans launched a sudden boycott against Swedish fashion giant H&M after the Communist Youth League—an affiliate of the China Communist Party (CCP)—shared screenshots of an old H&M statement expressing “concern” over reports of abuses in Xinjiang.“Spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton while trying to make money in China? Wishful thinking!” the Communist Youth Leaguepostedon China’s Twitter-likeWeibo, alongside photos of H&M’s statement. China is H&M’s fourth-largest market, accounting for roughly 5% of the brand’stotal$22 billion insalesin 2020. As the Youth League’s post went viral—liked over 400,000 times—e-commerce leaders Alibaba andJD.comremoved H&M’s virtual storefronts from their websites; domestic mapping leader Baidu Maps removed the more than 500 H&M China store locations from its online maps; and Uber-like Didi Chuxing blocked customers from setting H&M stores as pick-up or drop-off locations. Greg Gilligan, chairman of business lobby group the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said on a call with journalists in May that “companies are rightfully concerned” about the risk of boycotts in China. The risk of Chinese boycotts is higher for Muji and Uniqlo than it is for most U. S. retailers. Muji’s East Asia unit—which covers South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China—generated 28.4% of company revenue last year. Revenue at Fast Retailing’s “Greater China” segment was 25.8% of its total for the first half of fiscal 2021. Meanwhile, the companies that have spoken out about their response to alleged abuses in Xinjiang are notably less exposed to the Chinese market. Patagonia says China accounts for roughly 1% of its global sales revenue, while L Brands earned roughly 5% of sales in the Greater China region, which includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China, according to the company’slatest annual report. Reformation declined to say how much it earned from sales in China, but noted it has no physical stores in the country. L. L. Bean, a privately held company, doesn’t report sales by region. Silenceon the Xinjiang matter has become an untenable option for most brands, as human rights organizations and governments—primarily led by the U. S.—continue to scrutinize Beijing’s treatment of Uyghurs in the region. In January, the day before leaving office, then–Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled Beijing’s persecution of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang “genocide,” referencingreportsthat Chinese authorities have forcibly sterilized Uyghur women—an allegation Beijing denies. Although other governments havecondemnedChina for committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang, none have joined the U. S. in labeling Beijing’s crimes in Xinjiang as genocide. But Pompeo’s successor, Antony Blinken, has maintained the designation. In March, the EU and Canada also joined the U. S. in applying sanctions against several Xinjiang officials and companies accused of perpetrating human rights abuses, including theXPCC, a paramilitary conglomerate that produces 40% of Xinjiang’s cotton output. The sanctions have increased the risk for retailers that fail to keep a comprehensive view of their supply chains. Some U. S. companiesreportedlylobbied against abill, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which passed the House with bipartisan support last year and would presume products made “in whole or in part” in Xinjiang are guilty of exploiting forced labor. Lobbygroupsreportedly wanted Congress to ease the burden of proof and clearly define what constitutes sufficient auditing.“When these issues come up…we then look to government to give us very specific expectations in the form of regulations or laws that say what behavior is acceptable and encouraged and what behavior is not,” Gilligan said when asked how AmCham China members were responding to the situation in Xinjiang. In July, Hong Kong–based Esquel Group—one of the world’s largest shirt producers and a textbook example of a Tier 1 manufacturer—suedthe U. S. government for essentially upholding a presumption of guilt, rather than a presumption of innocence, when it imposed sanctions on the shirtmaker in November last year. The Trump administration included Esquel’s Xinjiang subsidiary on ablacklistof companies that the government says exploit Uyghur forced labor. In its lawsuit, Esquelarguesthat the U. S. has provided zero evidence to show Esquel employs forced labor and notes that third-party audits have found “no evidence of forced labor or coercion.”The Senate did not vote on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would presume companies operating in Xinjiang are guilty of exploiting forced labor, before adjourning last year; nor did it take up asimilar billintroduced to the Senatearound the same time. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduced anamendedversion of the Senate bill in January this year, whichpassedwith a unanimous vote of approval on July 14. The bill includes a new clause, absent from the 2020 version, requiring the government to provide “guidance” to importers on “the type, nature, and extent of evidence that demonstrates” goods weren’t made with forced labor. But the outcry over human rights issues in Xinjiang has already spurred some brands to enhance their supply chain management, regardless of what the Senate guidance might be. For many retailers, the risk of not knowing where their cotton comes from has grown greater than the cost of finding out.

112,Madeline Swegle breaks 110-year record and becomes the Navy’s first Black female fighter pilot,-4.33,43.0,https://www.upworthy.com/navys-first-black-female-fighter-pilot,https://adfontesmedia.com/upworthy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-11,16,"When Madeline Swegle was a little girl growing up in Burke, VA, she loved watching the Blue Angels zip through the sky. Her family went to see the display every time it was in town, and it was her parents' encouragement to pursue her dreams that led her to the U. S. Naval Academy in 2017. Before beginning the intense three-year training required to become a tactical air (TACAIR) pilot, Swegle had never been in an aircraft before; piloting was simply something she was interested in. It turns out she's got a gift for it—and not only is she skilled, she finds the 'exhilaration to be unmatched.' 'I'm excited to have this opportunity to work harder and fly high performance jet aircraft in the fleet,' Swegle said in a statement released by the Navy. 'It would've been nice to see someone who looked like me in this role; I never intended to be the first. I hope it's encouraging to other people.' As Swegle's story shows, representation and equality matter. And the responsibility to advance equality for all people - especially Black Americans facing racism - falls on individuals, organizations, businesses, and governmental leadership. This clear need for equality is why P&G established the Take On Race Fund to fight for justice, advance economic opportunity, enable greater access to education and health care, and make our communities more equitable. The funds raised go directly into organizations like NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, YWCA Stand Against Racism and the United Negro College Fund, helping to level the playing field. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the U. S. military has taken significant steps over the past decade to build a more diverse and inclusive force that attracts the country's top talent. However, women and racial and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in parts of the military, particularly at the highest levels of leadership. According to the Congressional Research Service, in the enlisted realm, 63% of senior enlisted troops are white, while 19% are Black; and only eight out of every 100 senior officers are Black. Women represent 16 percent of the enlisted forces and 19 percent of the officer corps. Lieutenant Commander Joseph Thompson, an officer serving in the Navy's Dental Corps, knows how it feels to be a minority in the military. 'As a fellow Naval Officer of African descent, I am extremely proud of Lt Swegle's accomplishments. I know the standards of excellence required to be a naval fighter pilot are extremely high. In a historically white male dominated sector of the Navy for her to break through the glass ceiling, not only as a female, but as one of African descent is nothing short of phenomenal...her accomplishments have not only made me proud, but have also motivated me to keep pushing forward in pursuit of my own goals.'",3,Reliable,0.1613297872340425,0.4800455927051672,598,2,Upworthy
113,"Whistleblowers Demand VOA Director Resign Over Pompeo Speech, Staff Moves",-2.67,45.33,https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/whistleblowers-demand-voa-director-resign-over-pompeo-speech-staff-moves,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,24,"Twenty-six journalists have demanded that Voice of America’s director resign after a series of alleged retaliatory measures and firewall violations culminated in the reassignment of one of VOA’s most high-profile reporters. A statement shared publicly Thursday accuses director Robert Reilly and his deputy director, Elizabeth Robbins, of violating VOA’s journalistic code by giving a senior government official “a free platform to speak live on our channels” by arranging a live broadcast of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then removing VOA’s White House correspondent after she tried to question the outgoing secretary. The Government Accountability Project (GAP), a nonprofit that protects whistleblowers, informed USAGM and VOA leadership, along with the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of the Inspector General, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and other lawmakers, that those signing the petition are deemed protected whistleblowers. Patsy Widakuswara, who joined VOA in 2003, was told late Monday she was being reassigned, hours after the veteran reporter attempted to question Pompeo and then Reilly as the secretary left VOA’s headquarters. In his speech, the outgoing secretary of state praised Michael Pack, USAGM’s chief executive, for changes implemented at USAGM under his leadership. He also commended a group of VOA journalists for their bravery in covering Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests. Widakuswara was among the team honored with the Burke Award for that coverage. Following his speech, which also addressed “American exceptionalism” and what he views as VOA's role, Pompeo had a brief question-and-answer session with Reilly, who did not pose questions submitted by the agency’s main newsroom about recent news events. As the secretary of state left the network’s headquarters, Widakuswara tried unsuccessfully to question Pompeo and then Reilly, who admonished Widakuswara, saying she was not authorized to ask questions. The statement signed by the more than two dozen VOA journalists calls for Reilly's and Robbins’ immediate resignations.“As journalists, our job is to pursue the truth — to ask questions even when it is uncomfortable or difficult. While Mr. Reilly abdicated this duty, one VOA journalist — Senior White House Correspondent Patsy Widakuswara — tried to uphold it by questioning Secretary Pompeo after the event,” the statement says. The statement also criticizes the “sudden and unexplained” reassignment of VOA Central News Director Yolanda Lopez, who was moved into a new role Wednesday evening. She was replaced by Luis Ramirez, an editor in the news division who has worked as a correspondent and editor in overseas and domestic bureaus during a 21-year career with the agency. VOA directors have the authority to reassign staff as they see fit. A spokesperson said Wednesday that it does not comment on personnel matters. Representatives Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, and Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, condemned the decision to remove Widakuswara in a joint statement from the Foreign Affairs Committee. In a separate statement shared with VOA, Meeks, the new committee chairman, said, “It is ironic that Secretary Pompeo would praise VOA for fighting foreign propaganda while using it to spread his own. Pompeo improperly held VOA reporters as a captive audience for a speech where the only questions allowed were from the administration’s own appointees.”Noting that Pack is already under scrutiny by the committee for “efforts to dismantle editorial independence at VOA,” Meeks added that the decision to remove a senior reporter “only gives ammunition to those same authoritarian leaders and undermines our ability to promote free speech around the world.”Pack has previously denied allegations that he is interfering with editorial independence, saying he is trying to address long-standing issues, including alleged security lapses within the agency. USAGM referred comments to VOA's public relations. In aDecember 6 interview with'“American Thought Leaders” podcast, Pack said his vision was to address areas where the networks are failing to fulfil their mission adequately, including reporting objectively, explaining American values and presenting the U. S. administration’s viewpoint. Media rights lawyer Theodore Boutrous accused Pack, Reilly and Pompeo of “making the First Amendment and the American tradition of freedom of the press a laughingstock around the world.”Boutrous, whose firm, Gibson Dunn, represents Widakuswara as well as senior USAGM officials and a VOA journalist in a separate lawsuit,warned in a letter Wednesdaythat the reassignment was “unlawful and unconstitutional” and called on Reilly to immediately reinstate her. Widakuswara is the second White House correspondent to face apparent retaliation since Pack’s tenure began. A separate lawsuit from Gibson Dunn alleged that Pack’s aides created a dossier on Steve Herman in an effort to have him reassigned. In that case, a federal district court banned Pack from directly interfering inVOA’s editorial decisions, including investigating staff. The GAP also wrote to Pack, Reilly and Robbins on Wednesday, informing them that the decision to remove Widakuswara was gross mismanagement. The letter noted that Widakuswara has since been assigned to the Indonesian service. Neither the reporter nor her union representative was informed of the move, and Widakuswara only learned of it after being copied on an internal email, David Seide, senior counsel at GAP, said in the letter. Indonesian news outlets includinghave reported on the bipartisan condemnation of VOA over its decision to reassign Widakuswara. The White House correspondent started her career as an international journalist in VOA’s Indonesian service, working on a J-1 visa. Journalists at VOA’s sister network RFE/RL have also raised concerns over Pack’s decisions. A December 30 letter from the RFE/RL editorial board and language service directors protested attempts by Pack to change their grantee contracts. The amendments, signed Monday by Ted Lipien, the newly appointed president of RFE/RL, say members, officers and directors appointed by the CEO cannot be removed for two years after their appointment, unless convicted of a criminal charge, and after that period they can be removed only for cause. The revised contract also states that as a condition of receiving grant funds, RFE/RL agrees to amend its articles of incorporation, bylaws and other documents as necessary.“[This] is precisely the kind of political power maneuver that RFE/RL regularly witnesses in places like Russia, Hungary, Belarus and Tajikistan. We never thought we’d see it from our own oversight agency,”the letter read. USAGM has also sought to debar the Open Technology Fund from federal funding, citing conflicts of interest and alleged irregularities at the independent nonprofit. Pack first notified the OTF of plans to block it from funding on December 15, but he rescinded the notice and reissued it without explanation at the end of the month. The new notice means that a 90-day extension for OTF to contest the bill, included in a spending bill signed by Congress in late December, no longer applies.",3,Reliable,0.0553167296838182,0.3704145011107036,1521,3,Voice of America
114,Vaccines Are Here. We Have to Talk About Side Effects,-2.33,49.33,https://www.wired.com/story/vaccines-are-here-we-have-to-talk-about-side-effects/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,25,"Since Monday, eagerlyawaited Covid-19 vaccines have been going into the upper arms of health care workers around the United States, the first slender tranche of millions of doses to come. But the joy that has greeted the shots’ arrival is already being muted by worries. Billions of dollars were spent to achieve the formulas. Prepping the US population to receive them got much less attention. This may turn out to be a mistake. The documentation provided by Pfizer and Moderna to the Food and Drug Administration notes that both vaccines have side effects—minor ones that fade after roughly two days, but that occurred in substantial percentages of people who received them in the trials—and a few serious reactions have been reported. Descriptions of those side effects are beginning to circulate, vianewsreportsand also social mediaaccountswritten by trial participants. Those descriptions are reaching the public in the absence of any effort to contextualize or counter them. There has not, to this point, been a coordinated national campaign that reassures people the vaccine not only works, but is safe to take and will not cause long-term illness. Planners and health researchers are getting concerned that it is already getting late to start.“It's really important, at this juncture when vaccines are about to be distributed, to talk to people about the predictable side effects from the vaccine,” says Eric Toner, a physician and senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “The worst case scenario would be that we don't tell people this, and they have a reaction, and they either believe that they got Covid from the shot or that there's something wrong.”That is a pressing concern, for two reasons. First, fear of side effects turns out to be one of the main reasons why people doubt these vaccines. And second, mistrust opens the door not just to confusion but to weaponized disinformation, and those will prevent people taking a vaccine that they need. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation’sKFF Covid-19 Vaccine Monitor, a rolling survey of 1,600 people 18 and older that launched this week to provide an ongoing measure of public feeling, reveals that, overall, people are feeling more positive about the shot than they were earlier this year. In November, 71 percent of participants said they are likely to take the vaccine, up from 63 percent in a survey done in September. But the remaining 27 percent said they would probably or definitely never take it, a proportion that rose to 33 percent among Black adults, 33 percent among essential workers, and 29 percent among people working in health care. For those who are hesitant, the leading worry was fear of side effects. This is a tricky thing to create reassurance about, because the side effects are real. Though the Pfizer vaccine was onlygranted emergency authorizationlast weekend, and the Moderna one is not authorized yet, tens of thousands of people received them earlier this year in clinical trials. In news accounts and on social media, participants have described experiencing “a severe hangover,” “fever ... fatigue and chills,” “full-on Covid-like symptoms.” One participanttoldCNBC he shook so hard with chills that he cracked a tooth. Those accounts match the data submitted by the companies to the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which reviews safety and efficacy. According to briefing documents, the Pfizer formulacausedfatigue in 59.4 percent of trial participants after their second dose, headaches in 51.7 percent, muscle pain in 37.3 percent, joint pain in 21.9 percent, chills in 35.1 percent, and fever in 15.8 percent. The numbers for the Moderna formula, which werereleasedTuesday, are similar: fatigue in 68.5 percent of recipients, headache in 63 percent, aches and pains in 59.6 percent, chills in 43.4 percent, and fever in 15.6 percent. These reactions aren’t mild to people experiencing them, but they are expected, and pass quickly. There have been very few serious adverse events recorded. In the United Kingdom, two vaccine recipients who already suffered from severe allergies hadanaphylacticreactions to their first shot of the Pfizer formula, but recovered. On Tuesday, a health care worker in Alaska who had just been vaccinated alsosufferedan allergic reaction and was hospitalized, according to. During the trials, four US recipients of the Pfizer formula and three of the Moderna formuladevelopedBell’s palsy, which is a paralysis of nerves on one side of the face that can last for several weeks. But FDA officialstoldJAMAthis week that the number of cases matches the background rate of the disorder in the whole population—about 30 people out of every 100,000 every year—and was not caused by the vaccine. Having a modest reaction to a vaccine is normal, a sign of the immune system revving up in response. (In fact, in both trials, percentages of participants who received inert placebo injectionsreported side effects.) But people misinterpret that reaction even with well-known, well-studied vaccines: Every year, people have to be reassured thatreceivingthe flu vaccine doesn’t infect them with influenza, because the reaction to receiving the shot can feel like the beginnings of the flu itself. Flu is not a benign disease, and preventing it is important. But with the Covid vaccine, the stakes are even higher. “I worry that [the side effects] could be a major barrier to vaccine uptake,” Kristen R. Choi, a nurse and health services researcher at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, wrote last week in aessaydescribing her own reactions of chills, nausea, dizziness, and 104.9 degree fever. “Clinicians will need to be prepared to discuss with patients why they should trust the vaccine and that its adverse effects could look a lot like COVID-19.”A particular challenge right now is that the vaccines are so new. No trial recipient has been tracked longer than a few months, and while the number of people who received them was substantial, it is still a small fraction of the number who will. It is possible that a side effect that occurs once in a million doses could surface at some point after millions of doses are administered. Thishappenedin the 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign, in which more than 500 people in the US came down with Guillain-Barré paralysis, and in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, in which a small number of children in Scandinavia who received a flu vaccine came down with narcolepsy. Given those still-remembered episodes, health planners may not want to commit to reassurances that they might later have to walk back. “This is the age-old problem public health officials face, where you need to reassure the public without having full information on hand,” says Josh Michaud, an epidemiologist who is the Kaiser Foundation’s associate director for global health policy. But even given incomplete information, pro-vaccine messaging has to get started, he adds: “It's going to be absolutely critical to get ahead of the inevitable disinformation and misinformation that's going to be out there, before it takes root.”People being hesitant to accept vaccination is not a new problem, of course, and social science has studied hesitancy for years. Researchers are quick to point out that what looks like one block of opposition to vaccination is really many overlapping populations, with different motivations for being hesitant, from suspicion of science tohistoric mistreatmentto political affiliation to lack of access to information (or to the vaccine itself, inrural areasand “pharmacy deserts.”)But specific fear of side effects hasn’t been as well-researched as some other motivations, says Sema Sgaier, cofounder and CEO of Surgo Ventures, anonprofitthat applies data science to public health problems. “There is not that much evidence in terms of what kinds of messaging works,” she says. “There will be an opportunity here to test different messages and see how we're going to alleviate these concerns.”Meanwhile, misinformation isn’t waiting. Two weeks ago, the BBCcollectedsome of the wilder claims—that the vaccine contains a microchip or fetal tissue or will alter the body’s DNA—in a debunking effort. Claims such as these aren’t merely misinformed; they are malicious. Joan Donovan, a social scientist and research director at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center, has been tracking the increase in mis- and disinformation since the pandemic began.“Since very early on in January, we’ve had a concerted misinformation campaign to make the public doubt the science around the pandemic, pushing claims that this is a conspiracy, a lab-created bioweapon, an attack on the United States by China,” she says. “This is a big problem, because when people search for things like, ‘Where did the coronavirus come from?’ they're not finding thoughtful discussions of the science. This part of the information market has been really cornered by disinformers.”Which makes it all the more urgent to get out in front. In thejournalEClinical Medicinelast week, the global health and vaccine experts Ali Mokdad, Pete Hotez, and Walt Orensteincalled fora “national communications plan” to anticipate problems, writing: “The American public will need to hear public health information about vaccines from trusted organizations of the US Government and at frequent and regular intervals. We need fully engaged vaccine scientists and public health experts who possess top-flight communication skills.”But here’s the problem. In normal times, the people who would be expected to speak for science on a national scale would be federal health leaders. But under the Trump administration, federal health leaders were sidelined and undermined, to the point that Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases spoke tosports starsandlifestyle magazinesto get his message out. The incoming administration is working to reverse that loss of credibility. President-elect Joe Biden hasannounceda 100-day plan to combat Covid andvolunteeredto be vaccinated live on TV alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. On Sunday, the transition teamreleaseda social media message on mask-wearing starring the incoming CDC director, the new Surgeon General, and a newly named national Covid-19 response coordinator. But the politicization and distrust remain so strong that federal leaders may not now be the right people to lead an educational campaign on the safety of the Covid vaccine. Scott Ratzan, a physician and public health researcher who is currently Distinguished Lecturer at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, has been calling sinceMarchfor “coordinated, trusted sources” to push vetted health information out to the public. On the site of the National Academy of Medicine, he and other academics proposed creating a public-private “Covid news bureau”—a nongovernmental, comprehensive stockpile of public health information and messaging that could serve as a fact-check for social media and the public.“It has to be external to government, and also external to industry, because trust in all institutions is going down,” says Ratzan, who also cofounded an alliance of researchers called Convince (for Covid-19 New Vaccine Information, Communication, and Education) to draw businesses into promoting vaccine literacy. “It needs to be some group that can’t be politicized by the left or the right.”The difficult reality may be that there is no time to wait for an organized messaging campaign, and that the answer to countering fear of side effects is volunteer action to fill the federal void. That would be the same kind of volunteer action that already birthed theCovid Tracking Project,Covid Exit Strategy,Covid Act Now, theJohns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centerand a raft of other projects—including, most recently, theCovid-19 Vaccine Allocation Dashboard, created byBenjamin Renton, a senior at Middlebury College. That kind of volunteering is also behind the personal storytelling that occurred organically on social media this week, asphysiciansandpharmacistsandhospital janitorsstepped up to show they were thrilled to take their shot. “It’s important to see people from different communities taking the vaccine and describing their experience of it,” Donovan says. “The way people message science, it's often very impersonal, very removed. The narratives that we need to tell now are compelling stories of people's humanity.”It may be that it’s the responsibility of everyone who supports the vaccine, no matter where they are in the queue, to work to dispel concerns about it: topush backon disinformation, to flood social media and Zoom calls and socially distanced chats with support, to be what the writer Emily Willingham once called “nerd nodes” for personal networks. Choi, the nurse and trial participant, predicted that will be necessary. “Every physician and nurse in the US needs to be prepared to have a conversation about adverse effects with patients,” she warned in her essay last week. “I can already see the wrong message about the COVID-19 vaccine going viral.”",3,Reliable,0.0563687628161312,0.3656068931068934,2923,3,WIRED
115,Trump vetoes bill to end U.S. military aid for Saudis in Yemen war,0.0,49.5,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-vetoes-bill-to-end-us-military-aid-for-saudis-in-yemen-war-2019-04-16?mod=mw_theo_homepage,https://adfontesmedia.com/marketwatch-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday vetoed a bill passed by Congress to end U. S. military assistance in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. In a break with the president, Congress voted for the first time earlier this month to invoke the War Powers Resolution to try to stop U. S. involvement in a foreign conflict. The veto — the second in Trump’s presidency — was expected. Congress lacks the votes to override him.“This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,” Trump wrote in explaining his veto. Congress has grown uneasy with Trump’s close relationship with Saudi Arabia as he tries to further isolate Iran, a regional rival. Many lawmakers also criticized the president for not condemning Saudi Arabia for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States and had written critically about the kingdom. Khashoggi went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October and never came out. Intelligence agencies said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was complicit in the killing. The U. S. provides billions of dollars of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen. Members of Congress have expressed concern about the thousands of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes since the conflict began in 2014. The fighting in the Arab world’s poorest country also has left millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and has pushed the country to the brink of famine. House approval of the resolution came earlier this month on a 247-175 vote. The Senate vote last month was 54-46. Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, voted to end U. S. military assistance to the war, saying the humanitarian crisis in Yemen triggered “demands moral leadership.”The top Republican on the committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, acknowledged the dire situation in Yemen for civilians, but spoke out in opposition to the bill. McCaul said it was an abuse of the War Powers Resolution and predicted it could disrupt U. S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries. Trump issued his first veto last month on legislation related to immigration. Trump had declared a national emergency so he could use more money to construct a border wall. Congress voted to block the emergency declaration and Trump vetoed that measure.",3,Reliable,0.0511730205278592,0.3369745845552297,512,3,MarketWatch
116,Biden’s $6 Trillion Budget for 2022: 6 Takeaways,0.0,47.67,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2021/05/27/Biden-s-6-Trillion-Budget-2022-6-Takeaways,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-27,25,"President Joe Biden is set to propose a $6 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year that envisions maintaining federal spending at its highest sustained levels since World War II and would result in a decade of deficits topping $1.3 trillion a year, according to reports. The budget request, slated to be released on Friday, fleshes out the full picture of Biden’s plans as the president pushes for trillions of dollars in new spending and taxes that the administration says are needed to reverse years of chronic underinvestment and ensure that the United States can compete with China and other nations. The budget blueprint also offers longer-term projections of how the administration believes Biden’s agenda would affect the economy. Here, six takeaways from the details that have been reported so far. A surge in spending:The Biden budget calls for spending to rise to $8.2 trillion by 2031, according toThe New York Times, driven by Biden’s $4.1 trillion in proposed spending packages for infrastructure and the social safety net and by increases in annual discretionary spending. The White House in April issued a discretionary spending request that called for a nearly 16% increase in outlays for non-defense programs, including large increases for health care and education, and a 1.7% increase for defense. For context, the federal government spent about $6.6 trillion in fiscal year 2020, or $2.1 trillion more than in fiscal year 2019 as a result of emergency pandemic response. In all, Biden’s budget reportedly calls for $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade, according toCNBC.“In each year of Mr. Biden’s budget, the government would spend more as a share of the economy thanall but two years since World War II: 2020 and 2021, which were marked by trillions of dollars in federal spending to help people and businesses endure the pandemic-induced recession,” the Times’s Jim Tankersley writes. A decade of trillion-dollar deficits:Deficits were already projected to behistorically largeover the coming decade, and Biden’s blueprint would expand them even further. The deficit for 2022 would come in at $1.8 trillion, even as the economy is projected to grow briskly — the administration projects the fastest annual pace since the early 1980s, according to the Times. And annual deficits under Biden’s budget would run higher than $1.3 trillion throughout the decade. In all, Biden’s $5 trillion in proposed new spending is partially offset by $3.6 trillion in additional revenues over the same period, CNBC says, leaving $1.4 trillion in expanded deficits over 10 years. Total debt held by the public would climb to 117% of gross domestic product by 2031, compared to 107% under the Congressional Budget Office’slong-term outlookpublished in March. And interest payments on the national debt would reportedly double as a share of the economy between 2022 and 2031. At the same time, the administration’s projections show budget deficits shrinking in the 2030s, in keeping with earlier White House projections that the costs of the president’s infrastructure and social spending plans would be fully offset over 15 years by his proposed tax increases. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen defended the budget in testimony Thursday before a House Appropriation subcommittee, calling it “fiscally responsible” and arguing that it balanced much-needed near-term spending with longer-term deficit reduction. “The president’s proposal, you’ll see, will have a temporary period of spending and permanent increases that beyond the budget window will result in lower deficits and more tax revenue to support those expenditures,” Yellen said, according toBloomberg News. That argument isn’t likely to ease the concerns of deficit hawks who have called for faster action to address ongoing structural imbalances and stabilize the ratio of debt to GDP. Instead, we’re likely headed for renewed political debate on deficits and debt, with Democratstoutingthe promised economic benefits of their proposed spending and Republicans warning about the dangers of historically large deficits and debt. Trillions in tax hikes — and some controversial new ones, maybe:Biden has proposed to at least partially reverse some of the tax cuts for corporations and top earners included in the 2017 Republican tax overhaul. His budget projects that federal tax revenues as a share of the economy will grow larger than at any time since the Clinton administration. It also projects that the president and Congress will allow the GOP law’s tax cuts for low- and middle-income Americans to expire as scheduled at the end of 2025. That could conflict with Biden’s repeated pledge not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year, though Biden could still seek to extend those tax cuts in future budgets. Lawmakers in both parties will certainly be loath to allow tax hikes on those lower earners.“This is the latest example of President Biden abandoning his lofty promise that he can fund trillions of dollars in new spending simply by taxing the wealthy or corporations alone,” House Ways and Means Committee Republicans said in a statement. “In fact, President Biden’s budget relies on expiration of middle-class tax cuts in order to achieve a historically high level of tax on Americans.""Some more modest economic assumptions:Biden’s budget includes conservative forecasts for economic growth — “a break from the recent past,” Tankersley notes. The blueprint reportedly projects a burst of about 5% growth in 2021 that cools to 4.3% next year and then falls to just under 2% a year for much of the rest of the decade, even if Biden’s full agenda is put in place. The budget also predicts that unemployment will drop to 4.1% by next year and stay below 4% over the rest of the decade. At the same time, the forecast also shows inflation staying relatively tame and interest rates rising slowly, contrary to concerns from some economists that soaring federal spending could lead the economy to overheat. Some big campaign promises left out for now:Biden’s budget does not include some major proposals that he campaigned on, including a “public option” for government-run health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, a plan to lower the Medicare eligibility age and allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and student debt forgiveness of up to $10,000. Those omissions could cause Biden some headaches, as progressives have urged him to tackle those items now. (The White House budget reportedly does include language pressing lawmakers to create a public option, allow people 60 years old and up to enroll in Medicare and enact legislation cutting federal prescription drug spending, but those goals are not incorporated into the outlined spending.)Budget battles loom:Democrats control both the House and Senate, meaning that, as Tankersley writes, “Biden faces some of the best odds of any president in recent history in getting much of his agenda approved, particularly if he can reach agreement with lawmakers on parts of his infrastructure agenda.” Even so, lawmakers — including those in Biden’s party — aren’t likely to embrace all of the president’s proposals. Instead, the president’s budget request will jump start months of budget battles. Biden’s proposal to spend $753 billion on defense is sure to be a particular point of contention, as it has already faced sharp pushback from Republicans who want a higher increase — and spurred some divisions among Democrats, with progressives calling for cuts. Republicans are already criticizing Biden’s overall blueprint, with Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN)calling it“unbelievable” and “crazy.” Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY)tweeted, “Biden’s budget has the highest debt/GDP ratio in American history. Congress needs to wake up. We can’t continue spending future generations into oblivion.”",3,Reliable,0.0844467291967292,0.3686134359467691,1686,3,Fiscal Times
117,The New Domestic War on Terror is Coming,0.33,36.0,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-new-domestic-war-on-terror-is,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,16,"have ushered in a wave of new domestic police powers and rhetoric in the name of fighting “terrorism” that are carbon copies of many of the worst excesses of the first War on Terror that began nearly twenty years ago. This trend shows no sign of receding as we move farther from the January 6 Capitol riot. The opposite is true: it is intensifying. We have witnessed an orgy of censorship from Silicon Valley monopolies with calls for far more aggressive speech policing, a visibly militarized Washington, D. C. featuring a non-ironicallynamed “Green Zone,”vows from the incoming president and his key allies for a new anti-domestic terrorism bill, and frequent accusations of “sedition,” “treason,” and “terrorism” against members of Congress and citizens. This is all driven by a radical expansion of the meaning of “incitement to violence.” It is accompanied by viral-on-social-media pleas that one work with the FBI to turn in one’s fellow citizens () and demands for a new system of domestic surveillance. Underlying all of this are immediate insinuations that anyone questioning any of this must, by virtue of these doubts, harbor sympathy for the Terrorists and their neo-Nazi, white supremacist ideology. Liberals have spent so many years now in a tight alliance with neocons and the CIA that they are making the 2002 version of John Ashcroftlook like the President of the (old-school) ACLU. The more honest proponents of this new domestic War on Terror are explicitly admitting that they want to model it on the first one. Areporternotedon Monday that a “former intelligence official on PBS NewsHour” said “that the US should think about a ‘9/11 Commission’ for domestic extremism and consider applying some of the lessons from the fight against Al Qaeda here at home.” More amazingly, Gen. Stanley McChrystal — for years head of Joint Special Operations Command in Iraq and the commander of the war in Afghanistan — explicitly compared that war to this new one,speaking toYahoo News:I did see a similar dynamic in the evolution of al-Qaida in Iraq, where a whole generation of angry Arab youth with very poor prospects followed a powerful leader who promised to take them back in time to a better place, and he led them to embrace an ideology that justified their violence. This is now happening in America…. I think we’re much further along in this radicalization process, and facing a much deeper problem as a country, than most Americans realize.”Anyone who, despite all this, still harbors lingering doubts that the Capitol riot is and will be the neoliberal 9/11, and that a new War on Terror is being implemented in its name, need only watch the two short video clips below, which will clear their doubts for good. It is like being catapulted by an unholy time machine back to Paul Wolfowitz’s 2002 messaging lab. The first video, flaggedby Tom Elliott, is from Monday morning’sprogram on MSNBC (the show that arguably did more to help Donald Trump become the GOP nominee than any other). It features Jeremy Bash — one of theseemingly countless employeesof TV news networks who previously worked in Obama’s CIA and Pentagon — demanding that, in response to the Capitol riot, “we reset our entire intelligence approach,” including “look[ing] at greater surveillance of them,” adding: “the FBI is going to have to run confidential sources.” See if you detect any differences between what CIA operatives and neocons were saying in 2002 when demanding the Patriot Act and greater FBI and NSA surveillance and what this CIA-official-turned-NBC-News-analyst is saying here:The second video features the amazing declaration from former Facebook security official Alex Stamos, talking to theCNN host Brian Stelter, about the need for social media companies to use the same tactics against U. S. citizens that theyused to remove ISIS from the internet— “in collaboration with law enforcement” — and that those tactics should be directly aimed at what he calls extremist “conservative influencers.”“Press freedoms are being abused by these actors,” the former Facebook executive proclaimed. Stamos noted how generous he and his comrades have been up until now: “We have given a lot of leeway — both in the traditional media and in social media — to people with a very broad range of views.” But no more. Now is the time to “get us all back in the same consensual reality.”In a moment of unintended candor, Stamos noted the real problem: “there are people on YouTube, for example, that have a larger audience than people on daytime CNN” — and it’s time for CNN and other mainstream outlets to seize the monopoly on information dissemination to which they are divinely entitled by taking away the platforms of those whom people actually want to watch and listen to:(If still not convinced, and if you can endure it, you can alsowatchMSNBC’s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski literally screaming that one needed remedy to the Capitol riot is that the Biden administration must “shutdown” Facebook.). Calls for a War on Terror sequel — a domestic version complete with surveillance and censorship — are not confined to ratings-deprived cable hosts and ghouls from the security state.reports that “Mr. Biden has said he plans to make a priority ofpassing a law against domestic terrorism, and he has been urged to create a White House post overseeing the fight against ideologically inspired violent extremists and increasing funding to combat them.”Meanwhile, Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) — not just one of the most dishonest members of Congress but also one of the most militaristic and authoritarian — hashad a billproposed since 2019 to simply amend the existing foreign anti-terrorism bill to allow the U. S. Government to invoke exactly the same powers at home against “domestic terrorists.”Why would such new terrorism laws be needed in a country that already imprisons more of its citizens than any other country in the world as the result of a very aggressive set of criminal laws? What acts should be criminalized by new “domestic terrorism” laws that are not already deemed criminal? They never say, almost certainly because — just as was true of the first set of new War on Terror laws — their real aim is to criminalize that: speech, association, protests, opposition to the new ruling coalition. The answer to this question — what needs to be criminalized that is not already a crime? — scarcely seems to matter. Media and political elites have placed as many Americans as they can — and it is a lot — into full-blown fear and panic mode, and when that happens, people are willing toacquiesce to anythingclaimed necessary to stop that threat, as the first War on Terror, still going strong twenty years later, decisively proved.could — and probably should — be written on why all of this is so concerning. For the moment, two points are vital to emphasize. First, much of the alarmism and fear-mongering is being driven by a deliberate distortion of what it means for speech to “incite violence.” The bastardizing of this phrase was thebasis forPresident Trump’s rushed impeachment last week. It is also what isdriving callsfor dozens of members of Congress to be expelled and even prosecuted on “sedition” charges for having objected to the Electoral College certification, and is also at the heart of the spate of censorship actions already undertaken and further repressive measures being urged. This phrase — “inciting violence” — was also what drove many of the worst War on Terror abuses. I spent years reporting on how numerous young American Muslims wereprosecutedunder new, draconian anti-terrorism laws for uploading anti-U. S.-foreign-policyYouTube videosor givingrousing anti-American speechesdeemedto “incite violence”and thusprovide “material support”to terrorist groups — the exact theory which Rep. Schiff is seeking to import into the new domestic War on Terror. It is vital to ask what it means for speech to constitute “incitement to violence” to the point that it can be banned or criminalized. The expression ofpolitical viewpoint, especially one passionately expressed, has the potential to “incite” someone else to get so riled up that they engage in violence. ShareIf you rail against the threats to free speech posed by Silicon Valley monopolies, someone hearing you may get so filled with rage that they decide to bomb an Amazon warehouse or a Facebook office. If you write a blistering screed accusing pro-life activists of endangering the lives of women by forcing them back into unsafe back-alley abortions, or if you argue that abortion is murder, you may very well inspire someone to engage in violence against a pro-life group or an abortion clinic. If you start a protest movement to object to the injustice of Wall Street bailouts — whether you call it “Occupy Wall Street” or the Tea Party — you may cause someone to go hunt down Goldman Sachs or Citibank executives who they believe are destroying the economic future of millions of people. If you claim that George W. Bush stole the 2000 and/or 2004 elections — as many Democrats,including members of Congress, did— you may inspire civic unrest or violence against Bush and his supporters. The same is true if you claim the 2016 or 2020 elections were fraudulent or illegitimate. If you rage against the racist brutality of the police, people may go burn down buildings in protest — ormurder randomly selectedpolice officers whom they have become convinced areagents of a racist genocidal state. The Bernie Sanders campaign volunteer and hard-core Democratic partisan, James Hodgkinson, who went to a softball field in June, 2017 tomurder Republican Congress members— and almost succeeded in fatally shooting Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) — had spent months listening to radical Sanders supporters and participating in Facebook groups with names like “Terminate the Republican Party” and “Trump is a Traitor.”Hodgkinson had heard over and over that Republicans were not merely misguided but were “traitors” and grave threats to the Republic. Asreported, “his favorite television shows were listed as ‘Real Time with Bill Maher;’ ‘The Rachel Maddow Show;’ ‘Democracy Now!’ and other left-leaning programs.” All of the political rhetoric to which he was exposed — from the pro-Sanders Facebook groups, MSNBC and left-leaning shows — undoubtedly played a major role in triggering his violent assault and decision to murder pro-Trump Republican Congress members. Despite the potential of all of those views to motivate others to commit violence in their name — potential that has sometimes been realized — none of the people expressing those views, no matter how passionately, can be validly characterized as “inciting violence” either legally or ethically. That is because all of that speech is protected, legitimate speech. None of it advocates violence. None of it urges others to commit violence in its name. The fact that it may “inspire” or “motivate” some mentally unwell person or a genuine fanatic to commit violence does not make the person espousing those views and engaging in that non-violent speech guilty of “inciting violence” in any meaningful sense. To illustrate this point, I have often cited the crucial and brilliantly reasoned Supreme Court free speech ruling inIn the 1960s and 1970s, the State of Mississippi tried to hold local NAACP leaders liable on the ground that their fiery speeches urging a boycott of white-owned stores “incited” their followers to burn down stores and violently attack patrons who did not honor the boycott. The State’s argument was that the NAACP leaders knew that they were metaphorically pouring gasoline on a fire with their inflammatory rhetoric to rile up and incite angry crowds. But the Supreme Courtrejected that argument, explaining that free speech will die if people are held responsible not for their own violent acts but for those committed byand were motivated to commit crimes in the name of that cause (emphasis added):Civil liability. . . .[A]ny such theory fails for the simple reason that there is no evidence — apart from the speeches themselves -- that [the NAACP leader sued by the State] authorized, ratified, or directly threatened acts of violence. . . . . To impose liability without a finding that the NAACP authorized — either actually or apparently — or ratified unlawful conduct would impermissibly burden the rights of political association that are protected by the First Amendment. . . . While the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct,Only those losses proximately caused by unlawful conduct may be recovered. Theourt relied upon the iconic First Amendment ruling inBrandenburg v. Ohio,which overturned the criminal conviction of a KKK leader who had publicly advocated the possibility of violence against politicians. Evenexplicitly advocating the need or justifiability of violence for political endsis protected speech, ruled the court. They carved out a very narrow exception: “where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action” — meaning someone is explicitly urging an already-assembled mob to specific violence with the expectation that they will do so more or less immediately (such as standing outside someone’s home and telling the gathered mob:it’s time to burn it down). It goes without saying that First Amendment jurisprudence on “incitement” governs what a state can do when punishing or restricting speech, not what a Congress can do in impeaching a president or expelling its own members, and certainly not social media companies seeking to ban people from their platforms. But that does not make these principles of how to understand “incitement to violence” irrelevant when applied to other contexts. Indeed, the central reasoning of these cases is vital to preserve everywhere: that if speech is classified as “incitement to violence” despite not explicitly advocating violence, it will sweep upwhich those wielding this term wish it to encompass. No political speech will be safe from this term when interpreted and applied so broadly and carelessly. And that is directly relevant to the second point. Continuing to process Washington debates of this sort primarily through the prism of “Democrat v. Republican” or even “left v. right” is a sure ticket to the destruction of core rights. There are times when powers of repression and censorship are aimed more at the left and times when they are aimed more at the right, but it is neither inherently a left-wing nor a right-wing tactic. It is a, and it will be deployed against anyone perceived to be a dissident to ruling class interests and orthodoxies no matter where on the ideological spectrum they reside. The last several months of politician-and-journalist-demanded Silicon Valley censorship has targeted the right, but prior to that and simultaneously it has often targeted those perceived to be on the left. The government has frequently declared right-wing domestic groups “terrorists,” while in the 1960s and 1970s it was left-wing groups devoted to anti-war activism whichbore that designation. In 2011, British policedesignatedthe London version of Occupy Wall Street a “terrorist” group. In the 1980s, the African National Congress was so designated. “Terrorism” is an amorphous term that was created, and will always be used, to outlaw formidable dissent no matter its source or ideology. If you identify as a conservative and continue to believe that your prime enemies are ordinary leftists, or you identify as a leftist and believe your prime enemies are Republican citizens, you will fall perfectly into the trap set for you. Namely, you will ignore your real enemies, the ones who actually wield power at your expense: ruling class elites, who really do not care about “right v. left” and most definitely do not care about “Republican v. Democrat” — as evidenced by the fact that they fund both parties — but instead care only about one thing:, or preservation of the prevailing neoliberal order. Unlike so many ordinary citizens addicted to trivial partisan warfare, these ruling class elites know who their real enemies are: anyone who steps outside the limits and rules of the game they have crafted and who seeks to disrupt the system that preserves their prerogatives and status. The one who put this best was probably Barack Obama when he was president, when he observed — correctly — that the perceived warfare between establishment Democratic and Republican elites was mostly theater, and on the question of what they, they’re both “fighting inside the 40 yard line” together:A standard Goldman Sachs banker or Silicon Valley executive has far more in common, and is far more comfortable, with Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan than they do with the ordinary American citizen. Except when it means a mildly disruptive presence — like Trump — they barely care whether Democrats or Republicans rule various organs of government, or whether people who call themselves “liberals” or “conservatives” ascend to power. Some left-wing members of Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) have said theyopposea newdomestic terrorism law, but Democrats will have no trouble forming a majority by partnering with their neocon GOP allies like Liz Cheney to get it done, as they did earlier this yearto stop the withdrawalof troops from Afghanistan and Germany. Neoliberalism and imperialism do not care about the pseudo-fights between the two parties or the cable TV bickering of the day. They do not like the far left or the far right. They do not like extremism of any kind. They do not support Communism and they do not support neo-Nazism or some fascist revolution. They care only about one thing: disempowering and crushing anyone who dissents from and threatens their hegemony. They care about stoppingAll the weapons they build and institutions they assemble — the FBI, the DOJ, the CIA, the NSA, oligarchical power — exist for that sole and exclusive purpose, to fortify their power by rewarding those who accede to their pieties and crushing those who do not. No matter your views on the threat posed by international Islamic radicalism, huge excesses were committed in the name of stopping it — or, more accurately, the fears it generated were exploited to empower and entrench existing financial and political elites. The Authorization to Use Military Force — responsible forof war — was approved by the Housethree daysafter the 9/11 attack withjust one dissenting vote. The Patriot Act — which radically expanded government surveillance powers — was enacted a meresix weeksafter that attack, based on the promise that it would be temporary and “sunset” in four years. Like the wars spawned by 9/11, it is still in full force, virtually never debated any longer and predictablyexpanded far beyondhow it was originally depicted. The first War on Terror ended up being wielded primarily on foreign soil but it has increasingly been imported onto domestic soil against Americans. This New War on Terror —one that is domestic in name from the start and carries the explicit purpose of fighting “extremists” and “domestic terrorists” among American citizens on U. S. soil — presents the whole slew of historically familiar dangers when governments, exploiting media-generated fear and dangers, arm themselves with the power to control information, debate, opinion, activism and protests. That a new War on Terror is coming is not a question of speculation and it is not in doubt. Those who now wield power are saying it explicitly. The only thing that is in doubt is how much opposition they will encounter from those who value basic civic rights more than the fears of one another being deliberately cultivated within us.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0935351884462053,0.4390053990265852,4270,2,Glenn Greenwald
118,Mississippi Explicitly Asks the Supreme Court to Overturn Roe v. Wade,-9.67,45.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/07/mississippi-15-week-abortion-ban-viability-supreme-court-roe-v-wade.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"The state of Mississippi made explicit Thursday its attempt to have the Supreme Court overturn,filing a briefthat calls on the court to uphold the state’s current abortion restrictions en route to upending the nearly 50-year-old law that ensures access to abortion procedures in the U. S. Mississippi’s Republican attorney general, Lynn Fitch, filed the brief that seeks to persuade the court to dust off the settled law and break with precedent to allow the state’s prohibition on abortion services after 15 weeks of a pregnancy to stand. The legal standard established underRoesays states must allow access for abortions performed up until fetal viability around 24 weeks. Mississippi passed the restrictiveabortion lawin 2018, along with a slew of anti-abortion provisions that have been blocked by the courts, including a law restricting abortions after six weeks. The Supreme Court announced in May that it would hear thecase, setting off alarm among abortion rights activists. The suit filed by the Jackson, Mississippi organization, the only abortion services provider in the state, contesting the 15-week law was successful in the lower courts, which cited precedent preventing states from restricting abortion access during the pre-viability stage. The Supreme Court, however, after months of hemming and hawing, announced that it would hear the state’s appeal of the case, raising the possibility it could choose to upend abortion pre-viability abortion restrictions that have been ruled unconstitutional as placing an undue burden on women seeking an abortion. In announcing its decision, the court stated explicitly it was out to reassess “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”The announcement signaled a tectonic shift in U. S. abortion law could be coming now that the court is lopsided with conservative justices. The Mississippi brief attempts to chip away at the viability standard, claiming advances in science and technology justify the state intervening earlier and earlier in a pregnancy. Even if the Supreme Court does not explicitly reverse, there are other ways it could defang the law. “As an alternative, Mississippi said the court could reduce the heightened scrutiny that abortion laws must meet and find that Mississippi’s law meets legitimate objectives such as protecting the unborn, women’s health or the medical profession,” the Washington Postnotes. “It could find that not all pre-viability abortions are unconstitutional, the state said, or that the 15-week restriction does not place an undue burden on a substantial number of women.”What is clear is that the stakes are high and, as the Post notes, Thursday’s “brief emphasizes the potential presented in the case,, the most direct challenge to abortion rights at the Supreme Court in decades.” The Supreme Court is likely to hear the case later this year, in November or December, and a decision would be handed down by June of nextyear.",3,Reliable,0.0699768518518518,0.4348842592592593,600,2,Slate

Sometime in 2018, Marjorie Taylor Greene, recovering from periodontal surgery and still coming down from anesthesia, was flipping through channels and got very confused. First she landed on Norman Jewison’s “Fiddler on the Roof,” got bored with the character of the old butcher, and found her way to “Star Wars.” Somewhere in between, she saw news coverage of the California Camp Fire, determined there were Rothschild-funded lasers in space causing the deadly blaze and decided topost that belief to Facebook. Antisemitism’s a hell of a drug. Now, for my own part, this is just conjecture.

All it’s missing to meet our current standards for the term is a sustained campaign by those in power and a precise political aim. But Greene’s rise proves there are holes in the barrier between fringe, nutty beliefs and policymakers. It’s one thing for Greene the private citizen to put a lie like this out into the world, it’s quite another when she is a U. S. representative. And to dismiss these pre-office musings as not applicable now is to miss the power of the online lobby that elevated her to Congress to begin with. It’s a cohort that, like their champion, buys into Trump’s big election lie, believes the elite subsist on baby blood, is obsessed with Jewish control and questions whether jet fuel can melt steel beams. Conspiracy theories, both bizarrely novel and steeped in centuries of prejudice, now have a voice in government. We need only look to the life of themanwho coined the term “big lie” to see the dangers of that arrangement.

While much of the conflict between the Chinese state and pro-democratic groups in theformerlysemi-autonomous zone hastaken place on the streets of Hong Kong, Wednesday’s dispute took place in the city’s legislature. Consideredboth a symbol and a bulwark of the “one country, two systems” policy since the special administrative region was established in 1997, the Legislative Council has condemned China’s recent crackdowns and arrests designed to end protests over mainland encroachment in the territory. On Wednesday, the administration granted itself the power to remove council members who have expressed critiques and fired four lawmakers minutes after the announcement was made. As a result, the remaining 15 members of their pro-democracy bloc resigned in protest. Claudia Mo, one of the lawmakers who stepped down, described the censorship effort as a move to “sound the death knell of Hong Kong’s democracy fight,” as Beijing could now remove “anyone they found to be politically incorrect or unpatriotic.” The departure of the 19 pro-democracy lawmakers will leave the Legislative Council only with members who support the administration of President Xi, a group of legislators who already made up the majority. American voices soon reiterated the lawmakers’ cries that the new policy allowing automatic dismissal of dissenting lawmakers would end the very idea of opposition in Hong Kong. Among them were National Security Adviser Robert C. O’Brien, who stated that the “one country, two systems” determination “is now merely a fig-leaf covering … one-party dictatorship in Hong Kong.”The struggle over the power grab in southeast China is one of two recent attempts to consolidate power for which the Xi administration has faced international condemnation: In the northwestern region of Xinjiang,over 1 millionUyghur Muslims have been placed in concentration camps, with reports offorced sterilizations. The resignations are the latest in a recent back-and-forthbetween Hong Kong and Beijing over authority in the city, which is scheduled to keep its semi-autonomous legal and economic systems until 2047. In June 2019, over 1 million protesters demonstrated against a bill that would allow extraditions to the mainland, a proposal that was dropped due to the pushback.

123,"TikTok launches its first personalized annual recap feature, ‘Year on TikTok’ – TechCrunch",0.0,43.67,https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/tiktok-launches-its-first-personalized-annual-recap-feature-year-on-tiktok/,https://adfontesmedia.com/techcrunch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-21,19,"Spotify users haveWrappedand Instagram usershavetheir Top 9. And now TikTok users will have their own year-in-review feature, too. The company todayannouncedthe launch of its first personalized annual recap feature with the launch of “Year on TikTok,” a video highlight reel that showcases individual users’ own top TikTok moments. This includes things like how long you’ve been on TikTok, what sort of videos you watched most, your favorite tracks and creative effects, metrics on how often you commented and shared videos, and more. The feature will also identify your favorite “vibes” — meaning, the sort of videos you like best, such as crafts, cooking, animals, travel, Cottagecore or any of the now numerous communities that have sprung up on the social video platform. If users haven’t been on TikTok long enough to have developed their own “vibe,” TikTok says their “Year on TikTok” will include other top videos from its “Year on TikTok: Top 100” list instead. TikTokTikTokThe content for the recap is presented in a familiar way. You’ll vertically scroll down through a video that details your 2020 interests and activities. You then have the chance to share that video directly to your own TikTok profile in order to receive a special profile badge that puts a “2020” on top of your profile photo. The app’s “Year on TikTok” page also includes other TikTok highlights to browse through, including top memes, top creators, top viral videos, most impactful creators, top celebs, top songs and other year-end trends. TikTok users can access their “Year on TikTok” by tapping the icon on their For You feed — a prominent placement — or by scrolling to the banner at the top of the app’s Discover page. The accuracy of TikTok’s recap is debatable. For example, even though every other video in my For You feed is related to politics and news (go figure!), TikTok informed me my top “vibes” were things like home, travel and animal videos. That’s true too, but it’s an incomplete list and doesn’t match up with the majority of my past “likes.” It seems that TikTok may be curating the experience to focus on more positive “vibes” — and political videos and themes didn’t make the cut. Regardless of its attempts at spin, social features that offer users a personalized retrospective of how they engaged with an app through the year have proven to be fairly popular — and a good marketing mechanism, as well. Spotify’s Wrapped, for instance, has been so well-received that people began to complain that people’s Wrapped shares were dominating and overwhelming their social feeds at year-end. Spotify this year partially addressed this problemby offering new customization options for its 2020 Wrapped that let users adjust the color of their Wrapped card before sharing. This way, the flood of Wrapped shares wouldn’t look quite as homogenous as in prior years, and may be perceived as less of an annoyance. The “Year on TikTok” feature will likely do well, too, though it’s hard to track. The hashtag #YearOnTikTok is up to 5.4 billion views, thanks to users who are adopting the tag in hopes of propelling their videos to a wider audience or getting on the For You page. The real test will be how many creators end up with the 2020 badge stuck on their profile in the days to come. While TikTok’s feature is fun, if you find it somewhat lacking there are third-party alternatives. One app,Retroplay, launched its own 2020 TikTok Year in Review this month. The app does more than just round-up your own stats and metrics. Users can also vote for their favorite creators and videos through Retroplay’s “Superlatives” awards, collect cards from favorite creators and customize their own highlight reel. But the app is brand-new and struggling with bugs — the highlight reel is currently down while it’s being fixed, for instance, and the app couldn’t resolve a username that began with a period instead of a letter, we found.“We wanted to focus more on the year-in-review for content creators, and over the past two weeks have been working with creators to get their ideas. We’ve temporarily disabled the Highlight Reel feature based on feedback,” the developers responded in an email to TechCrunch. They said creators will be able to create their Top 4 or Top 9 video compilations through a new feature launching at the end of the week. RetroplayRetroplayThe app also had difficulties pulling data as TikTok didn’t offer an API and cut them off from accessing public-facing user videos and pulling stats. But the app’s design is catchy and the interactive features are engaging, so hopefully the developer can address the other issues soon — and before year-end!Spotify launches ‘2020 Wrapped’ with new features including quizzes, badges and, yes, stories",3,Reliable,0.2771757756132756,0.5218745490620491,1136,3,TechCrunch
124,"Dr. Lance Dodes warns we aren't rid of Trump yet: He ""will continue to have no conscience""",-20.0,33.67,https://www.salon.com/2021/01/14/dr-lance-dodes-warns-we-arent-rid-of-trump-yet-he-will-continue-to-have-no-conscience/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,25,"Last Wednesday, thousands of Donald Trump's white supremacist supporters, at his de facto command,launched an assault on the U. S. Capitolwith the goal of stopping Joe Biden from becoming the next president. While investigations are ongoing, some people in the mob mayhave planned to kidnap or assassinate members of Congress they consider ""traitors,""along with Vice President Mike Pence, who presided over the ceremonial count of the electoral votes. Trump's fascist mob was well equipped for the task, as some of their members were armed with guns and other weapons, and clad in paramilitary gear. Five people have now died during and after the Capitol attack. Dozens more were injured. This Trump-inspired uprising is likely not over and may be in its early stages. There are credible reports by the FBI and other American law enforcement agencies that right-wing paramilitaries and other domestic terrorists are planning even more violence across the country in the days leading to Biden's inauguration next week. This attack was not an isolated event: The entire Age of Trump has been typified by right-wing violence. When Trump finally leaves office, the right-wing violence he has enabled and permitted may only get worse. On Wednesday, by a vote of 232 to 197,Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for a second time, on this occasion for ""incitement of insurrection."" All 222 Democrats (along with 10 Republicans) voted to impeach, while four Republicans abstained. Trump is now the only president to have been impeached twice, and clearly rivals only Andrew Johnson or James Buchanan for the shameful distinction of being the worst president in American history. Instead of being cowed by the violence at the U. S. Capitol and his second impeachment, Trump, like other autocrats and fascists, appears even more desperate and emboldened. On Tuesday, during a visit to his ""border wall"" in Texas, Donald Trump warned the Democrats and the American people that there will be consequences — implying more violence by his followers — for his impeachment or removal. Trump then claimed the Democrats were causing the country ""tremendous anger, and division and pain,"" another example of stochastic terrorism aimed at inciting violence by his political cult members against their shared ""enemies"". Under pressure from Republican leaders and his remaining White House advisers, DonaldTrump released a video on Wednesday evening in which he ""condemned"" political violenceand claimed that his ""true supporters"" would never engage in such behavior. This is patently insincere: From the beginning of his 2016 campaign, Trump has encouraged political violence by his followers and other cult members. Moreover,during the assault on the CapitolTrump was reportedly gleeful and excited. Ultimately, the disaster that is Trump's presidency did not need to happen. It was all a choice. Those Americans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 (and in even larger numbers in 2020) are responsible. The Republican Party, which embraced Donald Trump and his vile anti-democracy movement, is responsible. A news media which normalized Trump's fascist and authoritarian white supremacist regime are responsible. Those who denied the obvious warnings about Trump's coup attempt — and who mocked or tried to silence the people who were trying to warn the public — are responsible. Writing at the Atlantic,Tom Nichols locates the disaster of Trump's presidency and America's national perilas a moment comparable to the Cuban missile crisis or the darkest moments of Nixon's presidency:We can't keep hoping for the best or relying on those not in charge to keep Trump in line. Even one day more is too long for him to be in the White House. We escaped disaster over just a few days in 1962 and in the dark of an autumn night in 1973. Peace was kept, in part, by the presence of steady professionals such as Schlesinger and the Kennedy team, the likes of whom are nowhere to be found in Trump's Washington. We no longer have a margin for error. A second impeachment is the only reliable solution, and it should take place immediately. The disaster that Nichols describes could have also been prevented if warnings from many leading mental health professionals had been listened to and then acted upon. Since at least 2015, they have sounded the alarm and tried to educate the public about Donald Trump's pathologies, his malignant narcissism and his psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies. Dr. Lance Dodes is one such voice. He is a retired assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a training and supervising analyst emeritus at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute. In our most recent ofseveral conversations, Dodes explains that Trump's coup attempt and other dangerous behavior are a function of the president's obvious mental pathologies, and observes that this disaster was totally and utterly predictable. Dodes warns that Trump believes that he is a godlike figure — and that when that delusion is shattered, Trump will become even more dangerous. At the end of this conversation Dr. Dodes implores the country's leaders to remove Donald Trump as rapidly as possible, noting that if this man were a private citizen he would already be in prison or a secure mental health facilityThis conversation has been edited for clarity and length. I completely agree. Most professionals in mental health have long understood that far from being a buffoon, or the naïve idea that he is ""crazy like a fox,"" he is severely mentally disturbed. Unfortunately, starting in 2016 the official psychological organizations in this country failed to speak out. The American Psychiatric Association actually threatened to throw out those of its members who understood the problem and had the courage to speak up, falsely claiming that speaking out would be unethical. Ironically, this meant that they threatened the most ethical and courageous members of the profession. If they had done their ethical duty to society it would have given the country a chance to save itself from the deaths and suffering of the past four years. Poorly, because many of them saw Trump is just a buffoon, or believed the psychologically ignorant idea that he is just being clever. As a result they didn't recognize they were dealing with a dangerous and delusional psychopath whose endless lies needed to be openly and vigorously challenged. Many in the media covered his every tweet as if it was true. He was yelling at White House journalists saying, ""You're fake"" from the beginning of his term and it was years before they objected. The reporters should have said, ""No, Mr. Trump, you cannot talk to the free press that way."" They should have covered his assault on the free press as a major story. The media failed to do their job to protect the country. At this very moment he would be in jail for having incited a riot. But the multiple other crimes he's committed over many years would have put him in jail years ago. If he were in any other position his complete incompetence dealing with the pandemic would have led him to be removed from any responsible position regarding the health or welfare of Americans. That's the most valuable part of making a diagnosis. When Trump was first elected, many hopeful people said, ""He's been horrible, but he'll grow into the job."" The impossibility of that was easy to predict because of his diagnosis. If a few people in my field hadn't incompetently denied his condition, and if the American Psychiatric Association hadn't tried to gag its members, the public could have been made clearly aware of his diagnosis and been in position to far better understand and deal with him and his behavior. This man is fundamentally different from virtually all the people that you've ever known. The pain and suffering of others mean nothing to him. It's hard to get that across because we all say, ""He must be like us,"" which is a normal expectation. He is nothing like us. We don't know exactly what's going to happen, but we know that he is going to continue to act on his delusional beliefs and he will continue to have no conscience about what he does to cause suffering to others. Four years ago, we said he was going to get worse. And we're still saying he can only get worse. The closer and closer he gets to being what he would consider a loser, the more dangerous he becomes. It was horrifying and terrifying to see the insurrectionists get into the Capitol building, partly because it was obvious that there was some plot going on; this wasn't just a mob on its own. There was a clear risk of a coup successfully led by Donald Trump. A few years ago, I said on MSNBC that among the risks Trump posed were that he would start a nuclear war, but that there were also other risks: that he would try to create an emergency, declare martial law and dissolve Congress. It's never been a secret that Trump wants to be like Putin or Hitler or Stalin or his friend in North Korea. He wants to be a supreme tyrant, and in his mind that's what he is. Anyone who threatens that delusion is his mortal enemy. If he could have taken over via a coup, he would have. Trump is a very simple person. He says outwardly, ""I am being persecuted"" and he says the same thing to himself. His beliefs are not affected by reality. It would be a sign of greater mental health if Trump were able to become depressed with a loss, because it would mean he has accepted the loss. But as we have repeatedly seen, he cannot tolerate that reality. When he loses power, rather than becoming depressed, he becomes more delusional. He attributes the problem to persecution by his enemies and mercilessly attacks them. That's what the coup attempt was. I'm proud that the American Psychoanalytic Association became the first and so far only major national psychological organization to say that Trump must go. I wish the statement had come out four years ago, but I'm glad they're the first to break away from the self-imposed paralysis of the major psychological organizations. And I hope the country will listen. In an ideal world Trump would be voted out today via the 25th Amendment. If he were not president, he would have already been in jail or contained in some safe facility.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0333101851851852,0.4660515873015872,2189,2,Salon
125,New Senate report lays out Trump's efforts to overturn the election in frightening detail,-12.67,35.67,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/10/7/2056678/-New-report-details-sore-loser-Trump-s-abuse-of-power-as-he-tried-to-reverse-his-big-loss,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-kos-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,24,"Donald Trump’s weeks of efforts to pressure the Department of Justice (DOJ) into helping him overturn his election loss are spelled out ina new interim report from the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of the details have already been reported, including Trump’s repeated calls to top Justice Department officials and the meeting at which hehad to be dissuadedfrom firing Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with a loyalist bent on throwing out the election results in a series of states. But the report also offers some newer details, and having the evidence assembled in a 394-page document is powerful.“This report shows the American people just how close we came to a constitutional crisis,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbinsaid in a statement. “Thanks to a number of upstanding Americans in the Department of Justice, Donald Trump was unable to bend the department to his will. But it was not due to a lack of effort.”Trump’s personal effort is highlighted in a succinct timeline of the weeks between William Barr’s resignation as attorney general and the January 6 attack on the U. S. Capitol:That’s kind of a lot. And, of course, these behind-the-scenes pressure efforts ran parallel to Trump’s very public—and more successful—efforts to convince his supporters that the election had been stolen from him. In additionto Trump’s actions, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was simultaneously pressuring Rosen to have the Justice Department investigate a series of false and discredited claims about election fraud, including “a theory known as ‘Italygate,’ which was promoted by an ally of the President’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and which held that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and an Italian IT contractor used military satellites to manipulate voting machines and change Trump votes to Biden votes.”At the same time, Jeffrey Bossert Clark, the acting assistant attorney general for the civil division, was pressuring Rosen and Donoghue tosend out memosurging key state legislatures to overturn the election results in their states. Clark attempted to use Trump’s threat to fire Rosen and replace him with Clark to get Rosen and Donoghue to go along with this plan. Other key findings include that Trump did, as widely suspected,force the sudden resignation of Byung Jin Pak, the U. S. attorney in Atlanta, and bypassed the line of succession for Pak’s job to give it to a Trump loyalist. And Rep. Scott Perry was actively involved in the effort: “Perry has acknowledged introducing Clark to Trump, and documents and testimony confirm that he directly communicated with Donoghue about his false Pennsylvania election fraud claims.”Barr’s resignation in December doesn’t get him off the hook, either: “Prior to the 2020 general election, DOJ’s longstanding policy and practice was to avoid taking overt steps in election fraud investigations until after votes were certified, in order to avoid inserting DOJ itself as an issue in the election. Then-Attorney General Barr weakened this decades-long policy shortly before and after the 2020 election, including in a November 9, 2020 memo that directed prosecutors not to wait until after certification to investigate allegations of voting irregularities that ‘could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.’ Consistent with this directive and following additional personal involvement by Barr, DOJ took overt steps to investigate false claims of election fraud before certification in one instance detailed to the Committee—and likely others.”Judiciary Committee Republicans released acompeting minority report, which repeatedly points out that Trumpfollow through on firing Rosen and Donoghue and “listened to his advisors.” Never mind that it took hours of arguing to convince him not to make good on the worst of his threats and that Trump’s advisers included the guy pushing the Italian military satellites theory of election theft. If what you have is that the former guy didn’t follow all the way through on the pressure he exerted and that he claimed he was concerned with “the U. S. electoral system writ large rather than concerns about his campaign or himself personally” (ha), then you don’t have much. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, speaksat a Trump rallyin Iowa this weekend. In case you were wondering where this Republican report on Trump’s election subversion efforts is coming from.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0446330184966548,0.4019657615112161,927,1,Daily Kos

127,God Was Faithful to These Chinese Families in the American South,-3.33,43.67,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/june-web-only/chinese-mississippi-documentary-far-east-deep-south.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-02,25,"People saw my Chinese face and heard my Texas drawl. And in their minds, it didn’t add up, even though my family had been in the United States for three generations. But I was proud of my Southern accent and my family’s story in America that it contained. I saw strong echoes of my family’s history in(available onPBS.org,WorldChannel.orgor the PBS app through June 3), a documentary that follows the Chius, a Chinese American family exploring their ancestors’ history in the Mississippi Delta. At the start of the film, Baldwin and Edwin Chiu have little knowledge of their Southern history and their grandfather’s relationship to the white and Black communities. They travel as adults to the Mississippi Delta with their father, Charles Chiu, after learning that their grandfather, K. C. Lou, was buried in a small town along the river. They connect with locals who share stories and pictures of K. C. and historians who help paint the broader context of their family’s story. Many of us have learned key details of family history as adults. Some older generations purposely hold onto secrets, not eager to relive shame, agony, or violence. Others don’t take intentional time to share. And yet, as my family, the Chois, and the Bible remind us, practicing vulnerability with our children and grandchildren is what enables us to tell the story of how God has worked through our lives and what enables our communities to heal. Sharing a family’s history often means educating about the larger historical context that your ancestors waded through. In the case of the Chius, their great-grandfather, Chas J. Lou, was born in the US in 1877, eight years after thousands of Chinese laborers finished the transcontinental railroad and five years before the Chinese Exclusion Act went into effect, which banned nearly all immigration from China. These political realities had very personal consequences. Because Chas was an American citizen and considered a merchant rather than a laborer, he was able to bring in his son, K. C., in 1919. But K. C. couldn’t bring his wife or their son, Charles, who were in China. (Charles ultimately did not arrive until 1952.) Not knowing his father’s story, Charles believed K. C. never cared about him. But in a poignant moment in the film, he learns his father once wrote to his friend, “I would give up 20 years of my life to have my kids with me.”(L-R) Baldwin Chiu, Charles Chiu and Edwin Chiu in Far East Deep South pay their respects to Charles’ father, KC Lou, and his grandfather, Chas J. Lou at the New Cleveland Cemetery in Cleveland, MS. While Americans are often surprised to find Chinese people in the South in the 19th century and early 20th century—the Chiu brothers themselves are astonished—many Chinese settled there after struggling to find work elsewhere. However, they quickly felt the scourge of Jim Crow laws. Southern states considered Chinese immigrants “colored” and subjected them to the same discriminatory practices that African Americans experienced. Rather than self-segregate, the Chinese, including K. C., opened grocery stores and businesses in Black communities. In the film, Baldwin and Edwin discover their grandfather was known for his generosity and beloved by the Black community. A former customer comments that the Chinese businessman never looked down on the Black community or made them feel like second-class citizens. Instead, K. C. extended lines of credit to his customers, some of them sharecroppers who were paid only when the crops were brought in annually. Unlike the Chius, I learned about my family’s Southern history from a young age, partially because I was born and raised in Houston. My grandfather, Jim Toy Lee, was also a grocery store owner in Mississippi, arriving in California about 100 years ago. My great-grandfather, Hoy Cal Jee, had emigrated from China to San Francisco in the early 1900s. In 1906, the infamous San Francisco earthquake caused fires that destroyed more than 500 buildings, as well as all immigation and birth records. The disaster presented an opportunity for immigrants to claim citizenship by declaring they had been born in San Francisco. Hoy Cal took advantage of this and received US citizenship. Though the majority of Chinese people had been banned from immigrating to the US for nearly 30 years, there was one exception: US citizens could naturalize their children born in China. Although immigration officials vetted these claims, many “paper sons” also slipped through, which is how my grandfather, Jim Toy, and my “uncle” Yett Gee became US citizens upon entry in 1920. Several years after arriving in the US, Jim Toy traveled back to China and returned with my grandmother, Bow Sim, and their son, Hugh. The family moved from San Francisco to Chicago, and finally to Ruleville, Mississippi, a small farming town established following the construction of the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. Jim Toy was able to work in a grocery store with his “paper brother,” Yett Gee. Like K. C., Jim Toy was classified as “colored” and had limited job and education opportunities. Frustrated that his son, Hugh, would be forced to attend a segregated school and worried he would receive an inferior education, Jim Toy moved his growing family to Houston around 1937. Most Chinese became merchants in Black neighborhoods, but Jim Toy purposely chose to open a grocery store in a white neighborhood so his kids could have more opportunities. Learning these stories as a child made me appreciate both the hard work of my family and the sacrifices one generation made for the next. But like Charles, Baldwin, and Edwin, as an adult, I am still discovering new things and asking more questions. (While writing this essay, I interviewed two of my aunts and another cousin who told me even more family stories.)As the documentary suggests, when our parents are slow to reveal or are secretive about the details of their lives, we can end up believing that these histories don’t matter or the past is in the past. But through its numerous genealogies; frequent invocations to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and rituals specifically commemorating a particular triumph, Scripture strongly suggests that God wants us to remember where we come from. As the Bible makes clear, these aren’t just interactions of people in years past—they’re a testament to God’s work and blessings in the world. At the beginning of the Book of Joshua, the successor to Moses has recently assumed leadership over the Israelites and leads the nation to cross the River Jordan after God miraculously stops the water from flowing. With the water held back, the Lord has Joshua direct 12 men to collect 12 stones in the river and build a monument:Crossing the River Jordan means that after centuries of enslavement and decades wandering in the desert, the Israelites are finally in the Promised Land. God has made good on his promise to them. This monument becomes a means of helping them retain and care for their spiritual heritage. In my parents’ stories, I’m grateful that they didn’t hide the hardships their family endured. Upon my grandparents and their children moving to Houston, they opened a grocery store in the Heights, a white, blue-collar neighborhood. Residents boycotted the Chinese-owned store until their World War II ration coupons compelled them to enter the establishment. My mother told me that for more than half a decade, their family was banned from owning a home in the neighborhood, forcing them to live in the back storeroom, eating dinner and doing homework on apple crates. After six years, a white customer helped the family buy a home by first purchasing it himself and immediately selling it to my grandparents. Little did he know that he was helping the family that would raise the first Asian American on the Houston City Council and first Asian American woman in the Texas House of Representatives—otherwise known as my mom. This past year has been a hard one for many Asian American communities. Each week seems to bring new stories of violence and assault, incidents that many of us will feel reluctant to remember and pass down to one another. And yet, our wounds and joy, our trauma and triumph all matter to God, as Psalm 107:2–3 underscores, “Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story—those he redeemed from the hand of the foe, those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.”“Sometimes we think about testimony as being something purely personal,”director Larissa Lam, who turned her husband Baldwin’s family story into the film, told CT. “However, if we take a step back, we may begin to recognize how God has been with one’s family for generations.“If you think about it, the Bible is made up of family stories,” she said. “If we don’t tell our family stories, then no one will learn about the trials and triumphs, stories of transgression to redemption in our families. God gave us all unique stories, and it’s up to us to tell it.”Kim Wong Chew is a California-based writer.[ This article is also available in简体中文and繁體中文. ]",3,Reliable,0.0749017468529664,0.322080796349089,1942,3,Christianity Today

Klobuchar’s bill would change that — but only when a social media platform’s algorithm promotes health misinformation related to an “existing public health emergency.” The legislation tasks the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to define health misinformation in these scenarios.“Features that are built into technology platforms have contributed to the spread of misinformation and disinformation,” reads a draft of the law seen by Recode, “with social media platforms incentivizing individuals to share content to get likes, comments, and other positive signals of engagement, which rewards engagement rather than accuracy.”Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. The law wouldn’t apply in cases where a platform shows people posts using a “neutral mechanism,” like a social media feed that ranks posts chronologically, rather than algorithmically. This would be a big change for the major internet platforms. Right now, almost all of the major social media platforms rely on algorithms to determine what content they show users in their feeds. And these ranking algorithms are generally designed to show users the content that they engage with the most — posts thatproduce an emotional response— which can prioritize inaccurate information. The new bill comes at a time when social media companies are under fire for the Covid-19 misinformation spreading on their platforms despite their efforts to fact-check or take down some of the most egregiously harmful health information. Last week, as Covid-19 cases began surging among unvaccinated Americans,President Biden accused Facebook of “killing people” with vaccine misinformation (a statement he later partially walked back). At the same time, major social media companies continue to facecriticismfromsome Republicans, who have opposed the Surgeon General’srecent health advisoryfocused on combating the threat of health misinformation. Conservatives, and especially Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), have also pushed back against the White House’s work flagging problematic health misinformation to social media platforms, calling the collaboration “scary stuff”and “censorship.”Even though tech giants are facing bipartisan criticism, Klobuchar’s plan to repeal Section 230 — even partially — will likely be challenging. Defining and identifying public health misinformation is often complicated, and having a government agency decide where to draw that boundary could run into challenges. At the same time, a court would also have to determine whether a platform’s algorithms were “neutral” and whether health misinformation was promoted — a question thatdoesn’t have a simple answer. Also, it may prove difficult for individual users to successfully sue Facebook, even if Section 230 is partially repealed, because it’s not illegal to post health misinformation (unlike, say, posting child pornography or defamatory statements). And free speech advocates have warned that repealing Section 230 — even in part — could limit free speech on the internet as we know it because it would pressure tech companies to more tightly control what users are allowed to post online. RelatedRegardless, the bill’s introduction reflects the political will on Capitol Hill among Democrats to force tech companies to more effectively combat misinformation on their platforms.“For far too long, online platforms have not done enough to protect the health of Americans,” said Sen. Klobuchar in a statement. “These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world, and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation.”Earlier this year, Sen. Klobuchar wrote a letter with Sen. Luján to the CEOs of Twitter and Facebook demanding they more aggressively take down misinformation on their platform,as Recode first reported. The letter cited research by a nonprofit, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which found that 12 anti-vaccine influencers — a “Disinformation Dozen” — were responsible for 65 percent of anti-vaccine content on Facebook and Twitter. In responses to those letters, which were seen by Recode, both platforms largely defended their approach to these influencers, noting that they’d taken some actions on their accounts. Across both platforms, many of the accounts are still up. While data revealing the extent to which misinformation on Facebook has exacerbated vaccine hesitancy is limited, longtime online advocates for vaccinestold Recodeearlier this year that Facebook’s approach to vaccine content has made their job harder, and that content in Facebook groups, in particular, has made some people more opposed to vaccines. It’s also not the first time that Congress has tried to repeal parts of Section 230. Most recently,Congress introduced the EARN IT Act, which would take away Section 230 immunity from tech companies if they don’t adequately address child pornography on their platforms. That bill, which had bipartisan support when introduced, is still in Congress. Earlier this year, Reps. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) and Anna Eshoo (D-CA) also reintroduced their proposal,the Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act, which would remove platforms’ Section 230 protections in cases where their algorithms amplified posts that involved international terrorism or interfered with civil rights. PresidentTrump also attempted to repeal Section 230through a legally unenforceable executive order, a few days after Twitter started fact-checking his misleading posts about voting by mail in the 2020 elections. Despite potential hurdles to their proposal, Sens. Klobuchar and Luján’s bill is a reminder that lawmakers concerned about misinformation are thinking more and more about the algorithms and ranking systems that drive engagement on this kind of content.“The social media giants know this: The algorithms encourage people to consume more and more misinformation,” Imran Ahmed, the CEO for the Center for Countering Digital Hate, told Recode in February. “Social media companies have not just encouraged growth of this market and tolerated it and nurtured it, they also have become the primary locus of misinformation.”At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

129,Blackstone Group to buy 66 apartment complexes in San Diego for more than $1 billion,0.0,50.33,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2021-05-11/blackstone-group-to-buy-66-apartment-complexes-in-san-diego-for-more-than-1-billion,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-11,20,"Private equity giant Blackstone Group plans to purchase 66 residential complexes in San Diego County for more than $1 billion in one of the biggest real estate transactions in local history. New York-based Blackstone is purchasing roughly 5,800 apartment units from the Conrad Prebys Foundation. It said it intends to spend $100 million to improve the new assets. The deal makes Blackstone one of the biggest real estate holders in San Diego County. It already owns $4.5 billion in assets here — including Legoland and the Hotel del Coronado. The transaction, which also includes Los Angeles-based investment firm TruAmerica as a partner, is expected to close in the next few weeks. The sale of the apartments was praised by Dan Yates, the president of the Conrad Prebys Foundation, who said the portfolio was assembled by Conrad Prebys — a San Diego developer — himself. Yates said the money from the deal will be used for grants primarily in San Diego.“Conrad Prebys was a sharp businessman who found true joy in the act of giving, and I believe he would be honored to see the result of his life’s work dedicated to continuing his philanthropic legacy,” Yates wrote in an email. The deal will bring Blackstone’s apartment total in San Diego County to 6,700 units, making it among the top three biggest landlords. San Diego R&V Management holds about 8,000 apartments and is the largest landlord.“Blackstone has long been a big believer in San Diego, with multiple investments across our real estate business,” wrote Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, in an email. “We look forward to ensuring that these properties continue to provide the community with a high-quality rental option at a good value.”San Diego real estate analyst Gary London said the$230 millionsale of the downtown Manchester Pacific Gateway in September to a biotech office developer was the biggest recent deal he could recall.“To my knowledge, this is the largest real estate transaction in San Diego County history,” he said. Even when adjusted for inflation, past deals seem to pale in comparison. For instance, the 25,000-acre Otay Ranch — now the center of homebuilding in San Diego County and nearly the size of San Francisco — sold for $150 million in 1988. All the apartments are market-rate but Blackstone says it plans to partner with nonprofit Pacific Housing to provide services for residents, including after-school tutoring, financial literacy classes, and health and wellness initiatives at no cost. It did not address it directly, but the move seems to counteract earlier concernwith the foundation’s sale of these holdings. KPBS was first to report that the foundation waslooking to sell its portfolioin February. A letter was sent to the foundation in early February from San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, San Diego County Supervisors chair Nathan Fletcher and California Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins to urge them to take into account future affordability of the apartments when considering a sale.“A substantial number of these units are home to working individuals and families,” they wrote, “and are some of the limited inventory in the region of non-deed restricted, naturally occurring affordable housing options for San Diegans.”Blackstone said it plans to keep the majority of units affordable for residents who make 80 percent or less of the area median income during its ownership. “Blackstone is eager to engage with the State of California and San Diego municipal government to explore opportunities to support and/or add affordable housing in San Diego,” it said. Blackstone’s purchase comes as California is set to end its statewide eviction ban on June 30, which has prevented landlords from evicting tenants who could not pay rent due to loss of income related to COVID-19. Blackstone said it has not evicted anyone for non-payment since the start of the pandemic across its national portfolio. Blackstone already employs about 5,500 people in San Diego County. It estimates the new multifamily purchase from Conrad Prebys will create 500 jobs. It said some of its refurbishment of apartments will include addressing deferred maintenance and adding gyms, greenspace and playgrounds. Rent growth was slow during much of the pandemic but San Diego County has seen a resurgence in recent months. Average rent had increased5 percent in a yearas of this week, said real estate tracker CoStar, to $1,940 a month. Analysts have pointed to an improving economy and low vacancy rates for continued growth. Real estate website Zumper said in itsApril rent price reportthat San Diego was one of the few major markets in the nation with rent increases. It said annual rent growth was down in San Francisco, New York, Washington, D. C., Los Angeles, San Jose, Boston, Oakland and many other formerly hot rental markets. The Conrad Prebys Foundation gavemore than $71 million to 112 organizations across San Diego County in March to bolster the arts, health care, medical research, animal conservation, education, and the welfare of young people. The biggest grant — $15 million — went to the San Diego Symphony.",3,Reliable,0.0742508811771107,0.3381955385234075,1084,3,San Diego Union-Tribune

That was on top of the cyberattacks on critical industries by Russian criminals. So how did Biden respond to Putin during his meeting? Well, we don’t know the substance of the private discussion yet, but we do know what happened when they sat together for the press and were asked some questions. Biden’s team had previously said that he wouldn’t be holding a joint press conference with Putin, but this sit-down together gave him something of the same arrangement anyway. We alsoreported earlierabout Biden relying heavily on note cards, including some which appeared to have prepared answers. Here again, you can see him reaching for those cards in what’s just supposed to be a brief photo-op/few comments moment with the press prior to the meeting.

131,Some Hospitals Kept Suing Patients Over Medical Debt Through the Pandemic,0.0,53.33,https://www.propublica.org/article/some-hospitals-kept-suing-patients-over-medical-debt-through-the-pandemic,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-14,24,"Last year as COVID-19 laid siege to the nation, many U. S. hospitals dramatically reduced their aggressive tactics to collect medical debt. Some ceased entirely. But not all. There was a nearly 90% drop overall in legal actions between 2019 and the first seven months of 2020 by the nation’s largest hospitals and health systems, according to a new report by Johns Hopkins University. Still, researchers told ProPublica that they identified at least 16 institutions that pursued lawsuits, wage garnishments and liens against their patients in the first seven months of 2020. The Johns Hopkins findings, released Monday in partnership with Axios, whichfirstreported theresults, are part of an ongoing series of state and national reports that look at debt collections by U. S. hospitals and health systems from 2018 to 2020. During those years more than a quarter of the nation’s largest hospitals and health systems pursued nearly 39,000 legal actions seeking more than $72 million, according to data Johns Hopkins researchers obtained through state and county court records. More than 65% of the institutions identified were nonprofit corporations, which means that in return for tax-exempt status they are supposed to serve the public rather than private interest. The amount of medical debt individuals owe is often a small sliver of a hospital’s overall revenue — as little as 0.03% of annual receipts — but can “cause devastating financial burdens to working families,” the report said. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has estimated medical debt makes up 58% of all debt collection actions. The poor or uninsured often bear the brunt of such actions, said Christi Walsh, clinical director of health care and research policy at Johns Hopkins University. “In times of crisis you start to see the huge disparities,” she said. Researchers said they could not determine all of the amounts sought by the 16 institutions taking legal action in the first half of 2020, but of those they could, Froedtert Health, a Wisconsin health system, sought the most money from patients — more than $3 million. Even after Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers declared a public health emergency on March 12, 2020, hospitals within the Froedtert Health system filed more than 100 cases from mid-March through July, researchers reported, and 96 of the actions were liens. One lien was against Tyler Boll-Flaig, a 21-year-old uninsured pizza delivery driver from Twin Lakes, Wisconsin, who was severely injured June 3, 2020, when a speeding drag racer smashed into his car. Boll-Flaig’s jaw was shattered, and he had four vertebrae crushed and several ribs broken. His 14-year-old brother, Dominic Flaig, tagging along that night, was killed. Days after the crash, their mother, Brandy Flaig, said she got a call from a hospital billing office asking for her surviving son’s contact information to set up a payment plan for his medical bills. Then on July 30 — less than two months later — Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee filed a $67,225 lien against Boll-Flaig. It was one of seven liens the hospital filed the same day, totaling nearly a quarter of a million dollars, according to the Wisconsin Circuit Court Access website used by researchers and reviewed by ProPublica.“It’s during the pandemic, we’re still grieving, and they go after Tyler?” Flaig said. “It’s predatory.” Tyler Boll-Flaig declined to be interviewed. Froedtert Hospital is the largest in the Froedtert Health system, which includes five full-service hospitals, two community hospitals and more than 40 clinics. The health care system reported more than $53 million in operating income during the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2020 — double the amount from the previous year, according to its financial filings. It has also received $90 million in federal CARES Act money to help with its COVID-19 response and operating costs, a spokesperson said. Only Reedsburg Area Medical Center, a nonprofit hospital in Reedsburg, Wisconsin, pursued more legal actions in the spring and summer of 2020, with 139 lawsuits and 22 wage garnishments, the study showed. Medical center officials did not respond to a request for comment. In contrast, Advocate Aurora Health, the top-suing health network in the state before the pandemic, dropped to zero court filings after February 2020, the report found. Stephen Schoof, a Froedtert Health spokesperson, said in an email he could not comment on the Boll-Flaig case because of patient privacy laws. He also said the health system was unable to comment on the Johns Hopkins study because it had not yet reviewed all the findings. But Schoof disputed the numbers he was sent by ProPublica, calling them “inaccurate and misleading.”Schoof objected to how researchers defined and counted legal actions. He said that Froedtert Hospital ceased filing small claims lawsuits in March 2020 but continued to pursue liens on patients involved in accidents that might result in settlements.“The lien process does not impact a patient’s personal property and is intended to recoup expenses from settlement proceeds from the negligent party’s insurance company,” he said. That is what happened in the Boll-Flaig case. Jason Abraham, Boll-Flaig’s lawyer, told ProPublica the lien is in the process of being settled with the hospital. He said the sum will be covered by the at-fault driver’s car insurance and workers' compensation insurance since Boll-Flaig was on the job when the accident occurred. Liens allow hospitals to get paid quickly and by state law must be filed within 60 days of hospital discharge. Because he was hospitalized during the pandemic, Boll-Flaig was released after about 24 hours, his mother said. Abraham said the hospital was “trying to get to the front of the line because they think there is a pool of money available.”Wisconsin Watch, a nonprofit news site,reported late last yearthat Froedtert Hospital filed 362 liens through Dec. 11, including 251 after May. That was more than the 300 liens it filed in all of 2019, the news investigation showed. In New York, the Johns Hopkins researchers found 51 hospitals filed legal action against more than 1,800 patients between January 2018 and mid-December 2020. More than half came from just one health system: Northwell Health, a nonprofit that is the largest in the state, operating 19 hospitals with affiliations at four more across the state. The most litigious in the Northwell system during that time was Long Island Jewish Medical Center, which filed a total of 2,011 court actions, with more than a quarter of those pursued last year, the research showed.“During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, most hospitals substantially reduced or even ceased all medical debt lawsuits. However, as the pandemic’s first wave subsided, many New York hospitals resumed business as usual,” the study says. Although he had not seen the Johns Hopkins report, Rich Miller, executive vice president of Northwell Health, said he was skeptical of its findings, in part because the health system stopped all legal action against patients from April through September of last year. Northwell resumed filing cases for about two months in the fall of 2020, but has since stopped. Any case filed during the brief resumption has now been rescinded, he said. Miller said his health system does not take legal action against Medicaid patients, those over 65, the unemployed, people with disabilities or military members. Patients are pursued legally only if they have ignored attempts to work out payment plans or if they have “a strong ability to pay,” he said. All hospitals have specific guidelines and steps they must follow before taking any “last resort” collection actions, said Marie Johnson, vice president of media relations for the American Hospital Association. Health care systems must balance the need to be adequately financed with “treating all people equitably, with dignity, respect and compassion,” Johnson said. Read MoreStill, the problem highlights the murkiness of the U. S. healthcare system, said Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor specializing in health law. “Sometimes we treat it like a commodity, sometimes we treat it like a right,” he said. “In the eyes of the law, these are just personal debts.”But he questioned the wisdom of equating unpaid medical bills, often incurred during emergencies or crisis, with an overdue credit card: “Is this really how we want to process payment disputes?”Have You Been Sued by a Hospital, Doctor or Other Medical Institution? Tell Us About It. We want to hear from people across the country who have been sued or arrested after unpaid medical bills. This story originally misstated the time frame of the decline in legal actions that hospitals and health systems took to collect medical debt and, in a subheading, the degree of that drop. Actions declined by nearly 90%, not 92%, and the decline occurred in the first seven months of 2020, compared to 2019, not in the whole of 2020.

We need an equivalent program today. American author Richard Wright was hired to work for the Federal Writers’ Project. (Mondadori via Getty Images)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Review of Scott Borchert,(Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021)When Alfred Kazin arrived at the Manhattan office of the Federal Writers’ Project (FWP) to interview for a job as an editor, the writers were on strike. The room was “crowded with men and women lying face down on the floor, screaming that they were on strike,” he writes in his memoir of the 1930s. “In order to get to the supervisor’s office at the other end of the hall, I had to make my way over bodies stacked as if after a battle; and as I sat in the supervisor’s office, he calmly discussed the job while shouts and screams came from the long hall outside.”Kazin didn’t get the job. While he downplays his desire for the position in his memoir, FWP archives include a record of his follow-up about the position. For a precariously employed freelancer and the son of working-class Jewish immigrants, the FWP was a coveted placement, offering job security and a community, strikes and all. Such security was the hallmark of the project, a part of FDR’s Works Project Administration (WPA). The WPA launched in 1935, a year that saw 20 percent unemployment, and at its height, it employed 3.3 million people across the United States. The FWP was a minuscule piece of that program, its budget costing 0.002 percent of the WPA outlay, but for its modest size, it had significant achievements. Just as others were put to work building bridges and sewers under the WPA banner, so, too, were creative workers set to the collective task of crafting texts. The books in question were guides to the country — one for each of the then-forty-eight states, along with many cities, regions, and territories, as well as some ten thousand oral histories, includinginvaluable recordsof formerly enslaved people. The guides were not straightforward. A traveler seeking relevant hotel or culinary information might find them, at best, meandering and, at worst, useless. Instead, they were literary achievements, records of a period and a people, a hodgepodge reflecting the bizarreness and ambition of the FWP itself. As Scott Borchert describes the guides inRepublic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America, a new history of the FWP, they “sprawled. They hoarded and gossiped and sat you down for a lecture. They seemed to address multiple readers at once from multiple perspectives. They ran to hundreds of pages. They contained a melange of essays, historical tidbits, folklore, anecdotes, photographs, and social analysis — along with an abundance of driving directions thickened by tall tales, strange sites, and bygone characters.”One reason was their authorship. At one point, the project employed nearly seven thousand people. While the production process differed state by state, the guides were a collective endeavor, one that deployed hundreds of writers to streets across the country to collect stories, to decide what readers did and did not need to know about the United States. Hence, as Borchert writes, the tours “highlighted scenic overlooks and recreation spots, but they were also dense with Indian massacres, labor strikes, witches, gunfighters, Continental Army spies, Confederate deserters, shipwrecks, slave rebellions, famous swindlers, and forgotten poets.”It wasn’t necessarily what one might think of as “professional writers” penning these texts either, though, definitionally, the FWP took those excluded from such a category and made them writers by trade. Anzia Yezierska, a writer and member of the New York office, characterized her coworkers as “spinster poetesses, pulp specialists, youngsters with school-magazine experience, veteran newspaper men, art-for-art’s-sake literati, and the clerks and typists,” a mishmash milieu that generated a “strange fellowship of necessity.”The ethos was shaped by Henry Alsberg, the FWP’s director. Alsberg, a pinko friend to Emma Goldman, gay man, and hanger-on of the Greenwich Village bohemian-radical scene, approached his task with the belief that anyone who could write was a writer. The standard that mattered for him was that 90 percent of the writers would come from the relief rolls; 10 percent was set aside for skilled writers and editors who could provide technical expertise. The result — not only the finished product, but every step of the process — was chaotic. In New York, a mail carrier applies because he is “a man of letters.” A story circulates about how, when a toilet overflowed in the office of one of the state projects, all four editors sprang up to fix it because they were all plumbers by trade. One state’s director, a pulp fiction writer, simply tells his workers to make things up. Another such director is checked in on by someone from the national office. “She led him to a room of workers pounding away at typewriters and said, ‘Have you ever seen such an inspiring sight? Seventeen poets, all in one room, writing poetry seven hours a day.’” The FWP’s associate director, George Cronyn, receives a progress report with the subject line “What I have been doing thru the week.” Its conclusion? “Friday — in bed all day, not working, but certainly thinking of God and the Writers’ Project.”But amid, or perhaps because of, such eccentricity, the project achieved breakthroughs. It’s not for nothing that, upon the FWP’s dissolution in 1943,magazine called it “the biggest literary project in history.” Kazin, despite being turned down for the job in the New York office, singled the American Guides out for praise. Writing inOn Native Grounds, his book on American literature, Kazin argued that “More than any other literary form in the thirties, the WPA writers’ project, by illustrating how much so many collective skills could do to uncover the collective history of the country, set the tone for the period.”The guides give the reader a sense of a country “full of secret rooms,” creepy, but redeemed by an “odd, ludicrous sense of humor,” wrote Robert Cantwell in a 1939 review for the New Republic. It is doubtful if there has ever been assembled anywhere such a portrait, so laboriously and carefully documented, of such a fanciful, impulsive, childlike, absent-minded, capricious and ingenious people, or of a land in which so many prominent citizens built big houses (usually called somebody’s folly) that promptly fell into ruins when the owner backed inventions that didn’t work. But more than the merit of the guides themselves, there was the achievement of keeping a roof over the heads of the thousands who relied on the program for employment. Further, the work subsidized creativity, keeping people who would go on to be the era’s most celebrated writers from quitting their craft. Richard Wright was given flexibility on the job, and he used it to begin draftingNative Son. He struck up a friendship with Ralph Ellison, who worked in the New York office, encouraging him to write. The project’s national coordinating director might have called the New York City project “ a vast psychodrama” — and the anecdote in Kazin’s memoir certainly suggests it was far from a typical workplace — but it was also a hotbed of creativity, and the project that, along with Chicago, employed many of the FWP’s few black writers (the guides in Southern states sometimes shied away from regional history for fear of provoking racist backlash, leaving Zora Neale Hurston, who was attached to the Florida office, more isolated than she already was in the rural parts of the state from whence she sent her dispatches). Nelson Algren, fresh from an arrest for stealing a typewriter — his defense was that the object was his only means of earning a living, an argument that got him a suspended sentence — was hired onto the Illinois project in 1936. He joined the local John Reed club along with the state project’s shop committee, striking up a friendship with Wright. He met Studs Terkel, who worked on the federal project’s radio division; he ignored Saul Bellow, who was also in the FWP. A year into working on the FWP, Algren writes a piece advertising the project:Men who may otherwise have become too demoralized by poverty to do creative work, or would be frying hamburgers or turning out ad copy or running a roulette wheel, are now assisting both themselves and the nation’s cultural life through the federal writers’ project . . . such names are supplemented by dozens of young unknowns with genuine creative impulses who no longer have to sell Realsilk hose or Herald and Examiner life insurance from door to door to meet their rent. He is writing about himself. It isn’t easy to imagine a twenty-first-century FWP. Rather than direct job provision for cultural workers, today’s dominant model is the provision of funds to institutions like the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), created in 1965, which grants money to artists. Rather than offering stability, this approach perpetuates the precarity to which creative workers are already subject: a scramble, the pressure to come up with a fully formed project in advance of application. Congressman Ted Lieu has introduced a bill in the House to create a contemporary FWP, which would focus on stories of the COVID-19 pandemic, employing writers to create an archive of work from the present. The idea camefromDavid Kipen, former director of literature at the NEA. While it would be better than nothing, the project would entail having the Department of Labor administer money to nonprofits, libraries, news outlets, and communications unions, suggesting the precarity and scramble may yet remain. We can never repeat the past — and, given the shortcomings of the FWP, we shouldn’t seek to — but in imagining possible contemporary endeavors, it’s worth recalling how hard it was to imagine the project back then, too. When journalist Dorothy Thompson first heard about the FWP, she exclaimed, “Project? For writers? Absurd!” And yet it was built and defended, with the still-unpopular argument that writers are in fact people, and they need to eat, too. As one can imagine happening with today’s culture-war-obsessed GOP, the FWP was undermined by red-baiting. Congressman Martin Dies Jr hounded Alsberg and his staff with subpoenas. Investigators were caught planting and then photographing communist literature in the New York office (as if communists don’t deserve a paycheck!). But despite all this, by the time it shut down in 1943, the project had created dozens upon dozens of guides, employing thousands of out-of-work people at a time of upheaval. As is true of many of the other achievements of the FDR administration, the FWP was in part a response to union demands. Writers were struggling, and the Newspaper Guild and the Authors Guild wanted jobs, while the Unemployed Writers Association, with the backing of the likes of Theodore Dreiser and Ida Tarbell, worked to represent those still coming up. Borchert writes of a 1934 strike at the Macauley Company, a Manhattan book publisher. It received wide support from both writers and workers in other publishing houses. He characterizes such solidarity as “a sign of the simmering discontent and growing class-consciousness spreading throughout the industry.”It’s a scene that bears a striking resemblance to the world today, and the writing world’s unions — the News Guild, the Writers’ Guild of America, and theFreelance Solidarity Project, an organization of freelancers agitating to raise standards both at individual publications and across the industry. When writers’ employment was decimated by forces beyond their control in the 1930s, they called for work relief; what about now?“In late February of 1935,” writes Borchert, “the Writers Union launched picket lines across New York. TheDaily Mirrorreported that, in the absence of government intervention, the only work available was writing more protest signs.” The joke lands just as well today. The strength of the FWP was that it was a job like any other: a paycheck for people who needed it. There’s no reason we can’t imagine what that would look like now. Alex N.

134,4 key takeaways from Oregon’s election,-1.0,46.33,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/11/4-key-takeaways-from-oregons-election.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"A record2.3 million-plusOregon voters had their say in this fall’s general election, deciding races from local ballot measures and city councils tothe U. S. Senate. Here are some of the takeaways from Oregon voters' decisions. Unlike nationally, few Oregon races are undecided after election night. Oregon’s well-oiled vote-by-mail system delivered decisive results in the vast majority of contests Tuesday night. Oregon’ssix contested seats in Congress, its three races for statewide state office, nearly all legislative races and key money measures: all were decided shortly after the balloting deadline, thanks to swift action by voters and election officials. The few key races still pending -- two key Oregon Senate races that will help decide the balance of power in the Legislature, a tight race for Gresham mayor, a relatively minor ballot measure about Portland Water Bureau billing rights -- are worth watching, but don’t remotely approach the national breath-holding over the presidential race. Oregon Democrats' grip on state office is strong. Oregon has tilted blue for some time. But this year’s election results reinforced the state’s Democratic voters' dominance. The statewide votes for former Vice President Joe Biden to become president and incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley to serve another term were overwhelming, as were the votes to install the three Democratic candidates for statewide office -- incumbents Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Treasurer Tobias Read and newcomer Shemia Fagan as secretary of state. Oregonians want people to be free to use drugs. Two ballot measures, one to one to decriminalize possession of most street drugs and the other toallow supervised use of psilocybin, passed overwhelmingly Tuesday. Both are nationally notable, as they mark the first time any state has permitted the non-prosecuted possession or use of substances. To be fair, backers of the measure to decriminalize drugs, many of whom are former addicts with long records of hard-won sobriety, said they want people caught with small amounts of heroin, meth and other drugs to get assessed and treated to end their addiction, not to keep using. But it would not be a crime for them to do so. Multnomah County voters are soft on taxes for causes including parks, libraries, schoolsA global pandemic that has struck Oregon hard in recent this year and torpedoed the U. S. employment market hasn’t stopped Multnomah County voters from endorsing taxes increases or keeping property taxes at current levels to aid kids, library users, parks-goers and the like.

Obama would be their perfect candidate in 2020, of course, but he can’t run again because of that pesky 22nd Amendment. They’re crazy about AOC, but she’s not old enough yet. (It’s always that damn Constitution thwarting their goals!) And none of the approximately 450 Democrats running next year have been very exciting. A lot of Dem voters really like Bernie, but he’s too cranky and mean. They’d vote for Biden, sure, but they’re not about to throw their panties on the stage for him. They really want to be swept off their feet. They want to devote themselves. They want to fall in love. So apparently they’ve settled on… Beto? Callum Patton, Newsweek: A giant earth artwork depicting 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke has appeared north of Austin, Texas. The two acre design dubbed “Beto Earthwork” was created by Kansas artist Stan Herd, and is formed mostly from gravel, sand and rock… “We’re trying to tell the story of this amazing man from Texas making a difference in the national climate,” the artist explained. “This amazing man.” Yeah, I don’t see anybody building shrines to Kamala or Elizabeth or Amy or Kirsten. It really reminds you just how sexist this country really is, doesn’t it? Take a look at it, courtesy of the artist himself: The last time we heard about painted rocks in Texas, it was because we were supposed to care about the old name of a hunting camp owned by Rick Perry’s family. If Perry had been running for president as a Democrat, the press would’ve dismissed that story quicker than Beto’s DWI. Beto seems like a really weird guy to me. But then, so did Obama. And just as with Obama, all of Beto’s odd behavior and disconcerting foibles will just become part of the myth. The press insisted it was no big deal that Beto livestreamed a trip to the dentist, and they’re already racking their brains to excuse his habit of jumping up on restaurant countertops with his filthy feet. They’re projecting all their hopes and dreams onto him, and they’re not going to let reality spoil the party. I can’t wait until Beto and Kamala go head-to-head. Are white males the source of all our problems, or aren’t they? The cognitive dissonance is gonna be great! P. S. I also don’t like it when Republicans worship Trump, or any other politician. Even Mount Rushmore is kind of creepy, when you think about it. So if and when they start building graven monuments to Trump, I won’t like that either. Okay?

Here are the 11 dumbest, most slanted questions asked by Wallace.“This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?” Wallace asked. Wallace’s framing of the issue here was factually false and designed to make Trump look racist. Not only did he misconstrue theobjectively racistidea of critical race theory as “racial sensitivity training,” but he then followed up Trump’s answer on the issue with another trick question, “What is radical about racial sensitivity training?”It is not true that Trump banned diversitytraining from federal agencies, only trainings that teach racist, anti-American ideas such as “critical race theory” or “white privilege.”Sohrab Ahmari was one of many Fox debate watchers who was appalled by the question,tweeting an excerpt of a storythat showed that theactivities that were banned were blatantly racist, such as:The trainers then ask “white managers” to create “safe spaces,” where black employees can explain “what it means to be black” and to be “seen in their pain.” White staffers are instructed to keep silent and to “sit in the discomfort” of their racism. If any conflicts arise, the trainers ­insist that whites “don’t get to decide when someone is being too emotional, too rash [or] too mean.” Whites are told they can’t protest if a person of color “responds to their oppression in a way [they] don’t like.”Trump effectively answered the question, by pointing out that critical race theory teaches hatred of America and that this is unacceptable, but Wallace appeared to only know how the New York Times characterizes the racist belief system.“You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland?” Wallace asked. This was Wallace’s most disgusting question. While Antifa, which has organizations throughout the country, has set fire to cities across the country, there is no evidence whatsoever that violence in Kenosha was caused by white supremacists. President Trump has repeatedly condemned white supremacists. What a ridiculous question from Chris Wallace.#Debates2020pic.twitter.com/kuTsHBcKKf— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)September 30, 2020Wallace also refused to accept Trump’s answer of “sure” and “I’m willing to do anything…I want to see peace,” instead, choosing to press him on “specifically” condemning white supremacy.“Well do it, sir,” Wallace said, joined by Biden.“Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem this is a left-wing,” Trump replied. That debate was garbage but this is the actual transcript of the white supremacy exchange. Trump didn't ""refuse"" to denounce white supremacy, as much of the media is now saying. Look at his first reply. Sure, take issue with how he handled the q, but don't misinform people.pic.twitter.com/TIg2WSxKVj— Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky)September 30, 2020“Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?” Wallace asked, minutes after Trump explained his COVID-19 vaccine plan. Wallace felt the need to ask why a presidential candidate was campaigning on-the-ground and then insinuated that maybe he shouldn’t be campaigning because of COVID-19. This matches the Democrat Party talking point about COVID-19 requiring the banning of children from schools, the closure of businesses, and the denial of conservative First Amendment activities such as church and political gathering. But as demonstrated by the widespread media support for mass gatherings and riots in support of the BLM agenda, this is not a genuine concern but one deployed for partisan political gain.“I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case, decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, ‘Whether justice could be equally applied in America.’ Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country?”Moderators can ask a question neutrally, they can ask a question adopting the framing of the left, or they can ask a question adopting the framing of the right. In every single case, Wallace adopted the framing of the left. Here, that framing resulted in a softball question that Biden had no difficulty responding to and quickly moving past, even if his answer that he believed America was a systematically racist country should have earned a follow-up. “What is your responsibility for this inherently racist country, given your 47 years in public life?” Wallace might have asked. But he did not. He also could have asked about the Biden’s running mateKamala Harrisaccusing him of racism during the primary.“Mr. President, you said, ‘I don’t think the science knows.’ Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?”Wallace clarified his leading question by asking if Trump really believed in climate change, why would he have made the policy changes he did.“But, sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…?” Wallace continued. Chris Horner replied:At no point did Wallace consider the possibility that policy makers could protect the environment without murdering jobs. He did not seem aware of the possibility that large regulatory frameworks ostensibly about environmental protection are actually about building up the unaccountable administrative state. Separately, he didn’t ask Biden any similar questions about science acceptance such as why, if he believes in science, he supports legalized ending of human lives via abortion and forcing taxpayers to fund the practice against their conscience. And as Andy McCarthy points out, it was not Wallace who pressed Biden on his support of the Green New Deal, but Trump. Biden doesn’t support the Green New Deal. Oh, Wallace got that out of him?No, Trump did. Oh, well, did Wallace clarify what’s parts of Green New Deal Biden is against?No, needed to move on …— Andy McCarthy (@AndrewCMcCarthy)September 30, 2020When the question came around to Biden, he had forgotten what the topic was, saying “I can’t remember which of all his rantings …” Wallace laughed, said, “I’m having a little trouble myself,” and they had a moment of shared hatred of Trump. Wallace then helped him along repeatedly, prodding him to talk about the economy and the environment. Minutes earlier, Biden had denied that he supported the Green New Deal. But then he said, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward.” Wallace asked him if he did, in fact, support the Green New Deal. He once again returned to claiming he didn’t. “No, I don’t support the Green New Deal.” His web site, however, supports the radical Green New Deal policy co-sponsored by his running mate Kamala Harris, and lists it as a“crucial framework” for addressing climate change” on his campaign website.“Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?”“As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five-plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election?”Wallace continued his not-so-subtle suggestion that Trump might not accept the election results by throwing in this question about the legitimacy of this election. What Wallace failed to mention was that many Hillary Clinton voters in 2016 claimed they did not accept the legitimate results of the election. Even recently, Hillary Clinton has claimed that the election was “stolen” from her.“You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it’s rigged, that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?”It is unclear what Wallace was attempting to get at in asking this question. The media have repeatedly conflated absentee ballots, military ballots, and established state-based mail-in-balloting with a rush to implement universal mail-in balloting. That rush has already led to problems. By asking this question, Wallace seemed to reject the idea that voter fraud might actually make this election susceptible to questions of the legitimacy he referred to in his previous questions. Wallace reiterated this idea by clarifying that mail-in voting fraud is not the problem.“The biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?”Wallace asked this question after Trump had already given an answer for how much he paid in federal income taxes those years. This general question is a great example of how Wallace takes his direction from the New York Times, even though the New York Times has not published its evidence in support of its claim about how much Trump paid in taxes, and even though Trump’s attorneys have said on the record that Trump paid millions in those years. While Wallace thought this was a fitting question, he never asked Joe Biden about his son and brother profiting from foreign governments while he was vice president, even though the information about said profiteering came from official Treasury Department reports that were obtained by Senate investigators. When Trump attempted to bring up Hunter Biden’s relations with Russia, pointing out that Hunter “made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places” after Biden became vice president, Wallace wrote him off claiming that “the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects.”“We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. As the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here,” Wallace said, changing the segment to focus on climate change. Wallace also refused to ask Joe Biden any questions about his involvement in the Russia collusion hoax, an elaborate scheme to tie Donald Trump to nefarious activities by Russia. Despite promises to circle back to discuss the topic of abortion that came up during the segment about Trump’s Supreme Court nomination Amy Coney Barrett, Wallace never brought it up again, even when he decided to ask science questions.“Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade,” Wallace said. That unpacking, though, did not require any extra effort on Wallace’s part when he failed to push Biden after he refused to comment on Court-packing. In the end, it was Trump who continued to press Biden while Wallace moved on.",1,Questionable,0.0501033981667784,0.3959297451374914,2756,1,The Federalist
138,Northern composure: Can Canada stave off the West’s populist anger?,-2.75,46.25,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2019/0405/Northern-composure-Can-Canada-stave-off-the-West-s-populist-anger,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-05,25,"Accusations of fraud and corporate favors, secret tapes, and political rivals expunged: For two months, the nation has been gripped by a scandal at the highest tiers of government. This week, after two prominent members were expelled from the ruling political party, one newspaper dubbed it the “Tuesday night massacre,” a reference harking back to the Watergate scandal. No, this is not the United States, nor does it have anything to do with the Mueller investigation. This is Canada, under the leadership of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose “sunny ways” have been symbolizing all that is right about Canada – and all that seems to be going so very wrong in the rest of the world. Now Mr. Trudeau’s office faces allegations that it pressured former Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to drop bribery and fraud charges against a Quebec engineering firm over its dealings in Libya. The scandal, which broke in February, has always been about far more than the charges at hand. While right-wing and anti-globalist populism plagues the West, it remains rarer in Canada. Canadian politics have taken a different path thanks to geography, to wars past, and to political decisions made centuries ago. It started after a newspaper alleged that Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the first indigenous woman to hold that office, was reassigned for refusing to bend to the will of those at the top who wanted to shield the company, SNC-Lavalin, from prosecution. It has since turned into a he-said, she-said. And the optics couldn’t be worse for Mr. Trudeau, a self-defined feminist leader, and his narrative of a new way of governance: It looks like white male power punishing the new player for not doing politics as usual.“Sunny ways” have definitely clouded over. In a recent poll by Ipsos, Mr. Trudeau’s approval rating fell to 40%, lower than President Donald Trump’s 43% approval rating. Yet for Canadians, this is more than a story of the political fate of Mr. Trudeau or his Liberal party. It sits at the heart of how Canadians view themselves, and how the world views Canada – long touted as an exception in the era of the right-wing populist. An opinion piece this week in The Globe and Mail, which broke the original story, worried whether Mr. Trudeau has “channeled Trump.” It hints at the question many Canadians are asking themselves: Have we become what they are?History suggests the answer is no. Canadian politics have taken a different path than in the United States and many Western democracies, where anti-immigrant and anti-globalization sentiment has grown – and it’s not just because of Mr. Trudeau. There’s a much longer history that owes to geography, to wars past, and to political decisions made centuries ago. That’s not to say there is no anxiety. This is an election year, and many political observers are worried about the populism creeping into public discourse in this normally restrained nation. Yet even the humblest Canadian will admit that the cleavages don’t run nearly as deep as they do elsewhere – the mood not nearly as angry or explosive. Mike Gray sits in his Singer sewing shop in early January in downtown Oshawa, which was rocked by economic news in late November when General Motors announced a five-plant closure across North America, including its last assembly line here. He says he believes Canada won’t be torn apart and politics won’t turn mean-spirited as it has south of the border. “I think it’s just the way we were brought up,” he says. “People are probably a little more gentle. ... I think that we’re used to not rattling people up; it’s just not our nature.”It’s become almost a parlor game: Canadians and Americans comparing the differences in national character. Americans are the brash and boastful (at least according to the view up here) while Canadians are the polite and pleasant. The election of Mr. Trump in 2016 after a boisterous campaign, compared with the election of Mr. Trudeau in 2015 after a more muted national plebiscite, did nothing to dispel these views. But the differences in character, caricatured or not, show up in other measures as well. One recent Canadian study compared 40 million tweets among Canadians and Americans. The idea was to explore what language choices reveal about stereotypes of national temperament. The researchers found that Canadians tend to use words that are positive, such as “great,” “amazing,” “awesome,” “thanks,” and “beautiful,” while Americans’ tweets skew more negative, with words such as “hate,” “tired,” or “bored.”“What may be coming out here, if this is a reflection of Canadian culture and our choices, may be that Canadians are more invested in a sort of friendly and accepting identity,” says Bryor Snefjella, one of the study’s researchers from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. The differences in national persona, in some ways, extend all the way back to the Revolutionary War. The rebellious members of the 13 Colonies fought to carve out their own identity and country, while those who wished to stay the subject of the British crown fled north. “Loyalists,” essentially anti-revolutionaries, shaped the foundation of English-speaking Canada, with the values of “peace, order, and good government” dominating the early political culture, while those in a fledgling America infused their guiding charter with words such as “unalienable Rights” and “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”To this day, Americans seem more comfortable engaging in a fiery populism. Stephen Marche, a Canadian author, wrote an essay called “Canadian Exceptionalism.” In it he argues that one of the key differences behind the divergent paths of Canada, compared with the U. S. under Mr. Trump, lies in the conservative parties of each nation. Although Canadian Conservatives have taken up wedge issues, especially around immigration, in their quest to regain power, he says it is nothing like what he hears from some far-right elements of the U. S. Republican Party, in which “there really is a sense of wrecking the whole thing,” he contends. Anger over diversifying populations and influxes of people from other countries is fueling populist movements around the world. In Europe, it’s helped push Britain into unknown territory as it stumbles out of the European Union. From Hungary, to Turkey, to the Philippines, authoritarian leaders have risen to office, greatly expanding their powers, in part over concern about controlling borders and a backlash to the “others” in society. Those voices exist in Canada, too – and in an election year are reverberating more loudly than ever – but the country has a longer history in tolerance-building, forming a multicultural ethos that views immigration as a pragmatic response to an aging population and declining fertility. When the Canadian government announced plans to attract 1 million newcomers in the next three years this winter, it was to very little opposition. New figures show Canada surpassing the U. S. in the number of refugees it resettled in 2018 for the first time in 72 years. One of those newcomers arrived on a rainy night in December. The usual crowd has congregated outside customs at Toronto Pearson International Airport. They are there to greet passengers of Turkish Airlines Flight 17 from Istanbul. Among those waiting are Lana Delmaestro, her husband, and their young son. The youth holds a homemade poster with a maple leaf drawn in red marker and the name “Alaa.” They intently watch the sliding doors for a Syrian refugee they’ve never met, but whom the family sponsored with a group of other Canadians. By now, these airport scenes – of Canadians holding their flags and “welcome” signs as they meet refugees they’ve helped bring to Canada through the country’s private sponsorship model – are commonplace. In fact, the Delmaestros are one of three groups of people waiting for Syrian refugees on this flight alone. Ms. Delmaestro hugs Alaa when she walks through the main arrival area, dressed in a black sweatshirt and maroon headscarf after a long journey from Jordan. She hands the young Syrian an Ikea bag with a winter coat and boots. Then Ms. Delmaestro turns to her son, still holding his sign, and repeats something she’s told him over and over since they decided to sponsor a refugee family, legally committing to a year of supporting her financially and emotionally: “This is the most important thing our family will ever do.”Many see this acceptance rooted in the way the country was founded. After the British prevailed over New France in the Seven Years’ War, British officials signed the Quebec Act of 1774. It guaranteed French-speakers the right to maintain their religion and civil laws, laying the groundwork for what’s often called Canada’s “culture of accommodation.”Peter Russell, author of the 2017 book “Canada’s Odyssey,” argues that the “incomplete conquest” of French-speaking Canada as well as its indigenous peoples created a series of “nations” within the country that formed the foundation of a high level of tolerance for diversity today. Bicultural tensions between English and French, the “endemic fault line of Canadian politics,” adds author Erna Paris, has required compromise at every facet of Canada’s political life. As Quebecois identity strengthened in the 1960s, then-Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau (Justin Trudeau’s father) set to quell tensions with an official policy on multiculturalism in 1971. It codified in essence that no one religion or ethnicity was more important than another. “Accommodation and compromise have been the modus vivendi of nationbuilding in this country,” says Ms. Paris. Multiculturalism has also been encouraged by geography. A cold mass of land, bordered by two oceans and the most powerful country in the world across its entire southern flank, Canada has had to invite people to live here. Unlike the uncontrolled immigration from Mexico and Central America to the U. S. or from Northern Africa to Europe – which fuels perceptions of chaos and crisis – Canada relies on a highly-controlled points system based on language ability, age, and skills. Its immigrants are the “best and brightest” – the most educated immigrants among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries – which is one reason diversity, multiculturalism, and views toward immigrants rank so high in opinion surveys.“Increasingly I feel [Canada] has its own momentum, and it’s just going off on its own route. It’s not just not-London, not-New York, which is what it always was,” says Mr. Marche. “Canada is way more of an idea than it is an ethnic identity or even a collection of myths. Multiculturalism really does have that power as a binding agent.”Mr. Russell argued in his book that modern Canada “might be more like a civilization than a nation-state.” “As an example of how diverse peoples can live together in freedom and peace,” he writes, “this loose never settled alliance of peoples called Canada could replace empire and nation-state as the most attractive model in the twenty-first century.”That does not mean populism doesn’t exist here. In fact, the Reform Party, a right-wing populist movement founded in the late 1980s, predates America’s tea party movement. Today Canadians will immediately point to Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, who won on a decidedly populist platform last spring. Or to Quebec, where Premier François Legault ran as an outsider in the fall. He promised language tests for new immigrants and has proposed secular restrictions on religious symbols for some public-sector employees, both interpreted largely as anti-Muslim policies. To the extent that Canada gets “illegal immigration,” most of it flows through the border Quebec shares with the U. S., giving space to new populist faces. Far-right groups are here too. Hate crimes have also increased in recent years, according to federal statistics. Before the New Zealand mosque shootings, Canada suffered its own shooting at a Quebec City mosque that killed six in 2017. And the shame of the federal government’s policies toward Canada’s indigenous peoples, and what many see as a halfhearted attempt at reconciliation, hangs heavy – made worse by the ouster of Ms. Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal Party. Trump admirers exist here as well. Ken Montgomery, a truck driver in Oshawa, is one. He says he hates Mr. Trudeau because Mr. Trudeau hates Canada. He wishes a Trump-like figure would emerge on the national scene. “We need it,” he says. This doesn’t surprise Frank Graves, the president of Ekos Research, who says that it’s denial to think that Canada is immune from the nativist forces kicking up elsewhere. He measures attitudes between “open” versus “ordered” – ordered implying those with pessimistic economic outlooks or anti-elite sentiment, or the kind of worldview that fueled a political backlash in the U. S. – and counts 30% of the population holding such attitudes. He says the SNC-Lavalin affair could intensify resentments, leaving Canadians with the impression that the justice system is two-tiered. Still, far-right populism in Canada is different than in the U. S. Mr. Graves calls it a “northern populism.” Its key distinction – apart from not being as well-developed, nor as widely embraced as it is in the U. S. or Europe – is that it is not racially charged.“Unlike the United States, where populism is bounded by race and typically the attraction to [it] is restricted largely to white Americans, in Canada we don’t see that particular boundary. The boundaries are more rooted in social class,” he says. Mr. Ford, for example, does not invoke race or ethnicity in his campaigns and in fact drew heavy support from nonwhite neighborhoods that ring Toronto. Mr. Graves sees reasons for concern, though. Even though Canada has been held up as a success story on immigration – and polls show Canadians becoming more accepting of foreigners – a vocal minority who oppose the influx of outsiders is growing louder. And politicians are listening. Maybe so, but Dan Carter isn’t one of them. Lean and silver-haired, he is the new mayor of Oshawa, sworn in just days after GM announced its plant closure, what he says is the No. 1 issue at city hall. The assembly plant has been in Ottawa since 1953 – a sprawling icon of Canadian manufacturing. The American carmaker itself has been operating in this town, east of Toronto, for more than 100 years. In the 1980s some 23,000 people had company jobs. Now there are only 2,600 unionized jobs left at the plant. And all of those will be gone by the end of this year. Resistance to the shutdown exists, with protests and social media campaigns like #SaveOshawaGM. But the anger is not an outright backlash against mainstream politicians or even globalization – the kind that flipped many Rust Belt states to Mr. Trump in 2016. Instead it remains narrowly focused on the U. S. company itself. “Greedy Motors,” read one sign at a protest in January. In fact, anger might not even be the right word. Donna Lindsay is waiting in the parking lot for her daughter to get off work. Ms. Lindsay worked at the plant for 35 years, until she retired in an earlier round of downsizing. Yet when asked who she is upset with, it’s not immigrants or refugees who could be competing with Canadians for jobs. It’s not politicians either, local or federal. “It’s not their fault. It’s GM’s fault,” she says. Then she qualifies her feelings even more: “I’m not angry. I’m sad and hurt.”Steven High, a history professor at Concordia University in Montreal, has interviewed workers in former industrial regions on both sides of the border and notes some key differences in the way workers react to economic disruptions. The first centers around blame. When closures happened in previous decades, Canadian unions would rail against the U. S.“A lot of the Canadian unions would wrap themselves in the Canadian flag with a discourse around American bosses and Canadian workers,” he says. After decades of free trade and globalization, that kind of rhetoric doesn’t bring a response from the government the way it once did, though the culprit – in this case a U. S. company – remains the same. Canadian workers are also better protected, which helps quiet some of the vitriol over layoffs. Rates of unionization, which were similar in both countries in the 1960s, are about three times as high in Canada today as in the U. S., giving members a progressive working-class voice to represent them. Canadians have a stronger safety net, too – with universal health care and more affordable education – which further softens the blow of losing a job. Still, disillusionment among the working class may be rising. Deindustrialization has happened later in Canada, and Mr. High theorizes that means discontent could just be lagging. “We haven’t seen this rupture and the polarization like across both Eastern and Western Europe and the United States,” he says. “But I think we’re seeing that rupture starting to emerge.”The closure of the plant in Oshawa does mark a milestone, but it doesn't have to become an anti-globalization narrative, says the mayor. “It doesn’t get us anywhere to say ‘they’re making it somewhere else in the world.’ That’s why we’re able to buy TVs for $400,” he says at city hall in early January. While GM still maintains a footprint here, with its corporate headquarters for Canada and a research center for alternative-fuel cars and other technologies, the assembly plant was long vulnerable to closure, says David Paterson, vice president of corporate affairs at GM Canada. He says it was running at 30% below capacity. The company says it will retrain workers who seek new employment, and has already been approached by firms looking to hire. The company is also partnering with community colleges to identify future jobs and the training required to fill them. Mayor Carter says a diversified economy and strong employment can help buffer the blow. But residents also need a vision for their future. In some ways that’s an easier sell than it might be in the U. S., he says. “We in Canada look at things a little bit differently. We believe that we are our brother’s keeper,” he says. Yes, the GM closure is bad, he acknowledges. “And I understand the anger, and I understand the frustration.”“But we need to set the environment where people understand that we’re going to get through this storm ... that whatever we face we’ll still be able to succeed,” he says. “This moment is calling for the best of us.”",3,Reliable,0.1046934340962681,0.4359803320835709,4096,3,Christian Science Monitor

The Arizona GOP is making the call to Ducey so that the state legislature is able to address the multiple allegations of voter fraud and election integrity issues that have plagued the state since election day. The Arizona Senate’s Judiciary Committee had made some headway by issuing subpoenas to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, but the Board voted to reject the subpoenas earlier this month. Ward described the actions of the Board as “extremely frustrating,” and said that their tactic was simply to “delay, delay, delay,” hoping that the election would be over before the subpoenas would ever take effect. “Call the legislature back in early so that they can address this in the manner that the Constitution demands, and let our legislators get to the bottom of what happened in our elections in Arizona,” Ward said. In today’s update, Chairwoman@kelliwardazasks Arizonans to take action by calling the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and urge them to comply with legislative subpoenas & contact Governor Ducey and press him to call the State Legislature back into session two weeks early.pic.twitter.com/udbp1x6Wp7— Arizona Republican Party (@AZGOP)December 28, 2020READ MORE: EXCLUSIVE: Arizona Rep Demands Special Session After Maricopa Ducks Dominion Subpoena, Says Republicans “Don’t Have a Spine”The call to start the scheduled session early from Ward and the Arizona GOP differs slightly from the previous calls from Arizona legislators and others for a special session. The former can only be called by Governor Ducey, whereas the Legislature has the power to vote itself into a special session. Usually, there would be a requirement of a 2/3rds majority of legislators to call a special session. However, in a tweet, State Senator-elect Kelly Townsend said that due to the nature of the subpoenas, in that they are related to a presidential election, only a simple majority of the Legislature should be required to convene a special session of the Arizona House and Senate.",1,Questionable,0.0633465996369222,0.3782572266443234,535,0,National File

141,"The Apocalypse Never Dies, It Just Gets Weirder",-2.0,34.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/the-apocalypse-never-dies-it-just-gets-weirder/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-06,17,"Over the weekend, Madison Cawthorn, the Trumpy young first-term congressman,tweeted out a videoshowing himself misinterpreting the Bible and pushing theocracy. In the video, an edited clip from a speech he gave at a religious-right conference last month, Cawthorn seems to claim that David, Daniel, and Esther “influenced the governments of their day to uphold Christian principles”—at best a shockingly ahistorical assertion; at worst, a troublingly anti-Semitic comment. Yet what’s most remarkable about Cawthorn’s video pushing Christianity onto civic government and warning apocalyptically that “if we bend the knee to the Democrats today, our country will be lost forever and our children will never know what freedom is” is how utterlyremarkable it is. Cawthorn’s rant is, sadly, nowhere close to the biggest problem in apocalyptic Christianity in America at the moment. No, not only has the apocalypticism of the last few years not died out, but things aren’t getting better. Donald Trump may be off of Twitter. Q may have gone silent. Yet the unrest, the conspiracy theories, the anti-democratic forces that launched a coup attempt on January 6 and that promote apocalyptic ideas around the reinstatement of Trump? Those continue to grow and evolve. In 2019, I wrote about the theology of the “last world emperor,” a secular messianic figure used in the Middle Ages as part of apocalyptic circles to push for an active quest for Armageddon, and how and why Trump was being used as a contemporary example of the movement. Now, in 2021, it feels like we are somewhere between the revival of that message and Trump as the actual Messiah. Instead of the apocalypticism calming down eleven months after the 2020 election and nine months after the January 6th insurrection, it has spread, grown, put down roots. Apocalypticism has become mainstream among Trump supporters, and it has brought ever weirder and darker elements from the fringes into the core. In Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, for example, someone paid fora billboardat 1827 Lafayette Street with an image of Trump next to a Biblical verse, “Unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders” (Isaiah 9:6, but misattributed on the billboard to Romans). The full passage, in the King James Version, is “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” The billboard blasphemously implies that Trump is the Messiah; if that is not the intention, it is at minimum a creepy and confusing exercise in Trumpian adulation. The conflation of the Christian message in white evangelical churches with support for Trump is an ongoing crisis. The white evangelical demographic is growing, with anearly 4 percent increasenationwide from 2016 to 2020—fueled almost entirely by white supporters of Trump. According toone March 2021 poll from PRRI, some 61 percent of white evangelicals believe the “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. Numerous evangelical supporters,with “MyPillow” guy Mike Lindellbeing perhaps the most egregious example, have gone all in in this idea. Belief in the big lie overlaps with a number of other conspiracies: Ina January 2021 poll, a majority of evangelical respondents said they believed in widespread voter fraud in 2020, a Deep State war on the Trump administration, and Antifa being responsible for January 6th. QAnon, the apocalyptic partisan murder conspiracy web, is believed inby nearly a quarter of white evangelical Protestants, arounda quarter of Latter-day Saints, andabout a quarter of Hispanic Protestants. Among both white evangelicals and LDS, nearly a quarter say they are willing to “resort to violence in order to save our country.”This by itself is enough cause for alarm—QAnonandDezNat, the LDS iteration (or even more alarmingly,the Doctrine of Christ, a Mormon offshoot that incorporates QAnon directly), seemed to be genuinely dangerous ideologies long before January 6. But given the Trump big lie and the events of January 6th, the willingness to resort to violence takes broader meaning.“Q” himselfhas not posted since December 8, but the QAnon adherents are moving on without him—a QAnon conference in Dallas on Memorial Day weekend, the “For God & Country Patriot Roundup,” was a three-day event featuring Sidney Powell, Mike Lindell, Michael Flynn, and others. Trump was invoked throughout the event. Meanwhile, some45 candidatesfor Congress in 2022 are QAnon supporters. Dave Hayes, a leading QAnon adherent, claims that Q will return “when Trump comes back into office.” And, of course, the usual internet conspiracy-mongers are still following imaginary bread crumbs to saythat Trump isback in power. The interweaving of QAnon and evangelicals—especially in this context of Trump’s repeated insistence that he didn’t lose and his supporters’ belief that violence may be necessary to restore the true government—takes on dangerous holy war themes. Some of the speakers in Dallas openly pushed Christian Dominionist ideas. Edmee Chavannescalled for“those [Christian] disciples [to] have complete dominion over politics, entertainment, the press, business, education, finance, and by God, restoring the integrity of our voting system and get a hold of the global Communist takeover.” This rhetoric wasechoed by Rep. Lauren Boebertat another religious right conference on September 11:Are we going to sit and agree with the enemy? Are we going to agree with what the enemy is doing? Are we going to sit back and complain and murmur? Or are we going to speak life into this nation? Are we going to speak victory? Are we going to declare that God removes these unrighteous politicians, these corrupt, crooked politician, and installs righteous men and women of God?These political figures are not the worst of it, even if they have the biggest mouthpieces.’srecent pieceon the fight against QAnon within Protestant churches, offering examples of Christian nationalism and of congregants stockpiling weapons and joining militias, showcases the danger. There’s the issue of pastorsusing YouTube to spread QAnon sayings, and pastors such as Greg Lockemixing anti-vaccine rhetoric with calls for violence. The link between QAnon and religion has never been secret—but when it filters out beyond the internet, beyond the churches, spreads among their adherents, including some who are mentally unbalanced, you get horror stories like that of Matthew Coleman,who murdered his children because of his QAnon beliefs. This is not an apocalyptic movement that’s adhering to a central goal or theology. It’s one where very personal apocalypticisms, very personal conspiracy theories, lead to the murder of children. While the PRRI survey found that it was Protestant denominations most likely to have incorporated QAnon beliefs, some branches of radical traditionalist Catholics maintain similar beliefs. Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, who had been apostolic nuncio to the United States and now writes conspiracy-laden tracts for the,an apocalyptic hate site that routinely attacks Pope Francis, gavea speech in Julyin which he called the modern world “the kingdom of the Antichrist where transhumanism challenges heaven and nature, in the eternal cry of the enemy, ‘Non serviam’ (I will not serve).” Archbishop Viganò further argued that “this rebellious world, enslaved to the devil—especially in those who govern it with power and money—is waging war on us and is preparing for a fierce and ruthless battle, while he intends to gather around himself as many allies as possible, even among those who prefer not to fight, out of fear or interest.” The apocalyptic fights over QAnon and Trump have begun to bleed over into other intra-Catholic disputes, like the fight over the Latin Mass. Readers of Viganò will have heard of hisQAnon-like conspiracy theory, “the Great Reset.” And MAGA/Q Catholics certainly made their presenceknown on January 6th. In the midst of all this, where is Trump? He has sought out ever more radical ground, spending part of the twentieth anniversary of the 9/11 attacksgiving a virtual speech at the “Rally of Hope” event held by the Unification Church,the cultcommonly known as the “Moonies.” He is not the only senior member of his administration to appear at their events—Mike Pence, Michael Pompeo, and Mark Esper were featured at avirtual rallyby the Unification Church this past May. And the Unification Church had returned the favor—Hyung Jin “Sean” Moon, the son of the cult’s late founder, had campaigned for Trump and organized members to march on the Capitol onJanuary 6th. Sean Moon runs Rod of Iron Ministries,a gun churchthat usesAR-15s in its liturgyand ritual and has recently bought a40-acre compoundit dubbed “Liberty Rock” in central Texas,about 50 miles from Waco. The church’s Twitch stream often uses hashtags like #MAGA, #Trump, and, of course, #QAnon—while Sean Moonplansto take his own messianic kingship when America falls. This crazily radical group, technically separate from the Moonies although there isconsiderable overlap, sounds like it should be too far even for Trump—yet in October 2020Steve Bannon spoke at the group’s “Freedom Festival”(and will againthis coming weekend) and in 2016 Eric Trump attended the opening of the group’sTommy Gun Warehouse(owned by Sean’s brother Justin Moon). Teddy Daniels, a pro-Trump congressional candidate from Pennsylvania, hadSean bless his campaignwhen he announced his run. Far from being marginalized, Rod of Iron has managed to become part of Trump’s world. There is no way to know if Trump knew or cared about any of this when he agreed to speak at the Moonie rally on September 11—but if he did know, that means he intentionally chose to speak at a fringe movement that overlaps with one of the most militant, apocalyptic movements in the country. And as Trump continues his new “Save America” tour—with a name deliberately chosen to provoke fear and anger and to incite action—and presumably to runs for re-election as president (he will bein Des Moines, Iowa this coming Saturday), that combination of guns and God, by whatever means, will only further radicalize his adherents. As time passes, and asapocalyptic prophecies of Trump’s occupation of the White House fail, the strength of the apocalyptic impulses around Trump does not seem to be diminishing. If anything, the reverse is true: it seems to be growing. The more egregiously that fringe groups are being courted and integrated into the body of true believers, the more that Trump’s faithful seem to become weirder, more dangerous, and more convinced that their apocalypse is coming. We can only hope thatderadicalization effortswill be supported and be successful, but until then, the messianic fervor around Trump remains—and remains a threat.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0248547421113792,0.4538595819126792,2504,2,The Bulwark

What he wants is a free and fair election and honest results,” Dobbs angrily said to Nunes.“Right…” Nunes began.“And it’s being denied to him…Dobbs said, cutting off the Congressman while notably citing no proof to back up his false claim. “It’s outrageous, and what I — if I may — what I’d like to know is what in the hell is the Republican Party doing to defend and to, I mean, why not just say we’re not going to accept the results of this election? It’s outrageous.”When Nunes agreed and tried to pivot to the importance of Republicans signing up for the Twitter and YouTube alternatives, Parler and Rumble, Dobbs wasn’t having it.“Good lord, Congressman, you know, with all due respect, Congressman, and I respect the hell out of youa fiery Dobbs said, breaking in again, “the pushing Parler and Rumble is not an answer to what I’m asking. You’ve got to have something to say and you’re on either one of those the, I’d hope there’d be more, I would hope there’d with more interest in the content than in the messenger.”“I think we’re both saying the same thing here, Lou,” Nunes replied, before complaining about the lack of TV programs that would have him on as a guest. He went on to insist, absent any evidence, to contradict Biden’s massive vote lead across numerous swing states, that the election should not have been called for President-elect“What are you doing? What is the party doing to make certain it isn’t called?” Dobbs raged in response, stepping all over Nunes’ reply. “I see so little animation in the Republican Party on this. It’s as if it’s just another day at at the store. And when, in fact, I believe the fate of the republic hangs in the balance here. Don’t you?”“I couldn’t agree with you more,” a backpedaling Nunes said, before making yet another pitch for the alternative social media sites.“I will stipulate, go to Rumble, go to, you know, go to Parler,” Dobbs assented. “But that’s, you know, a simple question. Go do it.

It’s outrageous. Don’t you agree?”“I agree, I totally agree,” Nunes said, again rushing to assuage Dobbs. The congressman then offered up a bizarre theory that the Democrats had gone through all the effort to steal the election, but only by narrow margins, leaving to chance that recounts would easily uncover their fraud.“These states are way too close to call. And what we’re witnessing here is, is a choreographed, a well-choreographed play that was written before this election,” Nunes said. “If it was too close, they were going to riot in the streets. They have just enough, what are they doing? Moving past everything trying to cover it up.”Picking up on this bonkers thread, Dobbs referenced the 2018 confirmation fight of Justice, random Antifa violence, and Black Lives Matter protests as further indications of a vast, long-term plot to illegally install Biden.“This is an effort to intimidate,” Dobbs said, wrapping up the unhinged segment. “This is an attempt to take over the country and deny this president what is rightfully his, a second term.”Watch the video above, via Fox Business Network.",2,Generally Reliable,-0.008015873015873,0.5610978835978836,974,2,MEDIAite
143,Trump Needs More than ‘Meme Magic’ To Win,22.0,31.67,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/trump-needs-more-than-meme-magic-to-win/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"When the doomed impeachment of President Trump proceeded towards its anticlimax in February, many Republicans, in the midst of a strong economy, were optimistic about him being returned to the White House. A good thing too, since over the previous two years the Republican Party had taken stock of what happened in 2016 and decided, of all the things President Trump did and said, what they really thought they should adopt was hispersonality. He fights, they said, but what he might be fighting was left pretty vague. By now it has become clear that any hope of the party taking his election as a sign that they might actually have togive somethingto the downscale voters flocking into the party is a lesson that will take another election to reinforce. The impeachment proceedings against Trump began as news broke of the first COVID-19 cases in China, and we were told it was racist to be worried at the time. Trump was acquitted by the Senate about two weeks after the virus began to arrive on American shores, putting a damper on any effort to capitalize on the failure of the only impeachment in American history rooted in foreign policy disagreements. “Time is running out on Donald Trump,” read one Batman fan-fiction by the Krassenstein brothers. Wait, no…it was an early August news lede inPolitico, a publication started with funds from the scion of a banking dynasty that moved more foreign money through Washington than probably anyone else. They might be right, but how any patriotic American cannot hope for the disappointment of these people is beyond me. The late lamented M. Stanton Evans used to joke that he never much cared for Nixon until Watergate, the first time the deep state realized it could remove presidents. In a similar way, despite a long list of disappointments from this administration, it’s more obvious to me than it was in 2016 that to effect any sort of sea change in foreign policy or government, he’ll need four more years. There are reasons to think the Trump administration is learning its lesson after hiring far too many ideological enemies and party functionaries. Many of these people pushed against the president’s desire to withdraw from Afghanistan, but it’s looking more likely that Trump is going to get his way in that country, which is not a small achievement. However, the fact that the deep state is seemingly able to conjure up a scandal to order lasting several weeks—like the highly dubious Russian bounties for Taliban members who kill U. S. soldiers—means the administration should take more seriously the problem of civil servants who do not see themselves as accountable to the American people’s elected leaders. As with four years ago, there is plenty of demoralization propaganda afoot, and given how badly that outcome was predicted, with nobody having learned anything since, it does not seem absurd to think the consensus might have things wrong again. But a significant and troubling difference seems to be that a lot of campaign people believe the propaganda this time. COVID-19 has accelerated economic trends favorable to Trump, having decimated small business while woke tech billionaires get even richer. There are now millions more members of Trump’s most reliable voting demographic: downwardly mobile white voters. All this means that maybe there is some logic to campaign manager Bill Stepien’s base-centric strategy; as StepientoldBloomberg on August 6, “These are voters that [sic] always need to be looked after, cared for and paid attention to, because if you lose focus on them, if you take for granted key parts of the electorate like that, there’s a chance that they stay at home or vote a different way.”There are good reasons to think that the story we’re hearing right now—Batman is closing in on the Joker’s lair—might be missing some things. Pennsylvania new voter registrations haveadded150,000 more Republicans than Democrats, and Latino voter registrations have also benefited Trump more than Biden,accordingto NBC. And one pollster we spoke with on the “TAC Right Now” podcast believes that the “shy Trump voter” effect is even stronger today than it was in 2016. Despite the pandemic and economic contraction, recent events have proven that 2016 is still very much with us. As this column goes to press the National Counterintelligence and Security Center Office has put out an advisory that, while China and Iran would prefer a Biden administration, Russia is still backing Trump. Neither Trump nor the Democrats had even pondered the question of how one might campaign during a pandemic, but now they’re having to figure it out. The conventional wisdom is that an economic catastrophe is bad for the incumbent president, a problem compounded by Trump having to pare back his popular rallies. But there are reasons to be skeptical of this theory: polls show voters don’t really blame Trump for the pandemic, and Democratic governors are giving voters an experience of what a Biden lockdown might look like, good and hard. To that you might add that Biden’s case to voters, resting on the virtues of a steady hand and pitched to suburban moderates who just want the madness to end, is undermined, first of all by his limited forays out of his basement, and also his diminished verbal and possibly mental acuity. Will he make it to 83 before taking leave of his senses? Are the odds better or worse than a game of Russian roulette?The Trump campaign has wisely, after a few fits and starts, started playing on the uncertainty that Biden might not be a wild-eyed radical, but he’s not in a condition to resist much of anything at the moment. One Trump rapid response person tweeted that Biden“has entirely embraced the policies of the radical left. He signed onto the Bernie-Biden Unity Communist Manifesto Platform, and vetted Communist Karen Bass for VP.” This is certainly more effective than tweeting decades-old pictures of Biden’s young son in a Redskins hat, a line of attack that was being road-tested by GOP communications people. If ever there was an election unsuited to meme magic, it’s this one. The image of a man in a MAGA hat exuberantly giving aphotojournalist the double birds during Trump’s election night event in 2016 is, alas, not exactly the color our national mood ring is showing right now. If Trump is thrown out of office by voters in November, it will be because Republicans mistook being a fighter for being as important as what you’re seen as fighting for, a message both the White House and Republican congressional caucus have allowed to become muddied since he took office. All the same, I’ll confess that, after an unprecedented criminal investigation of a political opponent by the Obama White House, after every fundraising socialite from Great Falls to Silver Spring spent the last three years in a Cold War spy novel of their own invention, and after turning onThe New York Timespodcasts to hear columnists talk about how it’s every patriotic American’s duty to do zim or zer’s utmost to destroy this mad brute—after all this, if the American people simply said, “No, I’m afraid we don’t believe you this time either,” that would be cheering to me. It would almost be enough to restore one’s faith in the country.",1,Questionable,0.0729203600632172,0.4196488696488697,1554,2,The American Conservative
144,"Were the Founding Fathers Not Involved in Pledge, Anthem, ‘In God We Trust’?",0.0,48.0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/founding-fathers-pledge-anthem-in-god-we-trust/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"In the summer of 2021, we received inquiries from Snopes readers about the accuracy of a widely-shared meme insisting that several totems of American civic and political culture, such as the national anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance, were in fact relatively recent inventions, and thus had no link to the ""Founding Fathers,"" whose actions and intentions are often regarded as sacrosanct in the United States. The meme consisted of a banner image featuring Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, along with thefollowing text:The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1923. The Star Spangled Banner was adopted in 1929.""Under God"" was added to The Pledge in 1954.""In God We Trust"" was added to our money in 1956. So... NO. They were not created by our Founding Fathers. The following screenshot shows a selection of instances of the memeposted to Facebook in 2021, and illustrates its popularity on that platform:The broad point of the meme is correct — the four totems mentioned were not adopted until many decades after the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the Founders did not play a part in their implementation. As such, we are issuing a rating of True. However, the accuracy of the specific dates listed in the meme was mixed. The following is an assessment of each date and milestone listed in the meme, bearing in mind that the overarching point of the meme remains correct. The basic format of the pledge was devised by Francis Bellamy, a Christian minister, to mark the occasion of Columbus Day, in, the 400th anniversary of the Columbian expeditions. Anofficial programfor that day's commemorations set out the text of the pledge, to be recited in public school classrooms across the nation:""I pledge allegiance to my flag, and the republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""After that, two significant changes were made. In, the American Legion organized a National Flag Conference in Washington, D. C., at whichit was decidedthat the words ""my flag"" should be replaced with ""the flag of the United States,"" in order to avoid confusion (or subterfuge) on the part of recently-arrived immigrants. This is the development in 1923 to which the meme refers. That formula of words was formally adopted by Congress in1942, and the second significant change came in, when the words ""Under God"" were added (more about which below). The meme has the right era, but the wrong year. In fact, the U. S. Congress did not formally adopt ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as the national anthem until two years later. On, the following resolution wasapproved:""Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the composition consisting of the words and music known as The Star-Spangled Banner is designated the national anthem of the United States of America.""The version of the pledge re-adopted by Congress in1945is identical to the one now in use, save for two words: ""Under God."" As the meme correctly points out, that phrase was added on June 14,1954, as the comparison below illustrates:That phrase actually first appeared on U. S. currency, though not as far back as the era of Washington and Adams. As anentryon the official website of the U. S. Treasury Department outlines:The motto IN GOD WE TRUST was placed on United States coins largely because of the increased religious sentiment existing during the Civil War. Secretary of the TreasurySalmon P. Chasereceived many appeals from devout persons throughout the country, urging that the United States recognize the Deity on United States coins. In April 1864, Congress passed a law that ""changed the composition of the one-cent coinand authorized the minting of the two-cent coin. The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary. IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864two-cent coin.""In the 150 years since then, ""In God We Trust"" has appeared intermittently on various coins. In 1956 — the year referred to in the meme— it became the official motto of the United States, and the first paper currency bearing the phrase was printed in 1957.",3,Reliable,0.1003571428571428,0.3440986394557823,946,3,Snopes
145,Who Are “The People”?,-2.67,38.67,https://www.cato.org/blog/who-are-people,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,18,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s social media posts have come in for a lot of scrutiny lately. I noticed something in a recent tweet that hasn’t gotten much notice, but which I think reflects an interesting and perhaps disturbing attitude. On January 30 she wrote that “the people of this country are absolutely 100% loyal to” President Trump. But of course “the people” of the United States are not all that enamored of the former president, either now or at any point. He got 45.9 percent of the vote in 2016, 46.8 percent in 2020. He got 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton and 7 million fewer than Joe Biden. He’s the first president ever whose approval rating in the Gallup Poll never reached 50 percent, and as he left office his average poll rating was 38 percent. So it doesn’t really seem that the American people are “absolutely 100% loyal” to him. Yet on Facebook, Twitter, and elsewhere you can find constant affirmations that the elites may not like Trump but “the people” support him. Who are these people?Claiming the mantle of “the people” is a common theme of populists, of course, from William Jennings Bryan, who asked “Shall the People Rule?” but lost three presidential races, to Hugo Chavez, who denounced his opponents as homosexual, Zionist, and tools of “the bourgeoisie” and the Americans. Political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell described populism as an ideology that “pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous ‘others’ who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice.” Populists typically claim to speak for “the people” against some set of elites and/​or against groups who are not elite but are in some way “other” — foreigners, immigrants, Jews, racial or sexual minorities, etc. In a 2019 Reason article on authoritarian populism, Tom G. Palmer emphasized this point:The Princeton political scientist Jan‐​Werner Müller proposes another characteristic: “In addition to being antielitist, populists are always antipluralist,” he argues in 2016’s What Is Populism? (University of Pennsylvania Press). “Populists claim that they, and they alone, represent the people.” In that formulation, the key to understanding populism is that “the people” does not include all the people. It excludes “the enemies of the people,” who may be specified in various ways: foreigners, the press, minorities, financiers, the “1 percent,” or others seen as not being “us.”Republicans like to point to a red‐​blue map of recent elections by county or precinct, in which a few blue dots are visible in a sea of Republican red. Those are “the people” — even if there are more cows than people in many of those vast red areas. They’re “the real America,” as Glenn Beck titled a book. Sarah Palin said the “the real America” was the small towns. Living in Virginia, I hear the same claims about “the real Virginia.” When former Sen. George Allen noticed his opponent’s “tracker,” a young Indian‐​American, filming his speech, he called out “Let’s give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.” In 2009, Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli told Shenandoah County Republicans that they represented “the real Virginia.”And that, I think, is what Representative Greene and others mean when they say “the people” support Trump. They mean The People. The real people. Not those other people. Even if the other people turn out to be a majority.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0611111111111111,0.4220588235294117,815,3,Cato Institute
146,‘Super-Pollutant’ Emitted by 11 Chinese Chemical Plants Could Equal a Climate Catastrophe,-5.33,46.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06082020/china-n2o-super-pollutant-nylon-emissions-climate-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,21,"In December 2007, Charles Perilloux, an American chemical engineer, traveled to China to help install inexpensive and game-changing technology at a Chinese chemical plant that was spewing a climate “super-pollutant” into the atmosphere. For years, Chinese companies and government research institutes have had a strong interest in developing their own nitrous oxide abatement catalysts, as a way to reduce costs. The 2014 book published by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection noted that the high cost of foreign catalysts was “the main difficulty” for nitrous oxide emissions reductions. Researchers from Liaoyang urged the company to explore options other than continuing to import expensive catalysts in their 2018 report. A 2015 Chinese patent by Beijing University of Chemical Technology describes a lower cost, domestic catalyst. The catalyst was successfully tested at Shenma’s plant, according to a 2016 study published in Industrial Catalysis, an academic journal run by the Northwest Research Institute of Chemical Industry, a government research center in Shaanxi province. The 2016 study, however, suggests that domestic catalysts had yet to see large-scale deployment because of a lack of regulatory requirements.“The technology only remains at the laboratory and pilot stages and industrial use has yet to be developed because N2O emissions are not strictly controlled at present,” the study stated. If Shenma has been using a new, domestic catalyst in its CDM-era reactor, the company still couldn’t be abating all of its emissions. Since Shenma’s Clean Development Mechanism project began in 2007, Shenma’s adipic acid production capacity has grown nearly ten-fold, with a third of total production occurring at a second, nearby location. It is now the third largest adipic acid producer in China. The reactor installed by Invista would be capable of abating only slightly more than half of the company’s total nitrous oxide emissions, Perilloux said. Shenma has, however, begun to capture and purify a “small amount” of its nitrous oxide emissions for reuse in the electronics industry, Duo said. Nitrous oxide is used in semiconductor and LCD display manufacturing. It is also used as an anesthetic—N2O is the “laughing gas” long used by dentists—and as a propellant in foods such as whipped cream. The gas has also grown in popularity as a party drug in China in recent years. But the market for all uses of N2O is limited and represents only a small fraction of the N2O produced as a byproduct of manufacturing adipic acid. Chinese industry news reports anda n environmental assessment by the city of Pingdingshan, show that an outside company began capturing a small fraction of Shenma’s nitrous oxide emissions in 2017. Another company broke ground on a second, larger facility in the fall of 2019. Combined, the two facilities will be able to capture as much as 21,000 to ns of nitrous oxide per year, according to publicly available records. This is approximately 16 percent of Shenma’s total emissions, based on total production capacity. Shenma Industry Company, a parent company of Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company, mentioned these nitrous oxide recovery facilities and the CDM facility in a 2020shareholder report, but did not mention any ongoing abatement using catalysts and chemical reactors. Assuming Shenma uses its nitrous oxide capture facilities at full capacity, and using the most conservative figure for nitrous oxide emissions from the 2014 Ministry of Environmental Protection book, adipic acid plants in China could be emitting the greenhouse gas equivalent of 25.3 million automobiles, more than all cars in California, Beijing and Shanghai combined.‘A Topic Worth Investigating’In December 2018, China submitted an official report on greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The report,China’s “Second Biennial Update Report on Climate Change,” is a high-level country summary that provides a single figure for nitrous oxide emissions from across China’s chemical sector in 2014—311,000 to ns, the most recent official statistic available. This has a carbon dioxide equivalent of 92,678,000 to ns and aligns with the projections in the 2014 book by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection that assumed no nitrous oxide abatement from adipic acid manufacturing. The vast majority of those emissions come from adipic acid production, according to the 2014 Ministry of Environmental Protection book. Such a high volume of emissions is “not plausible if these adipic acid plants all run with abatement in place,” saidWilfried Winiwarter, a senior research scholar on greenhouse gases with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, based in Laxenburg, Austria. There could be three reasons why the government figure for nitrous oxide emissions is so high, Winiwarter said. The first possibility is that Chinese officials may have simply calculated nitrous oxide emissions based on adipic acid production volumes rather than checking with plan to perators to see if they abate any of their emissions, Winiwarter said. A second possibility is that adipic acid plants in China are reducing their emissions, but the Chinese government is intentionally failing to acknowledge their efforts, Winiwarter said. Chinese officials may “on purpose act as if these companies run unabated in order to allow them the possibility to at a later stage claim the reductions and get financial benefit for it,” Winiwarter said. Such a case would depend on there being a future international carbon credit trading scheme similar to the CDM that would allow existing adipic acid plants to sell credits. No known mechanism that would allow for such credits is currently being considered, Winiwarter said. The third possibility is that the government figures are correct and “these emissions really happen,” Winiwarter said. Winiwarter and his colleagues at the institute developed a widely used emissions model, the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model, which assumes that 40 percent of adipic acid plants in China abate nitrous oxide. Another prominent emissions inventory, the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research, assumes nearly all nitrous oxide emissions from China’s adipic acid plants are abated. But Winiwarter concedes that the assumptions on abatement are speculative.“Adipic acid production and related N2O emissions are a topic worth investigating,” he said. “However, I am a scientist and not a detective. I will not be able to provide ultimate solutions to the issue.”An Opportunity for China on Climate ChangeIn 2016, theChinese government stated that it would ensure nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid production would reach its peak by 2020. However, a2019 report by the World Resources Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D. C., projects that if nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid plants in China continue on their current trajectory, an estimate that assumes none of the emissions are abated, they will increase by more than 60 percent in the next decade. It remains to be seen if actual emissions will plateau rather than continue to climb after this year. The World Resources Institute notes, however, that China could go much further, bringing emissions from adipic acid plants to near zero in the next 10 years.“Adipic acid production is highly concentrated and relatively easy to regulate,” the report states. “China can reach a 100 percent installation rate for mitigation systems in adipic acid production by 2030.”The report calculates that the cost of abatement would be $0.12 to $1.35 per to n of carbon dioxide—and even less at plants like Shenma and Liaoyang with existing reactors—making it one of the least expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By comparison, building wind turbines or solar power installations to replace coal-fired power plants costs more than $20 per to n of carbon dioxide emissions eliminated by the renewable energy sources. Retrofitting existing coal plants with carbon capture and storage technology would cost more than $80 per metric to n. While costs for nitrous oxide abatement are low, they are not insignificant. Shenma’s reactor cost $10 million and had $1.1 million in annual operating and maintenance costs, according to the CDM. China has seen a surge in adipic acid production capacity over the past decade, as companies and the local, provincial and national government looked to expand economic development. The build out created overcapacity that severely limited the profitability of adipic acid production. With China’s economy slowing down in recent years and as the country begins to emerge from its coronavirus lockdown, additional costs for abatement would be a hard sell for individual companies if the government didn’t require it. The WRI report comes as China’s central government readies its 14th five-year-plan, a blueprint for the country’s economy for the next five years. The plan is a document that has historically set ambitious targets for economic activity and, increasingly, for emissions reductions as well. Chinese state media have called the five-year plan “one of the most important documents on the planet” for global sustainability. At the same time, China is also preparing to release its next round of commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, including, perhaps, how to tackle “non-CO2” emissions such as nitrous oxide. China’s current Paris commitment and five-year plan focus on carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Ranping Song, the author of the World Resources Institute report, said China should also set its sights on reducing non-CO2 greenhouse gases; pollutants like methane, hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent greenhouse gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning, and nitrous oxide.“If China’s non-CO2 emissions were a country, they would be the 7th largest emitter of total GHGs [greenhouse gases] in the world,” Song wrote i na b log post last September. To have a chance at limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, the world’s nations must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, Song said. Reducing non-CO2 emissions “offers a range of low cost, feasible technologies that should be deployed,” Song told Inside Climate News. “We think non-CO2 emissions reductions are a good opportunity for China to demonstrate momentum” on climate change. Ending Abatement: ‘Unconscionable’For Perilloux, who licensed the abatement technology to Shenma more than a decade ago, the thought that the plant might have stopped using the device is“unconscionable.”“It is galling to consider that you might have raked in that much money and not have continued to abate at 99 plus percent forever,” he said. Even without the CDM windfall, Perilloux said, continuing to use the abatement technology is the right thing to do. Perrilloux’s former employer, Invista, continues to abate roughly 98 percent of its emissions at its last remaining adipic acid plant in Victoria, Texas. The only other remaining adipic acid plant in the U. S., Ascend Performance Materials’ plant near Pensacola, Florida, abates 75 percent of its emissions. Company officials say they plan to voluntarily increase abatement to more than 95 percent by deploying new controls starting this summer.“The cost of abatingN2O is so cheap, we’d certainly think it is something you ought to do because it just doesn’t cost you much,” Perilloux said. “It was cheap as compared to the negative publicity you might get if you didn’t do anything.",3,Reliable,0.0789863613089419,0.3441221430898851,2510,3,Inside Climate News

Bilesannounced this morningthat she's pulling out of the individual all-around finals, having taken what she called a mental health day after pulling out of the team final. She could still compete next week, but maybe she won't. It'll be up to her and has nothing to do with any of the rest of us. We don't have a lot to add to the good things that have already been said, so we'll just agree with those pointing out that if you are the greatest gymnast in world history and— gymnasts call it getting the ""twisties,"" and you shouldclick here to learn all about it— then it's probably best for you and everyone else if you don't break your neck and have to get carried away in a stretcher. On that last vault, she had a mental breakin the middle of the air. Because she's so damn good, she was still able to land it on her feet, without the precision she needed, but also without killing herself. She had been experiencing similar troubles in the prelims. It wasn't a blip. She's going through a thing. She's a human being who goes through things. Expert athletes, musicians — anybody who has tolike that — will tell you that once your body is capable of doing a thing, the rest of it is mental. It's muscle memory. It's a zone they get into. If their brains fail to do their part, bad things can happen. If the skill in question is one where youliterally can paralyze yourself for life if you fuck up, it's probably best to know thyself and get out of there before youliterally paralyze yourself for life. People have been comparing Biles to a Steph Curry or Tom Brady type — mostly these dumpy conservative white men bitching and moaning about ""YEW DON'T DO THAT TO YER TEAM!"" — but iftwo athletes experience similar mental fuckups at a crisis moment, they miss the basket or throw an extremely shitty pass. A world-renowned concert pianist might be betrayed by their brain in the middle of theRach 3and get up and have to walk off stage without finishing. They don't suddenly end up hurling their bodies into their pianos and slamming the lids on their necks. What Biles is the greatest in the world at is uniquely dangerous, to say the least. There's far more to say about it, but again, lots of people have already said some good things. All that said, Charlie Kirkis a real piece of shit. This dumpy white conservative with an inhumanly tiny face that looks like a close-up of an infected ass pimple thinks he has opinions worth sharing about Biles.

Would love to hear about Charlie's expertise in what ""checking the boxes"" entails for a gymnast. Of course, if Biles had ended up severely injuring herself, that probably wouldn't have done wonders for Team America Fuck Yeah's medal contention possibilities. But hey, let's listen to He Of The Unfuckable Face some more:Simone Biles says, ""This Olympic Games, I wanted to be for myself when I came in, and I felt like I was still doing it for other people,"" as she cried after the team event on Tuesday. ""So that just, it like hurts my heart, because doing what I love has been kinda taken away from me to please other people.""Yeah, that's the point, SIMONE BILES. You're representing your nation, you selfish sociopath. You kidding me?Big surprise, Charlie Kirk, dumpy conservative white man, thinks a Black woman exists to please other people. Kirk continued quoting Biles, and adding his entitled editorial comments.""Today, it's like you know what? I'm not going to do something and get hurt. It's just not worth it, especially when you have three amazing athletes who can step up to the plate and do it."" So you know who has the gold medal? Russia. Russia. I have to go look at these 4'11"" Russian Olympians chewing on their gold medals, smirking at the Americans. I'm not OK with that, but honestly that's where we're headed. You know how Trump conservatives just hate letting Russia have the upper hand.. We are raising a generation of weak people like Simone Biles. Weak people like Simone Biles, as assessed by ... If she's got all these mental health problems, don't show up. This is one of the stupidest things these dumpy white men have been saying about all this, suggesting that Biles has been keeping her mental health issues a secret so she could pull a fast one on everybody and quit at the Olympics. As if this whole time she's been like LOL SUCKERS, I'm not going to win ANY gold medals, FOOLED YOU!Of course, she's an incredible athlete. I'm not saying that—she's probably the greatest gymnast of all time. She's also very selfish, she's immature and she's a shame to the country. Hate selfish people who selfishly refuse to break their selfish necks so Charlie Kirk can sit on his dimply ass with a Patriot Stiffy and scream ""U-S-A! U-S-A!"" And if Bilesto have injured herself and could never compete again likeKerri Strug,but she got that gold for Charlie Kirk to fantasize about swinging from said Patriot Stiffy?Worth it. She's totally a sociopath. Of course she's a sociopath. What kind of person skips the gold medal match? Who does that?A person who assesses their own body and mind and determines they physically cannot compete?It's a shame to the nation. You just gave a gift to the Russians. It's not on the level ofhanding overRust Belt polling models to instruct Russian intelligence on howto steal an election for Putin and install the stupidest, most loathed human being in American history as president. But it'll do, we guess. Don't show up. If you're not ready for the big time ...

150,Congress Unloads on Pro-Iran Deal Forces in Trump Administration,17.0,42.33,https://freebeacon.com/national-security/congress-unloads-on-pro-iran-deal-forces-in-trump-administration/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-free-beacon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"Leading Republican senators are uniting against what they describe as a bid by some elements of the Trump administration to keep the Iran nuclear deal on life support via a package of waivers exempting Tehran and its allies from new sanctions spearheaded by President Donald Trump, according to multiple conversations with top congressional officials both on and off the record. A debate has been raging inside the Trump administration for months over how far it will go to sanction the Iranian regime. While President Donald Trump has promised a ""maximum pressure"" campaign to choke off Tehran's resources, the State and Treasury Departments have advocated in favor of waivers permitting Iran to continue sensitive nuclear work as well as its lucrative oil trade. The debate has split certain elements of the Trump administration and will come to a head in the coming weeks as a series of sanctions waivers permitting eight countries to continue purchasing Iranian crude oil is set to expire in May. Already, some elements of the administration are pushing to issue another round of sanctions waivers, prompting outrage on Capitol Hill where multiple officials stand ready to fight that potential decision. At stake is the future of the Iranian nuclear deal itself, which has been on life support since Trump abandoned the agreement in pursuit of tough new sanctions. While the United States has withdrawn from the agreement, there remain elements of the Trump administration who view it as sacrosanct and are hoping to outlast the president. There is support for this position among many European allies who have been searching for ways to skirt U. S. sanctions and continue doing business with Iran. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a vocal opponent of the deal, told thehe is aware of elements within the Trump administration who are working behind the president's back to save the nuclear deal.""A nuclear Iran is the most pressing near-term threat to American national security and to the survival of our Middle East allies,"" Cruz said. ""Every waiver for Iran either allows them to work toward their nuclear goal, or pays for terrorists to attack us, or both.""""The president understands that basic fact but it appears that not everyone in the administration is totally on board. Maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure,"" Cruz said. ""Enough's enough.""The fight over new oil waivers, which thehas reported on multiple times in recent months, is fracturing certain elements of the administration, particularly in the State Department, which has the power to issue sanctions waivers. It remains unclear which direction Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is leaning. State Department officials took nearly a week to respond torequests for comment on the matter and would not provide a definitive answer.""For now Secretary Pompeo has not made a decision,"" said one U. S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak on record. ""He is in listening mode.""Pompeo is set for yet another trip to the Middle East for top-level meetings in Israel, where sanctions waivers are expected to be a topic of conversation among Israeli officials who want to see Iran's economy fully cut off.""Our policy goal remains to get all countries to stop purchasing Iranian crude as quickly as possible,"" a State Department official told the. ""We continue to discuss our Iran-related sanctions with our partners to ensure continued compliance. Any decisions related to sanctions waivers are at the discretion of the secretary of state.""The White House National Security Council appears to be more forward leaning than the State Department on the matter. One senior Trump administration official, speaking only on background, told thethat there is no good reason to issue more oil waivers. The marketplace, the senior official said, is more than prepared to absorb the full removal of Iranian crude.""The U. S. is approaching the May decision point on the renewal of eight countries with waivers,"" the senior official said. ""The administration's goal, as has been repeatedly made clear, is to get to zero exceptions and the oil market appears well positioned to deal with the removal of Iranian barrels.""Leading GOP lawmakers are now taking the unusual step of demanding the Trump administration stop issuing oil waivers when the current batch expires in May. They view the decision as critical to the administration's stated goal of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran.""I urge President Trump to end all waivers for U. S. sanctions laws against foreign purchasers of Iranian oil,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) told the. ""Given that international oil markets appear to have more than enough surplus capacity to offset losses of Iranian oil, it's time for the U. S. to take this step and truly maximize pressure against the terror-sponsoring and nuclear weapons-seeking regime in Tehran.""Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) told thethat the cash windfalls Iran receives from its lucrative oil trade go to fund its global terror operations, which have targeted U. S. forces in the region, as well as allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia.""The Iranian regime uses its petrodollars to fund terrorism and sow chaos throughout the region,"" Cotton said. ""Going forward, the proper amount of oil exports from Iran is zero.""Iran hawks on Capitol Hill are said to have been further riled by a Mondayreport on Iran's construction of two new nuclear plants, which could provide Tehran with a plutonium pathway to the bomb. This type of nuclear work was permitted by the nuclear deal, and is still believed to be legal due to another series of waivers issued by the State Department allowing Iran to continue performing nuclear research, including at a site that once housed its nuclear weapons program. These waivers have become a second flashpoint in the inter-agency battle over the administration's Iran policy. There also is support for a hardline sanctions policy among Republican members in the House.""The oil waiver issue gets to the heart of the matter: whether or not the United States should be engaged in a maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime,"" Rep. Mike Gallagher (R., Wis.) told the. ""I strongly believe we should. This is why last Congress, I introduced legislation along with Senator Cruz to effectively cut Iran off from the global financial system. We need to continue to use all the tools at our disposal to eliminate this regime's funding.""Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) also supports putting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and not granting any further sanctions waivers for Iran to sell oil. U. S. should not grant any more waivers for Iran to sell oil. Iran uses sales to fund terrorism, missiles and nukes. 'U. S. Officials Say the Oil Market Can Withstand No Iranian Exports This Year.""— Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney)March 16, 2019One senior GOP congressional official, speaking only on background, told thethat it is well past time for the administration to take its Iran policy seriously. This means no more waivers and no more wiggle room for Tehran to line its pockets.""If our policy objective is to 'go to zero,' our policymakers should go to zero,"" the source said. ""There's no excuse not to when global oil markets have more than enough spare capacity to offset the loss of all Iranian oil supply.""One veteran Iran policy hand familiar with the battle between Congress and the State Department blamed officials at the State Department for working to undermine Trump's policy toward Iran.""There's an old as dirt expression in Washington D. C., which is that Democrats organize and Republicans atomize,"" said the source, who would only speak on background. ""What it means is that it's impossible to unify any significant group of congressional Republicans around any significant issue.

151,Education Department disputes Georgetown’s claim that foreign funding investigation is winding down,7.33,43.67,https://www.thecollegefix.com/education-department-disputes-georgetowns-claim-that-foreign-funding-investigation-is-winding-down/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,23,"Following anOctober report by the U. S. Department of Education that questioned Georgetown University’s financial ties to foreign governments and reporting of contributions from overseas donors, the school claimed the department had told them it “anticipated closing the matter” and “will not be conducting further investigations.”Further, a Georgetown spokesperson told acampus reporterin November the Education Department report contained “mischaracterizations, inaccuracies and misunderstandings.”Not so fast, says the department. In an email Monday to, a spokesperson for the Education Department declined to comment on the school’s specific claims, but characterized its probe into Georgetown and other schools as an “ongoing investigation.”The spokesperson said the department “will allow the report to speak for itself,” adding, “the Department stands by it.”Representatives for Georgetown declined requests byto comment for this story. According to the report, the Education Department found $6.5 billion in previously unreported foreign money flowing to U. S. colleges and universities.“The threat of improper foreign influence in higher education is real,” said Education Secretary Betsy DeVos* in astatementfollowing release of the report.“Transparency in foreign funding of higher education is not just something I think is a good thing; it’s the law,” DeVos said. “For too long, enforcement of that law was lax, but not anymore.”According to the Higher Education Act of 1965, institutes of higher education are required to report, twice per year, any foreign gifts in excess of $250,000. The report did not provide specific amounts of unreported foreign contributions for individual schools. But according to an Education Department database, Georgetown has reported $380 million in gifts and contracts from foreign governments since 2014. But the report also criticizes other financial arrangements schools enter into with foreign governments, suggesting that they may be a security risk. For instance, in 2008, Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal provided Georgetown with a $20 million gift to fund the Center for Muslim Christian Understanding, which sought to “promote Islamic civilization’s image in the United States,” to “disseminate findings through scholarship,” and to hold academic events. The center was immediately controversial. Shortly after the gift, then-Congressman Frank Wolf (R-Va.) wrote a letter to Georgetown’s president, Dr. John DeGioia, questioning the center’s ability to “[maintain] the impartiality and integrity of scholarship that befits so distinguished a university as Georgetown” after accepting Alwaleed’s money. Wolf further questioned the school’s entanglement with Saudi Arabia given the country’s record on human rights, women’s rights, and religious freedom, noting “the inconsistency of its policies with U. S. priorities and values.”Others noted the danger in having a center dedicated to advancing the Saudi Arabian narrative in a school like Georgetown, which provides so many graduates to the federal government, given its location in Washington, D. C. Further, the center also faced accusations that its title was a misnomer — that there was no Christian representation anywhere in the curriculum.“Prince Alwaleed’s agreement with Georgetown exemplifies how foreign money can advance a particular country’s worldview within U. S. academic institutions — influence that has often remained undisclosed to American taxpayers,” reads the Department of Education report.“Georgetown retains control over the work funded by the Alwaleed gift and runs the Center without outside interference of any kind,” a university spokesperson told the campus paper in November. The October report also questioned a $10 million contribution to Georgetown from the Hong Kong-based multinational conglomerate Spring Breeze Foundation to establish an “Initiative for U. S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues.”According to the initial agreement, the contribution was to be doled out $1 million per year for ten years. An online database of foreign donations shows that five contributions totaling $3 million have been made from the Spring Breeze Foundation to Georgetown beginning in June of 2016. An additional unclassified contribution of $1 million from a Hong Kong-based donor was made to Georgetown in June 2020. Spring Breeze is a subsidiary of the Thailand-based CP Group, a telecommunications, retail, finance and pharmaceuticals company that boasts multi-billion dollar contracts with the Chinese government. The Education Department report notes the gift also “involves cooperation with Tsinghua University, a top-ranked Chinese university with ties to the Chinese military.”The report also questions schools that establish branch campuses in Dohar, Qatar, with the aid of the Qatar Foundation, a nonprofit organization funded in part by the Qatari government. According to the department, the Qatar Foundation “has been known to silence viewpoints Qatar opposes.”While the report redacts the names of the schools partnering with the Qatar Foundation, Georgetown is among the schools that operates a branch campus in Dohar.“All of Georgetown University’s international teaching, research, and service and outreach programs adhere to core institutional values of academic excellence, institutional autonomy, academic freedom, and service to the common good,” the Georgetown spokesperson said in November",3,Reliable,0.0306451612903225,0.2258064516129032,1077,2,The College Fix
152,"In Florida, progressive Jews still scored wins, despite Trump",-4.67,42.67,https://forward.com/news/national/458541/in-florida-progressive-jews-still-scored-wins-despite-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,25,"Supporters cheer as Joe Biden arrives for a drive-in campaign rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds on Oct 29,2020 in Tampa, Fl. Image by So, in the wake of Election Day, is Florida still good for the Jews – at least those who call themselves liberal? Are lefty bubbies and retired blue Boomers safe in their South Florida shtetls?On Nov. 3, Trump carried the state by nearly 400,000 votes. Republicans also defeated Democrats down the ballot in the process, knocking off several liberal Jewish legislative candidates who had been favored. The GOP increased its control of both houses of the legislature, and flipped two Miami U. S. House seats.“It wasn’t exactly a red letter day,” said Democratic State Rep. Joseph Geller, who was active in the Biden campaign, by way of understatement. “We didn’t have a good day in Florida.”But does that mean the state belongs to Republicans, from the rolling lawns of The Villages in Central Florida to the boat paraders of Palm Beach?Maybe not. There was one, lonely ray of sunshine for Florida progressives, many of them Jews, on what was otherwise a disastrous Election Day. On the same ballot where Trump reigned supreme, an amendment to the state constitution mandating a phased-in, $15-an-hour minimum wage passed by 60.8% margin, just over the required amount. It won despite the opposition of the state Republicans and business community, as well as from outside conservative groups. Florida now joins seven other states in mandating a $15 per hour minimum wage. Experts say there is more to it than a falloff in voting for down ballot issues like the constitutional amendments.“Floridians understand that the future of a vibrant economy in this state is not going to be based on attempting to lower wages, but to increase wages,” said longtime South Florida Democratic donor and activist attorney Mitchell Berger. Joe Biden speaks during a drive-in campaign rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds on Oct. 29, 2020 in Tampa, Fl. Image by The minimum wage vote was incongruous to some observers, given the day’s other results. Even more telling, it was the third time in four years that Florida progressives have prevailed in statewide ballot measures, building on more than a decade of similar victories. They recall similar outcomes in the face of previous GOP wins. In 2018, an obscure Republican congressman named Ron DeSantis, with Trump’s backing, won both his party’s primary and defeated Democrat Andrew Gillum for governor by 30,000 votes. Yet, Florida voters in the same election passed another constitutional amendment restoring the right to vote to nonviolent ex-felons who have served their prison terms. In 2016, they approved legalizing medical marijuana. Even earlier, in 2010, the year of the Tea Party avalanche in Florida and the nation, there was a similar anomaly. That year, despite the GOP wave, two constitutional amendments – aimed at egregious Republican gerrymandering — passed the 60% margin, mandated fair, nonpartisan districts for state legislative and U. S. Congressional reapportionment. In 2002, a similar vote mandated a maximum class size for public schools. Why?“The people of Florida essentially care about fairness, particularly fairness in government,” said Ellen Freidin, who led the 2010 campaign for the Fair Districts constitutional amendment, and who contributes to Democratic candidates. “But fairness doesn’t necessarily compute when you’re running one candidate against another,” she said. “People don’t make up their minds about political candidates in the same way they think about issues,” she said. This apparent anomaly – progressive constitutional amendments passing with a 60%majority, even in Republican wave years like this one, with Democratic candidates regularly losing by 1-3 percent has raised fundamental questions: If this pool of social consciousness exists in Florida’s electorate, why can’t the Democrats capitalize on it? They have a registration advantage over Republicans in the state, and the two fair district amendments have largely leveled the electoral landscape. Why can’t Florida Democrats manage to get from 48-49% to 50% in partisan races?Democratic State Rep. Anna Eskamani, of Orlando, has questioned why Democratic candidates this year did not link themselves to the minimum wage.“Not anchoring ourselves around this issue, contrasting ourselves with our opposition is where we failed,” said Eskamani, whose immigrant parents worked minimum wage jobs. “Voters care about issues, and they especially care about issues that impact their wallet.”However, in Seminole County, a swing county adjoining Orlando which Biden carried, the linking strategy only went so far. Democratic challenger Patricia Sigman campaigned for the state senate as a strong advocate of the minimum wage, which her Republican opponent opposed. But a dark money-funded, phantom, third party candidate undermined her race.“How we communicate over the noise is the challenge,” Sigman, a Jewish labor lawyer, said. “I don’t know the answer.”“We don’t need to point fingers at each other,” said Geller, the state legislator. “As a party, we need to figure out how we recapture the trust of average working class people.”Essentially, experts and activists say, what has evolved in Florida is a new way to make government policy sausage – and not a very pretty or efficient one. Frustrated by their minority status in both houses of the legislature, progressive Democrats have learned to use the amendment process to circumvent Republicans, most recently on the minimum wage issue. As an Orlando Sentinel editorial observed, “Voters had to use the only means available to them when lawmakers refuse to do their jobs, which is to change the state constitution.”When Democratic candidates embrace popular ballot measures, it can work to their benefit. The 2016 campaign tolegalize medical marijuana, which passed the same year Trump carried Florida, was led by a heretofore unknown lobbyist named Nikki Fried. Two years later, she parlayed that win to a victory as Florida State Commissioner of Agriculture, albeit a narrow one, 8,000 votes out of eight million cast. Frequently, GOP legislators and governors have challenged these progressive amendments in court, or legislated implementation rules and guidelines aimed at undermining them, generally without success.“Clearly, there is a strong majority of Florida voters that value basic fairness and compassion and providing opportunity and second chances to other Floridians,” said University of Central Florida political scientist Aubrey Jewett. “Hence the passage of several specific proposals that do those things.”“But in an election for president, governor, and senator there is one candidate against another, and those candidates represent a host of issues, personal leadership styles, partisan beliefs, and ideology.”A key issue in making that choice, Jewett said, is abortion rights, which skews against Democratic candidates, and can be a stumbling block to reaching enough socially conscious voters to get from 48% – recent margins – in races to victory. But a larger issue, Jewett and others say, is economic policy, in a state famous for its cozy relations with corporations, low-wages for service workers, and no personal income tax.﻿“Florida is a state that depends on tourism and is seen as business-friendly and Jews, like other voters, may like Trump better on deregulation,” said Beth A. Rosenson, associate professor of political science at the University of Florida. Ira Sheskin, director of the Center for Contemporary Judaic Studies at the University of Miami, agreed.“I think that many Jewish Republicans and other Republicans vote that way for the GOP’s economic stands, but are more liberal on social issues,” Sheskin said. The explanation for why the compassionate constitutional amendments pass is simple, said Berger: “As long as they don’t affect peoples’ taxes – they pass.”Mark I.

153,Districts Eye Summer and Beyond to Recoup Learning Losses. Here’s What 3 Have on Tap,-0.33,47.0,https://www.edweek.org/leadership/districts-eye-summer-and-beyond-to-recoup-learning-losses-heres-what-three-have-on-tap/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-11,25,"In a few short months, school will be out of session. Or will it?With the weather warming up and—cross your fingers—an increasing rate of COVID-19 vaccination nationwide, most school leaders expect the 2021-22 school year will be largely in person. Now they’re planning supports for students to make up for the harmful academic and social impacts of the last year. Among the ideas: increasing summer learning opportunities and other ways of extending learning time. In theory, school districts nationwide will have much more funding than they usually do to spend on these efforts. The Biden Administration’s COVID-19 recovery bill, narrowly approved by the Congress this week, directs more than $122 billion to states and school districts. Districts must spend at least a fifth of their share to address learning loss. The law specifically name-checks summer learning, extended-day programs, comprehensive after-school programs, and extended school-year programs as evidence-based approaches to try—even as mounting research suggests that it’s afifth strategy, sustained tutoring programs integrated into the regular school day, that seems to produce the largest results. In practice, many other factors are playing into district leaders’ decisions. For one, money on paper is not money in hand: Some districts have yet to see their cut of the $54 billion for schools provided in the COVID relief bill passed late last December, let alone from the newest one. Much will depend on each state’s funding picture, too—whether, for example, states will continue to “hold harmless” districts’ funding even in the face of potentially large enrollment declines in the early grades. (Texas and Florida are among the large states that didn’t penalize districts for lower enrollment in the 2020-21 school year, but are now reconsidering those policies.)Finally, in statehouses nationwide, state leaders are considering bills that could either give a boost to districts’ efforts—or tie their hands. In North Carolina, a bill that would mandate that all districts provide 30 days of summer learning has passed one chamber. There’s a trifecta of challenges to putting together good extended-learning programs, say experts who have studied them: encouraging attendance, avoiding the stigma that can attach to students who are prioritized for extra services, and ensuring the teaching is focused—not more of what students got during the school year.“A number of programs spend quite a lot of money keeping schools open, and having teachers lead a group of 10 the same way they would have taught a group of 30,” noted Robert Slavin, a Johns Hopkins University professor and the director of the Center for Research and Reform in Education. “You can see how much fun that would be for kids who aren’t playing outside and didn’t do well with that kind of instruction in the first place.”Still, Slavin said, “I think it would be foolish to waste this particular summer, if COVID is diminishing, not to use it, even though as a main reform it’s not the first thing you would go to.”For Catherine Augustine, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corp. who has studied summer and out-of-school learning, the key is carefully planning the goals and backmapping the curriculum to match.“One of the things we walked away with after looking at all types of summer programs is that programs have to be intentionally designed to meet their goals,” she said. “Be really clear about what you want to accomplish in this summer program—you want students to do better in math. Great. In what? What aspect of it? What are they struggling with?”Education Week spoke to several districts that are beginning to craft recovery plans for the summer and fall. Their insights, in general, mirror the researchers’: Whatever happens during extra learning time will need to look different from regular teaching. It should be in a smaller group or with a teacher who has a strong track record, and it should be responsive to the specific needs of each student. It should include some attention to students’ social-emotional needs and to making the programming enticing. And, they said, it shouldn’t merely repeat the same courses that were offered in the spring. TheEctor County, Texas,school district has added 30 additional days to the end of the 2020-21 school calendar for all K-5 students and for some secondary students. What will be taught in those extra days will differ from the rest of the school year, said Scott Muri, the district’s superintendent“They need more time with educators; they need more time in learning. But time has to be equated with effective practices,” he said. “Simply more time doing the same old strategies and ineffective work is meaningless for children.”For one, the district plans to make use of a model developed by the N. C.-based nonprofit Public Impact to increase the number of students who have access to the district’s strongest teachers, identified based on test scores, evaluations, and other factors. Those teachers will be supported by 4th and 5th year college seniors who are education majors as part of a paid internship. In general, Muri said, the curriculum will also be more flexible. Students will initially be grouped based on year-end benchmark testing, and teachers will be permitted to regroup them as needed; they may even create some classes that span multiple age groups. The district is still mulling over its approach to secondary students, but right now it envisions a model that uses a competency-based approach centered on what standards a student needs to demonstrate by the end of the school year. Some students might need two weeks to show they’ve mastered Algebra 1 content; others might need all 30 days. Muri estimates that the elementary portion of extended learning will cost about $1,650 for each K-5 student. TheOrange County, Fla.,district will be overhauling its summer learning program and coupling it with new on-demand supports for students it’s already put into place. Florida mandated that schools maintain in-person learning for this school year, and about 60 percent of students attend in person. District leaders have found that academic regression appears to be concentrated among its LaunchEd students—those attending school remotely but who are not part of the state or district virtual school. So, this semester, Orange County has piloted a form of virtual tutoring provided by teachers who are on leave for health reasons. It’s offered at specific times during the week for elementary students. For secondary students, the tutoring is semi-”on demand”: They can attend virtual sessions before or after school, and they can also access a menu of tutoring times and subjects for help, said Maria Vazquez, the district’s deputy superintendent. Summer school will also be expanded to about a quarter of students, up from the usual 10 percent to 12 percent. In the past, Vazquez said, summer learning operated only four days a week and only in some grade levels, and was reserved for students who were significantly below grade level, as measured by local tests and grades—usually, those who needed to retake a course or credit, or didn’t meet the state’s 3rd grade reading benchmark. This year, it’s extending eligibility to students who were below grade level but passed, expanding summer school to five days a week from four, and offering it for all grades from K-12 in two four-week blocks. Some students will need just one summer session; others will be encouraged to attend both. The curriculum will be focused on small group work and informed by district data.“The pandemic has really forced us to rethink how we use time, space, and resources, and the LaunchEd tutoring and expansion of summer school is just one example for the next school year,” Vazquez said. “They will look very different from how they’ve done in the past.”She estimates that the summer effort will cost the district $38 million in sum. Rather than adding extra time at the back end of the current school year, theSan Antoniodistrict will infuse its 30 extra days throughout next year’s school calendar. It will attach three weeks to the beginning of the 2021-22 school year, two weeks at the end of it, plus reserve a week in January that can be used for additional supports and interventions. It’s also keeping open the possibility for Saturday schooling, said Superintendent Pedro Martinez. In part, those plans are a reflection of the current logistics: Only about 40 percent of the district’s students are currently attending in person. Martinez believes more parents and students will feel safer returning to in-person learning as vaccination rates rise. Second, the plan focuses on what can be done during the school year out of a sense that many summer programs haven’t been as effective as other approaches.“I’ve had it in every district I’ve been in, and we do have some successes, but we always have a bigger goal or scale, and we never quite get there,” Martinez said. The district will take a more decentralized approach to remediation. It will ask each of its schools, during this April and May, to develop plans on how to use the extra time next year. The plans will need to be approved by parents and staff at the buildings. Meanwhile, the district office will have master teachers design different curriculum supports that target specific grade levels or subjects where data show that students have particularly struggled. Classroom teachers will be able to customize them. One area of focus, Martinez said, will be upper elementary and lower secondary math classes.“If you’re a principal working with teachers and parents, you’ll look at the data, at where the children are, and we’ll ask that not only you create the extra days but plan how you layer in the extra support in math,” he said. Martinez said the district is also working on a plan to help its entering kindergarten students—approximately 30 percent of whom did not attend pre-K, thanks to the pandemic. He expects it will cost about $2,500 a student to yield a strong recovery year in 2021-22.",3,Reliable,0.084660466651992,0.3715521484165552,2130,3,Education Week

That could dampen hiring and keep some workers on the sidelines of the job market — stalling or even reversing the labor recovery, the centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda.

S. states, but new legislation threatens any federal funding going to the practice. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, co-chair of thegrowingCongressional LGBT Equality Caucus,filed legislationlast month to crack down on any use of Medicaid funds for ""conversion therapy.""""Conversion practices are discredited, harmful and not therapy,"" Maloney said. ""Fundamentally, conversion tactics are based on the idea that a person's gender identity or sexual orientation are diseases to be cured.""Maloney, the first out congressmanelected in New York, said questionable billing techniques actually get the government to foot the bill on such debunked and hurtful services.""Until we can just ban conversion 'therapy' all together, we must ensure taxpayer dollars aren't funding a fraudulent practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community. That's exactly what my bill would do,"" Maloney said. The problem is that while Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans, gets funded by federal taxpayer dollars, states largely decide how money gets spent. Since the bulk of state legislatures have no problem letting ""therapists"" sell counseling to suppress gay, bi, and trans identity, illegitimate practices like ""reparative"" therapy get covered by public funds in many places. Typically, the services get filed as ""mental and behavioral health services.""Maloney's bill would establish a definition for what constitutes therapy and put federal parameters in place that disallow any federal dollars being funneled toward the questionable practice, while still ensuring Medicaid can support legitimate services provided toLGBTQpatients. His bill out of the gate enjoyed 63 co-sponsors. The list includes other out representatives like Mark Takano, David Cicilline, Mark Pocan, Angie Craig, and Chris Pappas. With a new Democratic majority, the bill could be bound for passage. Advocates for LGBTQ youth say it's critical for the federal government to defund ""conversion therapy."" The Trevor Project, which is pushing forbans on the practice in every state, applauded the legislation.""The Trevor Project hears from youth harmed by the dangerous and discredited practice of conversion therapy every week. By limiting the means by which licensed mental health professionals can be reimbursed for their horrific practice, the Prohibition of Medicaid Funding for Conversion Therapy Act will make clear that conversion therapy is far outside the mainstream,"" Sam Brinton, Head of Advocacy and Government Affairs for The Trevor Project, said in a statement. Education professionals also rallied around the bill. Marc Negan, spokesperson for the National Education Association, praised Maloney's legislation.""Many organizations, including the American College of Physicians, have discredited any programs that attempt to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity,"" he said. ""These dangerous practices damage physical, mental, and emotional well-being. As educators, NEA members strive to connect with and support all students, which means recognizing their right to be exactly who they are and opposing all practices that deny this right.""",3,Reliable,0.028063738429592,0.4648356386161263,682,2,Advocate Magazine

Apparently, media access was not only extremely limited to a few shouted questions at the beginning, but security then stepped in to get a little handsy with the press corps.

He didn’t step in and put a stop to it, likely because he didn’t know where he was and it wasn’t written for him to doon his notecards. I must say, that’s quite the betrayal given how subservient and slavish the press have been over Biden and every aspect of his presidency. This is a news media that literally worships at his feet, spending all week spinning tails about how Biden is going to stand up to Putin and lay down the law. When given the chance to interject on something as simple as not mistreating the press, Biden just laughs at them. Yeah, that’s gotta sting. This comes after Biden made the press wait for almost three hours a few days ago to give a 20-minute press conference where he called on pre-selected (likely pre-screened) reporters tofield softball questions about Republicans. He has no respect for these reporters, and he’s not afraid to let them know it. Of course, I’m under no illusions. The press won’t learn any lessons here. They’ll simply say, “Sir, may I have another?” the next time Biden abuses them. They are so ridiculously in the tank that they can’t even muster real criticism in the face of the president kowtowing to Putin’s demands, lifting sanctions, and greenlighting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Trump was lambasted as a Russian stooge for four years, but Biden is showing that he’s truly the one with a soft spot for Putin. Will the press call him on it? Nah, they won’t. Instead, we’ll get more glowing profiles in courage. In the end, I’m going to have to go with hilarious in regards to what I feel about this entire drama. The press had a chance to be independent and hold those in power to account. Instead, they bowed at Biden’s feet, rushing to do his bidding at every turn. Now, they are getting treated with all the respect they showed their own profession. You hate to see it.",0,Problematic,0.0392581569664903,0.5001984126984128,733,0,RedState

158,Keep the safeguards in California’s ‘End-of-Life’ law,-10.0,34.67,https://capitolweekly.net/keep-the-safeguards-in-californias-end-of-life-law/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-13,15,"Assisted suicide is already legal in California through the so-called End-of-Life Option Act, narrowly passed by the California Legislature and signed by then-Gov. Brown in 2015. The bill was opposed by both Democrat and Republican Assembly members and Senators, but passed during a contested Special Legislative Session on Medi-Cal funding. Despite the bill’s narrow passage, now just a few years into the new law, its proponents want to eliminate some of the very “safeguards” they used as arguments to pass their bill. The new bill, Senate Bill 380 by Sen. Susan Eggman (D-Stockton), would eliminate the 2026 sunset provision that doctors, patient advocates, and legislators included to undertake a thorough examination of California’s experience with this controversial law. This new bill will also eliminate the 15-day safety period to receive deadly prescription drugs, an important protection because studies such as one from The Lancet show the high percentage of patients who change their minds after deciding to hasten their deaths. This rush to erode the safeguards included in the 2015 End of Life Option Act is dangerous public policy. During the 2015 debate on the End of Life Options Act, former State Senator Bill Monning (a bill author) noted inthat, “co-authors on this bill … endeavored to build in protections that are stronger than any of the states where this has been practiced.”Monning’s statement is untrue because the bill’s minimal protections and limited data, when compared to other states where assisted suicide is legal, remain central to its problems today. The Death with Dignity National Center, supporters of the End of Life Option Act, contradict this new effort to eliminate patient protections in their website FAQs, as recently as April 12, 2021. The notation states, “Death with dignity statutes contain a number of safeguards, protecting patients from abuse and coercion … the patient must make two oral requests, at least 15 days apart.” (Source: But in this new bill, proponents want to eliminate this very “safeguard” they once held up. This rush to erode the safeguards included in the 2015 End of Life Option Act is dangerous public policy. There is simply no data or science to support removing them so soon. Annual reports on the End of Life Option Act required by the State of California do not contain any data whatsoever detailing complications or patients’ reasons for requesting the lethal drugs. For the limited data that is provided, too much remains listed as “unknown.” Over the past year, due to the COVID pandemic, we have become sadly familiar with how important medical and scientific data are in making informed public policy decisions; especially those involving life and death. With the benefit of hindsight, it appears that the protections proponents touted as safeguards were no more than a ruse to get the original law passed. For example, the latest California annual report on the End of Life Option Act released in July 2020 reports that 10% of those requesting the lethal drugs had an “unknown” insurance coverage, and it was “unknown” whether 7% ever received information about available hospice or palliative care options. In a March 2021interview with Dr. Diane E. Wright, longtime Director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care at Mount Sinai Hospital, Dr. Wright noted, “All the heartfelt adherence to restrictions that are announced when you first get the public to vote in favor of this go up in smoke once the practice is validated.”Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, it appears that the protections proponents touted as safeguards were no more than a ruse to get the original law passed. Given the contentious history of the End of Life Options Act, as well as a patient healthcare infrastructure pushed to the breaking point by the COVID pandemic, it is neither wise nor appropriate to remove any of the law’s protections. Further, any effort to expand assisted suicide policy in California is in stark contrast to the on-going, unresolved debate on healthcare disparity and inequity within ethnic and minority communities who lack access to palliative, hospice and other care for serious and terminal diseases. Prioritizing the right to die rather than the basic means needed to live is clueless at best, if not disingenuous. Enough of the doubletalk, and the double standards, that accompanies the double jeopardy that the repeal of assisted suicide’s protections would no doubt unleash. The minimal protections established in 2015 are just as necessary now, perhaps even more so. No matter what they say, proponents of assisted suicide can’t have it both ways",2,Generally Reliable,0.0600702678963548,0.4460781730346948,1006,2,Capitol Weekly

Afterfallingshort of its July 4 goal to have 70 percent of Americans vaccinated, the administration seems to be turning to a more community-focused method. In a Tuesday press briefing, President Biden warned of the danger caused by the COVID-19 Delta variant,tellingreporters that “we need to go to [sic] community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus.”Press Secretary Jen Psaki echoed the president’s remarks, reiterating the administration’s commitment to “targeted, community-by-community, door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the information they need about both how safe and accessible the vaccine is.”Some on the political left have criticized Biden’s door-knocking initiative as not enough, including Obama-era Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. “You know, we’re going to tiptoe around mandates,” SebeliustoldtheNew York Times. “Come on. I’m kind of over that.”But the strategy has also generated disapproval from those uncomfortable with the idea of government employees knocking on Americans’ doors. Podcaster Dave Rubinpointedout that America’s COVID-19 response changed “[f]rom ‘two weeks to flatten the curve’ to ‘a man with dementia is going to send government operatives to your house to make sure you’re vaccinated.’ ”Republican legislators also heavily criticized the policy, with Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas)tweeting, “How about don’t knock on my door. You’re not my parents. You’re the government. Make the vaccine available, and let people be free to choose. Why is that concept so hard for the left?”Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)warnedthe administration against the new strategy: “A lot of people have big government antibodies. Don’t knock on those doors.”Republicans also questioned the door-to-door campaign tactic’s effectiveness. GOP strategist Matt Whitlocknotedthat government employees showing up at American homes was not a strategy to endear the unvaccinated: “Whoever suggested that the best way to reach remaining vaccine skeptics was to talk about going door to door should be fired immediately. It’s the Beto O’Rourke of vaccine outreach.”Pennsylvanian candidate for Senate and veteran Sean Parnell offered the most succinctrebuketo Biden’s plan: “Hell no.”The CDCreportsthat 67.1 percent of American adults have had at least one dose of the COVID-19vaccine.

Despite that, Blake’s fathertold theon Thursday, Blake has been handcuffed to his hospital bed.“Even after being shot by the police, Mr. Blake continues to be abused by our criminal legal system.” — Alyssa Mauk, Wisconsin American Civil Liberties UnionAsked at a news conference in Kenosha Thursday afternoon whether that report concerned him, Governor Tony Evers said, “Hell, yes.” The governor added: “I can’t imagine why that’s happening and I would hope that we would be able to find a . . . better way to have him get better and recover.”“Jacob Blake, who is now paralyzed from the waist down after being shot seven times in the back by an officer, lies handcuffed to his hospital bed,” said Wisconsin American Civil Liberties Union Communications Director Alyssa Mauk. “Even after being shot by the police, Mr. Blake continues to be abused by our criminal legal system.”In separate statements Thursday, theACLUanda coalition of national civil rights groupscalled for Kenosha’s top law enforcement officials to resign or be fired, following the the police shooting of Blake on Sunday and, two nights later, the shooting deaths of two people for which a seventeen-year-old self-styled militia member was charged. The demands were the latest fallout amid mounting criticism of Kenosha law enforcement agencies since a police officer shot Blake seven times in the back on Sunday as he was getting into his car. The shooting, captured by a bystander on video, followed a police call for what was described as a domestic dispute and what some witnesses said involved Blake trying to break up a fight between two other people. On Sunday and Monday nights, large groups of people gathered in downtown Kenosha, protesting the killings. On both nights, peaceful protests later devolved to rioting that caused extensive damage to the city, both downtown and in the Uptown neighborhood on the city’s near west side. Tuesday night, after a Facebook post from a local militia organizerdrew dozens of people with guns downtown to counter the protesters, one of those who showed up shot and killed two people and maimed a third before fleeing. On Thursday, Kyle Rittenhouse, seventeen, of Antioch, Illinois, wascharged in Lake County, Ill., with two counts of homicide and one of attempted homicide, along with two counts of recklessly endangering safety and one of illegally possessing a firearm, an AR-15-style rifle that Rittenhouse had brought with him to the scene. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Friday. Video footage showed Rittenhouse walking about with his weapon and police giving water bottles to some of the armed people present, at one point telling them, “We appreciate you guys.”Other footage show the shooting incidents, and in still other videos, Rittenhouse is seen walking toward police after the shootings with his hands up, only to be apparently ignored. He’s alleged to have fled home to Illinois, where he was arrested Wednesday. At anews conferenceon Wednesday, reporters questioned Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth and Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis about their officers’ handling of events Tuesday night before and after the shooting. Beth told reporters sheriff’s deputies would share water with anyone who they came across; neither he nor Miskinis addressed questions about the video conversations between police and the weapons-toting people mingling in the area. Beth defended the apparent disregard of the shooter immediately after the killings, saying that officers were likely distracted by the chaos of the circumstances. Miskinis also responded to questions about the shootings by saying that “a seventeen-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, was involved in the use of firearms . . . to resolve whatever conflict was in place. The result of it was two people are dead.” He also said that “everybody involved was out after the curfew,” and that “had persons not been involved in violation of that, perhaps the situation that unfolded would not have happened.”In a joint statement, the ACLU’s Wisconsin and national offices said Miskinis effectively “blamed the unidentified victims in Tuesday night’s shooting for their own death.”The ACLU statement criticized Beth’s response while also citing comments the sheriff made two years ago after the arrests of five shoplifting suspects after a pursuit that ended in a car crash with minor injuries. At the time Beth said there should be “warehouses where we put these people who have been deemed to be no longer an asset.” (Beth laterapologized for the remarksafter backlash from several local groups including the NAACP.)Wisconsin ACLU executive director Chris Ott stated Thursday of Beth and Miskinis: “Their actions uphold and defend white supremacy, while demonizing people who were murdered for exercising their First Amendment rights and speaking out against police violence.” Ott called their resignations “the only way to rectify these actions.”If the two do not resign, the ACLU stated, Evers should fire Beth, and Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian should demand that the city’s police and fire commission fire Miskinis. The civil rights groups’ statement was signed by national leaders of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund as well as the NAACP, the National Action Network, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Urban League. It expressed outrage at videos from Tuesday night showing Kenosha Police officers “exhibiting camaraderie toward militia members—who were out in violation of curfew before the shootings—and also seemingly ignoring protesters who tried to identify the shooter.” Miskinis “blamed protesters for the killings,” the statement said, calling that “another example of the racially disparate treatment that Americans across the country have been protesting against since May and for decades before.”It called on Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul to “immediately investigate and prosecute these killings, the shooting of Mr. Blake, and the increasingly pervasive issue of armed white militia members confronting and attacking protesters demanding police accountability. They must also demand the immediate removal of Chief Miskinis.”The statement also called for holding Facebook “accountable for its inaction” as militia groups used it to organize.

161,Is Cuba’s Communist Party Finally Losing Its Hold on the Country?,1.0,37.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-cubas-communist-party-finally-losing-its-hold-on-the-country,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,25,"On Sunday, July 11th, the world took note of a historic event inCuba, as thousands of citizens took to the streets to protest against the government. Many shouted “”—Fatherland and Life—the title of a banned but extremely popular rap song that riffs on a slogan coined by the lateFidel Castro: “Fatherland or Death.” Many also shouted “Libertad!”—Freedom—and similar phrases that are not only heretical but, when shouted in protest, illegal in Cuba, where the Communist Party is the sole legal arbiter of political life. The uprising began in San Antonio de los Baños, a sleepy town near Havana that had been hit by a recent string of long power cuts. But Cubans across the island have become frustrated by their government’s inability to provide them with even such basic amenities as food and medicine, amid a slow vaccine rollout and spikinginfection rates. The protests metastasized quickly, as the news and images of what was happening shot across Facebook, Twitter, and other messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp. Within hours, there were protests in as many as sixty towns and cities, from Havana to Santiago, at the southeastern end of the island, five hundred miles away. During the past decade, despite long-standing official restrictions on the media and most other sources of independent information, Cuba’s government has gradually allowed its citizens access to cell phones and the Internet, both of which are now in widespread use. Just as skeptical Party apparatchiks had feared, this technology is proving to be a threat to their order. As Abraham Jimenez Enoa, a young Cuban friend who reported on the protests, told me this week, “The only certainty right now is that the people of this country want a change, and the Internet is helping us fight for it.”No sooner had the protests spread than an official crackdown also got under way. As black-uniformed special-forces units, police, and stick-wielding plainclothes agents were deployed, new images emerged showing policemen beating protesters and dragging them away. There was also some violence and vandalism carried out by demonstrators: shops were looted and a couple of police cars were overturned. Just hours later, in a bid to show that the government had regained control, President Miguel Díaz-Canel was shown on television walking down a street in San Antonio de los Baños with a security entourage, and no demonstrators in sight. He later appeared on camera to denounce the protests as a counterrevolutionary measure organized and financed by the United States, and he called on “Cuba’s revolutionaries” to “combat” the miscreants. By nightfall on Sunday, a shocked silence had fallen over the island. Access to the Internet was restricted indefinitely. Even so, news trickled out over the next few days of deepening repression by security forces and of widespread detentions, reportedly including the jailing of several prominent dissidents and government critics. As leaders around the world condemned the crackdown—President Bidencalled Cuba “a failed state”—Díaz-Canel seemed to reconsider his more bellicose rhetoric, and, on Wednesday, July 14th, he appeared on state-controlled television to express his hope that “hatred does not take possession of the Cuban soul, which is one of goodness, solidarity, dedication, affection and love.” Directing his comments to “the Cuban people,” he said he wanted to see them enjoying “social peace and tranquillity, showing respect and solidarity toward one another and other needy people of the world, and to save Cuba in order to continue growing, dreaming, and achieving the greatest possible prosperity.” He spoke at length, largely blaming the unrest on “an enormous media campaign against Cuba” and a “deliberate campaign of unconventional warfare” waged by the United States. As for the “adversities” that Cuba’s enemies had exploited to provoke the protests, he said, these were the fault of the long-standing U. S. trade embargo, “the blockade.” Nevertheless, for the first time in the sixty-two-year history of the revolution, the notion that the Communist Party enjoys the immutable support of the citizens had been shattered, and, more than any other time since the end of the Cold War, its ability to remain in control was thrown into doubt. Joe Garcia, a Cuban American and a former Democratic congressman from Miami who was recently in Cuba and often serves as aninformal intermediarybetween the U. S. and Cuban governments, said that Díaz-Canel, a protégé of Raúl Castro, had stumbled in his first big test since becoming President, in 2018. (Earlier this year, he also became the head of the Communist Party.) “For the first time in six decades, the Cubans have seen a leader blink,” Garcia said. “This problem isn’t going away. They’ve got a health crisis and an economic crisis that their government has been unable to deal with, and telling the Cubans that it’s all the fault of the embargo is not something that’s going to fill their stomachs. Blaming the protests on the Americans, like he did, begs credibility. For the sake of argument, let’s say that the C. I. A. did it. That either means a massive intelligence failure on the part of Cuba’s intelligence services, which are supposed to be among thebest in the world, or else the C. I. A. just got a lot better at what it does. Protests in sixty towns and cities across Cuba? Come on.”The last time major protests broke out in Cuba was in August of 1994, and they occurred only in Havana. In that pre-Internet and pre-smartphone age, demonstrations were easier to contain—and Fidel Castro was alive and still very much in command of the nation he had ruled since seizing power, in 1959. It was the fourth year of the so-called Special Period, which Castro proclaimed after the Soviet Union’s collapse triggered a precipitous end to three decades of the generous subsidies that had kept his regime, and the economy, afloat. The U. S. S. R.’s demise was also a crisis for the global communist ideal, but, while most of the socialist regimes of the era also collapsed, or else quickly adapted to the new circumstances, Castro doubled down. Vowing to never give up on socialism, he said the Cubans would go it alone, if necessary, and survive. They did survive, but by the summer of 1994, conditions had become harsh. Fuel, food, and medicine were scarce, electrical blackouts frequent, and feelings of despair widespread. Finally, in August, riots exploded along Havana’s Malecón, the seaside promenade that runs past the cramped and dilapidated neighborhoods of Centro and Old Havana, where ill feeling had been festering after several attempts by residents to flee the island by sea had been thwarted by authorities, and resulted in a number of violent deaths. When Castro was alerted to the commotion, he rushed to the Malecón, where a large mob of men and youths had assembled. They shouted anti-government slogans and picked up rocks and masonry from building sites, apparently preparing to go on a rampage. Upon sight of Castro, however, the rioters first fell silent and then began to cheer him, and soon order was restored. It was a remarkable moment, which has since found a prime place inmythology. But it wasn’t only Castro’s presence that stunned the 1994 rioters into submission. Hundreds of rough-and-ready loyalists drawn from élite Communist Party worker’s battalions, wielding clubs and lengths of rebar, were trucked into nearby backstreets for the purpose of intimidating any protesters who did not stand down. I was living in Havana at the time, and that day I tried to approach the Malecón. As I did, plainclothes agents in the crowd around me stopped a car with an anti-Castro sign, dragged the driver out, and beat him before taking him away. People around me watched in silence and then moved away. Just then, the trucks full of workers came roaring past. That night, Castro went on television and announced that any Cuban who wanted to leave the island by sea could so. For the next three weeks, some thirty-five thousand people built improvised boats and rafts and set sail for Key West and Miami. It was an embarrassing episode for Castro, but, as so many times before, he came out the ultimate winner, first by removing a good number of troublesome malcontents from the island, and then by forcing President Bill Clinton to deal with the crisis. Washington, fearful of another exodus like the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which had overwhelmed Miami with more than a hundred thousand Cubans, agreed to give residency to most of the, as the rafters were called, and to double the number of legal Cuban émigrés it allowed in the country at the time, from ten thousand to twenty thousand yearly. Díaz-Canel’s walk through San Antonio de los Baños on July 11th seemed a clear attempt to emulate Fidel’s iconic 1994 Malecón appearance, and his follow-up television appearance appeared similarly intended to project the power of command. But Díaz-Canel’s appearances only underscored the differences between him and Fidel Castro—and the changing times in which we live. Even if Castro’s offer to Cubans was brutal—“Leave, if you wish,” he said—it did provide a way out. Díaz-Canel, on the other hand, offered Cubans no solutions, only repression, followed by accusations of whose fault it all was: the Americans. “If Fidel had been alive, he’d have done that, and then fed them, too,” Garcia said. “But Díaz-Canel can’t.”Theparadoxfor Díaz-Canel, who is said by people who know him personally to want to be a reformer, is that he is boxed in by circumstances. Having been embarrassed by the Cuban uprising, he must show strength in order to preserve order. But to placate the public’s rising frustrations, he must also signal moderation, which he has belatedly tried to do; in a second address, on Wednesday, he acknowledged that his government bore responsibility for the issues that had sparked the protests, including both the shortages and the rising prices of food and medicine. But to call for dialogue, or else to “open up,” as many outsiders—the European Union and Pope Francis, among others—have urged him to do, could telegraph weakness to the boldest Cuban dissidents, and provoke new demonstrations. In any event, it seems a certainty that the unrest in Cuba has not ended. So far, despite widespread expectation that the Biden Administration might engage in a renewed diplomatic opening, it has taken a tepid approach toward Cuba, even leaving in place many restrictions and punitive measures imposed during the Trump years; these include a last-minute listing of Cuba as a state sponsor of terror, which penalizes U. S. and foreign companies seeking to invest in the island, as well as restrictions on financial remittances and travel to the island by Americans. Earlier this year, Biden’s newly appointed national-security adviser for Western Hemisphere affairs, Juan S. Gonzalez,told methat Cuba was not a front-burner issue, given the President’s need to tackle other major crises at home and abroad. Officials have also alluded to the challenges of finding a consensus for possible gestures to Cuba on Capitol Hill, where the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez, is a Democrat from New Jersey, but also a Cuban American, and closer to the Republicans than to the progressive wing of his own party when it comes to Cuba. It is this political reality, along with the fallout that the Administration could incur from conservative Cuban Americans in Florida in next year’s congressional elections—and particularly in the Democrats’ bid to unseat Senator Marco Rubio—that has effectively kept the Administration from taking decisive action. Garcia told me that it was his understanding that the Administration had been planning some good-will gestures to Cuba, including opening up remittances again and easing travel restrictions, but, since the uprising, making any such blandishments looked difficult. “To do so now,” he said, could appear to Cuban Americans in Florida as “appeasement.”To avoid a crisis of increasing proportions, both leaders must find a way to persuade their more intransigent allies that the best thing for Cuba, and for the United States, is renewed engagement, and also a credible and sustained opening within Cuba that can address the needs of its citizens and reduce the stresses that now threaten the island’s stability. If the Cuban Communist Party wants to survive, its denizens will have to face up to the reality that its days of unquestioned hegemony are over, and it will have to agree to share power with Cubans who have other points of view, and to give them an equal opportunity to find solutions to the problems of Cuba that they have proved unable to address. The United States, for its part, should make it abundantly clear that it stands ready to assist Cuba and its people, but that it is opposed to violence and bloodshed, both of the kind the Cuban government has used against its protesters and the kind some Cubans, mostly from the safe distance of Miami, are calling for against their government. For the first time in living memory, Cubans on and off the island need to find a spirit of democratic compromise to find a common way forward.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0903621482683982,0.443366747835498,2910,3,The New Yorker

S. Look, I understand, okay? Not as many people have had the experience I had of living under unbridled, unmasked Marxist power, so you don’t understand their myths and how they actually connect with reality. Oh, you’re starting to see it, as the left drops its masks, but it’s not the same as seeing them running around, showing their behinds and expounding the craziest theories during your formative years, when your eye is unsparing. There is a reason it was a little boy who cried “the king goes naked.”Let’s start with what the left thinks they are doing:They think they’re bringing about their utopia, their heaven on Earth. They have been programmed – indoctrinated, really – from birth via the media, education, entertainment, and – heaven have mercy – even churches and synagogues into believing what amounts to a heretical Christian sect. There are many variations of the Communist mythos, mostly Marx, but with its roots firmly in Rosseau. They range from racial ones (one to each race) to feminist ones. There are probably others I haven’t even heard about. The myth goes like this: in the beginning, there was no capitalism (the cult’s quaint name for any free buying and selling or trade. (This is why they call monarchies capitalism or private property.) This was the dawn of man, the perfect state of humanity. Because there was no property there was no envy and no crime. Man (and particularly woman) lived in a time of innocence. In this perfect utopia – feminist version – women ruled, sex was free, babies were brought up communally, and every woman could do as she pleased. In the racial version, the poor now-oppressed race were the rulers, and therefore there was no property, etc., etc. No crime. But then theserpentevil white race showed up. Or males rebelled. Whatever. Because, you know they didn’t like paradise. And they instituted private property and “capitalism” and since then there’s been this great struggle by the good to overturn the evil. In the end, the good prevails, they confiscate and redistribute all private property and reeducate the people maimed by living under the unjust capitalist system and we go back to living in a utopia. The liniments of the story should sound familiar if you come from a Judeo-Christian background. It’s the story of creation, fall, and eventual world-redemption, only stripped of a creator, any power superior to the Kommissars and the idea of personal redemption. In fact, in this heresy the individual doesn’t matter at all, only the group he belongs to. I doubt any Marxist has been told this story as such, but I promise you it is in the background of a lot of their books, from “non-fiction” to novels. The idea, bonkers as it is and as easy to dismantle as it is, is in the background of their thoughts. These ideas have been in circulation for a long time, and I guarantee if you read your kids’ school books and look for hints of this you will find it. Particularly in history. I was fortunate (?) to have relatives from many professional backgrounds and to be a compulsive reader. For instance, my sister-in-law in Portugal is an M. D. and studied from American books. Her psychiatric manuals were full of the idea that mental illness was brought about by the unnatural state of “capitalism” and therefore if you abolish capitalism, there will be no mental illness. This, incidentally, was a lot of the idea behind the scenes of the de-institutionalization movement, which closed madhouses and filled our streets with mentally ill homeless. These books, in the seventies, suggested very strongly that America kept as many political prisoners in madhouses as the USSR because capitalism caused madness, which only proved the mad people were sane, since they were rejecting capitalism. The origins of this devil’s brew go back all the way to the crazy theories of noble savages, overlaid with Marx and then weaponized against healthy societies by the USSR agitprop (agitation and propaganda, the only thing they ever did well). Now that you have the decoder ring, it is probably starting to make sense why Black Lives Matter immediately jumps to “abolish capitalism”; why feminism jumps to “abolish capitalism”; and why Hollywood has a love affair with making the homeless the repositories of wisdom. Once your eyes are open you’ll see it everywhere. Which is good, because this stupid mythos, this tissue of half-baked wishful thinking and the toddler’s scream of “it’s not fair,” has permeated society to such an extent that you’re looking at the current spastic insanity from the left as they are. Yes, I know, a lot of what they’re doing echoes revolutions from the French to the Russian, to a lot of other revolutions throughout the 20thcentury. I know. I lived through one of the later ones (though this being Portugal – basically the D&D alignment of chaotic neutral with borders – it was the international socialists rebelling against the national socialists). And all of them have the same “touch-feel” and the same incidents. For a long time now I’ve been telling people to watch for a pregnant woman being shot and becoming a martyr of the revolution. If they can manage it, she’ll be black and Latin too. It’s one of the touchstones of the kabuki theater revolutions of the left. What you should ask yourself, actually, and give an honest answer to, is how these revolutions can all be so similar to each other, step by step and touch by touch in completely different times and societies. And if you answer honestly, you’ll realize it’s because these events are being staged. In the cargo-cult religion of the left, if they do these things this way, the power will devolve to them, utopia will be installed, and everyone will be happy, even the evil bad rightists after they are re-educated. That pregnant woman who will get shot “by federal forces” any day now? That is universal, because – I think – if the law officers don’t provide her, her comrades will. (If you have a pregnant daughter stupid enough to gambol withProAntifa, warn her. She won’t believe you, but your conscience will be clean if she’s the chosen victim.) As are other things, like the evil, mean authorities putting down the “peaceful” protesters and sparking the final rebellion. There are only two things standing in the way of their sparking their revolution. They’re blind to them, but we should not be. The first is that there isn’t a vast mass of the “dispossessed” who are natural communists and will “ignite” into violent revolution and take over, given the slightest encouragement. No, I’m serious, Obama believed in this with all his heart (that poor man is an echo-boomer and a red-diaper baby and so his head is full of excrement to an extent no sane person can believe). Hence his telling bankers he was standing between them and the mob (that Obama was sure was just ready to ignite). Hence, the crazy stupidity of Fast And Furious, which posited that if American guns were found at the site of Mexican cartel crimes, the (oppressed, natch) people of America would rise up and demand gun control in solidarity with their oppressed brethren. And if you look closely, you’ll see the links between Obama and Occupy Wall Street, which they believed was the spark that would send the 99% up in revolution. Only… it failed because the 99% are not “natural communists” wishing to throw off the yoke of capitalism. You need to be exquisitely indoctrinated to believe they are. The second thing they have wrong, and what I urge you to realize as soon as you can:They are not the “oppressed.” No, I don’t mean by that that there is no oppression in our society. Any human society has people with more power than others. It’s just that the groups and ideas that the left and their violent lap-wolves Antifa have cast as victims aren’t the victims. In fact, their philosophy—the Marxist ideology they propound and the craziness behind it—has been in control of society, on top, since at least the seventies. Being a leftist is a mark of being “good” and also well educated. The same way that in Elizabethan England poor mad Christopher Marlowe wrote his stage directions in Latin, to show that he had had an excellent education and deserved respect, so too the leftists of today pepper their works, from movies to TV to books to art, with odes to the oppressed and paeans to the coming revolution. It’s how you show you’re high-class and exquisitely educated. All the old families, all the rich, all the captains of industry and power brokers signal left as hard as they can, because that’s where the power is—and in my field, the awards, the professorships, and the acclaim. Heck, remember what Trump signaled just to be allowed to do business. And that’s why I’ve been watching in amusement the left going through the motions of kabuki theater revolution against a society… they control. If you go read the history of the French Revolution and probably the Russian (it’s been a long time since I actually read on it) you’ll find this is a typical move of the out-of-touch “ruling” and “powerful” class as they start to lose control. They will proclaim themselves the defenders of the poor, fighting on behalf of the oppressed, their only defense, etc. It never works. It. Never. Works. Louis XVI putting a revolutionary coquade atop his powdered wig didn’t save his head from falling to the guillotine. Real revolutions, not the left’s pretend theater, are not “and the people rose up.” That’s usually the last stage. Real revolutions are caused by living conditions/ways of making a living changing so dramatically that ideology must follow. Communism and socialism were – though heads-on-pants insane – well suited to the mentality of mass production and mass movements. They’re fish out of water in the 21stcentury. Which is why every move they make turns against them. Their heads are full of a society that no longer exists. I’m not saying they’re not a danger, particularly in the areas – geographic and social – they control. What I’m saying is that they’re losing that control. The ramping-up insanity you see is partly their desperate need to keep control and partly the fact that their prophecy has failed twice in two different flavors right before their eyes. Obama was supposed to usher in a non-white utopia. Well… that didn’t happen. And then when the feminists were about to usher in their feminist utopia, it was snatched from their aching hands. Their art works and entertainment filled with their gospel truth bring less and less money/acclaim/etc. Their only chance, as they see it, is to bring about utopia now. But they’re looking at it backwards. And if they keep on destroying and burning and looting in the hopes the vast “oppressed” hordes who want communism will rise up, this will all end in “Aristo, aristo a la lanterne.”Stay aware. Stay calm. Don’t get caught up in their play. This is their last push. And if history is any guide, it will fail. The only question now is how high a butcher’s bill will we have to pay.",0,Problematic,0.042518876018876,0.5004873444873443,2602,0,PJ Media
163,Some States Curb Public Access To COVID-19 Statistics Amid Uptick In Cases,-3.67,41.67,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-covid-statistics-cases-hospitalizations-deaths_n_60fc26b4e4b00c1de0a20b10,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Several states scaled back their reporting of COVID-19 statistics this month just as cases across the country started to skyrocket, depriving the public of real-time information on outbreaks, cases, hospitalizations and deaths in their communities. The shift to weekly instead of daily reporting in Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota marked a notable shift during a pandemic in which coronavirus dashboards have become a staple for Americans closely tracking case counts and trends to navigate a crisis that has killed more than 600,000 people in the U. S. In Nebraska, the state actually stopped reporting on the virus altogether for two weeks after Gov. Pete Ricketts declared an end to the official virus emergency, forcing news reporters to file public records requests or turn to national websites that track state data to learn about COVID statistics. The state backtracked two weeks later and came up with a weekly site that provides some basic numbers. Other governments have gone the other direction and released more information, with Washington, D. C., this week adding a dashboard on breakthrough cases to show the number of residents who contracted the virus after getting vaccines. Many states have recently gone to reporting virus numbers only on weekdays. When Florida changed the frequency of its virus reporting earlier this month, officials said it made sense given the decreasing number of cases and the increasing number of people being vaccinated. Cases started soaring soon after, and Florida earlier this week made up up one-fifth of the country’s new coronavirus infections. As a result, Florida’s weekly releases — typically done on Friday afternoons — have consequences for the country’s understanding of the current summer surge, with no statewide COVID stats coming out of the virus hotspot for six days a week. In Florida’s last two weekly reports, the number of new cases shot up from 23,000 to 45,000 and then 73,000 on Friday, an average of more than 10,000 day. Hospitals are starting to run out of space in parts of the state. With cases rising,Democratsand other critics have urged state officials and Gov. Ron DeSantis to resume daily outbreak updates.“There was absolutely no reason to eliminate the daily updates beyond an effort to pretend like there are no updates,” said state Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from the Orlando area. The trend of reducing data reporting has alarmed infectious disease specialists who believe that more information is better during a pandemic. People have come to rely on state virus dashboards to help make decisions about whether to attend large gatherings or wear masks in public, and understanding the level of risk in the community affects how people respond to virus restrictions and calls to get vaccinated.“We know that showing the data to others actually is important because the actions that businesses take, the actions that schools take, the actions that civic leaders take, the actions that community leaders take, the actions that each of us individually take are all influenced by our perception of what the risk is out there,” said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who leads the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. But reporting the numbers on a weekly basis still allows people to see the overall trends while smoothing out some of he day-to-day variations that come from the way cases are reported and not the actual number of new cases. And experts have long advised that it makes sense to pay more attention to the seven-day rolling average of new cases because the numbers can vary widely from one day to the next. And Florida health officials say that they have not curtailed the sharing of data with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maintaining daily updates on the virus does require significant resources for states. For instance, Kansas went to reporting virus numbers three times a week in May because the state health department said providing daily statistics consumed too much time for its already overwhelmed staff. In Nebraska, officials decided that continuing to update the virus dashboard daily wasn’t the best use of state resources now partly because there had been a steady decline in the number of views of the website indicating less interest in the numbers, spokeswoman Olga Dack said. The state could return to providing daily updates if the governor’s office decided that was needed, she said.“Now that Nebraska is back to normal, some of the staff that has been dedicated to the dashboard has been able to focus on some of the other important issues,” Dack said. State health departments have a long history of providing the public regular updates on other diseases like flu and West Nile, but those viruses have none of the political baggage associated with COVID-19. In Florida, a former health department employee was fired last year after publicly suggesting that managers wanted her to manipulate information on coronavirus statistics to paint a rosier picture. The employee, Rebekah Jones, did not allege any tampering with data, but her comments sowed doubts about the reliability of the metrics. Infectious disease specialist Dr. David Brett-Major said that for many people, national websites such as the one run by the CDC can be a good source of data on the latest state trends and weekly updates could be OK. The World Health Organization often uses weekly updates, but he said they do that for practical data management reasons, not political ones. He said the message Nebraska sent when it ended its dashboard that the state emergency was over and conditions were returning to normal was troubling.“The main problem is that it reflects a disinterest in pandemic risk management,” said Brett-Major, with the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, said part of the problem is that public health officials generally don’t have sophisticated data systems so it is more labor intensive to produce the daily dashboards. Even though public health agencies have money for operations at a time when pandemic government spending is flush, they haven’t necessarily had the chance to upgrade.“It would be great if daily reporting could be made widely available, but public health would have to be funded better to do that and right now that is just not the case,” said Hamilton. And even in states where virus numbers aren’t being reported publicly every day health officials are still looking at the latest data, Hamilton said. But at a time when the delta variant is, in the words of the CDC director, “spreading with incredible efficiency,” Bibbins-Domingo said it is important that everyone can see the latest trends and understand the risks.“Even if we know that they are available to decisionmakers on a daily basis, there is considerable value to providing the data to the public,” she said.

The Trump administration is weighing withholding some aid to Ethiopia over a Nile dam projectthat has severely strained its relationship with downstream countries Sudan and Egypt, six officials and congressional aides familiar with the matter told Foreign Policy. The massive dam, Africa’s biggest, has become a flash point of geopolitical tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia, with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi hinting that his country could use military force to halt the project. Many in Egypt fear the dam could threaten its water supplies. But some U. S. officials said the project has also fueled divisions and confusion over policy within the U. S. government, ever since Sisi asked President Donald Trump to help mediate negotiations over the dam last year. U. S. participation in four-way talks over the dam earlier this year, led by the Treasury Department, helped advance talks. However, Ethiopia refused to sign a final agreement. Now there’s growing concern that the Trump administration is putting its thumb on the scales to favor Egypt at the expense of Ethiopia—even as new signs of progress emerge in negotiations.“The Trump administration has gotten it into its head that it has to take Egypt’s side on this,” said one U. S. official familiar with the matter. “Nobody in the White House seems to be looking at this through the Africa lens and its impact on Ethiopia, which is equally important,” the official added. “This is just shooting ourselves in the foot.”A Treasury Department spokesperson said the administration is working as an impartial mediator. “The sole objective of the U. S. government has been, and continues to be, to assist Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan in reaching a fair agreement on the filling and operation of [the dam] that addresses the interests of all three countries,” the spokesperson said. On Tuesday, Ethiopia said the three countries had made “major” progress on their dispute in talks brokered by the African Union, and they agreed to more negotiations aimed at a comprehensive solution on water issues around the dam. The announcement sends a positive signal to some U. S. officials and observers who feared that if Ethiopia continued filling the reservoir behind the dam without an agreement with Egypt, regional tensions could boil over into a military confrontation. Two administration officials who spoke toForeign Policycast the announcement as an indication that negotiators have laid the groundwork for a final agreement. “The Trump administration’s engagement has helped Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan make more progress in negotiations over the last nine months, than the last nine years,” said one. “The considerable work by Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan over the last nine months shows it is possible to come up with a fair and balanced agreement if there is a commitment among all to do so.”In the “major common understanding” reached Tuesday by Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan, the three countries agreed to have more technical discussions on the pace of the reservoir fill and drought mitigation measures with an eye toward inking a final agreement. Several U. S. officials said that the Trump administration could move forward with aid cuts to Ethiopia if negotiations hit another impasse and the sides can’t reach a final deal. The idea of a massive hydroelectric project on the upper Nile River, in the Ethiopian highlands, has been a dream since the days of Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie in the 1960s. But it wasn’t until 2011 that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam got underway in earnest—and ever since, relations with the downstream countries Sudan and Egypt have been fraught. For Ethiopia, whose citizens bankrolled the $4.6 billion project, the dam is not just a way to provide electricity to a power-starved corner of the continent but has become a point of national pride and emblematic of the country’s ambitions as a regional power. Though the U. S. State Department traditionally handles diplomatic issues, Trump abruptly tapped Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to lead mediation efforts during a phone call with Sisi last year. Some U. S. officials said that has led to growing divisions between Treasury and State and confusion at embassies in Africa over how Washington is handling the negotiations. Others dismissed this narrative, insisting that the two agencies were coordinating closely. “Secretary Mnuchin and Secretary Pompeo have worked in close coordination throughout this process, as have the teams at Treasury and State,” the Treasury spokesperson said. Foreign Policywas told that the State Department has been involved in every meeting on the issue since Washington began facilitating negotiations from November 2019 through this February. Ethiopia made it clear that it would continue the dam project despite lingering disagreements with other Nile-dependent countries, and in fact it began filling the massive reservoir behind the dam this month, taking advantage of Ethiopia’s rainy season. Egyptians fear Ethiopia will fill the dam over a period of just a few years, which could choke off water supplies that Egypt needs downstream, especially for agriculture. The Ethiopian government says the pace of filling shouldn’t affect Egypt’s allotment of water, and it further maintains that Egypt has used more Nile water than it’s entitled to for decades. Rising Water Levels in the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam ReservoirImages from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 satellite show expanding water levels between July 26 and July 11 behind the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile in northwestern Ethiopia. The region has recently seen above-average rainfall. Satellite image ©2020 Maxar TechnologiesThis month, the Treasury Department asked the State Department for a rundown of all U. S. aid pledged to Ethiopia, a move three officials said is aimed at withholding some or all of the non-humanitarian aid as leverage if the negotiations stall. Any decision to alter or withhold U. S. aid, however, would rest with the White House or Congress. It’s not clear what specific aid would be withheld if the administration carried out the plan under consideration, several officials said. One point of leverage under discussion is projects from the U. S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) that could spur up to $5 billion in investments, two officials said. In fiscal year 2019, the United States provided a total of $824.3 million in assistance to Ethiopia, of which $497.3 million was humanitarian aid, a State Department spokesman said. Officials stressed that no aid funding for humanitarian needs would be held up. The spokesman declined to comment further on interagency deliberations. The White House did not respond to request for comment. Several U. S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some at the State Department and U. S. Agency for International Development opposed withholding aid from Ethiopia, fearing it would damage already fraying relations between Addis Ababa and Washington at a precarious point in Ethiopia’s political transition. The killing of a prominent Ethiopian singer late last month sparked a surge in protests and fueled religious and ethnic tensions in the country, marking one of the biggest challenges yet for the country’s stability under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. One official said the State Department is “slow walking” the request from Treasury. Three other officials gave conflicting accounts of whether the Treasury Department is cutting the State Department out of talks: Two said this was the case, and even top U. S. diplomats stationed in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan are cut out of talks. The third official said this was untrue and reiterated that the negotiating teams and U. S. embassies are coordinating closely. When approached for comment on whether DFC projects to Ethiopia are in consideration of being held up, a DFC spokeswoman said: “We have worked closely with Ethiopia on key reforms to advance competitive, open markets, which helps position Ethiopia for a significant DFC commitment that would catalyze billions in financing from the private sector. Private sector investment would help create jobs and increase economic opportunity in the country.”In recent months, Egypt has tried to exert pressure on Ethiopia to halt filling the dam both through the Trump administration and through meetings at the United Nations Security Council. Fraught diplomatic negotiations between Egypt and Ethiopia have for years centered on how quickly Ethiopia would fill the dam. Egypt has pushed Ethiopia to slowly fill the dam over the course of a decade or more—which could delay the dam’s provision of large amounts of electricity—while Ethiopia pushed to fill the dam in three years. Another lingering point of contention between the two countries is what steps Ethiopia might take to alter the filling schedule in case of drought, to ensure that a sudden spell of dry years during the filling process doesn’t leave Egypt starved for water.is a diplomacy and national security reporter at. Twitter:@RobbieGramerRead MoreBut talks in Washington haven’t yet solved the trickiest questions still looming over the dam’s impact on countries downstream. Ethiopia and Egypt are at odds over a Nile dam. Washington should be helping them compromise, rather than doing Cairo’s bidding. Talks are stalled over how to deal with the impact of a $5 billion dam that could threaten Egypt’s lifeblood.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0601053708196565,0.4518707482993198,1920,3,Foreign Policy
166,"Biden, Section 230, and the Response to Political Extremism",2.67,45.67,https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-section-230-response-political-extremism,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,18,"Last year, Biden called for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to be revoked. The law, which Biden voted for in 1996, protects interactive computer services from being held liable for the vast majority of third party content. In recent years, the law has become a popular target of conservative lawmakers, who allege that the largest social media companies implement content moderation policies that stifle conservative speech. Biden and some other members of the Democratic Party have different concerns. Biden cited online misinformation as motivating his call for Section 230 repeal, “There is no editorial impact at all on Facebook. None. None whatsoever. It’s irresponsible. It’s totally irresponsible.” Bruce Reed, Biden’s chief of staff from 2011 to 2013 and current deputy White House chief of staff, has expressed concerns about Section 230, noting that the law “hurts our kids and is doing possibly irreparable damage to our democracy.”Harris supported the most recent amendment to Section 230, The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) and Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) package. SESTA/FOSTA added content associated with sex trafficking to the list of Section 230 exceptions. While no doubt well‐​intended, the law resulted in harmful unintended consequences. When considering Section 230 amendments as a means to address the harms associated with online speech White House officials and their allies in Congress should proceed with caution. Section 230 may look like a tempting target for amendment, but changes to Section 230 will not eliminate harmful content and may entrench market incumbents. The Capitol StormingConcerns about misinformation are bound to be more pronounced in the wake of the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol. During attempts by Trump supporters to disrupt Congress’ certification of the Electoral College vote members of the mob that broke into the Capitol shared images and video of the intrusion widely on social media. The shared content revealed that those who stormed the Capitol included believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, white supremacists, and many others. Such content appears to vindicate the concerns from Reed and other Biden allies who believe that Section 230 is doing harm to American democracy. After all, online speech appears to be radicalizing millions of Americans, some of whom have demonstrated a willingness to engage in violence. Before determining whether Section 230 amendments are the best means to address such speech we should keep in mind that racist and conspiratorial content is protected by the First Amendment. Social media networks that cater to or are tolerant of such content are open to accusations of being socially irresponsible, but they are not running afoul of the First Amendment or Section 230. Many of the largest social media companies have faced criticism over their treatment of conspiratorial and political extremist content for years. Shortly after the Capitol storming Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube took steps to remove a wide range of content, including accounts run by former President Trump. For many, these content moderation decisions were too little too late. Section 230 and Extremist ContentLegislative attempts to condition Section 230 protections on tackling extremist speech will quickly run into a stubborn constitutional barrier. The First Amendment prevents the government from compelling a private company from favoring one category of legal speech over another. Accordingly, a Section 230 amendment that makes the law’s liability protection contingent on the moderation of legal but awful speech would be unlikely to survive a constitutional challenge. Social media firms are well within their right to remove extremist speech, and Section 230 prevents them from being sued when they choose to do so. In addition, social media firms can host conspiracy theories as well as extremist content. Not long after the attack on the Capitol, AWS severed ties with Parler, a social media site used by many of the Capitol insurgents. Apple and Google ceased hosting Parler on the Android and iOS app stores. Shortly after the Capitol attack the most popular social media firms took action against content associated with the incident and claim of election fraud. This content moderation and the action AWS, Google, and Apple took against Parler prompted encrypted chat services Signal and Telegram to experience a surge in new users. The move to encrypted services is not a surprise. Encrypted services allow for users to communicate with one another without the service or law enforcement being privy to the communications. These services are not ideal social media replacements. Social media platforms are designed such that users can express themselves to a wide audience. Encrypted services do allow for group chats, but they cannot replicate the social media experience of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Unintended ConsequencesLawmakers could amend Section 230 in such a way that it would encourage social media platforms to be more aggressive when it comes to moderating content. As I have noted before, Boston University Law School’s Danielle Citron and the Brookings Institution’s Ben Wittes have suggested making Section 230 protections contingent on platforms taking “reasonable steps” to address unlawful uses of their services. In such an environment, social media firms would probably be willing to embrace false positives in an attempt to remain in compliance. But as I wrote not long after the attack on the Capitol:If such an amendment were enacted, interactive computer services would have an incentive to embrace false positives in order to ensure that they don’t run afoul of Section 230. Awful but lawful speech could be stifled because sites hosting third‐​party content would seek to avoid bankruptcy via a tsunami of lawsuits. Some might ask, “What’s wrong with services having an incentive to err on the side of caution when it comes to borderline illegal speech?” The answer is that such an environment is likely to be anti‐​competitive, with powerful market incumbents best positioned to adapt to how courts and lawmakers interpret “reasonable steps.” While concerns about online political extremism are likely to prompt lawmakers to seek carrots and sticks for social media companies, we should keep in mind that Section 230 amendments could ultimately entrench the companies so many are criticizing. Response to Extremist SpeechIt would be inappropriate for the president and lawmakers to look to Section 230 amendments when thinking about how to address the spread of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extremist political content. Almost all of such content is legal under the First Amendment. The most popular social media sites have taken action to address harmful content. But even if these moderation efforts were 100 percent effective such content would find a home on encrypted services or social media sites designed with such content in mind. The rise of extremist political content is troubling, especially when it leads to violence. Amending Section 230 to address this content is likely to run into constitutional barriers or result in market incumbents improving their market positions.",3,Reliable,0.0727942928631001,0.4169595694825054,1449,3,Cato Institute

Head/hands/feet/back…""BuzzFeed StaffIn the first rotation of the competition on Tuesday, Biles went to do a vault with 2.5 twists but, appearing dazed and disoriented as she flipped in the air, seemed to bail on the skill midway through. Instead, she completed 1.5 twists and nearly fell upon landing. The vault received the lowest score of the rotation, 13.766 — a huge drop from her average score of 16.050 for the same event during the previous Olympics. Soon after, Biles left the competition floor before it was officially announced that she had withdrawn from the event altogether. She only returned to the arena to cheer on her teammates, who eventually went on to win the silver medal, from the sidelines.""After further medical evaluation, Simone Biles has withdrawn from the final individual all-around competition at the Tokyo Olympic Games, in order to focus on her mental health,"" USA Gymnastics said in astatement.

Her courage shows, yet again, why she is a role model for so many.""Biles later told reporters that she'd been ""having a little bit of the twisties,"" a term used to explain a mental block that can appear out of nowhere and make a gymnast lose their sense of direction or where they are in the air or perform an extra twist. Experiencing this block while flipping and twisting in the air leaves a gymnast blind to their surroundings, unable to figure out where the ground is and how to land safely. Former gymnasts explained just how bad the vault could've ended, telling Deanna Hong, a producer forGolden: The Journey of USA's Elite Gymnasts, that it could've led to serious injury.""One former US elite gymnast I talked to said that if it was someone other than Simone Biles who had made that same error, they would have certainly blown a knee, at minimum,"" Hongtweeted.

A deepfake is a video whereartificial intelligenceand deep learning – an algorithmic learning method used to train computers – has been used to make a person appear to say something they have not. Notable examples include a manipulated video ofRichard Nixon’s Apollo 11 presidential addressandBarack ObamainsultingDonald Trump. These edited videos can be extremely difficult to detect, but researchers have suggested that examining how blood moves around the face could indicate what is real and what is fake, since deepfakes cannot replicate it with high enough fidelity.“Biological signals hidden in portrait videos can be used as an implicit descriptor of authenticity, because they are neither spatially nor temporally preserved in fake content,"" the research, published in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Learning,states. This means of examination is called photoplethysmography, or PPG, and is used to monitor newborn babies without having to attach anything to their bodies, because their skin is thinner than an adult’s.“Synthetic content does not contain frames with stable PPG”, the scientistssuggest, and were apparently able to tell whether a video was real or fake with over 90 per cent accuracy. This technique can also be used to detect exactly where the deepfake came from, narrowed down to four different generators – DeepFakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap or NeuralTex. Deepfakes have been called themost dangerous cybercrime of the futureby experts, due to their difficulty to find, and the variety of crimes that the technology could be used for. The fake videos could be used to discredit a public figure by pretending to be a friend or family member, for example. Long term effects could be the public distrusting audio and video evidence as a whole. At the moment, deepfakes are predominantly used for pornography. In June 2020, research indicated that96 per cent of all deepfakes online are for pornographic context, and nearly 100 per cent of those cases are of women.

169,7-day average of new COVID-19 cases in U.S. drops below 100K for 1st time since November,0.0,45.0,https://globalnews.ca/news/7640407/us-coronavirus-cases-below-100k-daily/,https://adfontesmedia.com/global-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-14,19,"Average daily newcoronaviruscases in the United States dipped below 100,000 in recent days for the first time in months, but experts cautioned Sunday that infections remain high and precautions to slow the pandemic must remain in place. The seven-day rolling average of new infections was well above 200,000 for much of December and went to roughly 250,000 in January, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University, as the pandemic came roaring back after it had been tamed in some places over the summer. That average dropped below 100,000 on Friday for the first time since Nov. 4. It stayed below 100,000 on Saturday.“We are still at about 100,000 cases a day. We are still at around 1,500 to 3,500 deaths per day. The cases are more than two-and-a-half-fold times what we saw over the summer,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It’s encouraging to see these trends coming down, but they’re coming down from an extraordinarily high place.”She added that new variants, including one first detected in the United Kingdom that appears to be more transmissible and has already been recorded in more than 30 states, will likely lead to more cases and more deaths.“All of it is really wraps up into we can’t let our guard down,” she said. “We have to continue wearing masks. We have to continue with our current mitigation measures. And we have to continue getting vaccinated as soon as that vaccine is available to us.”The U. S. has recorded more than 27.5 million virus cases and more than 484,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins data. With parents and political leaders eager to have children around the country back in school for in-person learning, it is important that people continue to observe precautions, Walensky said.“We need to all take responsibility to decrease that community spread, including mask wearing so that we can get our kids and our society back,” she said. The CDC released guidance on Friday outlining mitigation strategies necessary to reopen schools or to keep them open. Some teachers have expressed concern about returning to the classroom without having been vaccinated, but the guidelines do not say that’s necessary. Dr. Anthony Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week” that it would be “optimal” if teachers were vaccinated but that other measures laid out in the 24-page document can lessen their risk.“Practically speaking, when you balance the benefit of getting the children back to school with the fact that the risks are being mitigated, if you follow the recommendations and these new guidelines from the CDC, hopefully, I think that will alleviate the concerns on both sides,” he said.",3,Reliable,0.1155469327420547,0.3984220251293421,618,3,Global News

The “China Initiative” had been criticised by civil liberties advocates as racially biased, and judges in several court proceedings had expressed scepticism aboutthe FBI’s tactics in interrogating the scientists. On Thursday and Friday, the US government filed motions in federal courts to dismiss charges in five cases of Chinese researchers arrested on visa fraud charges last year. All pleaded not guilty to falsifying visa applications to conceal military ties as well as other charges. The motions to dismiss the cases coincides with the new Biden administration’s Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman visiting China on Sunday and Monday. All five arrests occurred about a year ago when US-China relations were at a low point and now the world’s two largest economies are seeking to navigate a troubled relationship. The Justice Department said in a statement that it was dismissing the cases in the “interest of justice”. US-based Chinese officials could not be immediately reached for comment on the development.“Recent developments in a handful of cases involving defendants with alleged, undisclosed ties to the People’s Liberation Army of the People’s Republic of China have prompted the Department to re-evaluate these prosecutions,” a statement by Justice Department spokesperson Wyn Hornbuckle said, without detailing what those developments were. Court documents filed this month in two cases included FBI draft analysis that questioned how useful the investigation was in safeguarding technology developed in the United States. The report said that the visa application question about military service that ensnared the scientists was unclear. The analysis was written in reaction to the China Tech Transfer Analysis Unit at the FBI being nominated for an award in February for the “high impact” of the “arrests of the PLA students”. PLA refers to the Chinese military. The FBI unit leader disagreed on the impact of the arrests and removed the unit from the award nominations, according to the court documents. Asked about the court filing, a Justice Department official answered by email that the “draft analysis prompted follow up questions and requests from defense counsel that we could not resolve before Monday’s trial date.”One of the cases was scheduled to start on Monday. The official said that in most of the cases the sentences would be a year or less and that the defendants have had their liberty restricted for that time whether in jail or out on bail. Defence lawyers have said their clients’ only “crime” is running afoul of US-China politics. John Hemann, a lawyer for Chinese brain researcher Song Chen, said they were “grateful and relieved” the case against her had been dismissed and “the government has done the right thing.”",3,Reliable,0.0216813543599257,0.2543545145330859,575,3,Al Jazeera
171,Beaches sit empty and fragile habitats hang in the balance as crews race to clean up a Southern California oil spill,-1.67,45.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/05/us/california-oil-spill-tuesday/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-05,24,"An anchor hooking an oil pipeline may have caused the Southern California spill thatspewed more than 100,000 gallons of oilinto the Pacific Ocean, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said in a notice to operation owner Amplify Energy.“The pipeline has essentially been pulled like a bow string. And so at its widest point is about 105 feet away from where it was. So it is kind of an almost a semicircle,” Amplify Energy CEO Martyn Willsher said at a press conference Tuesday. There is no confirmation of a vessel above the site of the spill, but a response team is working with other agencies to determine whether a ship was in the area, said Capt. Rebecca Ore, the commanding officer at US Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach. Earlier Tuesday, authorities said a 4,000-foot section of the pipeline was displaced laterally about 105 feet and had a 13-inch split that was likely the source of the spill. The discovery explains the likely source of a spill, widely reported Saturday, of as much as 144,000 gallons of crude oil about five miles off the coast of Huntington Beach. The spill has shut down prized beaches, damaged the environment and presented possible health hazards for local residents. Authorities investigating the leak also sought Tuesday to clarify the timeline of when authorities and the pipeline company learned about the spill and what they did in response. A strong gasoline odor. Plumes of oil. And now California's coastal residents brace for damageThe Unified Command said the National Response Center first received a report of an unknown sheen of unknown source on Friday evening.“These types of reports are common and in many cases, the sheen reported can be natural seepage of oil or sheen that is never located,” the Unified Command said in a press release. “NOAA satellite imagery was reported to agencies early morning reporting a possible oil anomaly.”Crews from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Office of Spill Prevention and Response went to investigate before sunrise, but conditions were foggy and the crew returned to shore, authorities said.“The Coast Guard and Orange County Sheriff deployed at first light once fog lifted to investigate. A Coast Guard aircraft was diverted to support the investigation. On Saturday morning, the company confirmed a release of oil from a pipeline,” the Unified Command said. The timeline confirms that California authorities were notified late Friday of reports of an oil sheen at the site of the spill, more than 12 hours before Amplify Energy Corp., the operator of the line, reported it to state and federal officials, according to documents reviewed by CNN. At a news conference Monday, Amplify’s Willsher said a sheen was detected by company personnel Saturday morning, not Friday night. Willsher said while there is equipment to detect the leak without visibly seeing oil spills, there were no notices of a potential leak in the line before Saturday. The timing is important because of how many people were potentially impacted by the spill on Saturday, said Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley.“There were hundreds of boaters out on the Huntington Beach coast because we had an air show,” Foley said. “There were hundreds of boaters coming back and forth from Catalina to Orange County.”In a federal “corrective action order,” Amplify Energy was directed to shut down the pipeline entirely, provide maintenance and inspection records, and complete a root cause failure analysis, among other requirements. Only then can it submit a plan to resume operations. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration wrote that the cause of the spill remains unconfirmed. Nathan Avila found himself caught in the spill Saturday night when he arrived at a jetty near Newport Beach, one of his favorite surf spots. He told CNN he saw a lifeguard speaking with other surfers, but didn’t think it had anything to do with him. Then he heard sirens and decided to get out of the water.“I look down at my hand and I see oil over it, so I knew right then … this is an oil spill, this is, this is no joke,” he said. Avila, who is from Long Beach, said he had dish soap with him to try washing the oil away, but it didn’t work.“I was lucky enough that I was wearing a full wetsuit, so my wetsuit’s pretty much trashed, it’s like soaked into my wetsuit,” he said. “The surfboard had oil all over it. There was specs on my face, it was all over my hands, my feet, but I was really lucky to be wearing a wetsuit.”How oil spills harm birds, dolphins, sea lions and other wildlifeAvila wound up going to his house and using alcohol to wash the oil off. On Tuesday, Avila and his business partner, Elliot Lewis, ventured out into the waters of the Pacific Ocean to film the floating blobs of oil. They were eventually told to leave by the US Coast Guard.“The part that I was most surprised on is how thick the patties of oil were,” Avila said. “You could pick them up in your hand and it was about two inches thick and just globs. And we were seeing these globs everywhere.”Lewis told CNN the smell is what got to him.“It just smelled like death oil basically, like you were walking through a refinery and then we saw all these different patties of oil had floated to the top, some as big as a Frisbee and some five, six times greater than that and we were just right in the middle of it. It was just disaster of the worst kind,” he said. Lewis added: “No way that an animal could survive in that water.”Huntington Beach once had a a sign reading “Surf City USA.” A new sign Monday read “Beach open, Ocean and Shore closed.”On one beach section, workers in hazmat suits and rakes cleaned up tar balls from the spill, while beach-goers and their dogs ran between them. America's offshore oil infrastructure is aging. 'We don't know there's a problem until there's a problem.'And a little farther south, teams in white hazmat suits worked to protect the fragile wetland ecosystem near the mouth of the Santa Ana River – a crucial habitat for migratory birds that is now wrapped in shimmering oil ribbons. On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsomproclaimed a state of emergencydue to the spill. “The state is moving to cut red tape and mobilize all available resources to protect public health and the environment,” he said in a statement. The spill, which stretches from Huntington Beach to Laguna Beach, is likely to move farther south based on wind and currents, the Coast Guard’s Ore said. The spill is just the latest such incident to hit California’s shores, including the1969 spill of as much as 4.2 million gallonsof crude oil near Santa Barbara. Locally, Huntington Beach bore the brunt of a1990 spill of about 417,000 gallonsof crude oil when an oil tanker ran over its anchor and punctured its hull. The current spill’s volume pales in comparison to the most serious oil spills in history, including the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska (11 million gallons) and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico (134 million gallons). As of Tuesday morning, about 4,800 gallons of oil has been recovered from the water and about 11,400 feet of boom – a term for floating barriers designed to contain an oil spill – has been deployed. Dead birds and fish have already washed ashore, according to Foley, who has been providingupdates on Twitter.“This has devastated our California coastline in Orange County, and it’s having a tremendous impact on our ecological preserves as well as our economics,” Foley told CNN. “We need answers and the public deserves answers.”Why ending our dependence on fossil fuels is so challengingEight birds have been recovered from the oil spill, according to OWCN, including a brown pelican that was euthanized because of a wing injury. For some, this latest incident is a sign of aneed for change to protect the environment.“As California continues to lead the nation in phasing out fossil fuels and combating the climate crisis, this incident serves as a reminder of the enormous cost fossil fuels have on our communities,” Newsom said Monday. “Destructive offshore drilling practices sacrifice our public health, the economy, and our environment.”Willsher, the Amplify executive, apologized Tuesday for the spill and vowed to clean the area up.“This is a terrible tragedy and we’re extremely sorry this happened, obviously the cause of this still needs to be investigated. But regardless of the cause, we’re going to do everything we can to make things right for all those impacted areas and individuals, as quickly as we can,” Willsher said. Major oil spill off coast of Southern California threatens shores from Huntington Beach to Laguna BeachAmplify is a small,Houston-based company with 222 employeesas of the end of 2018, the last time it reported its staff size in a company filing. Its most recent financial report shows sales of $153 million, with year-to-date losses of $54.4 million through the end of June. Amplify’s pipeline was due for an inspection at the end of this month, Gov. Newsom said Tuesday. An inspection is done on the pipeline every two years. An internal check was completed in October 2019 and an external inspection was done in April 2020. While there were no issues with the pipeline during the previous inspections, Newsom said they’re going back to the details of those reports.

The attacks,according to Reutersciting Gaza Health officials, targeted houses in the center of Gaza City. At least eight children were reportedly killed in the strikes. Sunday’s violence brings the death toll in Gaza to at least 181, including 47 children, according to Reuters. At least ten people have been killed in Israel, the news service noted, including two children. According to The Associated Press, the Israeli airstrikes on Sunday were the deadliest single attack since violence in the region broke out early last week, marking the worst conflict since the 2014 war in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said the nation’s forces are“trying to degrade Hamas’s terrorist abilities.”When asked by host John Dickerson on CBS’s “Face the Nation” how much longer the hostilities would continue, Netanyahu said “we hope that it doesn’t continue very long,” later adding that “it’ll take some time, I hope it won’t take long but it’s not immediate.”In a separate televised address, Netanyahu said the attacks were continuing “full-force,” adding that it will “take time,” according to The AP. On Saturday, Israeli forcesbombed a building in Gaza City that housed the AP and Al Jazeera. The 12-story building collapsed as a result of the strike. Netanyahu on Sunday defended Israel’s decision to target the media building, claiming that an intelligence office for Hamas that “plots and organizes the terror attacks against Israeli civilians” was housed in the structure. The military told the owner of the building that occupants had an hour to evacuate before the structure would be bombed.",3,Reliable,-0.1618214285714285,0.242547619047619,381,3,The Hill

Police have recorded 105 homicides in the city so far this year, while 2020 saw a 16-year high of 198 homicides. Contee said the Thursday shooting left people “mad as hell” in a Friday press conference.“We could take the political route and talk about all of this fluffy stuff, but I’m going to give it to you straight, where the issues are,” Contee told reporters. “The justice system that we have right now—it is not functioning the way that it should. The courts are not open, that is a fact.”Contee said people arrested by police could up back on the streets within “three weeks,” and that there is still a backlog of cases from the previous year.“What does the community expect?” Contee said. “When a person gets caught with a firearm, what do we expect? Do we expect to see them in the neighborhood in three weeks? And if we do, are we saying that that’s acceptable?”Contee continued, “You cannot coddle violent criminals. You cannot treat violent criminals who are out here making communities unsafe…. They might not want a job. They might not. They might not need services.

It wasn't hundreds of thousands of Americans dead in a pandemic Trump repeatedly claimed was an overhyped plot against him. It was not impeachment. All those things irritated him, but it now looks like Trump's incitement of a violent coup against the nation may cost Trump and his self-named corporation—steel yourself, for this news is grim—In a statement,PGA of America announced that their board is terminating an agreementto hold the 2022 PGA Championship at Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey golf resort, declaring that it ""would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand.""You know, to be associated with a man who for months has been attempting to goad his followers into overthrowing the republic to reappoint him unelected god-king. Yeah, seems like pretty sound logic to me. This news was not taken at all well by Trump's allies or, it seems, Trump itself. In a now-deleted tweet, golf person Grayson Murray suggested that Trump put on his own tournament—maybeone with blackjack and hookers!""Hey @POTUS you should just host a tournament the same week as the 2022 PGA championship at your course. Put up a huge purse that players can’t turn down. Make the pga championship a weak field or force them to up their purse and cost them more money.""This is, of course, ridiculous because it supposes Donald Trump would ""Put up a huge purse"" for anything, ever. Not likely. Also, Murray appears to have deleted his Twitter account entirely after the resulting, ahem, response. In any event, we have good information thanks to' top Trump whisperer that Donald is—as a result of this crisis more than any other crisis in his barrel of current crises—melting the hell down. He’s angry about impeachment, people who have spoken to him say. But the reaction to the PGA decision was different order of magnitude. Yeah. Yeah, this is the thing that got him. Not any of the rest of it, but the thing that will cost him, personally, money. While it is perhaps satisfying to imagine Donald Trump stomping around in impotent rage as the consequences of his own actions punch him straight in the pocketbook, the news is more grim than that. If there is anything that would convince Donald Trump to order a nuclear strike in his last days of the ""presidency,"" it is the PGA insulting him.

But Saul isn’t going out without a fight and insists he will still sign in to work on Monday morning remotely from his New York home. “I consider myself the term-protected commissioner of Social Security,”Saul told the Washington Post, characterizing his firing as a “Friday Night Massacre.”Biden had asked on Friday morning for the resignation of both Saul and David Black, the deputy commissioner. Black resigned, but Saul refused. Biden appointed Kilolo Kijakazi, currently the deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy,to lead the agency. The Social Security Administration is an independent agency and the commissioner has a six-year term that doesn’t usually change when a new president moves into the White House. Saul’s term was scheduled to end on Jan. 19, 2025. But Democrats, as well as advocates for the elderly and the disabled, had been pushing Biden to get rid of Saul since day one in part due to his staunch, anti-union stance. He was also accused of delaying stimulus checks and attempting to limit disability benefits. In March, three Democratic lawmakers called for Saul to be fired, citing his “aggressive anti-union activities” and accusing him of pursuing “a range of anti-beneficiary and anti-employee policies.”Saul had “undermined and politicized Social Security disability benefits, terminated the agency’s telework policy that was utilized by up to 25 percent of the agency’s workforce, not repaired SSA’s relationships with relevant Federal employee unions including in the context of COVID-19 workplace safety planning, reduced due process protections for benefits appeals hearings, and taken other actions that run contrary to the mission of the agency and the President’s policy agenda,”the White House said in a statement. Saul’s firing marks the latest instance of Biden seeking to remove a Trump-appointed head of an independent agency that have historically stayed on from the previous administration. Last month, Biden fired the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency after the Supreme Courtruled he had the authority to do so. Saul said he was “very upset” by his dismissal that he said came without warning. Some Republicans immediately blasted the move. “This removal would be an unprecedented and dangerous politicization of the Social Security Administration,”tweeted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.",3,Reliable,-0.0161868686868686,0.3222474747474748,519,2,Slate

WRAL in Raleigh released the cartoon which depicted members of the NC GOP as KKK members with their recent attacks on the NC school curriculum. Robinson did not like it one bit. Robinson, the state’s first Black Lieutenant Governor, said that the cartoon was hypocrisy against GOP members of the NC Council of State who were minorities themselves. He said that running such a cartoon during Black History Month was an absolute disgrace. You can view his comments in the video below. Robinson’s statements are completely correct. He said that this cannot be tolerated, but media outlets around NC do not seem to support his side of events. TheRaleigh News & Observerimmediately went on to criticize Robinson for statements on his own social media pages. They called his statements anti-Semitic, homophobic, and anti-Muslim. WRAL responded to Robinson’s comments to say that the cartoon was full of hyperbole and satire. He said that it was meant to draw attention to the attempt of GOP members to wipe racist history away from the state’s social studies curriculum. Robinson has been vocal about the school curriculum recently. Robinson said that schools should be teaching children how to think, not what to think. He supported his statement by attacking a recent proposal where a stated objective of the school curriculum was to “explain how individual values and societal norms contribute to institutional discrimination and the marginalization of minority groups living under the American system of government.”By now, everyone is aware that the terms for institutional discrimination and marginalization of minority groups are simply talking points of the Left. The Left wants you to believe that systemic racism is real and that we need to acknowledge America’s racist past in order to move on. Other suggestions have been things like reparations for slavery, which are absolutely ridiculous. While WRAL can claim that the attempt is not to call these members KKK members, it’s hard to argue with the image. It depicts a KKK member, with GOP tagging on the white gown and an elephant underneath. That clearly is depicting them as racists. Robinson is a member of the State School Board as Lt. Governor. Media outlets want to claim to be the morality police, then they do something that is absolutely sickening like this. When called out, they start to attack the character of Robinson and make excuses for their actions. This is simply another sickening display of a media outlet that has no morals trying to garner some attention.

William Clinton III, 18, and a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old are being held without bail, police said. Police said video footage and physical evidence led them to Clinton and the two minors. Efraim Gordon was fatally shot multiple times May 3 in the 3700 block of Fords Lane in what police said appeared to be a robbery. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died. On the same day, police say, Clinton also stole a vehicle. He is charged with theft and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, according to online court records. An attorney for Clinton is not listed. Gordon had traveled from Israel to Baltimore for a week’s visit to attend his cousin’s wedding. When he was shot in the Glen neighborhood, he was walking back to his aunt and uncle’s house,Councilman Isaac “Yitzy” Schleifer previously said. Law enforcement and “the cooperation of the community … made these arrests possible,” Schleifer wrote in a Facebook post after police announced the arrests.“Countless people” came forward with information and doorbell camera footage, Schleifer said in an interview. But “the only way to drive down crime is to clear cases” and prosecute violent repeat offenders, Schleifer said. Clinton was also charged with armed robbery and armed carjacking in two separate incidents in 2019. Court records show the cases were remanded to Juvenile Court. Gordon’s familyraised $61,000to return Gordon’s body to Israel and to offer a $30,000 reward for tips leading to an arrest. In an update on the fundraising campaign page, organizers said Gordon “has been buried respectfully.”“No family should be forced to endure the insufferable pain of losing a loved one to gun violence,” Mayor Brandon Scott said in a statement.“As this family continues to heal, I remain committed to working with [Police Commissioner Michael Harrison] to build a safer Baltimore and finally put a halt to the long legacy of gun violence that plagues our city,” Scott said.

Martha McSally (R-AZ) has received multiple donations from the travel and lodging industries over the past several years. Sen. Martha McSally’s campaign has received tens of thousands of dollars from political action committees associated with commercial travel in the past two years. The last of those contributions came just after the Arizona Republican introduced a bill to subsidize vacations for Americans, according to publicly available Federal Election Commission data. On June 22, McSallyintroducedthe American TRIP Act, which would provide every adult with a $4,000 tax credit to be used for a vacation within the United States. Families would receive an additional $500 tax credit for each child, meaning a family of five would receive a total credit of $9,500. The bill “is about getting more than 180,000 Arizonans and over 9 million Americans who are employed by the tourism and hospitality industries back to work,” McSally said in apress releaseat the time. In this election cycle, the McSally campaign has received $43,500 from PACs of industries that could benefit from the TRIP Act, including commercial airlines, rental car companies, and restaurants, according to data compiled by theCenter for Responsive Politics. Her campaign received$18,500from American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Southwest Airlines;$11,000from travel and lodging PACs;$5,000from the National Restaurant Association; and$9,000from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. A $7,500donationfrom the American Hotel and Lodging Association PAC came on June 29, just a week after McSally introduced the American TRIP Act. McSally has received campaign contributions from these industries in past election cycles, including nearly $20,000 from lodging and tourism PACs from2015through2018. McSally “wants to give a handout to the travel industry that is bankrolling her campaign,” Zach Hudson, a spokesperson for American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive opposition research organization, claimed in an email on Wednesday. The McSally campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. McSally introduced the American TRIP Act even as coronavirus cases surged across the country. When she first introduced the bill, there were 2.3 million coronavirus cases in the United States; as of Wednesday, that number stood atmore than 3.9 million.“Because travel increases your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19, staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention haswarned. The CDC has recommended to those who do travel to wash their hands frequently, stay at least six feet away from others, and wear a face mask to prevent further spread or infection.

They tied up a maid and houseboy and ransacked Jovenel Moise’s office and bedroom. When it was over, Moise lay sprawled on his bedroom floor. He had been shot in the forehead, chest, hip and stomach, and his left eye was gouged. By the time the sun rose, the suspects had scattered by car and foot, leaving this country of more than 11 million in shock. People tuned into radio stations, some still in disbelief until gruesome photos began to circulate on social media.“I’m not saying he was a good person, but he didn’t deserve death,” said a woman named Sandra, who lived across the street from the president’s mansion. She and her son and husband squeezed into a shower in the back of their home when they heard gunshots echoing through the Pelerin neighborhood. Sandra, who declined to give her last name for fear of being killed, thought it was Haitian gang members who had been threatening to take over the area until she heard someone yell in English: “Go! Go! Go!”Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said the July 7 attack was carried out by a highly trained and heavily armed group. Details have been scarce, but Associated Press interviews with investigators and witnesses give a sense of the terror and chaos of that night. So far, police have detained more than 20 suspects they say were directly involved in the killing, including a contingent of former Colombian special forces soldiers. Other suspects were killed by authorities as they closed in. None of the president’s security guards were hurt. The president’s daughter hid in her brother’s bedroom and survived, Carl Henry Destin, a deputy peace justice, told the AP as he confirmed details of that night. Shortly after the slaying, several of the Colombians hid in a two-story business that once sold furniture on a narrow, hilly road just a few minutes’ drive from Moise’s house. One of the Colombians texted his sister from the business around 6:30 a.m. “Things had gotten complicated,” Duberney Capador wrote to Yenny Capador. Half an hour later, her phone beeped with another message: “We are under attack.”She said Capador told her police were firing at them and that they were trying to talk to authorities and turn themselves in. Then he went silent for several hours and later turned up dead, his body badly bruised.

David Schweikert be fined $50,000 and reprimanded on the House floor for violating federal law and House rules by allowing his office to misuse taxpayer money, skirting Federal Election Commission reporting requirements, using campaign money for personal use and pressuring his staff to engage in campaign work. The Ethics Committee plans to bring a privileged resolution to reprimand the Arizona Republican for a full House vote. Schweikert must repay the Treasury by Oct. 30. The Arizona Republican’s Members’ Representational Allowance was misused for non-official purposes from January 2011 to November 2017, the Ethics Committee found. The report comes after the panel received a referral from the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent investigative entity in the House that found there was a “substantial reason” to believe Schweikert violated federal and House rules.“We are pleased the Committee has issued their report and we can move forward from this chapter,” Grace White, a spokesperson for Schweikert, said in an email to CQ Roll Call. “As noted in the review, all issues have been resolved and Congressman Schweikert will continue working hard for Arizona’s 6th District.”A privileged resolution reprimanding Schweikert will likely, based on past precedent, be voted on Friday morning. Between January 2011 and July 2018, Schweikert’s former chief of staff, Oliver Schwab, spent more than $270,000 in impermissible expenditures for Schweikert’s campaign and at least three other staffers made similar expenditures totaling less than $500, the Ethics Committee found. Schwab, who resigned in July 2018, used over $6,000 of official funds from the MRA — an account that is explicitly for expenses that support the congressional office, such as staff salaries or computer purchases — on a six-day trip to Super Bowl XLIX in Arizona, the OCE found. Schwab spent the MRA money, which comes from the U. S. Treasury Department, on airfare, accommodations, a rental car, gas, parking and food. During the 2015 trip, Schwab also attended the Phoenix Open, a PGA golf tournament. Schwab’s wife, mother and brother — none of whom live in Arizona — were also in the state for the trip and attended the Super Bowl matchup between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. The Ethics Committee found Schweikert “failed to take reasonable steps to ensure his campaign committees operated in compliance with applicable laws and standards of conduct, including Federal Election Commission Act (FECA) reporting requirements.”The House Administration Committee requires members to sign off on MRA disbursements to certify they were incurred to support members’ official duties. The OCE report found Schweikert “had little or no involvement in approving MRA disbursement requests” and designated people to sign off on the disbursement documents on his behalf. It is against federal law and House rules for a member to accept a campaign contribution from a staffer. In 2012, Schwab made a $1,000 contribution to Schweikert’s campaign. From 2011 to 2016, Schwab also spent money on behalf of Schweikert’s campaign committees that he was reimbursed for. Schwab was reimbursed for at least $16,000 in personal outlays made on behalf of Schweikert’s campaign committees, the OCE found. The Ethics Committee ruled that Schweikert misused campaign money for personal use. He accepted personal items from his staff that were reimbursed with campaign funds from 2011 to 2018, including food and babysitting services. Members of Schweikert’s congressional staff were also pressured to work on the campaign, the committee found. The ethics investigative subcommittee, which looked into Schweikert, ultimately decided to recommend a lesser sanction than censure, largely because he accepted responsibility and agreed to pay the fine. It is rare for the House Ethics Committee to recommend that the full House formally reprimand a member on the floor. The last time this happened was in 2012, when Laura Richardson, a California Democrat, was formally sanctioned on the House floor. However, several members have resigned or lost reelection amid investigation. Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat, worked as the chairman of the investigative subcommittee and Rep. Bill Flores, a Texas Republican, served as the ranking member.",3,Reliable,0.0355134996582365,0.4142486899065847,974,3,Roll Call
184,"Teachers, Activists Prepare to Battle Conservatives in Court on 'Institutional Racism'",6.0,40.33,https://www.newsmax.com/us/education-racism-critical-race-theory-activists/2021/07/10/id/1028161/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Courtrooms and local school board meetings are setting up as the battleground for a major cultural conflict between conservatives, parents, teachers, and social justice activists on controversial critical race theory. According to theBritanica website, critical race theory is an ""intellectual movement and loosely organized framework of legal analysis based on the premise that race is not a natural, biologically grounded feature of physically distinct subgroups of human beings but a socially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of color.""Although it has been a staple of law schools since the 1970s, the theory has come to the education mainstream due to changes in the way some view gender and items like The New York Times ""1619 Project,"" which claims the country's founding was based more in the slave trade and ""white supremacy"" more than an effort to create an egalitarian society. Educators and the unions that represent them argue these ""darker"" moments of American history have been whitewashed in the past and need to be taught to present the most accurate picture of the country. Opponents, including conservatives and newly formed parent organizations, say the material is too divisive and ends up indoctrinating children to a more far left-wing view of America. Suburban districts, like Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia, have gainednationalprominence following contentious board of education meetings with advocates on both sides speaking out. Parents and others are seeking the recall of board members for absorbing the controversial theory into the district's policies and curriculum, while the board denies it is teaching the theory to students. Several statesare currently considering legislation to ban teaching the theory or its application in classrooms throughout the country. Recently, American Federation of Teachers Union President Randi Weingarten compared the battle to the1925 ""Scopes Trial""where a teacher was tried for teaching evolution to students in Tennessee.""We're looking at court actions because these laws conflict with standards and our licensure requirements and our professional obligations,"" Weingarten, leader of the country's second largest teacher's union, said. She denied members of her union are teaching the theory.""Let's be clear: critical race theory is not taught in elementary schools or high schools,"" she said. ""It's a method of examination taught in law school and college that helps analyze whether systemic racism exists — and whether it has an effect on law and public policy. But culture warriors are labeling any discussion of race, racism or discrimination as CRT to try to make it toxic. They are bullying teachers and trying to stop us from teaching students accurate history.""Delegates from the largest union, the National Education Association, said they would expand teaching ""anti-racism and diversity"" in classrooms, and said it has set aside several million dollars to defend members in court for teaching ""accurate"" history. It is also asking members to ""fight back"" against the anti-critical race theory movement, saying in a statement that ""it is reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed"" by critical race theory.",3,Reliable,0.1371994172494172,0.3728664335664335,637,1,Newsmax
185,Did you hear U.S. plans to require vaccine passports? Not true,-3.17,46.67,https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2021/04/did-you-hear-us-plans-to-require-vaccine-passports-not-true.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-10,25,"The Associated Press checks out some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. This one is bogus, even though it was shared widely on social media. Here are the facts:CLAIM:The federal government wants to require Americans to present a health passport or vaccine certificate “on demand,” including for domestic travel. THE FACTS:The U. S. government has no plans to require so-called vaccine passports to travel domestically, or for any other purpose. While private businesses are considering vaccine passports for certain activities, Biden administration officials have said the federal government will not mandate vaccine passports. A vaccine passport is documentation that shows a person has been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus or recently tested negative. The information will be in the form of a scannable code that can be stored on a smartphone or printed out. During a press conference on Tuesday, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration is “not now nor will we be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential. There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.”But posts circulating on social media are falsely implying that vaccine passports will be mandatory in the U. S., including for domestic travel. “President Biden and the Democrats want to force Americans to present a ‘vaccine passport’ upon demand, yet they oppose presenting an ID to cast a vote,” reads a tweet by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. A Facebook post claims: “So, now, I will need a Health Passport to travel IN America, but Illegals don’t need any kind of Passport to enter INTO America!”Such claims are “patently false,” according to Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor, and director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.“There are no plans in the US to introduce a vaccine passport for domestic travel,” Gostin said to the AP in an email. “Neither the government nor the US airline industry have announced any plans for requiring proof of vaccination as a condition of interstate travel.”Gostin explained that foreign carriers were discussing a voluntary COVID vaccine passport system, but it did not include U. S. carriers yet. In the U. S., only one state has rolled out a vaccine passport. New York introduced an app through a limited government partnership with a private company. People can show proof of vaccination or a negative test with an app to enter places like entertainment venues. Lawmakers in ahandful of states, including Pennsylvania, are trying to ban vaccine passports. Last week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also issued an executive order banning businesses from requiring customers to show proof they got the shot. The Facebook post’s claim that people without legal status in the U. S. are allowed to enter without documentation is also misleading. Those trying to enter the U. S. must show proof they are an American citizen or documents showing they have permission to enter the country, otherwise they are placed in expedited removal proceedings and face deportation. The law does allow those without documents who have a credible fear of returning to their home country to enter and apply for asylum.",3,Reliable,0.0492260264987537,0.32827626918536,696,3,The Oregonian
186,Here's everything you need to know to vote by mail in Indiana,-6.0,44.67,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/10/mail-voting-indiana-what-you-need-know-vote-mail/3303694001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/indianapolis-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-10,19,"The debate over no-excuse absentee voting by mail has takenthe national spotlight, but it's ultimately a state issue. In Indiana, there's little indication that officials will expandmail-in voting optionsfor all Hoosiers. Currently, the option is only available for people who meet certain criteria. But the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has some calling for changes to the rules in Indiana. For now, here's everything you need to know about mail-in voting in Indiana ahead of the Nov. 3 election. There are currently11 accepted excusesfor voting by mail in Indiana. They are:The list does not include an excuse specifically related to the coronavirus. When asked about the possibility of adding such an excuse during a Wednesday press conference,Gov. Eric Holcomb saidhe wants to wait to see where a pending lawsuit lands before ""we start to entertain different language.""Applications for mail-in voting must be received by election officials by Oct. 22. The application can bedownloaded online at in.gov/sos/electionsVoters can also request that their county election office or the Indiana Election Division mail them an application or pick them up from county election offices. The Marion County number is 317-327-5100. Contact information for other counties can be found on the back of the application. Applications can be submitted online or sent to the local county office by mail, email or hand-delivery. As of Aug. 6, roughly 8,400 people have applied to vote by mail, according to the Marion County Clerk's Office. Voters wishing to vote by mail must apply before each election. Applications and ballots by mail are handled at the county level. If approved, a ballot package will be sent to the voter by mail, along with a pre-paid return envelope. The voter must personally fill out their ballot. Someone can assist the voter with putting the ballot in the envelope and sealing it, but an affidavit of assistance must also be submitted. Ballots must be received by noon on Nov. 3. How applications are reviewedRussell Hollis, deputy director of the Marion County Clerk's Office, said staff reviews applications to make sure the person is registered to vote. They also check their address to make sure it matches their voter registration and to ensure they are assigned to the right precinct and receive the right ballot. Staff makes sure the voter has selected one of the accepted excuses, but Hollis said the office doesn't verify that the excuse is truthful. Some excuses, like being 65 or older, could easily be verified. But excuses that indicate the voter will be unable to vote in person due to illness, work or being out of state, would be tough to confirm, Hollis said.""It's extremely difficult for us to know that someone has actually lied,"" he said. By signing the application, a voter swears under penalties of perjury that the information is true. Perjury is punishable by up to 2-and-half years in prison and a $10,000 fine, according to the application. Once the Marion County election office receives ballots, they remain sealed and locked away in a secure room until Election Day. But first, county staff log each received ballot package into a statewide system. Hollis said that allows voters to track whether the office has received their ballot. And if that voter tries to vote in-person -- maybe because they don't think their mailed ballot was received -- poll workers will be alerted and the person will only be allowed to vote provisionally. The ballot packages aren't unsealed until Election Day. Workers first match the signature on the ballot to the signature on the application. They then take the ballot to a bi-partisan team that runs the ballots through ""high-speed counting machines,"" Hollis said. The process of counting mailed-in ballots is ""more tedious"" than in-person voting, Hollis said.""It takes a while to do those manual steps of signature verification and cutting open the ballot,"" he said. Indiana's primary election, which was slated for May 5, was pushed to June 2 due to the coronavirus pandemic. No-excuse mail-in voting was permitted while the state was under stay-at-home orders. Ultimately,more than 500,000 voters requestedballots by mail. In the 2016 primary, only about 53,800 votes were cast by mail. Some voters reportednever receiving a ballot, and more than1,700 ballots were left uncountedbecause they were received past the June 2 noon deadline. At the polls, some voters experienced hours-long waits to vote. Hollis said the challenge with voting by mail in the primary was the unprecedented volume of applications received in a short time frame. Most were received in a roughly three-week period, he said. Indiana is one of just eight states that require an excuse not related to COVID-19 to vote by mail, according to aWashington Post analysis. Kentucky is the only bordering state that also requires an excuse other than COVID-19 to vote by mail. Illinois, Michigan and Ohio will automatically mail applications to registered voters, all of whom can vote by mail without an excuse. Seven states, including Vermont and Utah, will automatically mail ballots to all voters. According to Washington Post, more than 75% of all American voters will be able to vote by mail. Several states, including California and Vermont, have movedto expand access to mail-in ballotsamid the ongoing pandemic. Citing the long lines in the primary and the ongoing threat of the coronavirus pandemic, Indiana Democrats support expanding mail-in voting for the General Election, too. Indiana Election Commission members and Democrats Anthony Long and Suzannah Overholt have sent a letter to commissionRepublicans Paul Okeson and Zachary Klutz asking that the board approve no-excuse absentee voting for the general election. The letter notes that COVID-19 cases continue to increase, school districts have delayed opening and no vaccine will be available by November. Okeson told IndyStar in late July that he's watching COVID-19 data and is in touch with the governor and secretary of state. President Donald Trump has been a loud critic of no-excuse mail-in voting, going so far as posing theoption of delaying Election Day. Trump says universal mail-in voting is a recipe for fraud and would delay results for weeks or months, though there is no evidence of widespread fraud in mail-in voting. Holcomb has also expressed concern over mail-in voting causing delays. Holcomb also said hedoesn't see the need for no-excuse mail-in voting, noting that all voters can cast ballots in-person beginning Oct. 6 to avoid Election Day crowds. He also insists polling locations will be safe. Indiana Republican Party Chairman Kyle Hupfer told IndyStar in July that the GOP agreed to expand mail-in voting for the primary because of the now-expired stay-at-home order. He said counties took measures to keep voters safe, and the primary isn't known to have spread the disease. Elizabeth Bennion teaches American politics at Indiana University South Bend’s Department of Political Science and is the founding director of IUSB’s American Democracy Project. Bennion called the idea of widespread voter fraud perpetuated by Trump a myth.""This is something that has been studied dozens of times by separate academics... in a variety of states with mail-in voting,"" she said. ""and they really find no evidence of widespread voter fraud.""As for delays in election results, Bennion said it's a ""real possibility,"" noting there have been delays in results in previous elections that had nothing to do with mail-in voting.""It does take longer,"" she said. ""But is it more important to have this done quickly or to have it done right?""Bennion and public policy professor Shelia Kennedy point to benefits they say outweigh any potential hiccups, like increased voter turnout. Kennedy, who teaches at IU's Paul H. O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said Oregon and Washington, where voting is done entirely by mail, have reaped that benefit. Oregon routinely sees a 60-80% voter turnout. In the 2016 General Election, 58% of Hoosier voters cast ballots. In Oregon, just over 80% voted. Bennion and Kennedy also said voting by mail allows people to research races and questions on the ballot as they're filling it out.""Voters also report that they feel like they have more time to really consider their choices and make informed choices as they cast their ballot,"" Bennion said. ""Because they have their ballot there at home.""",3,Reliable,0.1221705522486772,0.4652281746031746,1844,3,Indianapolis Star
187,"The inside story of an alleged victim of ""cancel culture""",-8.75,45.5,https://popular.info/p/the-inside-story-of-an-alleged-victim,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,18,"The concept of ""cancel culture"" is a relatively recent phenomenon, appearing in popular usagearound 2017. The idea is that groups of people, sometimes pejoratively referred to as the ""woke mob,"" demand punishment of individuals that offend their sensibilities. Those who decry the existence of ""cancel culture"" do not provide data to prove it is a cultural problem. Instead, they rely on anecdotes of people who are unjustly punished to persuade and outrage the public. These anecdotes have convinced some of the country's most prominent voices — fromSenator Tom Cotton (R-AR)toformer President Barack Obama— that ""cancel culture"" is a real issue. A prototypical anecdote was featured on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News on June 18. Carlson highlighted the plight of Melissa Rolfe, the stepmother of Garrett Rolfe, the former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks. Carlson told millions of viewers that Rolfe was fired from her job as an HR Director at a mortgage broker because her stepson, a police officer, was charged with murder. Until today, his stepmother, her name is Melissa Rolfe was the HR Director at a place called Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta, Georgia. But today, she was let go. She is no longer in that role. Apparently, she was fired, and her only crime was being Officer Rolfe's stepmother. According to a source familiar with the matter who spoke to this program, Rolfe was promised that her job was safe. But today she was told, and we are quoting, ""We have to terminate our relationship with you."" No other explanation was offered, and honestly, no other explanation was needed. It was obvious what happened. Rolfe has already been scrubbed from the company's website, wiped away as the Bolsheviks did with those who lost favor with Joseph Stalin. That will keep happening until lawmakers decide to resist the mob and protect ordinary people from its predations. That night, Congressman Doug Collins (R-GA) embraced Rolfe's cause, claiming she was fired for the actions of her stepson. ""The 'Cancel Culture' and political correctness mob must be stopped before it destroys our country,"" Collins said. On June 30, Carlson invited Rolfe to be a guest on the show. She appeared with her lawyer, David Guldenschuh. Carlson asked Rolfe if she knew of any other possible reason for her firing, other than the actions of her stepson:CARLSON: Had you been in trouble with them? Was there any indication that they were going to fire you before you received the message saying you were terminated?ROLFE: No. I had received full support from the President and from my Direct Manager that my job was not in danger. But that does not appear to be the whole story. Adefamation lawsuit filed this week by Rolfe's former employer, Equity Prime Mortgage (EPM), alleges that Rolfe ""repeatedly violated company policy and created an uncomfortable and hostile working environment."" The complaint accuses Rolfe of making hostile, sexual, and ""blatantly racist"" remarks. All of the conduct allegedly took place prior to Garrett Rolfe's shooting. EPM accuses Rolfe and Congressional candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of organizing a ""smear campaign"" against the company, resulting in ""death threats, a boycott, and enormous reputational and financial harm to EPM.""If the allegations in the complaint are true, it suggests that Rolfe was exploiting the concept of ""cancel culture"" to cover-up actual wrongdoing. Rolfe did not respond to a request for comment sent to her through her attorney. Another attorney representing Rolfe and Green, Lin Wood, called the allegations against Rolfe in the lawsuit ""damnable lies.""Rolfe claims she was fired because she stood up for her stepson, police officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot and killed Rashard Brooks. But the complaint alleges misconduct that began well before the June 12 shooting. Rolfe started working for EPM in February 2020. EPM says, less than a month later, on March 19, ""Rolfe was reprimanded because she had made inappropriate jokes via text message about conducting rectal temperature checks in the office."" On April 23, ""Rolfe was reprimanded again, this time for referring to employees as “savages,"" according to the complaint. On June 11, Rolfe was reprimanded a third time by EPM CEO Eddie Perez. According to EPM, ""two employees reported Rolfe for calling employees 'fucking bitches,' saying an employee had only been hired because she had 'big boobs,' and making racist comments.”Popular Information obtained a document from EPM memorializing the meeting between Perez and Rolfe. The ""Employee Warning Notice,"" dated June 11, cites Rolfe for ""gross misconduct."" According to that document Rolfe responded by ""saying that she doesn’t see color, but that some people are 'idiots.'"" EPM says that Perez ended the meeting after Rolfe became upset but told her he would continue investigating. The next day, Garrett Rolfe killed Rashard Brooks, and Melissa Rolfe took a paid leave of absence. But according to EPM, the investigation continued, and employees came forward with claims of ""wildly unprofessional and hostile conduct"" by Rolfe, including:Rolfe told an employee that another employee was a “dumb bitch” and that the only reason a man would be interested in her was because she “must suck dick really good.”Rolfe told a Black woman who dates Black men that she needed “to get outside the box and upgrade [her] standards.”""We terminated Ms. Rolfe because, while in the workplace, she repeatedly made inappropriate and hostile comments to and about other EPM employees, which violated company policy, created an uncomfortable working environment, and resulted in a loss of confidence that she could perform her job as an HR director,"" EPM told Popular Information. The lawsuit filed by EPM also names the campaign of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican running for Congress, as a defendant. Greene won the Republican nomination on Tuesday night. She has gained notoriety for her embrace of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that claims liberal Hollywood actors and Democratic politicians are running an international child sex-trafficking ring, and Trump is the only one who can stop them. Facebook hasremoved several of Greene's advertisementsfor making violent threats against Black Lives Matter protesters. EPM's lawsuit notes that Greene repeatedly claimed that Rolfe was fired because of the actions of her stepson. The lawsuit alleges that Greene ""coordinated the planting of a false story with Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" but does not provide evidence to support that allegation. Greene has appeared previously on Carlson's show. On August 6, EPM sent Greene and her campaign a letter demanding a retraction. Greene responded by posting again on social media, claiming Melissa Rolfe was fired because she defended her stepson. Do we know why Rolfe was fired? No. That will be determined in a court of law. But we know enough to say the simple story presented on Tucker Carlson was reductive and misleading. It suggests we should be more cautious making broad conclusions about societal trends based on one-sided anecdotes. Another anecdote that has been widely embraced by critics of cancel culture is the firing of David Shor. We are told that Shor, a 28-year-old political data scientist, was fired from his job at Civis Analytics fortweetinga research paper that concluded race riots reduced Democratic turnout in the 1960s. This claim is repeatedagain, andagain, andagain. If Shor was fired for tweeting an academic paper, that seems unfair. But neither Civis Analytics nor Shor, who signed a non-disclosure agreement, has confirmed he was fired for the tweet. ""These rumors are incorrect and unsubstantiated. Civis was founded on the principles of free speech and the pursuit of truth through objective scientific research, and that has not changed. This is an internal personnel matter, and out of respect for our employees and alumni, we won’t be commenting further,"" Civis Analytics toldThe Atlantic. Do we know why Shor was fired? No. But an unconfirmed anecdote is not evidence that our society has been turned upside down. This is important because the concept of ""cancel culture"" is being used toarguethat ""protests for racial and social justice"" have gone too far because they have created ""a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity."" We are told that ""institutional leaders, in a spirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms.""Many people are treated unfairly. But there is little evidence that unfair treatment is now disproportionately impacting, for example, supporters of the police rather than minority groups. Free speech is a bedrock principle of American democracy. But free speech is not inconsistent with being held accountable for your words and actions.

188,How Churches Adjusted ‘Ash Wednesday’ To Fit The Pandemic,-0.67,48.33,https://www.laweekly.com/how-churches-are-adjusting-ash-wednesday-to-fit-pandemic-guidelines/,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-17,25,"Ash Wednesday is a personal, close-contact ritual within the Christian church where members receive a blessed mark of ashes on their foreheads. From drive-thru setups, to mailing ashes to church members, Southern California churches found creative ways to safely keep the old tradition going. Saint Mark’s Episcopal Church has multiple locations throughout Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino County, but it is their Upland location that adopted a modified “Ash and Dash” system for Ash Wednesday. For this system, the church opted to create an “ash kit” that was placed in either a passenger seat or trunk, allowing churchgoers to safely apply the blessed ashes themselves.“Instead of imposing the ashes on people’s foreheads, we’re going to safely deliver the kits into their trunks or their passenger side window,” Saint Mark’s Rev. Keith Yamamoto said. The church has had a drive-thru Ash Wednesday setup for four years now, which Rev. Yamamoto said the program helped him receive ashes in 2020, after an being involved in an accident that wouldn’t have allowed him to participate otherwise.“This is our fourth year doing the drive-thru experience because what we found was that people were busy, they couldn’t take the time off work… to get to the church or the Ash Wednesday service,” Yamamoto said. “We started doing the drive-thru experience… so people on their morning commute could just come through our parking lot, receive the ashes and begin the rest of their day.”Those who chose to attend the Ash and Dash this year saw ministers in masks, instructing cars where to go an allowing them to receive the ashes without needing to lower their windows or contact anyone outside. The church also advised on Lent instruction, as well as carried out a streamed church service at 12 p.m., with another streaming at 7 p.m. St. James Episcopal Church in Los Angeles sent its congregants ashes by mail since they were not having in-person services for Ash Wednesday. The church will also be streaming a church service at 7 p.m. and asked that church members check their mailboxes as they put together their own ash kits and sent them out last week.“Many of our episcopal churches in the region have risen up with creative solutions such as mailing ashes that have been blessed… so they will have the ashes at home for the digital services that will take place on Ash Wednesday,” Bob Williams, Canon For Common Life of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, said. Hoping everyone is having a blessed#AshWednesdayand that you'll be able to join us at 7PM for our Ash Wednesday livestream – and don't forget to check your mail for your ashes-at-home kit! 📬@StJamesLApic.twitter.com/O8CanaaBaI— Jon Feuss (@RevJonFeuss)February 17, 2021All Saints Church in Pasadena made their ash Wednesday a little more interactive this year with a “Burn It” campaign. The church asked its congregants to share messages and phrases of “negative or constraining experiences,” put those words to paper and drive by the church, where masked ushers would receive them. The church took those words as they came in throughout the day, Tuesday, and used the ashes for their Ash Wednesday service. St. Charles Borromeo chose to have a drive-in mass for Ash Wednesday, as parishioners parked in designated spots, and were asked to wear masks at all times, including while inside their cars. While there, as would be the case in a drive-in theater, guests tuned their car radios to listen to the live church service. With PPE on, servers from the church went around to cars, distributing the ashes. It’s a wonderful encounter for people who might not be comfortable with coming into a church,” Williams said. “…the churches are rising up and finding creative solutions to make the observance meaningful.”Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

189,University System of Maryland requiring masks on campus this fall amid coronavirus pandemic,-0.67,46.67,https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-usm-masks-on-campus-20200722-c73x4yqw2fdbnahwmwhxeerdfe-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,24,"The University System of Maryland is requiring students to wear face masks on campuses, codifying the new directive in its disciplinary guidelines as a means of preventing the coronavirus from spreading. With plans to reopen this fall, the twelve affiliate institutions will allow students and faculty to return to the facilities but will reduce density in housing accommodations, dining halls and classrooms. The system will adopt a “hybrid” modelthat will offer many classes virtually and others in-person. The mask mandate, announced Wednesday during a Board of Regents special meeting, highlights the challenges of reopening institutions of higher education as the public health crisis continues to infect thousands nationwide each day. Debates about reopening schools this fall have escalated in recent weeks as students of all ages gear up for the next academic term,with many large school districts in the statealready planning to start the year in an online-only setting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified face coverings and social distancing as key components of mitigating the coronavirus, which is easily transmissible through direct contact and via aerosols. Baltimoreannounced new rules Wednesday, restricting indoor bars and restaurants from serving patrons outdoors or via carryout online and calling on residents to cover their faces in public. Colleges and universities face extraordinary challenges this fall, especially asmany face cuts to their budgets and reductions in what they can collect in room and board, parking and athletics fees. The state’s flagship university in College Park has long struggled with providing adequate ventilation in its buildings and has faced scrutiny for its handling ofmoldand asbestos. An adenovirus outbreak in 2018that left one student dead drew further criticism for the university’s ability to communicate during crises. In remarks, Vice Chancellor Joann Boughman said mask wearing would “be enforced,” but did not elaborate on what penalties people would face if they disregarded the measure. She also said social distancing would be required, and universities would help regulate physical proximity by spreading out students in classrooms and limiting in-person sessions to small groups. Spokesperson Mike Lurie, in an email, said face mask use is already being enforced by the system. The university system will also havestudents take their temperaturesdaily and log their symptoms on a portal, which will organize and aggregate the data. People with certain symptoms will be “flagged” and guided in how to get tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Contact tracing will begin on the campus level, Boughman said, with university officials working closely with state and local health departments. Such investigation will help identify whether a student could have become infected in a classroom setting, allowing administrators to make decisions and monitor potential outbreaks. Students who test positive will not necessarily be asked to leave campus, Boughman added, though they will be required to isolate. Housing density on campus has been significantly reduced, she said, with priority given to freshmen, international students, and people with disabilities and those who are not able to commute or secure off-campus accommodations. Upperclassmen who require mostly face-to-face instruction due to advanced level coursework will also be given priority for on-campus housing. Though no more than two students will share a room, a small group of students will share bathrooms in dormitories, Boughman said. Most students should prepare to have many of their classes taught virtually even if they do come back to campus in the fall as residents, said system Chancellor Jay Perman. He called the combination of online and in-person courses a “high cost, high effort” undertaking, but one worth the investment.“What we can do effectively in a remote format we will, because the health of our students, faculty and staff is our priority,” he said. “I’m not a stubborn man; if the effort isn’t enough and spread of COVID in Maryland presents challenges too tough to overcome, then yes, of course we’ll pivot to remote instruction.”The hypothetical transition from a hybrid model to a fully online one will go smoother in the fall than it did in the spring, Perman said. State and local health officers will head this “trigger point” decision, ultimately having charge of whether the campus should shut down if the pandemic escalates. The partnership formed between these health officials and the institutions will also work to refine testing and tracing for campus communities, he added.“We have no incentive to salvage an in-person semester if the science tells us we shouldn’t,” Perman said. “We know COVID has the last word in our plans.”Perman said the system seeks to reopen in this fashion to retain students from low-income backgrounds, students of color and first generation college students who may not succeed without on-campus resources. As the country reckons with overturning systemic racism in media, the workforce, health care, and education, he said the system must position itself to protect the students most vulnerable to the pandemic. He cited the value of camaraderie and face-to-face emotional support as anchors of the decision, as well. Boughman said some students will have courses available through the University of Maryland Global Campus, which already offers many of the classes that will move to an online setting this fall. Certain classes with high drop-out rates will continue to meet in person, she said, and laboratory coursework will take place face-to-face with some exceptions.",3,Reliable,0.0962457912457912,0.4347093226638679,1160,3,Baltimore Sun
190,Nonprofit linked to PhRMA behind ads opposing drug pricing changes,-7.33,45.67,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/30/nonprofit-linked-to-phrma-behind-ads-opposing-drug-pricing-changes/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-30,23,"The nonprofit organization behind a wide-reaching ad campaign against allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices has deep ties to pharmaceutical lobbyists. A cable ad campaign has made a patient group called the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease ubiquitous on television screens in Washington, D. C., and 13 states including Arizona, Colorado and Georgia.“Thirteen years ago, I noticed a lump on my stomach, and sure enough, they found a cancerous tumor on my liver. I’ve got to take about 22 pills a day,” a man named Bo says in one of the group’s ads. “Take it from someone who knows: Medicare price negotiation isn’t the answer.”Undisclosed in the heart-wrenching commercials: The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease has extensive ties to the lobby for major pharmaceutical companies, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA. For nine years, it shared an address with PhRMA, which advocates for pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer, Amgen and GlaxoSmithKline. Lobbyists for the partnership also lobby for drug companies, and they list PhRMA as a related organization on their required disclosure forms. The partnership is now located at the office of a consulting firm paid by the nonprofit, a three-minute walk from its former location at PhRMA. Two of the firm’s leaders were once vice presidents at PhRMA focusing on public relations, according to the consulting firm’s LinkedIn page.“These are the telltale signs of an astroturf operation,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a Washington watchdog group, using a term to describe something that appears to the public like an independent group but is actually supported by a wealthy special interest. The nonprofit does not disclose its funders. The partnership’s ad buy is worth at least $5.3 million, according to research by Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, a nonprofit that opposes them and ran its own nearly $4 million ad campaign supporting Democrats’ drug pricing proposal. The partnership’s ads against drug price negotiations are raising concerns among some of the groups listed as its partners. The partnership did not respond to emailed questions about its ties to the drug industry but said in an emailed statement it supports lowering prescription costs.“For nearly 15 years, we have advocated for a range of public policy solutions that address health disparities, promote prevention, improve benefit design, and lower prescription costs for patients,” said Jennifer Burke, a spokesperson for the group, in the statement. “We are strongly opposed to government price setting, specifically policies that use discriminatory [quality adjusted life years] and impose restrictive formularies to limit access to much needed care for millions of Americans living with one or more chronic conditions.”PhRMA did not answer questions about funding it provides the partnership or its spending but said in a statement it is one of “many partners” that support it. PhRMA itself has spent at least $2.7 million on ads in the past couple of months against Medicare drug price negotiations, according to Patients for Affordable Drugs Now.“Few organizations have done more to advance the issue of chronic disease and the pain endured by patients than the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease. Since its founding more than a decade ago, we have been one of many partners that have supported this vital organization,” said a PhRMA spokesperson in a statement. “The varying viewpoints each member brings to the table is one reason why the Partnership has been so successful in serving these vulnerable patients.”“It’s unfortunate the organization is under attack by those who are pushing extreme policies that will limit access to life-saving medicines and destroy the discovery of future treatments — many of which could help address the chronic disease crisis our country is facing,” PhRMA said, in an apparent reference to Patients for Affordable Drugs Now. PhRMA “helped launch” the partnership in 2007 with executive director Kenneth Thorpe, a former health care official under the Clinton administration, to help drug companies better court Democrats, according to a press report at the time. The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease identifies itself as “an international coalition of over 80 groups focused on highlighting the key role that chronic disease plays in the growth in healthcare spending.”But many of the groups the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease lists as partners distanced themselves from the ads, saying they were not consulted or haven’t been in touch with the group for years.“We certainly would not run that ad ourselves. We would not want our name on that ad,” said John Clymer, executive director of the National Forum for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, who served on the partnership’s advisory board from about 2008 to 2010. Clymer said he supports the partnership’s work on preventing chronic disease, but that his organization would have gotten input from members before launching an ad campaign.“We do not agree with the Partnership’s approach to communicating with or on behalf of kidney patients,” the National Kidney Foundation said in an emailed statement. The Cleveland Clinic, an academic medical center, said it was involved with the organization years ago but was not aware of any current activity with the group. The Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, a public health group, said it first partnered with the organization over a decade ago and does not support the ads. The SEIU, another group listed on the partnership’s website, said the union “strongly opposes” the ads. After CQ Roll Call contacted more than 100 groups listed as partners, the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease updated its website to read that the list “includes organizations we have partnered with on various projects and programs over the last 14 years but does not imply support for all of our public policy initiatives.”The partnership lists the “Lance Armstrong Foundation” as among its partnering organizations, but that nonprofit changed its name to the Livestrong Foundation in 2012 after the retired cyclist’s doping scandal. Thomas Oliver, professor of medicine and public health at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, said the partnership’s focus on preventive care for chronic diseases deflects attention from rising drug costs.“It’s a great idea but very insincere,” said Oliver, who follows the history of Medicare’s prescription drug benefits. “They’re basically saying, ‘Don’t blame us for having to rescue people who, for a variety of reasons including levels of activity and diet, have gotten very sick and require our really critical medications.’”“I think they’re trying to shift the spotlight away from a serious problem,” he added. There are other connections between the group and PhRMA: The group has over the past 10 years listed PhRMA employees as key officials on its tax forms. For example, PhRMA vice president Scott LaGanga was the group’s principal officer in 2014 and 2015, according to tax filings. LaGanga led a similar PhRMA-linked nonprofit opposed to pharmaceutical drug importation, the Partnership for Safe Medicines, until he stepped down in 2017. Despite its multimillion-dollar budget, the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease has reported no fundraising costs each year since its 2007 founding. Over the past few years, the partnership has signed onto letters to lawmakers and authored op-eds in favor of various under-the-radar policies that also were priorities of the drug industry. They include advocating to disband the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a cost-cutting measure decried by critics as “death panels,” and opposing a novel Nevada bill to bring down insulin prices. But the possibility of Medicare being able to limit the prices of some of the drugs it covers might be the biggest challenge the pharmaceutical lobby and its advocates have faced.“The day that Medicare gets the authority to negotiate drug prices, the entire U. S. prescription drug cost structure is going to be radically overhauled, and the uncertainty of all that is really unsettling for the industry,” said Oliver.",3,Reliable,0.0614768598202333,0.4077452667814114,1698,3,Roll Call

On Friday, Biden tore into social media platforms such as Facebook, accusing them of“killing people”by not cracking down on non-conventional opinions about vaccination fervently enough.“They're killing people... Look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they're killing people,""the US president said. Dismissing the allegation, Rosen accused Biden of essentially making Facebook a scapegoat for his administration’s failure to reach its self-imposed goal of having 70% Americans vaccinated by July 4.""President Biden’s goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed,”Rosen said, arguing that figures“tell a very different story to the one promoted by the administration.”Facebook, Rosen claimed, has seen a dramatic increase in confidence in Covid-19 vaccines among its American users in the last six months.“Since January, vaccine acceptance on the part of Facebook users in the US has increased by 10-15 percentage points (70% → 80-85%),""Rosen wrote, citing a recentsurveyby Carnegie Mellon University. He added that distrust of the jabs among racial and ethnic minorities has“shrunk considerably”as well. Facebook has deployed“unprecedented resources""in its fight against the pandemic, such as“pointing people to reliable information”and facilitating vaccine appointments, he noted. In addition to persuading people of the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines through pop-up labels under coronavirus-related posts, Facebook has been waging a war on information that does not align with the official stance of the World Health Organization (WHO) or local governments. Hailing its success in stamping out Covid-19“misinformation,”Facebook said it shadowbanned some“167 million pieces of Covid-19 content”deemed untrue by its fact-checkers, in addition to erasing 18 million“instances of Covid-19 misinformation.”In a thinly-veiled swipe at the Biden administration, Rosen pointed out that Canada and the UK, where Facebook has used“similar tactics,”had already hit the 70% milestone for first dose vaccinations. Some 68% of American adults have received at least one shot.

Bidenis proposing a significant increase in legal immigration as part of his new legislation that would also legalize most illegal immigrants. The bill, which Mr. Bidenwill send to Congress after he is sworn in Wednesday, is more a policy statement than a serious piece of legislation, with almost no chance of being enacted in a form close to how it’s written. But it lays down a marker for Mr. Biden, for whom immigration, more than any other issue, provides a stark contrast with President Trump. The bill would be the most generous immigration policy in U. S. history, wiping away barriers for illegal immigrants to integrate into American society. Mr. Bidenwants to end the bar that requires those who have been in the country for some time without permission to go home and wait 10 years before being able to come in legally. And he would create an opportunity for people who have been deported under President Trump to request to be allowed back into the country. The bill is light on new security measures, instead focusing on leniency and reversing the direction Mr. Trump had set. Where Mr. Trump had proposed ending the diversity lottery that doles out visas on the basis of luck, Mr. Bidenis proposing a nearly 50% expansion of that program.“The legislation modernizes our immigration system, and prioritizes keeping families together, growing our economy, responsibly managing the border with smart investments, addressing the root causes of migration from Central America, and ensuring that the United States remains a refuge for those fleeing persecution,” the Biden team said in detailing the bill. The crux of the bill is a generous legalization program for most of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country. It would grant immediate legal status to illegal immigrant Dreamers and those here under special humanitarian protections. Other illegal immigrants would have to go through a process with a five-year wait before obtaining a green card signifying permanent legal status. Both Dreamers and other illegal immigrants would get a new, speedy chance at citizenship, with just a three-year wait between a green card and eligibility to naturalize. Mr. Trump had proposed a much smaller immigration legalization in 2018, suggesting a deal that would combine an offer of citizenship rights to some Dreamers in exchange for border wall money, changes to the chain of family migration and an end to the visa lottery. Democrats rejected his suggestion outright, insisting they wouldn’t bargain for Dreamers. Before that, the previous major attempt at legalization came in 2013, when the so-called “Gang of Eight” senators came up with a broad bill that would have offered a chance at citizenship to between 7 million and 8 million illegal immigrants and a guest-worker program giving future workers a path to citizenship, too, in exchange for some new border security measures. Of those eight senators, all four Democrats and two Republicans are still in the chamber. One of them. Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, will take the lead on the new bill.“I know all too well from my work with the ‘Gang of Eight’ that passing immigration reform through the United States Congress will be a challenging task. However, there is a moral and economic imperative to get this done,” he said. One of the Republicans from the Gang of Eight, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, has already declared Mr. Biden’s plan a non-starter. He said there are too many other issues already stacked up, and besides, Mr. Biden‘s offer doesn’t include any new enforcement standards.“There are many issues I think we can work cooperatively with President-electBiden, but a blanket amnesty for people who are here unlawfully isn’t going to be one of them,” Mr. Rubio said",2,Generally Reliable,0.0560456315173296,0.4284118135533229,789,1,Washington Times

S. troops will pull out of Germanyas soon as is feasible, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday, but the ones who will bestationed back in the U. S.may be called up forrotational deployments back to Europe. Under the plan, troop levels in Germany would drop from 36,000 to just over 24,000, Defense Secretary Esper told reporters, with 5,600 of those re-positioned to other European countries and the remainder shifting to U. S. bases to be determined.“I want to note that this plan is subject to, and likely will, change to some degree as it evolves over time,” he said in his opening remarks. The plan would move at least two headquarters elements out of Stuttgart, Germany, and over to Mons, Belgium, according to U. S. European Command boss Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, specifically EUCOM and Special Operations Command, Europe. Africa Command, also based at Stuttgart, could also move out of Germany, officials said, though that decision will come with the completion of AFRICOM’s review. Elsewhere, an Air Force fighter squadron and support elements would move from Germany to Italy, while a group of 2,500 airmen who had been scheduled to shift from Royal Air Force Base Mildenhall, United Kingdom, to Germany will stay put, Esper said.“Once Warsaw assigns a defense cooperation agreement and burden sharing deal as previously pledged, there are may be other opportunities as well to move additional forces into Poland and the Baltics,” Esper added. In that way, he explained, troop presence in Europe will more closely mirror the new Eastern front. When the U. S. first began basing troops in Germany to deter the Soviet Union, it was one of the farthest east allies to work with. Now, with much of the former Soviet Union having joined NATO ― while still contending with Russian advances ― the U. S. has been spending more time working with troops in countries like Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and more.“These changes will achieve the core principles of enhancing U. S. and NATO deterrence of Russia, strengthening NATO, reassuring allies and improving us strategic flexibility and EUCOM operational flexibility,” he said. That partner training has been done by a mix of Germany-based units moving east for weeks at a time, as well as a U. S.-based Army brigade combat team rotating through. Rotations allow the Army, for example, to save the logistics of moving entire families to Germany and then sending soldiers to the field for short stints.“And I will say this much: the deployment rotational forces from the United States we have observed, whether it’s the [armored brigade combat teams] going from the United States to Korea with ABCT to Poland, or the bomber task force, we’re finding that they are deploying at a much higher level of readiness,” Esper said, citing other examples of rotational forces. “And while they are deployed, they are ... able to sustain a much more fixed focus on their mission and their capabilities. And they can, third, they can provide a more enduring presence.”The plan is part of a review of several combatant commands, which also includes U. S. Africa Command and the recently reactivated Space Command. Effects on the forceAssuming the administration’s plan is completed, the uprooting of EUCOM’s headquarters from Stuttgart to Belgium carries the symbolism that the days of Germany as the decades-old nerve center for American military might in Europe may be numbered. The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps also have European command headquarters in Germany. Pentagon officials are doing their best to blunt a more profound and potentially destructive re-ordering of the U. S. military footprint in Europe, according to retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who last commanded U. S. Army Europe in 2018.“It could have been worse,” he said, noting that any hasty moves from Germany in and out of Poland appear to be off the table.“Germany is still our most important ally in Europe,” he added, describing the White House reasoning driving the reshuffling as “wrong from the beginning.”As Pentagon leadership briefed reporters, President Donald Trump answered questions about Germany and NATO on the White House lawn.“Germany is not paying their bills,” he said. “They’re delinquent. It’s simple.”A non-mandatory target has NATO members paying 2 percent of their gross domestic product toward shared security costs by 2024, butfew of those countries are meeting that benchmark. That includes Germany, at an estimated 1.38 percent in 2019, but also Italy and Belgium ― who paid an estimated 1.22 percent and 0.93, respectively, last year. Poland has reached that goal.“Let’s be clear: I think Germany is the wealthiest country in Europe. Germany can and should pay more to its defense,” Esper said. “It should certainly meet the 2 percent standard, and I would argue, go above and beyond that.”The Pentagon’s plan was focused on maximizing readiness and reassuring allies, Esper said, while at the same time under pressure from the president, who has repeatedly targeted Germany. While Esper had hinted at rejiggering Europe force structure last year, he said that Trump’s rhetoric “accelerated” the plan.“If they start paying their bills, I would think about it,” Trump said Wednesday of Germany. Esper did not provide details on how many troops would be part of a new Europe rotation. By the math, 5,300 would be returning stateside. The Army in 2016, following a drawdown of several units based around Germany, began rotating an ABCT for nine-month stints, at about 4,700 soldiers each. On balance, the presence of U. S. troops in Europe might only be reducing by several hundred, when all is said and done. For the roughly 6,300 on tap to return home, some could be returning “in a matter of weeks,” Esper said, though the Pentagon will coordinate with both Congress and the services to decide which U. S. bases will absorb them. The planned return of the Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, based in Vilseck, Germany, to the United States is expected to leave a mark, according to Hodges.“That’s a tough one to swallow, because that is their assigned combat unit,” he said. On Capitol Hill, the decision has been met with bipartisan criticism that it was hasty and will damage America’s alliances. Both the House defense appropriations andpolicybills have provisions to bar the Germany drawdown. U. S. force levels have been lowered gradually over the years, in consultation with Germany and NATO, Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee said in atweetWednesday.“Trump is doing this on a lark. Likely just to embarrass Germany,” said Murphy, D-Conn. “No plan. No consultation. Making it a really bad idea.”Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah., called the plan “a grave error,” a “slap in the face at a friend and ally,” and “a gift to Russia coming at a time when we just have learned of its support for the Taliban and reports of bounties on killing American troops.” Romney has introduced an amendment to the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to block the removal of troops from Germany. What will it cost?The movement of both manpower and equipment comes with costs, which Esper described as “several billion dollars, I’d say single digits, but that’ll be spread out over time.”However, Hyten later indicated that a significant amount of detail has yet to be worked out, and stressed that any cost estimate is still in the early stages – a sign that costs could potentially grow.“The secretary said single digit billions, but those are rough estimates. What we have right now is really a concept ― a concept that we’ve shared with our allies, shared with the Congress, and we shared inside the department fairly widely,” Hyten said. “We now have to turn it into plans. As you turn into plans, we have a very structured process involving the Joint Staff, the office of the secretary, and the combatant commands and the services, to make sure we understand what those are, then we’ll lay in the costs.”The costs of the plan would come not just from military construction, but from the added expense of moving from based forces to rotational ones. In a 2017 studyfor the Army War College titled “Rotational Deployments vs. Forward Stationing,” author John R. Deniconcluded that it costs$135 million more each year to have a rotational brigade combat team in Europe, as opposed to having the force be permanently based in Germany.“We need to actually reach out to the potential locations where these forces are going to move, make sure we understand what is there, what can be there, and then turn those into real cost estimates, and then work with the Congress to get the resources,” Hyten continued. A2019 analysisby Rick Berger of the American Enterprise Institute found that the U. S. has invested $5.9 billion in construction for its German bases over the last two decades; while it is unclear is similar investments would be needed to build up new headquarters buildings and other infrastructure in Belgium and Italy, leaving behind empty facilities in Stuttgart and elsewhere may be seen by Congress as a waste of taxpayer dollars.“Some of those resources can be handled in-year execution,” he added. “Some will be handled out years, especially military construction.”Defense News reporter Joe Gould contributed to this report.

As of Saturday, there are a total of 88 large wildfires burning in the U. S., and they have already destroyed 1,456,925 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. With help from unprecedentedheat wavesanddrought, new fires are rapidly igniting, sometimes quicker than they can be contained. The fires, which have predominantly affected the western region of the country, have created nationwide air pollution and resulted in thousands of evacuations.""We're seeing an environmental change where we are more susceptible to these wildfires,"" said Josh Dozor, general manager of medical and security assistance at International SOS. ""It's growing in severity.""Using data compiled from Inciweb, a national wildfire tracker provided by the U. S. Forest Service, these are the country's five active wildfires with the largest acreage burned as of Saturday:The country's largest wildfire has burned 401,601 acres in Fremont-Winema National Forest, which is about 15 miles northwest of Beatty, Oregon. More than 2,000 personnel have worked since July 6 to contain the wildfire, which is when officials say it was first ignited by lightning and natural causes. As of Saturday, 42% of theBootleg Firewas contained. The fire is now the third-largest wildfire in the state's history, and islargerthan the entirety of New York City. Its smoke hastraveledas far as New York and Canada, according to images this week from the National Weather Service. The wildfire is now large enough tocontrolthe area's weather with its pyrocumulus clouds that can generate lightning. The quickly-spreadingDixie Firenear Feather River Canyon in Butte County, California, has burned 181,289 acres and is only 19% contained. The cause of the wildfire, ignited on July 13, is under investigation and more than 4,000 personnel are working to contain it. Dixie is currently the largest fire burning in California. Evacuation orders, warnings and closures have been issued for various counties in the area. Forecasters predict weather conditions will become hotter and drier this weekend, and incoming moisture in the air has the potential to create pyrocumulous clouds over the fire. There are chances for thunderstorms, which can also provoke the wildfire's activity.""The fire behavior conditions that we're facing right now are really quite unprecedented, and at a historical level,"" Cal Fire deputy incident commander Chris Waters said at a briefing Thursday. TheSnake River Complex Firehas burned 107,679 acres and was 74% contained as of Saturday. It is burning about 20 miles south of Lewiston, Idaho. Lightning ignited the fire on July 7, and although spot fires have sprung up daily outside of its control lines, the fire has grown slowly and is being contained by the 208 personnel assigned to its mitigation. On July 9, Idaho Governor Brad Little issued an emergency declaration and mobilized the state's National Guard firefighters to help combat the Snake River Complex fire, among others. The state is currently experiencing its worst drought in years, with 87.9% under severe drought, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System.""Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,"" Little said in astatement. ""I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.""The governor is planning to fly over the Snake River Complex wildfire next week. The Lick Creek (Dry Gulch) Fire has burned 80,392 acres across areas in Oregon and Washington State. Its perimeter has been contained by 75% and firefighters are focused on securing the fire's line and mitigating hot spots, according to Umatilla National Forestofficials. Lightning originally ignited several flames southwest of Asotin, Washington, on July 7. The following day, the fire merged with another nearby flame called the Lick Creek wildfire. More than 200 personnel responded to the fire which was described as having ""extremely dry"" fuels with a ""high resistance to control.""Morning operational update for the Lick Creek and Green Ridge fires for 7/22/21. Dry air has helped to keep the wildfire active, and a warm and dry weather trend is expected to continue throughout the weekend. Some roads and trails within the area still remain closed but certain evacuations have been lifted or downgraded. Lightning ignited the Tamarack Fire on July 4 approximately 16 miles south of Gardnerville, Nevada. As of Saturday, 65,152 acres have burned and it is was 4% contained. More than 1,000 personnel are fighting the fire. The fire has destroyed multiple structures and threatened at least 2,700 homes in Douglas County, Nevada, according to the state's governor Steve Sisolak, whodeclareda state of emergency in response to the wildfire on Friday. Road closures and evacuations are in place for various counties in the area. Local law enforcement said they will provide help escorting residents and their pets out of evacuation zones to a shelter in the area, according to the Alpine County and El Dorado County Sheriff's Office. Officials said at a meeting Friday to expect multiple large aircraft in the sky that will support personnel with fire retardant drops. Officials forecasted strong winds could contribute to extreme fire activity for the next 24 hours with poor humidity and high spreadability.""Thank you to all of our first responders, local government agencies, & nonprofit who continue to go above & beyond to assist our community during these trying times,"" SisolaktweetedFriday. Other significant fires this season include the contained Rafael Fire, which burned 78,065 acres in Arizona, the Creek Fire in California which has been completely mitigated and burned 379,895 acres and the contained Johnson Fire in New Mexico which burned 88,918 acres.",3,Reliable,0.0511041568872894,0.4539080999321965,1296,3,CBS News
196,An Abolitionist Approach To Addressing Sexual Violence Without Police,-12.8,41.4,https://shadowproof.com/2020/07/15/community-organizers-address-sexual-violence-without-the-criminal-justice-system/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-15,22,"When college student L. saw photos of her feet in a boy’s Snapchat, she felt scared. She had never consented to those photos being taken, let alone shared on a Snapchat account, where the boy was constructing a romantic narrative for both of them without her knowledge or permission. L.’s friends were furious on her behalf, threatening to beat up the boy who hurt her. When L. realized the situation might devolve into physical violence, she approached Jasmyn Elise Story’s organization and requested a restorative justice process (locations for this story have been kept purposefully vague for the anonymity of the involved parties). Story, an international restorative justice practitioner and the founder ofThe People’s Coalition, started the process of alternative justice—one that does not require the involvement of police or the criminal justice system but does require a commitment to accountability—through pre-conferencing with the victim and the boy who harmed her separately.“Pre-conferencing are the meetings that occur prior to any restorative process before we get to the actual dialogue about how we are going to move forward,” according to Story, who has worked as a restorative justice practitioner since 2014. “We practice and we meet and we work through that conversation ahead of time.”L. was concerned about the boy’s safety, but she also wanted to make sure the boy knew how much she hurt and scared her. Pre-conferencing asks participants to answer five restorative questions that confront the harm caused: What happened? What were you thinking at the time? What have you thought about since? Who’s been impacted and how?“The first step [to this kind of process] is to hear the survivor, hear their needs—and that doesn’t necessarily mean that we are doing a deep dive in their narrative and their story—but to understand what they are seeking and what does justice look like for them, and why they are looking for this particular process,” Story added. After both students had gone through pre-conferencing, L. was told that she had options for moving forward. She could meet face-to-face with him, there could be a letter-writing process, or she could request time and treatment before the conferencing section of the process, where victim and harm-doer dialogue with each other.“As a practitioner, I’m focused on what the survivor is going to need to be able to show up fully in the process that they choose, if it’s a face-to-face process, if it’s a circle process, if it’s a letter-writing process. My job is to figure out what they need to move forward and be able to participate,” Story shared. The process can be customizable to make the survivor comfortable, Story said. The survivor might need time or mental health support, or they might request the harm-doer go through therapy or substance abuse treatment before the conference, depending on what the harm was and the needs of the survivor. In L.’s case, she decided she did not want to speak to the harm-doer face-to-face and requested that Story brought her answers to the restorative questions to him.“What came out was that he wanted people at home to think he had a girlfriend, and he wasn’t even thinking about the fact that taking pictures without consent, sharing them on the internet without consent, building a narrative that is untrue without consent, is something that is terrifying. But this absolutely did not cross this student’s mind, and I would say that there were social cues that the student missed,” Story said.“Once this was clarified, the student was willing to be fully accountable to this, and he deeply understood that the extension of this process [to him] was really something he needed to be deeply grateful for as well because part of why this was being brought to us was fear of violence against this young man that the survivor could not handle being done in her name.”The process ended up being really positive; the harm-doer took responsibility and made the adjustments that were requested by L. and everyone was able to move on. L. also requested that Story inform her friends that justice had been achieved by her standards and that her needs were being supported. L.’s story is one example of a prison abolitionist approach to gendered harm, where harm against a woman is dealt with outside of the traditional criminal justice system. Recent public debates about police and prisons have brought upquestionsof the usefulness of police and the criminal justice system in cases of gendered violence. Critics of the criminal justice system and how it deals with rape and sexual assault point out that the current systemretraumatizes sexual violence survivors, that police can oftenbe perpetratorsof sexual and gendered violence themselves, and that some survivors are incarcerated forfighting backagainst their abusers. Story is a survivor of sexual violence and extremely open about their experiences with the criminal justice system and the ways it failed them.“The first thing that happens in a traditional carceral justice process is intake, and the only thing that’s happening to a survivor is invasive harm,” declared Story.“The gathering of a rape kit is a violent process, it is invasive, and depending on how fresh that physical harm is, it can be extremely, extremely painful. Then you have the fact-finding part of the piece which is even more invasive, where you have someone who is allowed to ask you whatever questions they feel relevant. It’s a completely arbitrary process that is to the discretion of whoever is sitting across the table from you.”Story and other abolitionists are also critical of the lack of support survivors receive from the system.“When it comes to support in America, in particular where we don’t have robust social welfare, what is provided to survivors is unbelievably poor. I’ll never forget the neon sheet of paper I was given with services I could tap into for a limited amount of time that the government was willing to pay,” they shared. This lack of trauma-informed care and support for survivors inspired twenty-five-year-old writer Nylah Burton to start ahealing fundfor Black survivors who were harmed at Howard University. Burton suffered sexual violence on the Howard University campus, and though filing a Title IX complaint against her attacker resulted in his suspension, the lack of care and support compounded by already existing mental health issues resulted in a derailment of her life. She is still recovering.“The reason that I started the healing fund was because I knew first-hand how those assaults can completely destabilize your life in ways that people don’t even think about,” she said. “I remember after the first time that I experienced sexual violence, my mother was incredibly abusive to me because she felt it was my fault. And that started a chain reaction that led to me losing my scholarship [at Howard], being estranged from my parents, having incredibly bad relationship problems, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the same time.”Burton’s experience with inadequate support and the subsequent unraveling of her mental state is common. It is part of what advocates call the “sexual abuse to prison pipeline.”A study from 2004 by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network revealed that if the trauma of sexual abuse in girls and women is not resolved, it may result in the further development of mental health problems andbehaviorsthat are criminalized.“At the very least you need money to get through that,” Burton said, referring to her fund that provides survivors with a stipend of $5000 for mental health care. Burton mentioned survivors might not be able to work for a while or that the assault might result in huge medical bills and impact a survivor’s career aspirations..“Dealing with the trauma of sexual assault delays your education, it delays so much [of your life]. The first person who abused me, he graduated med school, and I am just now being able to start this journey of thinking maybe I can go to med school too, and he’s literally a doctor now. I feel a lot of resentment about that, and I know a lot of survivors who didn’t graduate college and don’t know what they’re going to do next and are financially insecure.”Financial instability and poverty have beenproven to increasepeople’s vulnerabilities to sexual violence. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, theprevalenceof sexual assault increases dramatically as annual household income decreases.“The work of healing is so intense,” said twenty-six-year-old survivor Nisa Dang, when asked about structural issues she had to battle due to being a survivor. “Especially as someone who was unemployed and financially unstable [after the assault], it just added to the process of being retraumatized throughout so to be able to get a stipend to spend it however I need it would have been helpful.”Story suggested that the difference between a carceral and a restorative process is who is centered.“In a carceral process, the only reason the state cares about what happened is because the person who harmed you owes the state for breaking a law,” they added. “That means it’s never about you. It’s never about the harm that you’ve experienced. It’s never about the harm that your family has experienced. It’s never about the punitive damages that you as a survivor might take on, albeit paying for doctors, therapists, things like that. It’s solely about how the state gets repaid for having to go through this.”According to the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN), the vast majority of sexual assault perpetrators will not go to jail or prison, and a recent survey with survivors revealed that 20% wereafraid of police retaliationfor reporting a sexual crime. There are issues within the actual police force as well: one study revealed that the NYPDundercounted rapesin New York City for years and a 2018 study revealed thelack of trainingof police officers investigating sexual assaults in Austin, Texas.“The only thing that I ever wanted [after the assault] was the ability to feel safe again and to live in a society where it is normalized to discuss harm without it being litigated in court, without it being wrapped up in incarceration,” Dang shared. Collective Action for Safe Spaces (CASS), a grassroots organization in Washington, D. C., recognizes the need for safety for survivors without police. Originally a chapter of Hollaback, an organization that seeks to stop sexual harassment in public spaces, CASS works to prevent sexual violence without the involvement of police through workshops on masculinity and bystander intervention. It is an example of abolitionist work that seeks to prevent sexual violence before it happens, recognizing that the social problem of sexual violence is more complex and wide-ranging than penetrative rape.“We train local bars and restaurants in the hospitality industry on bystander intervention so if someone is being harassed or assaulted in real time in these public spaces, the restaurant and bar staff are equipped with the tools needed to intervene directly and in a way that does not involve the police,” stated Je’Kendria Trahan, executive director for CASS. “We also have our Rethink Masculinity program which is an eight-week cohort model where men and masculine of center folks come together to unpack toxic masculinity and rape culture and talk about building accountable communities.”While CASS did not start as a prison abolitionist space, Je’Kedria said they have organized around abolition and focused on the prevention of sexual violence because of the harm the system causes survivors looking for support.“By virtue of being in the decriminalization [of sex work] space, we were almost an oddball in the domestic violence and sexual assault world because some folks are very invested in carceral feminism,” she said. “Because we are now in this political moment of an uprising, it’s really important to make a decision about what side we are going to be on as folks are calling to defund the police. Let’s also think about how the money and the resources can be pulled away from the police and away from prisons and allocated into community-driven solutions that don’t cycle these instances of criminalization and harm.”CASS is an example of abolitionist work that seeks to prevent sexual violence before it happens, recognizing that the social problem of sexual violence is more complex and wide-ranging than penetrative rape. As someone expanding their experience as a restorative justice practitioner to other identity-based harms, Story has a similar perspective on justice and gender.“There is so much gender-based harm, and for the whole world and communities to solely focus on penetrative rape, penetrative sexual assault. I feel like that does survivors a disservice,” they said. In many ways, what survivors need to feel safe is a completely different world.“Everything that [survivors] are asking for is so simple,” Dang concluded. “The idea that I could have a night out with my friends and not have to form a barrier between them and a man. Or that we could be in spaces and be free and that if we were drunk, that was okay, and we wouldn’t be shamed or humiliated or harassed.”",3,Reliable,0.1235552995391705,0.5036479774705582,2843,2,Shadowproof
197,The World’s Most Technologically Sophisticated Genocide Is Happening in Xinjiang,-0.33,43.67,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/15/uighur-genocide-xinjiang-china-surveillance-sterilization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-15,25,"Two recent disturbing events may finally awaken the world to the scale and horror of the atrocities being committed against the Uighurs, a mostly secular Muslim ethnic minority, in Xinjiang, China.

Customs and Border Protection of 13 tons of products made from human hair suspected of being forcibly removed from Uighurs imprisoned in concentration camps. Both events evoke chilling parallels to past atrocities elsewhere, forced sterilization of minorities, disabled, and Indigenous people, and the image of the glass display of mountains of hair preserved at Auschwitz. Two recent disturbing events may finally awaken the world to the scale and horror of the atrocities being committed against the Uighurs, a mostly secular Muslim ethnic minority, in Xinjiang, China. One is anauthoritative reportdocumenting the systematic sterilization of Uighur women. The other was theseizureby U. S. Customs and Border Protection of 13 tons of products made from human hair suspected of being forcibly removed from Uighurs imprisoned in concentration camps. Both events evoke chilling parallels to past atrocities elsewhere, forced sterilization of minorities, disabled, and Indigenous people, and the image of the glass display of mountains of hair preserved at Auschwitz. TheGenocide Convention, to which China is a signatory, defines genocide as specific acts against members of a group with the intent to destroy that group in whole or in part. These acts include (a) killing; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm; (c) deliberately inflicting conditions of life to bring about the group’s physical destruction; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Any one of these categories constitutes genocide. The overwhelming evidence of the Chinese government’s deliberate and systematic campaign to destroy the Uighur people clearly meets each of these categories. Over a millionTurkic Uighursare detained in concentration camps, prisons, and forced labor factories in China. Detainees are subject to military-style discipline, thought transformation, and forced confessions. They are abused, tortured, raped, andeven killed. Survivors report being subjected toelectrocution,waterboarding,repeated beatings,stress positions, andinjections of unknown substances. These mass detention camps are designed to cause serious physical, psychological harm and mentally break the Uighur people. Therepeatedgovernment ordersto “break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections, and break their origins”; “round up everyone who should be rounded up”; and systematically prevent Uighur births demonstrate a clear intent to eradicate the Uighur people as a whole. Ekpar Asat(brother of one of the present authors) is an emblematic example of how Uighurs are targeted regardless of their recognition as model Chinese citizens by the Communist Party. Asat was praised by the government for his community leadership as a “bridge builder” and “positive force” between ethnic minorities and the Xinjiang local government. But Asat still suffered the same fate as over a million other Uighurs and disappeared into the shadows of the concentration camps in 2016. He is held incommunicado and is reported to be serving a 15-year sentence on the trumped-up charge of “inciting ethnic hatred.” Not a single court document is available about his case. In 2017, Xinjiangwageda brutal “Special Campaign to Control Birth Control Violations,” along with specific local directives. By 2019, the governmentplannedto subject over 80 percent of women of childbearing age in southern Xinjiang to forced intrauterine devices (IUDs) and sterilization. The goal is toachieve“zero birth control violation incidents.” Government documentsreveala campaign of mass female sterilization supported by state funding to carry out hundreds of thousands of sterilizations in 2019 and 2020. This goes far beyond the scale, per capita, of forced sterilization inflicted on women throughout China under the past one-child policy. To implement these policies, the Xinjiang governmentemployed“dragnet-style” investigations to hunt down women of childbearing age. Once apprehended, these women have no choice but to undergo forced sterilization to avoid being sent to an internment camp. Once detained, womenfaceforced injections, abortions, and unknown drugs. And statistics show that the government is meeting its birth prevention goals. Between 2015 and 2018, population growth rates in the Uighur heartlandplummetedby 84 percent. Conversely, official documents show that sterilization ratesskyrocketedin Xinjiang while plunging throughout the rest of China, and the funding for these programs is only increasing. Between 2017 and 2018, in one district, the percentage of women who were infertile or widowed increased by 124 percent and 117 percent, respectively. In 2018, 80 percent of all IUD placements in China were performed in Xinjiang despite accounting for a mere 1.8 percent of China’s population. These IUDs can be removed only by state-approved surgery—or else prison terms will follow. In Kashgar, only about 3 percent of married women of childbearing age gave birth in 2019. The latest annual reports from some of these regions have begun omitting birth rate information altogether to conceal the scale of destruction. The government has shut down its entire online platform after these revelations. The scale and scope of these measures are clearly designed to halt Uighur births. With Uighur men detained and women sterilized, the government has laid the groundwork for the physical destruction of the Uighur people. At least half a million of the remaining Uighur children have beenseparatedfrom their families and are being raised by the state at so-called “children shelters.”What makes this genocide so uniquely dangerous is its technological sophistication, allowing for efficiency in its destruction and concealment from global attention. The Uighurs have been suffering under the most advanced police state, with extensive controls and restrictions on every aspect of life—religious, familial, cultural, and social. To facilitate surveillance, Xinjiang operates under a grid management system. Cities and villages are split into squares of about 500 people. Each square has a police station that closely monitors inhabitants by regularly scanning theiridentification cards, faces, DNA samples, fingerprints, and cell phones. These methods are supplemented by a machine-operated system known as theIntegrated Joint Operations Platform. The system uses machine learning to collect personal data from video surveillance, smartphones, and other private records to generate lists for detention. Over a million Han Chinese watchers have been installed in Uighur households, rendering even intimate spaces subject to the government’s eye. The Chinese government operates the most intrusive mass surveillance system in the world and repeatedly denies the international community meaningful access to it. It is therefore incumbent on us to appreciate the nature, depth, and speed of the genocide and act now before it’s too late. Recognizing or refusing to name this a genocide will be a matter of life or death. In 1994, by the time U. S. officials were done debating the applicability of the term to the situation in Rwanda, nearly a million Tutsis had already been slaughtered. A document dated May 1, 1994, at the height of the genocide, by an official in the Office of the Secretary of Defensestated: “Genocide finding could commit [the U. S. government] to actually ‘do something.’” Four years later, President Bill Clinton stood before Rwandan survivors and reflected on his administration’s historic failure andvowed: “Never again must we be shy in the face of the evidence.”With the passing of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, the U. S. government has begun to take steps in the right direction to avoid another human catastrophe. Seventy-eight members of Congress havefollowed upwith a call for the administration to impose Magnitsky sanctions on the responsible Chinese officials and issue a formal declaration of the atrocity crimes, including genocide. So far, the administration has officiallyimposedMagnitsky sanctions on four Chinese officials and an entity in charge of the Orwellian surveillance system and responsible for the expansion of the internment camps in Xinjiang. The U. S. government must now make an official determination of genocide. This will not be difficult, as U. S. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus has alreadyassertedthat “what has happened to the Uighur people … is potentially the worst crime that we have seen since the Holocaust.”A formal declaration of genocide is not simply symbolic. It will catalyze other countries to join in a concerted effort to end the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang. It will also prompt consumers to reject theover 80 international brandsthat profit off genocide. Furthermore, the determination will strengthen legal remedies for sanctioning companies that profit from modern slavery in their supply chains sourced in China and compel business entities to refrain from profiting from genocide and commit to ethical sourcing. In our interconnected world, we are not only bystanders if we fail to recognize the genocide as we see it.

While Broward County waits for the vaccine, it has been gearing up how to distribute it to the public, likely involving heading to places such as parksfor vaccinations. Early details of the plan came to light at a recent meeting with the county’s mayors. Dr. Paula Thaqi, the director of the Florida Department of Health in Broward, told the mayors the following:Parks:Vaccination sites will be running simultaneously with testing sites at county parks, such as perhaps Markham Park in Sunrise. “We have plans in place for mass vaccination,'” Thaqi said. Tents:Thaqi called mass vaccinations a “logistical Herculean effort” that will include a myriad of equipment and supplies including “more tents than we ever thought as a health department that we would possibly own.” She said, “We are as ready as it is possible to be.”Freezers:There’s the necessity of having freezers capable of storing the vaccine at the necessary temperature, and Broward County already has planned for that. “We have prepared our warehouse to handle the super-cold vaccine. We purchased those freezers early on, not knowing whether we need them or not, but in anticipation and in an abundance of caution,” Thaqi said. Tracking:The state will use Florida’s State Health Online Tracking System, an immunization registry also known as SHOTS, to document who is getting the vaccine and to provide reminder messages for people who need to get a second dose. Any problems:There will be a 24-hour phone number to report any problems, or “adverse events,” from the vaccine, which then will be reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state submitted a draft vaccination plan to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in October. And there will be a phased approach to vaccination by creating priority groups who are the first to be vaccinated. Those vaccinated first would include health care workers, first responders, residents and staff at long-term-care facilities, members of the population who have high-risk medical conditions and people ages 65 and older.",3,Reliable,0.1508333333333333,0.4675000000000001,499,3,Sun Sentinel

Lindell vowed ahead of the 72-hour event that began in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on Tuesday to show conclusive proof that China hacked voting machines in the 2020 election in favor of President Joe Biden— thus costing Trump victory. But after the second day on Wednesday,there was no such evidence. Instead, a cyber expert hired by Lindell to decrypt and analyze what the pillow peddler called “irrefutable” data reportedly said it was unrecoverable in its current state and could not prove hacking.“So our team said, we’re not going to say that this is legitimate if we don’t have confidence in the information,” Josh Merritt toldThe Washington Times, adding that Lindell has now canceled his $5 million reward for anyone who can disprove his wild claims. Former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, meanwhile, criticized Lindell for repeatedly airing a 15-minute “documentary” on election fraud, calling it “a mistake.”“I want to be brutally frank. I think there’s so much work to get through the day. It’s now time to really get to the details,” said Bannon. “You’ve laid a theory of the case out here that’s very powerful, but in laying that case out, you’ve got to bring the receipts.”Lindell also found out Wednesday that his attempt at dismissing Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation lawsuit against himhad been shot downby a federal judge.

And thankfully, the time for change has come—alongsideJoe Biden securing his spot as the 46th president of the United States,Kamala Harris has made historyas the first Black womanandAsian American personto be elected vice president of the United States of America. And she’s not the only one—her husband, Doug Emhoff, is a legend in the making too. With Joe and Kamala’s win, Doug gets the ✨ sparkly✨ new title of (future) Second Gentleman of the Unites States. But if you’re wondering what the hell that even means and you want the 411 on Kamala’s hubby, we’ve got you covered. Below, find every bit of info you need to get acquainted with Doug since you’re gonna be seeing a lot of him in the next four (or possibly…eight?) years. Aside from cheering on Kamala 24/7, Doug is a graduate of the University of California’s law school. Doug previously served as a litigator and partner with a specialization in entertainment and intellectual property law at DLA Piper law firm. Some ofhis notable accomplishmentsincluded “representing the rights holders of a famous animated character in copyright and trademark disputes” and defending a “prominent former NFL and Olympic athlete in a civil action brought by the SEC.”After Kamala and Joe won the election,Doug revealed that he would be leaving the firm to give more time to his role as Second Gentlemanat the White House. To match his new title, Doug created a@SecondGentlemanTwitter account, featuring the cutest political bio of all time: “Future Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff. Devoted dad. Proud husband to Vice President-Elect Harris.”Doug will also be following in the footsteps of Dr. Jill Biden andbegin working at Georgetown University’s Law Centeras a professor for a two-credit course on his specialty: entertainment law disputes. “I’ve long wanted to teach and serve the next generation of young lawyers,” Dougsaid in a statementto the university. “I couldn’t be more excited to join the Georgetown community.”No Tinder, Bumble, or Raya to be seen here, y’all. Instead of using apps to forge a connection, Doug and Kamala met the old-fashioned way—through a close friend! The two were set up to go on a blind date by Kamala’s close friend, PR consultant Chrisette Hudlin. According to Chrisette, Doug “said something to the effect of, ‘She’s really hot,’” she told. “He was complimenting her and at the same time he was admiring her, and I liked that.” And get this—the next morning after their date, Doug emailed Kamala and said, “I really like you.” (Meanwhile, I’ve been waiting a good 72 hours for a text back. 😭😭😭)Just a year after Doug and Kamala started going steady, he popped the question—thereportednews of their engagement on March 27, 2014. Doug kept things pretty low-key by asking Kamala to marry him at her apartment while agonizing over which takeout they should get. The simplicity of their engagement set the tone for their wedding later down the line!After four months of being engaged,Kamala and Doug tied the knot in an intimate courthouse ceremony. Why so fast? Well, Kamala straight-up toldthat she doesn’t “believe in long engagements,” so…¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Nevertheless, Doug and Kamala’s wedding sounded pretty cute—Kamala’s sister, Maya, officiated the wedding while a cellist played in the courtroom. Doug and Kamala wrote their own vows, and Kamala’s niece Meena read from Maya Angelou’s poem “Touched by an Angel,” which ends with the eye-watering words, “Suddenly we see / that love costs all we are / and will ever be. / Yet it is only love / which sets us free.”Kamala honored Doug’s Jewish heritageby breaking a glass, andDoug honored Kamala’s heritageby wearing a flowered garland around his neck during the ceremony. This is what they looked like on their actual wedding day, d’awww:Doug and Kamala are both 56, and believe it or not, their birthdays are justDoug’s birthday is October 13, while Kamala’s is October 20…making them bothLibras! The hallmark traits of Libras—thatthey just hate injusticeand are fabulous diplomats—totally check out. (See: their career choices.)Before marrying Kamala, Doug was previously married to his ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff (cofounder and chief executive of production company Prettybird), with whom he shares two children—Cole and Ella Emhoff. According to, Cole graduated from Colorado College, while Ella studies at New York’s Parsons School of Design. Cole and Ella love Kamala so much that they call her Momala. You probably would too ifshe brought you cookies when meeting you for the first time(while wearing her trusty Converse sneakers, of course). For all you lil nosies out there sniffing for drama, there is none to be seen—Kamala is actually “dear friends” with Kerstin and once said, “Our modern family is almost a little too functional.” In a personal essay writtenfor, Kamala spoke about their family bond in detail and said:Expect to see Doug hitting up golf courses when he isn’t busy teaching or completing his Second Gentleman duties. Doug loves golfingand also had a fantasy football team back in the day named after the band Nirvana, LOL. He’s also not too shabby in the kitchen. Speaking about Kamala in thefeature, Doug said, “She spends days thinking about the menu, grinding her own pepper, driving all over town just to find that one ingredient that we need.…I’ve gotten pretty handy in the kitchen as her sous chef.”“Our relationship and the way I roll, my whole life has just been to support the people I love unequivocally, and they support me,” Doug told. “The whole thing has been based on parity and mutual respect.” Aww, you just can’t beat that, can you?",2,Generally Reliable,0.1640762428708857,0.448598656634371,1414,1,Cosmopolitan

Kathy Hochul, following allegations detailed in a state Attorney Generalproberevealed disgraced ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomosexually harasseda female trooper working on the same detail. An internal memo was sent Thursday notifying all troopers that the head of the agency’s NYC Troop, Major Douglas Larkin, will take over the governor’s Protective Services Unit from Dave Dively effective next week. The change wasfirst reportedby the Albany Times Union on Friday.“Superintendent [Kevin] Bruen directed a thorough internal review of all aspects of the PSU, which resulted in recommendations to professionalize the unit, including changes to leadership and procedures,” trooper spokesman Beau Duffy told The Post in a statement. Staff Inspector Jennifer Gottstine will oversee the change and “include the appointment of permanent rank commissioned officers to the unit’s command staff,” the agency said. Dively is a ‘technical’ lieutenant who has served on the detail for 11 years but did not take the necessary exams according to agency requirements that would permit him to lead and instead will be transferred to the NYS Intelligence Center, the paper reported. AG Letitia James’ bombshell sexual harassment report released Aug. 3 concluded Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women — one of them identified as “Trooper #1.”In the report, the trooper told investigators that the former governor ran his hand or fingers across her stomach and back, kissed her on the cheek and openly ran his hand over her abdomen as she held a door open for him, making her feel “completely violated.”The ex-pol also asked her for help in finding a girlfriend and asked her why she didn’t wear a dress, according to the report. Cuomo’s personal attorney Rita Glavinhas admittedCuomo “may have touched” the trooper’s back, but in recent weeks wrote a letter to the state Assembly Judiciary Committee — which is in the process of finalizing a report on Cuomo’s harassment allegations as well as other topics — where she denied the ex-pol sexually harassed all 11 women in the AG’s report. When asked during a Wednesdaypress conferencehow many women Cuomo allegedly harassed, Glavin said defiantly “none.”She has since asked James’ office to amend parts of the report in a 150-page submission and appoint an independent investigator to oversee her request.“I think in any organization recovering from a scandal or a shakeup like that I think it’s normal they do a shakeup in internal personnel — whether it’s a big fortune 500 corporation or any large state police organization,” PBA of New York State Police President Tom Mungeer told The Post.“The members of the detail took a first and foremost seat in that investigation. There were definitely some problems with members of the detail that led to the [former] governor’s demise, by no fault at all with the troopers and that female trooper was a victim in all this.”He said Hochul is within her right to make changes within the unit.“If she sees there is a necessity for change, she has the authority to do so,” he said, adding Larkin has “been a friend for over 20 years” and is “a very capable leader.”",3,Reliable,0.0893421459492888,0.3537255205112348,721,2,New York Post

Some cried. Most cheered. Kalitta Air 4371, with service to March Air Reserve Base in California, landed to refuel in Anchorage on the night of Jan 29. The cargo plane had been hastily converted to accommodate passengers and commissioned by the State Department to bring 201 Americans home. And while planes landing safely seldom make the news and delays rarely make anyone happy, this one did both. It came from Wuhan. The passengers kept cheering as the 747 taxied to the gate. At that time, World Health Organization officials still insisted that human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus seemed unlikely, and they wouldn’t declare a global health pandemic for another 42 days. But listening and watching from his home office, Alaska’s chief executive came to his own conclusion.“You just knew something was up,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy told RealClearPolitics of the cheering expats and crying diplomatic staff. “This isn’t a cold. This isn’t the ordinary flu.”Medical professionals were screening the passengers one by one when Dunleavy realized it was a matter of time before the virus would come to the last frontier. “We just wanted to do everything we could to prepare,” he explained. “We stood up, our response, right after that.”Much of that responsibility went to Adam Crum, commissioner for the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. The State Department had called on Saturday. The governor gave the go ahead. Crum had four days to prepare, “but really we didn't know much about this virus at all at that point in time,” he recalled. So, they took every precaution, turning a terminal at Ted Stevens International Airport into an impromptu screening station: negative pressure systems, first responders geared head to toe in personal protective equipment, and hospital beds ready to go. The cheers were also the first thing Crum heard, and it was a relief. Rumors had circulated once news broke of the flight from Wuhan that “we were letting a ‘death plane’ land in Alaska filled with the plague.” No one knew the exact nature of the virus, let alone the mortality statistics. The onboard jubilation was an early sign that their worst fears wouldn’t be met. Among the most extreme contingency plans: How would Alaska store dead bodies of Americans coming back from Wuhan with the state’s already limited morgue capacity? Officials prepared to use cold storage warehouses at the Department of Fish and Game and Department of Natural Resources. The freezers stayed empty. None of the passengers needed emergency medical care either, except for one woman who had broken her hand boarding the plane. Still, Crum and his team often began conversations with the Centers for Disease Control by warning that “Alaska has a very delicate health care system.”Alaska has mirrored many of the actions taken by states in the Lower 48. There are stay-at-home orders and schools are out for the rest of the year, and everything from bars to bingo halls are closed. The governor also went farther with an emergency order: Anyone entering the state must declare a designated quarantine location and self-isolate for 14 days. Ignoring that edict is a Class-A misdemeanor that could come with a $25,000 penalty or a year in jail. And, so far, it has worked. This week Alaska has only 329 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and nine deaths, according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services.“There is no doubt that a major contributor to Alaska’s lower case counts to date is the fact that our state and local leaders, particularly Gov. Dunleavy, took decisive action early to implement broad community mitigation interventions,” wrote state epidemiologist Joe McLaughlin. But the big advantage of Alaska -- its 663 million square miles and fewer than 1 million people -- is also its biggest disadvantage. Villages are isolated, Crum explained, but people there are densely packed together. Alaska has nearly double the national average of homes defined as overcrowded. “While we can keep it isolated,” Crum said of the virus, “if it finds its way into some of these communities, it would spread like wildfire.”The state, in good times, has hospital capacity for 2% of the population, and Alaskans have a saying that there is just a week’s supply of groceries within its borders at any given moment. This makes for a different pandemic experience than that of other states. So do the snow machines and bush planes ferrying medical supplies and personnel to the farthest north, east, and west corners of the country. Bad luck has also made for good pandemic preparation. Alaska has a history of tuberculosis outbreaks and regularly battles sexually transmitted infections. “And so,” Crum explained, “our epidemiologist teams are well versed with public health nurses to do contact tracing and getting into small areas to find out what exactly is going on.”Alaska is also drawing from its own grim institutional memory of the great influenza outbreak that swept the world a century ago. “We have villages that existed at 1918 that don't exist anymore because of the Spanish flu,” Dunleavy explained. His team knows the history. According to University of Alaska professor Katherine Ringsmuth, “More people per capita died from influenza in Alaska than almost anywhere else in the world.” “Fake news” was a thing back then, too. Nothing to see here, the Anchorage Daily Times assured its readers back in 1918: “Don’t be alarmed,” it proclaimed, “over influenza in Anchorage.” Then, when it became clear that alarm was just the right response, pleas came from Alaska to Congress for relief – pleas that fell on deaf ears: A $200,000 request was cut in half by the Senate and then voted down by the House. But the money flows north without impediment this time, and the governor is hell-bent on keeping a second tragic chapter from being written. Abbott testing machines are being delivered via snow machines, and Alaska feels better about its preparations for this pandemic. Dunleavy is not afraid. After all, this state is populated by the most unconventional of citizens — global health crisis be damned. There is a reason, they say, why people move to a frozen place, an unbroken motivation for living in Secretary William Seward's infamous “icebox.”The White House has not forgotten the nation’s northernmost citizens. The administration would rather let them figure out the particulars while Washington figures the broad strokes. This works for Mike Dunleavy. But the Republican governor won’t go as far as his colleagues. The state parks remain open. “We are a free people in this country,” he said. “We believe that in Alaska we are an even a freer people, and so to be able to go out and do what you want, as long as you stay six feet away from others, is fine.”Salmon season is just around the corner, and the governor is planning on how to let fisherman reap the harvest while following federal social distance guidelines.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0400538548752834,0.4355962348309287,1530,2,RealClear Politics

Perhaps you got the same chain email I did: did you know over 50 individuals connected to President Bill Clinton have died in mysterious circumstances?The conspiracy relied on a combination of innuendo and statistical ignorance. Most of the ""Clinton connections"" aresimply fabricated: a cashier killed by a robber was actually an ""accountant for the CIA."" The dozen or so deaths remaining seems high, but tens of thousands of people are vaguely ""connected"" to a president: Four Marines who were killed in a helicopter crash were listed because Clinton was on the helicopter two months earlier. A new, woke version of the body count conspiracy has cropped up in liberal circles, with mysterious government assassins targeting protesters of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.""Puzzling number of men tied to Ferguson protests have died,"" readsthe Monday headlinefrom the Associated Press. Other outlets have expanded on this innuendo: ""Deaths Of Six Men Tied To Ferguson Protests Prompt Fear Of Sinister Connection""; ""Deaths of six men tied to Ferguson protests alarm activists""; ""Deaths of Ferguson activists lead some to believe something sinister is at play.""Despite its ""puzzlement,"" the AP cites police statements noting most of the deaths weren't murders and also the crime rate and lack of mental health resources available to black Ferguson residents. But the AP also takes a bizarre ""both sides"" approach to the issue, quoting activists insisting there is something sinister going on, perpetrated by shadowy ""white supremacists or police sympathizers."" The deaths are listed out one by one, often with clarifying details omitted. The result of the framing is the far left cited the AP story on social media as vindication for the conspiracy. News service the AP finally covered the horrific story of the Black liberation activists who have ""mysteriously"" died in what looks an awful lot like assassinations, with this euphemistic headline:Puzzling number of men tied to Ferguson protests have died— Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton)March 18, 2019When lots of activists suspiciously die in adversary countries, the US press doesn’t hesitate to conclude it’s assassinations by the evil government authorities.

(@AudaciousBeat)March 18, 2019I think this is an Occam's Razor situation guys— Eoin Higgins (@EoinHiggins_)March 18, 2019As with the Clinton conspiracies, the ""Ferguson body count"" is less scary when considering that thousands participated in the 2014 protests, the deaths took place over a span of five years, and that some of the dead men's connections to the protests are dubious.""Deandre Joshua's body was found inside a burned car blocks from the protest. The 20-year-old was shot in the head before the car was torched,"" the AP reports. What they omit is that Joshua's family say henever joined the protests. His inclusion in the list likely stems fromviral rumorsat the time that he was killed after testifying in the Michael Brown case, another claim his family denied.""MarShawn McCarrel of Columbus, Ohio, shot himself in February 2016 outside the front door of the Ohio Statehouse, police said. He had been active in Ferguson,"" the AP writes. McCarrel was a member of the Ohio branch of Black Lives Matter, but henever actually participated in the Ferguson protests. If an out-of-state activist is counted as ""tied to Ferguson,"" then the pool of those ""tied to Ferguson"" is likely hundreds of thousands, so large that six deaths is a drop in the bucket. AP reports that ""24-year-old Danye Jones was found hanging from a tree in the yard of his north St. Louis County home."" However, as they note, it was hiswho was active in Ferguson, not him. She insists her son's death was a lynching, butpolice saythere was no sign of a struggle and the family themselves reported it to police as a suicide. This leaves us with only three deaths of actual Ferguson protesters. Yes, ""Edward Crawford Jr., 27, fatally shot himself in May 2017 after telling acquaintances he had been distraught over personal issues,"" but AP omits that he did so in front oftwo witnesses. Bassem Masri was found dead of a fentanyl overdose on public transportation; AP omits he was open about his history ofheroin addiction. Darren Seals was killed in the same manner as Deandre Joshua, likely prompting the conspiracy theories in the first place. But aDaily Beast investigationfound four other men in the Ferguson area were also found shot in cars that were set on fire, with three killings confirmed to be carried out by locals. It seems to be a common MO in the area to burn cars to destroy forensic evidence. Seals also sadly fits the profile of the sort of man who might find himself caught up in violent crime. ""Caught my first felony at the age of 18 for slamming a cop on his head. Wasshot 7 timesand had a smile on my face the whole time,"" he wrote ina Facebook post. Those seven bullets were the second time he had been shot; his murder was the third. Even within the Ferguson protest movement he was a divisive figure, once physically attacking fellow activist DeRay McKesson in a parking lot. The ""Ferguson body count"" is only plausible if you exclude all exculpatory evidence, insist every police statement is a lie, and failed high school statistics. It's distressing to see activists pushing such a deranged conspiracy theory, but it's even sadder to see media outlets fanning the flames.

Adam Kinzinger won’t rule out a statewide run",-3.67,46.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2021/1/13/22229969/illinois-gop-rep-adam-kinzinger-trump-impeach-republican-party,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-13,25,"WASHINGTON — By speaking out against President Donald Trump’s crazy, dangerous conspiracy theories and being the first Republican to call for Trump to be thrown out of office after the Capitol siege, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., has gained fame and outsider status in his own party. What does he do with this? “I just don’t know,” Kinzinger said in a Wednesday call, a wide-ranging conversation with Illinois reporters. Kinzinger said he was not “plotting or planning any statewide run; I won’t rule it out.”For now, as Republicans reckon with the coming post-Trump presidential era, Kinzinger said “it would be a fool’s errand” to run “until we know where the party’s going.”We spoke on the day Trump became the only president to be impeached twice. Kinzinger has been in very high media demand since the Trump-inspired mob of domestic terrorists attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, leaving five dead in their wake. He was one of 10 Republicans to vote for impeachment Wednesday and was the only Republican to join with Democrats on Tuesday to vote for a measure calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25thAmendment to force Trump out. Now Kinzinger, 42, is at a crossroads. Nationally and in Illinois, the Republican Party is divided between the Trumpists and election deniers and mainstream conservatives, like Kinzinger, a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard. He is in his sixth term in Congress, representing a district south and west of Chicago. He faced no primary foe in 2020 and won reelection with 64.71% of the vote. Illinois Republicans are hunting for candidates to challenge Gov. J. B. Pritzker and Sen. Tammy Duckworth in 2022. Illinois Democrats will also be carving new district maps, with Illinois to lose one or two seats in Congress. Pritzker has every incentive now to draw a very favorable map for Kinzinger — pack it with GOP precincts — to encourage the best known Republican in Illinois to stay in Congress.“I think the next few months will determine — I think there’s going to be a lot of reckoning in this party about how did we get here, how we were led here, what did we do wrong, what did we do right. …“And I think the next few months will tell; does this party, you know, to use kind of a crude analogy I’ve been using, does it wake up Saturday morning from a Friday night bender and look around and say, ‘What did we do?’”“There’s no doubt that if this party continues to hold on to this idea of a stolen election, anger, conspiracies and division, there’s probably not a bright future for Adam in it. And quite honestly, I’m not sure if I would want” a future with that kind of party “in that case.”“But if we begin to wake up and figure out what conservatism is … I will be part of this battle to redefine this party.”“I’ve heard from friends that don’t want to be friends with me anymore. ... I’ve had family members who are somewhat distant relatives sign a petition disowning me,” citing “Bible verses and that I was part of the devil’s army. That actually reemboldened me because I believe that we are fighting, you know, against a lot of misinformation, where even people that are Christians have been misled.”",3,Reliable,-0.0248248992386923,0.5142924814648953,759,3,Chicago Sun-Times

Critics of“cancel culture”-- a movement that seeks to call out offensive behavior -- denounce it as excessive and say it is contributing to increased political polarization. However, the claims in the posts are false on several accounts. Six books, out of a collection of 50 Dr. Seuss titles that were independently reviewed, are beingpulledbecause of imagery now considered racist. The publisher of the bestselling children's books made the announcement on March 2, 2021 which would have been the author's birthday. Dr. Seuss Enterprisessaidit made the decision last year -- before Biden became president -- to take six titles out of print: “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,” “If I Ran the Zoo,” “McElligot’s Pool,” “On Beyond Zebra!,” “Scrambled Eggs Super!,” and “The Cat’s Quizzer.”The six are currently unavailable for sale on the officialDr. Seuss’ website.“These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,” the company said in its statement, making no mention of governmental involvement in the decision. Seuss' books have sold more than 650 million copies and have been translated into dozens of languages. Contrary to what some Facebook posts claim -- linking the decision to the current administration -- the reevaluation over the portrayal of Black, Arabic and Asian people in the Dr. Seuss catalog, that led to the decision, has been long in the making. A February 2019 study published in the""Research on Diversity in Youth Literature"" journalexamined 50 of Seuss’ books. The report concluded that 43 of the 45 characters of color had ""characteristics aligning with the definition of Orientalism.""Postsstatingthat “The Cat in The Hat” has been “canceled” are misleading. The 1957 children's book is not part of the six discontinued Dr. Seuss Enterprises titles. However, “The Cat’s Quizzer” displays the main character from that book. In February 2021, toy manufacturer Hasbrosaidit was dropping the honorific from the “Mr. Potato Head” logo and packaging ""to promote gender equality and inclusion.""But the product’s rebranding does not mean “Mr. Potato Head” will cease to exist. The iconic action figure, known for starring in the Pixar franchise “Toy Story,” will continue to be sold in stores but known simply as ""Potato Head.""A non-gender-specific version of the toy, in which children add facial characteristics and clothes to the body of plastic spuds, will hit shelves in the fall. Their new product is a kit “that includes enough potatoes and accessories for kids to create all types of families,"" Hasbro told AFP in an email. The companytweetedthat Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters “aren’t going anywhere,” and would still be available for purchase. Hasbro also included a visual of what could be the new packaging and branding. Hasbro did not associate the rebranding of the toy with a governmental decision or to Biden himself. Moves by classic brands for more inclusive toys and books are not new this year. Barbie creator Mattel released a line of""gender-inclusive”dolls in 2019, after a series with more inclusivebody typesreleased in 2016. For years , retailers have alsoembraceda more gender-neutral approach to marketing and selling their children’s toys. In 2015, for example, Targetannouncedit would stop labeling toys for boys or girls in its stores. The part of the claim which says Donald Trump “took down” ISIS is misleading. The former president was in office when the Islamic State group, often referred to as ISIS, was defeated. However, it was not the US but local forces inIraqandSyriathat played the decisive role in victories over the jihadists, with America focusing on providing them with air support, equipment and training. And while Trump was president at the time the jihadists' last major strongholds were retaken, the strategy of having local forces lead the fight was put in place by hispredecessor Barack Obama.",3,Reliable,0.0648423335923336,0.3259245384245384,970,3,Agence France-Presse

The state’s death toll of 4,406 has now remained steady since Monday, according tostate data. The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University reported Wednesday evening that 142, 677 Americans have died from COVID-19. The number of hospitalizations also remained mostly steady, with the state reporting only one additional hospitalization, for a total of 63. That slight increase comes one day after a more significant uptick — the state was down to 54 hospitalized patients on Monday, before reporting an increase of 8 on Tuesday. Despite the fluctuations and occasional increases in hospitalizations, that number is still a fraction of what the state at the peak of the pandemic. In mid- to late-April, the state had nearly 2,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus. In addition to hospitalizations, Gov. Ned Lamont has repeatedly pointed to positivity rate as a key indicator of the success of the state’s coronavirus response. Positivity rate is found by dividing the number of new cases by the total number of tests conducted. It’s used to gauge whether a state is conducting enough testing — a lower positivity rate indicates that a state is identifying a larger proportion of its actual coronavirus cases. Connecticut officials have touted the state’s low positivity rate, which has hovered around and often dipped under 1%. In early July, the positivity rate dipped as low as 0.5%, and neared that low again on July 10. But on Wednesday, the rate ticked up slightly. The state reported 127 new cases out of a total of 11,529 tests, for a positivity rate of 1.1%. With the new cases reported Wednesday, the state now has identified a total of 48,223 coronavirus cases. Connecticut’s risk score increasedOn Tuesday, an initiative called Covid Act Now released a ranking of states’ coronavirus risk level — and Connecticut was the only state labeled “green” or “on track to contain COVID.”Connecticut officials, includingLamontand chief operating officerJosh Geballe, posted about the ranking on social media and applauded the state’s efforts. But on Wednesday, thestate’s ranking was downgradedto “yellow” or “controlled disease growth.” Covid Act Now added a new metric to its ranking system, which changed the rankings for nine states, including Connecticut. The ranking now also accounts for daily new cases per capita.“We understand that taking into account [this new metric] has increased the risk score for many states and counties,” said Covid Act Now in an announcement. “This change may be disheartening, but we believe it is important for our COVID risk score to reflect risk as accurately as possible.”Connecticut is now one of only 10 states labeled “yellow.” There are no states currently labeled “green.”This story has been updated.

J., authorized plans to build a monument to transgender civil rights activist Marsha P. Johnson. According to Union County officials, this would make Johnson the first transgender person in the country to be honored with a monument. ABC News reportsthat city officials met with the Johnson family on Thursday to officially announce their plans to erect the monument. The Johnson family played a pivotal role in creating the proposal for the monument, which will be located near downtown Elizabeth across from the Thomas Jefferson Arts Academy. In October, the family will host a series of events in partnership with the county for LGBTQ History Month that will allow the community to engage with the planning process of the monument.“Today, the family of Elizabeth native and LGBTQ+ Civil Rights activist Marsha P. Johnson was joined by Union County Freeholders and LGBTQ+ advocates to announce the future site of a public monument on Freedom Trail in the City of Elizabeth in Johnson’s honor,” a statement from the county read. “The monument is anticipated to be the first public monument in the State of New Jersey to honor a LGBTQ+ person and transgender woman of color.”Johnson was an outspoken advocate for trans and LGBTQ rights for over two decades until her tragic deathand is said to have played an instrumental role in the Stonewall uprising of 1969. Johnson and others fought back against a group of New York City cops who attempted to raid the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in the Greenwich Village. She also founded the Street Transgender Action Revolutionaries, anorganization intended to provide assistance to homeless transgender youth. She died in 1992 at age of 46 when her body was found in the Hudson River. Her death was initially ruled a suicide, but the case was reopened in 2012 following pleas from her family alleging foul play was involved. Her death still remains unsolved to this day. This is not the only honor bestowed upon Johnson this year, as last week New York Governor Andrew Cuomo dedicated East River State Park to Johnson on what would’ve been her 75th birthday. Similar to the monument, it is the first state park in the country to be dedicated to a transgender person. There are plans to improve conditions in the park as well as add a public art piece celebrating Johnson’s life and the role she played in the LGBTQ movement, according to a statement.“Marsha P. Johnson was one of the early leaders of the LGBTQ movement, and is only now getting the acknowledgement she deserves. Dedicating this state park for her, and installing public art telling her story, will ensure her memory and her work fighting for equality lives on,” Cuomo said in a statement.",3,Reliable,0.067739898989899,0.3439709595959595,555,1,The Root

In the last few weeks, there have been major recoveries of dozens of children. In Ohio, authorities are working on what's called ""Operation Safety Net"" through the month of October. Twenty-five children ages 13 to 18 have been rescued in less than three weeks. The operation is still underway with the cooperation of the Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force across the northern part of the Buckeye State. The task force is made up of about 350 men and women from 125 different departments across the state, according toWHSV-TV. The television station reports there are about 200 children who have been reported missing in Northeast Ohio right now. Operation Safety Net recovered 25 missing children in its first two weeks, and the sting is continuing right now: current operation has targeted cases in northern Ohio, but WHSV reports at least one child was found from as far away as Miami, Florida.""Sometimes the situations they—they go to, believe it or not, maybe better than the situations they left from,"" US Marshal Pete Elliot told Cleveland-basedWOIO.

Nine suspects were arrested on sex trafficking charges in that case. Of those 39 victims, authorities reported 15 of them were being human- and sex-trafficked. A third effort — ""Operation Moving Target"" — led to the arrest of 27 men in Ohio who had been engaging in sexually explicit conversations with undercover agents posing as children.""As we have seen the number of cyber tips dramatically increase this year, it is clear that online predators remain a serious threat to our children,"" said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley. ""Hopefully, the success of yet another operation serves as a stern warning to offenders that you will be found, you will be arrested, and you will be prosecuted.""And in Flint, Michigan, back in mid-August, seven children were rescued and 17 people arrested on child trafficking charges. That was all part of an effort to find 27 children who disappeared from schools, hospitals, probate courts, and the foster care system, according to theDetroit News.

214,Trump’s White House Lawyer Don McGahn Finally Talks to Congress,-13.0,34.25,https://thebulwark.com/trumps-white-house-lawyer-don-mcgahn-finally-talks-to-congress/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-04,6,"This morning, Donald Trump’s first White House counsel, Don McGahn, isscheduled to testifyabout his former boss’s obstruction of justice in a closed-door congressional hearing. McGahn’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee comes in response to a longstanding congressional subpoena relating to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the Mueller probe seems like ancient news, the contents of thereport—the first volume of which inquired into Russia’s attacks on the U. S. election system and the second into Donald Trump’s acts of obstruction of justice relating to the Mueller investigation—have yet to translate into meaningful accountability for either of the biggest fish in that scheme: Russian President Vladimir Putin and his pal Donald J. Trump. Which is why the impending McGahn testimony is important. The outstanding McGahn subpoena dates back to April 22, 2019. McGahn refused to comply, claiming absolute immunity. Litigation ensued, culminating in a2-1 rulingby the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit on August 30, 2020. The court held that the House of Representatives’ lawsuit seeking to enforce the subpoena must be dismissed, on the novel notion that the House Judiciary Committee lacks what’s called a cause of action to enforce its subpoena—i.e., a law giving that body a means to invoke the courts for relief. On the literal eve of his retirement, Judge Thomas Griffith wrote for the majority that the decision doesn’t prevent Congress “fromenforcing a subpoena in federal court; it simply precludes it from doing so without first enacting a statute authorizing such a suit.” The dissenting judge, Judge Judith Rogers, would have lodged a congressional right to seek judicial relief in Article I of the Constitution itself. Without a means for enforcing its constitutional powers, in other words, Congress’s enumerated powers are meaningless. Sadly, regardless of the legal merits of Judge Griffith’s analysis, the notion of turning to Congress for action is cold comfort these days. This is precisely the maneuver that the Supreme Court took in its fateful 2013 decision in, in which Chief Justice Roberts penned a majority opinion effectively gutting Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, under which the Department of Justice for decades successfully staved off state legislative efforts to suppress black and brown voters from exercising the franchise. Despite multiple bipartisan votes in Congress to renew Section 5, the Supreme Court declared the 1965 law too stale for its tastes and sent it back to Congress for an update. Fast-forward to 2021. As the country reels from an insurrection over a legitimate presidential election and the Republican party requires its leaders to swear loyalty to the deluded liar who lost that election and instigated that insurrection, theJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act—Congress’s answer toShelby County—still lingers untouched in the Senate. Bottom line: Congress is broken, leaving the courts all the more crucial to preserving accountability and democracy. What finally ended the impasse in the McGahn case was the election of Joe Biden as president and the confirmation of his attorney general, Merrick Garland. The Biden Justice Department, which is representing McGahn in this dispute because it inherited the case from the last administration, informed the D. C. Circuit that it had reached “an agreement on an accommodation” with the Judiciary Committee, and that “former President Trump, who is not a party to this case, is not a party to the agreement in principle regarding an accommodation.” Today’s testimony will be confined to the publicly available portions of the Mueller report that document the information McGahn gave to Mueller’s team over the course of30 hoursof meetings during that investigation. Congress had asked the D. C. Circuit to rehear the adverse 2-1 ruling—that is, with the full panoply of judges present, rather than just three—and that hearing was scheduled for May 19. It has now been indefinitely postponed, due to the agreement. Volume II of the Mueller report, which outlines ten “discrete acts” of Trump’s obstruction, is laden with details derived from McGahn, who backed former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision to recuse himself from the probe, twice refused to order then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller, and spoke the truth publicly about Trump’s efforts to get rid of Mueller. According to Trump adviser Steve Bannon,Trump “screamed at McGahn”when he declined to talk to Sessions about his recusal. Arguably, McGahn ably walked the tightrope between his duty to the rule of law and the obstructionist demands of his uniquely irascible and narcissistic Oval Office boss. It is difficult to see how McGahn’s Judiciary Committee testimony could move the accountability needle in any meaningful way, although it’s due to be made public at some point, and some details will likely be leaked soon. In light of Senate Republicans’ cynical refusal to support a bipartisan January 6 commission on their own terms, nothing is likely to move in Congress when it comes to Trump. If there is to be accountability for the unseemly abuses of his time in office, it will have to come through the ongoing state and municipal criminal inquiries in New York and Georgia, if at all. Still, it’s nice to know that government can function again; after all, the Republican Senate acquitted Trump on obstruction of Congress over his blanket hostility to any congressional subpoenas whatsoever. The fact that Congress, the Biden White House, and the courts are working together to salvage the Article I subpoena power that Republicans gave away under Trump is a step in the right direction for the separation of powers, although a tiny one.",2,Generally Reliable,0.083050283050283,0.4717365967365966,1268,2,The Bulwark
215,Media Fail to Identify Xenophobia as Biden Says Trump ‘Rolled Over for Chinese’,-23.33,33.67,https://fair.org/home/media-fail-to-identify-xenophobia-as-biden-says-trump-rolled-over-for-chinese/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-21,25,"As Covid-19 and its economic effects clearly dominate all else politically, ads for the Trump campaign are ramping up the anti-China rhetoric in an effort to deflect blame. The first attack ad Donald Trump launched since Joe Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee was titled “Biden Stands Up for China” (4/9/20), while a pro-Trump super PAC is airing multiple ads (4/16/20,4/16/20) painting Biden as cozy with China. One ad warned China is “killing our jobs, stealing technology and putting us in danger with Covid-19”; the other concluded, “Now more than ever, America must stop China. And to stop China, you have to stop Joe Biden.”Rather than respond by focusing blame for the crisis squarely where it belongs—on Trump’s incompetent, reckless and self-centered management—and working to beat back thedangerously risinganti-Asian sentiment in this country, Biden and some of his supporting super PACs are choosing to adopt rather than challenge the anti-China premise of the attacks. The pro-Biden super PAC American Bridge released an ad (4/17/20) that announced in a menacing voiceover: “[Trump] gave China more than praise. He shipped China 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies. Ourmasks and supplies. Supplies we need now.”The Biden campaign put out its own ad (4/18/20) accusing Trump of being the one who’s too cozy with China, saying he “rolled over for the Chinese” and “didn’t hold China accountable” for its own management of the pandemic. As theNation‘s Jeet Heer (4/20/20) pointed out, using the phrase “the Chinese” here is particularly problematic, as it conflates China’s government with Chinese people—many of whom live in the United States. And the obsession (shared by much of the media) with “holding China accountable”—i.e., making China a scapegoat—continues to prioritize aggressive us-vs.-them international posturing over international cooperation and looking for lessons from China’s ultimately successful drive to control the virus’s spread inside its country (FAIR.org,3/24/20). The responsible way for media to cover this campaign battle would be to call out these xenophobic Yellow Peril ads for what they are. But while some journalists are able to do so for the pro-Trump ads, far fewer are questioning the pro-Biden ads. After Trump’s April 9 ad, a team ofNew York Timesreporters (4/10/20) managed to call the ad “xenophobic”—though its decision to characterize his rhetoric as merely “exploit[ing] racial discord” rather than fomenting it reveals the paper’s continued adherence to its executive editor’s insistence that it must not directly call Trump racist (FAIR.org,11/22/19). The Washington Post‘s John Wagner (4/10/20), noting that the ad included an image of former Washington State Gov. Gary Locke, said it “appeared to be suggesting that Locke is a Chinese official at a time when Asian Americans face rising bigotry and blame for the coronavirus outbreak.”But when media later included the pro-Biden response ads, criticism was in short supply. While Trump’s xenophobia and racism are unparalleled in contemporary mainstream US politics, and therefore easy to identify, it’s certainly possible—and urgent—to point out xenophobia and racism frombothmajor parties, without at the same time falling into the common media fallacy of creating a false equivalence between them. Reporting a week later on both sides’ ads and rhetoric on China, a separateNew YorkTimesteam (4/18/20) labeled the GOP strategy an attempt “to divert attention from the administration’s heavily criticized response to the coronavirus by pinning the blame on China.” But the reporters merely found it “striking” to see both Biden and Trump “attempt to portray each other as captive to Beijing.” The piece also described, without commentary, the American Bridge ad. Meanwhile, in aPostfollowup (4/18/20) about Trump’s efforts to link Biden to China, the team of reporters let the rival super PACs offer the only commentary on their ads. And a piece by thePost‘s Michelle Ye Hee Lee (4/19/20) on the American Bridge ad couldn’t get past bland press release-style descriptions in its more than 500 words: “Trump and his allies increasingly are seizing on China’s role in the spread of the novel coronavirus to attack Biden,” while the ad “aims to counter the Trump operation’s narrative.”Like the New York Times, theLA Times(4/17/20) called Trump’s strategy “xenophobic,” but offered no similar analysis of the pro-Biden messaging. ABC‘sThe Note(4/20/20) appeared to buy in to the ads’ political messaging, arguing thatpinning blame on China could draw bipartisan agreement—particularly as more evidence emerges that the Chinese government knew more than it was letting on months ago.(It’s worth reiterating that Chinaalertedthe World Health Organization about a peculiar form of pneumonia on December 31, 2019, when just 27 cases had been recognized, none of which had yet turned fatal; it was not until a week later that Chinese scientistsidentifiedthe novel coronavirus as the culprit. China declared a lockdown in Hubei Province on January 23, after 18 deaths had been counted nationwide; by comparison, thefirst statewide stay-at-home orderin the US was issued on March 19, by California, after 200 national deaths.)OnCNN(4/19/20), hostDon Lemonaired a clip from Biden’s ad and commented, “The Biden campaign turning the tables on the president there, because Trump has been trying to say that Biden is the one who is too cozy with China.” Contributor Garrett Graff likewise had no critique of Biden’s ad:Yes, and it’s hard to believe that this administration could get away with saying Joe Biden is soft on China, given the extent to which President Trump is on record praising China over the course of this entire presidency, let alone just in the last couple months during the pandemic. MSNBC‘s Joe Scarborough (4/18/20) went so far as to rave about Biden’s ad: “This is the most devastating political ad I’ve seen in years. It reveals the truth about Trump and China, and that truth is ugly.”Over atNBCNews.com(4/18/20), Sahil Kapur laid out the issue for readers:The back-and-forth shows the extent to which the deadly virus, which experts say originated in the city of Wuhan, has turned China into a powerful election-year issue, with both major party candidates scrambling to get on the right side. It’s a classic media formulation, but of course it’s not the virus that turned China into a powerful issue—it’s political leaders, aided and abetted by their media accomplices. And unfortunately, the “right side”—the one that seeks to end both the pandemic and xenophobia—is largely missing from the media at the moment.",2,Generally Reliable,0.049769721019721,0.412934102934103,1633,2,FAIR

I think we'll find irregularities that is going to say, you know what, there’s this many dead people voted, or this many who may have voted that don’t live here anymore. We’re going to find those,” Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, a Republican, said on Arizona PBS.“We know those exist, but everybody keeps saying, ‘You have no proof.’ Well, maybe we'll get the proof out of this so we can fix those holes that are there. I hope there’s no fraud there—I don’t even like using the word, because that would truly shake the utter ground of everything we believe in in our election system. But if—and I mean a big if—there is, then it will be turned over to the authorities, they can take care of it and the Senate will do whatever we can to close down those loopholes,” she added. Fann and others involved in the process have seen harsh criticism from Democrats, including Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. On MSNBC on Thursday night, Hobbs called the audit a “circus” and said people from across the political spectrum have called her office expressing concern about it.“They have been able to see what a sham it is, and that it is not actually a real audit, and that it’s not going to determine anything different about the election than we already know, that it was a free and fair election,” she said. In addition, the Arizona Democratic Party tried halting the audit, claiming the auditors were violating the law with lax security and poor ballot handling. Fann said the audit is not about changing election results, which saw Democrats win the presidential race and a U. S. Senate race. She said it is about restoring confidence in elections among the approximately half of voters that polls indicate distrust the entire election system. Democrats “do not want this audit done,” she said on television on Thursday. “They talk about conspiracy theories, but I'll tell you what there’s almost like a reverse conspiracy theory now as to trying to demean this audit. I’m going to be very, very clear here because this is something that just isn’t getting reported enough. This election is not about [former President Donald] Trump, it’s not about overturning the election or electors or anybody else. This is about 49 percent of Arizona voters have no confidence in our election system,” she said. The county chose two firms that only certify machines, and one of them, Pro V&V, certified the machines to begin with, she said.“That is not a forensic audit,” she said. The current process, on the other hand, is reviewing all of the nearly 2.1 million ballots cast in 2020, in addition to thoroughly investigating the tabulators and other machines used.“I was hoping that they would be a little further along than they are right now,” Fann said, but added she was pleased with the progress. “It’s a huge undertaking. It’s the first time anybody’s every done this to this magnitude.

Harris, meanwhile, has a background as a prosecutor, so the debate between the two of them — which, as Pence mentioned, is set for October — doesn’t exactly seem poised to go as well for the Trump team as Pence imagines.

218,The Iran nuclear deal.,-1.67,46.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/iran-nuclear-deal-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-23,16,"What should Biden do?We’re diving into the Iran nuclear deal — with views from the left, right,(I’m trying something new with foreign policy pieces). It’s a deep dive, so we’re also skipping the reader question today. But we’ve got a brand new podcast for your ears, a very important story on policing and some fascinating numbers about coronavirus in the U. S. Of all the topics readers have written in and asked me about, money in politics is probably one of the top three. Last week, I sat down with Anna Massoglia from OpenSecrets, a non-partisan non-profit that tracks “dark money” in campaign spending. We talked about what dark money really is, how that money is influencing the politics you see, how it flows through politicians’ coffers and why it’s so hard to track. You can listen by. If you enjoy it, please don’t forget to give us a five-star rating! It’s really important for getting the word out. The Iran nuclear deal (formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). Let me start by saying there are many layers to the Iran deal, so we won’t be able to cover everything here. The deal was signed in 2015, and the rough outlines of it were designed to prevent Iran from attaining nuclear capability. Iran had to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium, a key ingredient in making nuclear weapons, and also allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to have regular access to and conduct inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities. In exchange, the U. S. and other European nations lifted economic sanctions on Iran and freed up Iranian money that had been frozen in overseas accounts. Former President Trump withdrew the U. S. from the deal in 2018, citing its shortcomings: that it didn’t allow the inspection of military sites, that the so-called “sunset provisions” allowed the deal to expire, that it didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program and that it did nothing to limit Iran’s influence in the Middle East (The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, funds military groups, proxy groups and terrorism across the region). He also accused Iran of cheating on the deal. Trump replaced the deal with a maximum pressure campaign of crippling sanctions on Iran and leveled strikes against Iranian leaders, including the assassination of General Qassim Suleimani and the United States’ alleged approval of the assassination of a nuclear scientist named Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Now, Joe Biden is deciding whether to re-enter the JCPOA. On Thursday, his Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, told European foreign ministers that the United Statesplanned to join themin seeking to reinstate the 2015 accord. But Blinken has also said that simply restoring the old deal would not be enough. He wants to rein in Iran’s ballistic missile capability and its support of terrorist groups and governments in the region, stipulations Iran has already said are not on the table. Meanwhile, in Iran, scientists have begunproducing uranium metalbanned under the 2015 deal, citing America’s withdrawal. It’s a clear effort to use the nuclear threat to pressure the new Biden administration into lifting sanctions. Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani have said they were open to a synchronized approach, similar to 2015 — which would mean both countries acting in unison, rather than tit for tat. But Iran also has a presidential election in four months, meaning Rouhani will soon be out of power. Rouhani is considered a moderate by many in the West, and since he is finishing his second term, cannot run for re-election. In Iran, the president is the most powerful elected leader, but is second in command to the country’s Supreme Leader — in this case, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei appears more skeptical of negotiations and has said that Iran abided by the deal only to be hurt by Trump’s withdrawal. Right now, a Khamenei-aligned party in Iran is favored to win the presidential elections, which could substantially change Iran’s posture in the coming months. All of these negotiations are further complicated by arocket attackon a U. S.-led military base in Kurdish northern Iraq last week. The attack, executed by an Iran-backed militia, killed a civilian contractor and wounded five other people, making it the most deadly attack on U. S.-led forces in nearly a year. Today, we’ll look at perspectives from the left, right, Iran, and then my take. The left mostly wants to see Biden rejoin the JCPOA, believing it’s the best way to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. But some say Trump’s failed “maximum pressure” approach has pigeon-holed the Biden administration.“That will be a tough sell in Tehran — and understandably so,”Bonnie Kristian wrote in Business Insider. “For all its many flaws, the Iranian government was infull, independently-verified compliancewith the JCPOA when former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States and re-imposed punitive sanctions three years ago. Trump thought he could strongarm Iran into a better deal, but the message Tehran received — as Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif madeeminently clearrecently — was that Washington is untrustworthy and will punish Iran regardless of compliance.is the bad faith Biden must overcome.”Dennis Ross, a former special assistant to President Barack Obama, suggested Biden not rush back into the deal. Instead, Ross wrote Biden should try a “less for less” deal, providing limited relief from sanctions in exchange for halting uranium enrichment and reducing (but not eliminating) the current stockpile Iran has built out.“It would scale back the Iran nuclear program in a way that would extend its breakout time and make it less threatening; it would maintain our overall sanctions regime, thus preserving our leverage; it would buy time to try to achieve the longer-term agreements that the president-elect seeks, which he hopes on the one hand will extend the sunset provisions in the nuclear deal and on the other produce parallel understandings on ballistic missiles and Iran’s regional behavior; it would make it far easier to gain some Republican buy-in given their almost uniform opposition to the JCPOA, even as it would reduce the Iranian nuclear threat Trump is leaving.“Finally, it would be more likely to reassure the Israelis, Emiratis and Saudis who fear an early return to the deal, and the lifting of all nuclear-related sanctions will give the Iranians little reason to change their threatening regional behavior,” Ross wrote. Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst, wrote that “Iran has never been in compliance with the JCPOA,” citingIranian violationsthat were allegedly revealed when Israeli spies stole documents from an old Iranian warehouse. Fleitz called for five preconditions to rejoin the deal: a permanent ban on Iran enriching uranium; the elimination of sunset provisions that expired in 2020, or will in 2023 and 2025; a deal that “must neutralize” Iran’s ballistic-missile program for meddling in Middle East disputes; a deal that creates buy-in from Middle East partners like Saudi Arabia, and a deal that gets submitted to the Senate to be ratified as a treaty.“The Biden administration must recognize that there are no shortcuts to a good agreement with Iran and be willing to walk away if Tehran will not agree to the above preconditions,” he wrote. “The U. S. can always keep the Trump administration’s successful Maximum Pressure strategy, with its strong sanctions, in place until Iranian leaders are prepared to negotiate in good faith.”Eli Lake said that Iran’s proxies have “been busy” since Joe Biden took office.“This month alone, Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed credit for adrone attackagainst Saudi Arabia’s Abha airport; one of the most prominent critics of Hezbollah, the journalistLokman Slim, was found murdered in his car in Lebanon; and in Iraqi Kurdistan, a front group for one of the country’s most deadly Shiite militiasclaimed creditfor a series of rocket attacks in and around Erbil,” he wrote.“At the very least, Biden should halt any efforts to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal so long as Iran’s proxies are running wild,” he said. “While it’s true that Biden and his top advisers see the 2015 deal as a way to forward U. S. interests by temporarily limiting Iran’s enrichment of uranium, Iran also has an interest in ending the secondary sanctions that the U. S. re-imposed in 2018. Biden has more leverage, at the moment, than Iran. An even better option for Biden would be to adopt a version of his predecessor’s policy toward Iranian proxies. Former President Donald Trump’s administration did not bother with distinctions among the offshoots, factions and militias that Iran supported. If a militia attacked U. S. forces in Iraq, the U. S. attacked the militia in response.”In The New York Times, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the U. N., said that “even during the last months of the Obama administration, the United States was not as faithful a partner as we hoped.”“As if the withdrawal wasn’t enough, the Trump administration repeatedly pushed the region to the brink of a catastrophic war,” he wrote. “The assassination of Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian military commander, in January 2020 was the most important of these provocations, to which was added the brazen assassination of our eminent scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in November. Yet despite these provocations and the fantasies of some Trump administration officials of regime change in Iran, the Middle East has not exploded into a major conflagration. For our part, we have been prudent and patient.“The accord was specifically designed to deal with the nuclear issue, and nothing else,” he added. “Other elements of Iran-United States relations have nothing to do with the agreement and cannot be intertwined with it. Still, if fully implemented, it can be a basis for mutual respect that would be to the benefit of all parties. But Mr. Biden and his administration should know that any delay in the lifting of sanctions will be construed as a sign of continued animosity toward the Iranian people. Iranians are suffering from this unjust blockade on our economy, and the responsibility for this suffering lies squarely with the United States.”Seyed Mohammad Marandiechoed these arguments in Middle East Eye, saying Biden’s only path toward solving the crisis was implementing the nuclear deal in full — which means lifting sanctions.“The US, which has surrounded Iran with military bases and long threatened Iranians with death and destruction, cannot seriously believe that Iran will negotiate away its military advantages, nor withdraw its support from allies who have severely curbed western imperial ambitions,” Marandi wrote. “How can Iran negotiate with the incoming Biden regime whenfour Iranian nuclear scientists, including one of my colleagues at the University of Tehran, were murdered during his vice presidency?… No matter how much western analysts claim otherwise, there will be no negotiations over Iran’s defense capabilities, its regional alliances, or changes to the nuclear deal. Iran didn’t resist years of Trump’s inhumane brutality in order to appease Biden.”Let’s assume for a moment the expert consensus thatMarc Lynch and Shibley Telhami citein The Washington Post is accurate. 75% of scholars say rejoining the JCPOA reduces the chance of Iran developing a nuclear weapon. The next question is: what is the likelihood of them developing one without a deal? And what is the cost of doing the deal in the first place?Say, for argument’s sake, there is a 1 in 10 chance of Iran getting a nuke without the JCPOA and a 1 in 50 chance of them getting a nuclear bomb with a deal. In a vacuum, that’s a perfectly good reason to do everything possible to make the Iran nuclear deal happen. But what if having a deal (which lifts sanctions and gives the Iranian regime more cash flow) means, say, an 8 in 10 chance the Iranian government is funding terrorism and proxies across the region, while not having a deal means a 1 in 10 chance Iran is funding terrorism across the region?To me, the best argument for staying out of a deal is that I might rather have a 1 in 10 chance of a nuke and a 1 in 10 chance of funding terrorism — via a maximum pressure campaign — than a 1 in 50 chance of a nuke and an 8 in 10 chance of funding terrorism. Of course, the math isn’t as simple or crude in the real world, and the equation is complicated by all sorts of things. Number one is that the Iranian people are suffering greatly under U. S.-imposed sanctions, and while that may turn them against the leadership in Iran it’s also going to turn them harder against the West. They know who to blame. Two is that there is no plausible scenario where Iran stops funding proxies, terrorism, or whatever you want to call their influence across the Middle East. Exerting power in the region is how they keep their sovereignty, and no matter how much we limit their resources through sanctions, the Iranian regime is going to squeeze out as much influence across Iraq, Syria and other parts of the region as they can. From the Iranian perspective, why should we get to decide where they can spend their money?The way Eli Lake describes Iran’s proxies as “running wild” is a bit misleading. On the contrary, it’s very deliberate and calculated. It’s also totally rational: if Iran is on its best behavior, then they have nothing to cede in negotiations. By responding with aggression, Iran can say “okay, we’ll knock that off so long as you do x, y and z.” The framing of this as irrational behavior is a very Western and, frankly, patronizing view of the Iranian regime’s position. The choice we face seems to be this: Would we rather have Iran with a well-funded network of proxy groups and influence in the Middle East, or have them be a few steps away from a nuclear bomb? By having a deal, we are legitimately stopping the latter. There’s been a lot of fear-mongering about Iran’s alleged violations, and there’s no doubt the regime (like any nation’s leadership) has been deceitful about its military capabilities. But we had complete access, and by the terms of the deal and the IAEA’s reports,it appeared to be working. I also struggle to see how Trump’s “maximum pressure campaign” has benefited our position. Some argue we are in a better negotiating position now, but crushing Iran with sanctions hasn’t actually eliminated its influence in the Middle East, nor has it stopped them from flexing their ability to get a nuke (on the contrary, they seem emboldened and justified in their violations of a deal we’re no longer a part of). It’s been two years since the U. S. pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and they are closer now than they were then to a bomb. They’re also making it clear they can still cause mayhem in the region. The major difference between now and then is the Iranian people are suffering under a broken economy. I’m resisting the urge here to make a claim about what the best path forward is — I’m not entirely sure, and I don’t feel any need to stake out a position. I’m hoping there are people smarter than I am who can navigate these choppy waters, but there’s no doubt the waters are choppy. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court judge ruled against police unions and allowed New York officials to release discipline records on officers that have been kept secret for decades. In the wake of the George Floyd protests this summer, New York repealed a law that shielded the records from being released. Unions sued to prevent their release, but ProPublica published the records while the release was temporarily halted by a federal court. The unions argued that releasing the records, which contain some allegations that are unproven, would harm future job prospects and put officers in danger. The fight to unveil the records of police conduct is happening not just in New York, but in cities across the United States. (ProPublica)We’ve got some treats for you…For all the horror happening in Texas, there have also been a number of feel-good stories. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) raised $4.7 million in relief for the state through a fundraising effort (CNN). La Riv, a local restaurant in Temple, Texas, is giving out no-questions-asked free meals to anyone who requests one (KTWX). A delivery driver who got stuck in a family’s driveway ended up being taken in for six days when the storm worsened and power outages persisted (Today). When the power went out in one Texas grocery store, the managers simply allowed everyone to take their groceries and leave without paying (WPXI).",3,Reliable,0.0894187828208446,0.3817070200704222,3705,3,Tangle
219,Donald Trump is making a huge mistake,-23.67,19.67,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/donald-trump-is-making-a-huge-mistake/39570/,https://adfontesmedia.com/palmer-report-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,25,"When the late Christopher Hitchens was asked if he were shown irrefutable proof of the existence of God would he believe, he replied, “Of course I would, what an absurd question.” I don’t know if Mr. Hitchens was being modest or ironic by calling the question absurd, but he must have known that most people don’t let go of their core tenets with quite the same facility. Yet in an ideal world they should. Ask yourself a similar question. If you were shown incontrovertible evidence that contradicted a pet theory, a new age belief, a religious conviction or even a time-honoured scientific verity, would you change your position? The extent to which you would dodge or qualify the question may give an insight into the extent to which your particular belief is unfalsifiable. This may seem, on its surface, a trivial point, but I think it’s actually fundamental. It gets to the heart of how open any of us are to the actual truth — on a case-by-case basis. Most of us will defend our positions on any issue with a heartfelt declaration that our stance is motivated by a sincere search for the truth and nothing more, but when it comes right down to it we are in fact resistant to anything that interrupts or contradicts our most sacrosanct narratives. Being guided by truth alone is hard. We are wired for bias and bias has many comforts. Try though we may to make it otherwise we are all biased. It’s a price we pay for being human. But that doesn’t mean we can’t fight the impulse. And indeed we should. Because that is the source of compassion and tolerance. That is how we are best able to see things the way others do. In the spirit of the foregoing I am duty-bound to concede that Donald Trump’s forthcoming book, one that he is touting as a “book of all books,” of course, may turn out to be a truthful confession — I just don’t see how. I refuse to be so open-minded that my brains fall out. First of all I’m not even sure he’s writing a book. The man lies the way most of us breathe. But whatever he writes, if he writes anything at all, I do know this, there are people who will believe in his “mother of all books” no matter how absurd it may be, no matter how easily refuted the lies contained in it may prove. That is the essence of unfalsifiability. It would be easy for me to say that Trump’s book is a failure before he’s even written a word. But that would be too facile. That would be my bias speaking. There are in fact millions of people who will buy it and put it in a prominent place on their coffee tables. As with many of the Germans of the 1930s and “Mein Kampf,” they may never actually get around to reading it, but some will. And those that do will believe every single word of it. There exists no photographic or DNA evidence, no movie, no polemic, no combination of words that can sway the true Trump idolator. He or she will never for a moment so much as entertain the possibility that he or she might be wrong about Trump. Trump has an audience of millions ready to believe anything he writes. Their devotion to every word is already foregone before a single word is written. Politically and legally Trump is making a huge mistake. Books have even more permanence than tweets, and they can and will be used against him in a court of law. So I say write on, Mr. Trump. Write it all down. His followers who think his every word is gospel and contains nothing but truth could very well learn the bitter lesson that that kind of “truth” can send you directly to prison. And, as ever, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, comrades and friends, stay safe. Robert Harrington is an American expat living in Britain.

The slump in satisfaction with the veep comes after several weeks oftough news cyclessurrounding her handling of the border crisis andreports of disharmony and dysfunctionin her office. Harris’ numbers lag way behind those of her boss, Joe Biden, who boasts a 51.8 percent approval rate, compared to 42.8 percent who disapprove of his job performance according to the RCP average. In the most recent poll, aYouGov survey, only 18-29-year-olds had had a more positive than negative view of the vice president, while all other age groups had more detractors than supporters. Late last month, Harris finallytook a tripnear the US border with Mexico after weeks of hesitation that featured testy exchanges with reporters who wondered why the person put in charge of the border crisis response by Biden was not going there?In one interview, a defensive Harristold NBC’s Lester Holt“we’ve been to the border,” when he pointed out that she had not personally gone as vice president she snapped back with, “And I haven’t been to Europe,’ And I mean, I don’t understand the point that you’re making. I’m not discounting the importance of the border.”The White House defended Harris saying that her responsibility was for “root causes” of the crisis, not the border itself, but according to this latest polling that excuse does not seem to have satisfied voters. Adding to Harris’ public woes was areport in Politicoin which 22 sources confirmed big trouble in her office, including one who said, “It’s not a healthy environment and people often feel mistreated. It’s not a place where people feel supported but a place where people feel treated like s—.”The June report mirroredsimilar concernsraised during the 2020 campaign when a frustrated senior staffer admitted that, “I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly.”Harris might have less time than most first term vice presidents to cure what is ailing her popularity given the unusual amount of speculation that Biden, who is 78, could opt to only serve one term. Viewed by many as a top-tier candidate in the 2020 primary she never broke through in that race, by the time she dropped out in December of 2019 her polling numbers had sagged to a mere 3.3 percent.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0480776515151515,0.4704071969696969,557,2,New York Post
221,What you need to know about hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus,-6.33,45.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-you-need-to-know-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-coronavirus,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-10,25,"There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that hassickened millions of people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, and killed thousands more. But health care workers have been trying to reduce the severity of people’s symptoms with medications designed to treat other ailments — including the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine. While there is anecdotal evidence some patients’ may have received hydroxychloroquine and then recovered, there is no data that proves it is effective in treating or preventing COVID-19. In fact, mounting data suggests this drug may do more harm than good when used to treat patients infected with novel coronavirus. The National Institutes of Health has launched clinical trials around the drug as a potential therapy for COVID-19 at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville and a network of more than 40 hospitals. But absent that kind of data, there has been confusion around how exactly to use the drug to treat patients sick with the virus — and whether it is effective. On April 24, the FDA warned the public against using hydroxychloroquine outside of a hospital since these clinical trials are not yet completed.“While clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for COVID-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered,” said FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen M. Hahn in areleased statement. For weeks, President Donald Trump has touted the use of the drug, along with chloroquine, as possible treatments. Often, he has suggested combining them with antibiotics. On May 18, Trump told reporters during a roundtable with restaurant industry leaders that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for at least two weeks, despite the fact that the drug remained an unproven form of treatment for COVID-19.“A couple of weeks ago, I started taking it,” Trump said. “I’ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it is not good, I will tell you right. I’m not going to get hurt by it. It has been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things. I take it.”In a large observational study that has since been discredited, researchers analyzed the effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine using data from nearly 97,000 patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 at 671 hospitals. Their findings, published May 22 in The Lancet, suggested that use of these drugs to treat COVID-19 was linked to higher rates of mortality and serious heart conditions. Researchers also said these drugs should not be used outside clinical trials, which have not yet concluded that either drug is safe or effective to treat people infected with novel coronavirus. But on June 4, the journal said the study’sauthors had retracted their workafter they “were unable to complete an independent audit of the data underpinning their analysis.”On June 15, the Food and Drug Administrationrevoked its emergency use authorizationfor hydroxychloroquine, saying the drug may not be effective to treat COVID-19 and “the drug’s potential benefits for such use do not outweigh its known and potential risks.”Public health officials have criticized Trump for pushing a drug without evidence of its efficacy in treating COVID-19, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has led the nation’s response to the virus, has said there is no data to support that this drug works. The president’s endorsement has emboldened at least two people to take chloroquine, absent a doctor’s orders, with tragic results. One Arizona couple consumed chloroquine phosphate, a chemical used to treat sick fish in their koi pond. Both in their 60s, the man and woman became ill, and the man later died,NBC News reported on March 23. They were afraid they would get sick with COVID-19, and ingested the chemical after President Donald Trump touted its possible benefits, according to the woman, who asked not to be named when she spoke to NBC News. Here’s what we know about the drug now and how researchers are working to determine if it truly can help patients infected with novel coronavirus. U. S. President Donald Trump stops a reporter from asking Dr. Anthony Fauci a question about use of the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat the disease caused by the new coronavirus near the end of the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, U. S., April 5, 2020. REUTERS/Joshua RobertsCenturies ago, the Incas in Perudried and ground cinchona tree bark, then mixed the resulting fine powder with a liquid. In doing so, they produced a medicine used to lower fever later called quinine. By World War II, researchers studied how to further develop quinine for antimalarial treatment, eventually creating chloroquine. Among soldiers who were administered these drugs, those with rashes and arthritis noticed their symptoms improved, paving the way for thisantimalarial medication to also be prescribed to reduce swelling and joint pain. By 1955, a synthetic and less toxic version of this drug, hydroxychloroquine, had become more widely available. Because hydroxychloroquine reduces inflammation, doctors have often prescribed it to treatrheumatoid arthritis, as well as lupus, sarcoidosis and other autoimmune diseases. Side effects tend to be mild and includenausea, vomiting and diarrhea, but if the drug is taken for long periods of time, arare eye disorder called retinopathymay develop, resulting in permanent vision loss. Patients in the United States often refer to hydroxychloroquine using the brand name, Plaquenil. At Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Dr. Wesley Self said he has lost count of how many patients he has treated for COVID-19. To find better ways to take care of those patients, Self is serving as lead investigator for the nationwide clinical trial on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. On Thursday, the National Institutes of Healthformally announced the trial. Researchers started enrolling trial participants on April 2, Self said. There is reason to think hydroxychloroquine could reduce swelling in the lungs of a person with the virus, Self said. But people with COVID-19 are taking many medications, and those medications may interact with each other in unexpected ways. On top of that, Self said people infected with the virus “may be more susceptible to side effects from medications.”“There’s promise for this drug, but we simply don’t have enough data in patients with COVID,” he said. To understand whether or not the drug might help COVID-19 patients, Self and his research team are conducting a randomized trial. That means some patients infected with the coronavirus will receive hydroxychloroquine, and some won’t. Those who do get hydroxychloroquine will receive the medication for five days. The research team will then compare which group of patients get better faster and which ones may have reactions and side effects from the drug, Self said. And investigators, medical teams and patients won’t know which patients get the medication, ensuring that — all else being equal — every patient gets the same level of care. The trial is expected to last several months, or until researchers see definitive evidence that the drug is or isn’t helping.“We know this is an emergency, so we were already working very quickly,” Self said. “We’re trying to run this study as fast as we can while making sure it is still safe.”Until researchers complete these trials, anyone touting the benefits of using these drugs is only speaking anecdotally. These trials “are the way we learn,” said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer for the American Society of Clinical Oncology and an expert on clinical trials. If the study is well-designed and conducted, the findings won’t be based on hearsay or intuition but scientific observation. Until then, it remains unclear if these antimalarial medications offer effective treatment and relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. And no one should take these medications without consulting with their health care provider. Researchers at the Microbiology Research Facility work with coronavirus samples as a trial begins to see whether malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U. S. March 19, 2020. REUTERS/Craig LassigThe Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorizationon March 28 for hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate. That made it available to public health authorities to tap into the Strategic National Stockpile’s supply as an option for treatmentThe next day, the Department of Health and Human Services accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine and one million doses of chloroquine to the Strategic National Stockpile, donated by Sandoz and Bayer, two pharmaceutical companies.“Anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” a department press release said. “Clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective.”Even before confirmation from clinical trials, demand for hydroxychloroquine has led to shortages for people prescribed to take the drug to treat other illnesses. Health care providers are warning that could be a dangerous problem on its own.“Treatment interruptions for those with SLE and other rheumatic diseases must be prevented, because lapses in therapy can result in disease flares and strain already stretched health care resources,” Drs. Jinoos Yazdany and Alfred H. J. Kim,wrote late last monthin the Annals of Internal Medicine. Autoimmune disease patients like James Kuhn said they fear they will have trouble filling prescriptions for a medication that they have relied upon for years. Kuhn has taken the medication as his primary therapy for 10 years to treat sarcoidosis, a rare disease that swells lymph nodes and organs, and Sjogren’s disease. Kuhn, who also volunteers as a patient advocate, refilled his prescription in mid-March. But he is worried when he hears that some pharmacists are scaling back 30- or 90-day prescriptions to just two weeks. That could mean immuno-compromised people like Kuhn must venture outside their homes more often and potentially expose themselves to novel coronavirus to get the medications they need.“If we catch the disease, it is a near-death sentence,” Kuhn said. His rheumatologist, Dr. Soha Mousa, has been consulting with her patients, including Kuhn, by telemedicine since the pandemic began, and they are telling her they are already having a tough time filling prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine. In some cases, pharmacies ask patients to provide proof of their diagnosis before receiving their medication, Mousa said.“I’m getting frantic messages, [like] ‘How am I going to survive?’” Mousa said. Mousa said she is asking her patients to shop around, if possible. Find different pharmacies, or shop online for their prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine. They have told her that in some cases, it now costs $600 to fill a month’s prescription, dramatically more than what the drug cost even three months ago.

Art Pavelski, an upstate New York Pastor of Pierce Hill Christian Fellowship explained, “Christ is neither conservative or liberal and that Christ is both.”But there is fear that the politics of our era would affect the message of Christianity. As of now, the big tech censorship of people like Donald Trump or of Parler has not hit the church. But many are concerned that might be the next step. Pavelski said, “It could affect the church. If it gets to the point where you are saying that when you talk about Christian viewpoints and it is considered to be too offensive. That could be the case.”There would be a big reason the big tech firms out there would censor Christianity in America.“These Twitter accounts, Facebook, whatever the social media is not owned by Christians,” Pavelski said. “It’s not a Christian company. So, you cannot expect them to act in any kind of a Christian manner. That, that’s just the way it is.”There is also another reason the church is on the lookout for possible big tech censorship.“Maybe people who would say that that some of the things that the Christians talk about would be inappropriate,” said Pavelski. “It would be what some would consider hate speech.”As of now, Pavelski said the attack on Christianity has not grown too out of control in America.“I haven’t seen anything compared to any kind of attack on Christians like it has been in the first century, where Christians are fed to the lions. There aren’t any Christians being fed to lions in the United States that I know of.”Pavelski also notes that Christians are persecuted in other parts of the world, including those with a one-party system.",1,Questionable,0.089194577352472,0.333133971291866,380,0,Daily Torch
223,How the pandemic is messing with kids’ mental health: Coping through COVID,0.0,44.0,https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/12/how-the-pandemic-is-messing-with-kids-mental-health-coping-through-covid.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,18,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – Your kids are squabbling. One refuses to do his math homework. Another treats your work Zoom meetings as reason to put on a talent show. Maybe they’re irritable. Or anxious. Extra clingy. Or regressing.“What’s wrong with these children?” You want to scream, after nine months of being trapped in the same house during the coronavirus pandemic. The same thing that’s wrong with everyone else. They’re missing socialization and stimulation -- and theirmental health is suffering.“Behavior has meaning,”said Kristina Ryan, a licensed social worker at the behavioral health agency Ohio Guidestone. “It’s not that they’re giving you a hard time. They’re having a hard time.”A national study found that between March and June, 27% of parents reported worsening mental health for them, and 14% reported worsening behavioral health for their children. Astudy in Italy and Spainreleased in October found that 86% of parents reported changes in children’s emotions and behaviors during the pandemic, including difficulty concentrating, nervousness and uneasiness. From April through October, the proportion of mental health visits to pediatric emergency departments jumped 24% for kids ages 5-11 and 31% for kids 12-17, according to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We’re already seeing that children’s mental health is impacted in the short term. Likely there will be long-term consequences as well,” said Nirmita Panchal, who has studied the issue as a senior policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “What early research and data is showing that lack of socialization has been pretty critical.”Coping through COVIDaims to help Northeast Ohioans manage the stress of COVID-19, by examining the mental health aspect of the pandemic. In an ongoing series,cleveland.comis telling individuals’ stories and talking to experts about challenges and strategies. What is weighing on kids? TheCDC has a list.- Changes in routines, including having to physically distance from extended family and friends- Breaks in education, including struggles with virtual learning- Missed pediatric visits- Canceled significant life events, including holiday traditions and school milestones- Lost security and safety, including food insecurityClinical psychologistLisa Damour,who practices in Shaker Heights, writes an adolescents column for the New York Times and co-hosts a podcast called “Ask Lisa: The Psychology of Parenting” is giving virtual Town Hall talks on the topic for Rocky River schools this year.“Families and their children are facing disruptions on a scale we’ve never seen. They undermine so much of what is normal and expectable,” Damour said. “Children are feeling upset, at best, if not very distressed, as a result of the complexities that come with the pandemic.”And that’s for all kids. Children who have lost a family member to COVID-19, or whose parent has lost a job or family has faced eviction will likely struggle more with mental health. Children can absorb their parents’ stress, too. How that stress manifests depends on the child, and their age. Experts say it’s important for parents to take their children’s cues seriously, to listen to their concerns and contact a therapist if they need more help. Children 5 and younger may lose developmental gains, have trouble sleeping or eating or act out, Damour said. Kids 6-10 may have head- or stomachaches, talk about feeling upset and also act out. Teenagers, too, may also act out, or turn inward with signs of depression or anxiety. Damour believes the pandemic may be hardest on middle schoolers, who already are anxious about their social standing and who use school to find their personality and their people. Having that process disrupted by virtual class is tough. But it’s hard for all ages, Ryan said. Toddlers and preschoolers learn and grow through play with their peers. But right now, they aren’t going to story hour at the library or meeting friends at the park. Older students are trying to learn remotely, a much more self-directed learning process that is harder for kids of all ages. School districts across the country have reported significant increases in failing classes.“It’s a nightmare,” Ryan said. Kids are spending a lot of time on screens, both for school and fun. While Damour says not to worry about screen time, as long as its age-appropriate and not disrupting other activities. However, Ryan said too much can make kids crabbier and can cause trouble sleeping, which creates a compounding problem. Screens can’t substitute playing outside or having face-to-face conversations. Regardless, kids’ worlds have shrunk. They have few outlets for their frustrated energy. So they may fight more with their siblings. (It’s not just my kids.)“The pandemic is boring,” Damour said. “When kids get bored they often start stuff… They don’t have anything else to do, so they think, I’ll just pick a fight.”Experts say it’s possible. There is little data on the subject. But “studies from other countries show that levels of anxiety and depression are increasing as people come out of these lockdowns,” Panchal said. “None of this data is promising.”The more vulnerable the population, the more disruptions they’ve had to their lives and the more cut off they were from care, the less likely they’ll be able to bounce back.“There are kids whose lives will forever be changed because of the pandemic,” Damour said. “There are kids who won’t go to college. There are kids who have lost one or more parents. These are devastating circumstances.”As for the more fortunate kids, Damour said they’re pretty resilient – especially if their parents can shield them from the impact of persistent and serious stressors.“We know from research that the success with which a child weathers difficult time depends heavily on how well the parents are able to buffer the impact of that stressor on that child,” Damour said. That doesn’t meanbuying your kids a pandemic puppyor aNintendo Switch. It means keeping a routine and balancing warmth and structure. You don’t have to be perfect, Damour said. You should just aim for predictable. Relaxing the rules occasionally is OK, too, especially over winter break. Ryan encourages parents to pick their battles.“Routine is important. It definitely helps kids function,” she said. “But also being able to be flexible for your kids is important, sitting down and listening to what your kids need.”Damour said research has shown kids are also more resilient when they have at least one adult in their life who loves the kid like crazy and opportunities to do meaningful work (in school or around the house and community). Take care of yourself, parents.“Everything has changed so much,” Ryan said. “We’ve gone from being able to go everywhere we want to isolation. You’re just trapped in your environment. It’s hard to get alone time, hard for kids to get social interaction to help them grow. Not to mention, am I going to get COVID if I go to the grocery store?”It’s easy to be overwhelmed. But when parents are drowning, it’s hard for their kids to thrive. Even the World Health Organization urges parents to give themselves a break, to do something they enjoy, as the pandemic slogs on. That self-care is a good model for kids, too, Damour said. So get a good night’s sleep. Eat well. Do physical activity. Find happy distractions.“It doesn’t solve the problems,” Damour said. “It does help buffer the stress we feel as a result.”Are you, a family member or a friend in crisis?, or do you need mental health or substance use services?

Paxton was using the ""full weight"" of his position as retaliation over editorial choices he didn't like, Twitter's attorneys said. Paxton himself had claimed Twitter's ban ""chills free speech"" and accused multiple tech giants of a ""seemingly coordinated deplatforming"" of Trump following the Capitol riot. He echoed frequent conservative beliefs that Twitter,Facebook, Google and others are breaking the spirit of the First Amendment with an alleged bias against right-wing views. These sites should be treated as public spaces and forced to carry any otherwise legal content, according to these beliefs. Twitter may have a solid case, however. As a private company, Twitter is within its rights to determine what it does and doesn't publish. It might also point to a long history ofrefusing to ban Trumpdespite repeated violations of its policies, insteadrelying on labelsor limitations on specific tweets. This wasn't a company that rushed to ban a dissenting view, in other words. Paxton's office hadn't formally commented as we wrote this, but it wouldn't be surprising if he fought hard to protect the investigation. It could rally political supporters at a time when Paxton himself is facing scandals, such asaccusationsof bribery and abuse of office.

225,North Carolina Republican in disputed Congressional race won’t run again,-7.0,58.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/north-carolina-republican-in-disputed-congressional-race-wont-run-again,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-02-26,25,"RALEIGH, N. C. — The Republican candidate whose narrow lead in a North Carolina congressional race was thrown out because of suspicions of ballot fraud announced Tuesday he will not run in the newly ordered do-over election, saying he needs surgery late next month. The withdrawal of Mark Harris, a candidate hobbled by links to alleged ballot fraud, could help Republicans in their effort to keep the competitive seat in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district. Harris announced his decision in a statement that focused on his health problems. He did not mention the alleged ballot fraud scandal. Harris had led Democrat Dan McCready by just 905 votes after November’s election, but the outcome was never certified. State election officials grew concerned about reports that an operative working for Harris was illegally tampering with absentee ballots. Harris last week stopped a special state elections board hearing by declaring he couldn’t continue to testify. He cited health problems caused by a blood infection that required hospitalization and led to two strokes. He also said he agreed that a new election should be called, despite his previous calls to be declared the winnerShortly after Harris spoke last week, the elections boardordered a new contest. A date for the new election has not been announced. WATCH: Do-over election in N. C. congressional district requires new primariesOn Tuesday, Harris encouraged his supporters to rally around Stony Rushing, a commissioner in Union County. The local official from the Charlotte suburbs would “stand firm on so many of the issues that concern us, including the issue of life, our national security, and religious freedom,” Harris said. Rushing, a firing range owner and licensed gun seller, has been a county commissioner off and on for more than eight years, first taking office in 2002. He didn’t return a phone call to his shooting range seeking comment on Tuesday. Only one other GOP candidate — former state Sen. Tommy Tucker of Union County — has publicly expressed interest in running for the seat. In a phone interview, Tucker said he’s “95 percent sure” that he plans to run for the seat. He said he had no idea how Harris’ near-endorsement of Rushing would affect the campaign. Former U. S. Rep. Robert Pittenger, whom Harris defeated in last May’s primary, told The Associated Press in an interview that it was “good for the country and the party” that Harris wasn’t running. When asked why, he said simply: “I think it’s just obvious.”Pittenger again closed the door on seeking his old job, saying he’s involved in a series of conferences around the world bringing lawmakers together to discuss counter-terrorism and security issues. Former Gov. Pat McCrory said Monday he wouldn’t seek the seat. He was previously mayor of Charlotte, a part of which is in the congressional district. McCready has been assembling a new campaign staff and raising money to run again in the district that stretches from Charlotte through several counties to the east along the South Carolina border. His campaign finance report showed McCready raised $487,000 during the final five weeks of 2018. His campaign sent out a campaign fundraising plea late Thursday, citing the state elections board’s decision. McCready formally announced his intention to run Friday before several dozen supporters at a brewery in Waxhaw, near Charlotte.“Folks, there’s a lot of people that have had their confidence shaken in recent weeks because of the fraud conducted by Mark Harris’s campaign,” McCready said. “There’s a lot of people right now in North Carolina that are disillusioned in our electoral process.”He told the crowd that he and his team were going to “knock on every door” in the district to earn votes and to reassure constituents that he’s the type of politician who will do the right thing.“We’re going to talk to people about doing what’s right instead of what’s wrong,” he said. Harris struggled during testimony last week over why he prepared for his primary election last year by seeking out and signing up Bladen County political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless, a convicted felon who had been accused of ballot fraud in the 2016 elections. The state elections board turned over evidence of his actions in 2017 to federal prosecutors, who took no action. According to testimony and other findings detailed at the hearing, Dowless conducted an illegal “ballot harvesting” operation: He and his assistants gathered up absentee ballots from voters by offering to put them in the mail. Dowless’ workers in rural Bladen County testified that they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates. It is generally against the law in North Carolina for anyone other than the voter or a family member to handle someone’s completed ballot. No criminal charges have been filed in the case. Dowless declined to testify last week after the elections board refused to grant him immunity from prosecution based on what he might say.",3,Reliable,0.0415182935344225,0.3356485360517619,1056,3,PBS

Now, the U. S. Air Force has its own Artoo — called, well, Artuμ — an artificial intelligence systemthat flew onboard a Lockheed Martin U-2for the first time Dec. 15 and was given control ofthe spy plane’s radar and sensor systems. On a reconnaissance training mission conducted out of Beale Air Force Base in California, Artuµ was tasked with finding adversarial missile launchers during a simulated missile strike, and it was solely responsible for sensor employment and tactical navigation after takeoff, the Air Force said in a news release. The human U-2 pilot, referred only by the callsign “Vudu” for security reasons, concentrated on finding enemy aircraft and shared the use of the radar with the AI co-pilot.“Like any pilot, Artuμ (even the real R2-D2) has strengths and weaknesses,” Air Force acquisition executive Will Ropertweetedin an announcement of the news. “Understanding them to prep both humans and AI for a new era of algorithmic warfare is our next imperative step. We either become sci-fi or become history.”Artuµ was created by the U-2 Federal Laboratory, which in October successfullyupdated the plane′s softwarewhile it was flying — a first for the U. S. military. The event was made possible by deploying Kubernetes, an open-source, containerized method for automating software updates. Artuμ is based on a gaming algorithm known as µZero, which has been used to beat human players in chess and Go, Roper explainedin an op-ed on Popular Mechanics. The U-2 lab specially trained the AI co-pilot to manipulate the U-2′s sensor suite during “over half a million” computer-simulated missions, according to the Air Force.“With no pilot override, ARTUµ made final calls on devoting the radar to missile hunting versus self-protection,” Roper wrote. Although Artuµ was developed to take away from the pilot’s workload in a U-2, it can be modified for use by other combat planes, the service said.“We know that in order to fight and win in a future conflict with a peer adversary, we must have a decisive digital advantage,” Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown said in a statement. “AI will play a critical role in achieving that edge, so I’m incredibly proud of what the team accomplished. We must accelerate change and that only happens when our Airmen push the limits of what we thought was possible.”Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

The proposal would charge anyone illegally camped out on state property with a Class E felony, which is punishable by up to six years in prison and results in the loss of a person’s voting rights, according toThe Tennessean. For nearly two months,protesters have been camped outside the state Capitol calling on lawmakers to tackle systemic racism and remove a bust of Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest, according to Nashville Public Radio. In July, a protester was arrested after setting Nashville City Hall on fire. Nashville Public Radio reported that camping means “laying down a blanket, sleeping bag or any other bedding material, or erecting a tent or a canopy from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.”Democrat State Senate Minority Leader Jeff Yarbro said the measure is extreme during a Senate floor debate, according to The Tennessean.“Are we really saying that a citizen of this state can be punished with a year in prison and have a felony record because they camped on public property? That should be a bridge too far.”Yarbro also mocked the bill in a tweet. Well, camping on state property will now lead to felony punished by range of 1 to 6 years in prison and up to a $3,000 fine. And bonus penalty for exercising your protest rights in an unapproved manner: you lose your voting rights.— Jeff Yarbro (@yarbro)August 12, 2020 Republican State Sen. Mike Bell filed an amendment Wednesday to keep the camping offense a misdemeanor, saying it was “heavy handed” for the offense to become a felony. The amendment failed, but Bell said the “overall benefits” of the bill outweighed any issue he had with the measure, according to The Tennessean. The proposal also requires protesters charged with camping out, vandalism of state property and other protest-related offenses to be held for at least 12 hours without bond. A magistrate must provide a written argument that the person in question won’t resume their behavior to avoid the mandatory hold. The Tennessean reported such holds aren’t mandated for most other criminal offenses in the state.

I saw it happen as a correspondent in Israel when Menachem Begin captured the vote in June 1977 to become prime minister of the state’s first right-wing government. He overturned 29 years of Labor rule. And then came a surge of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, what Begin defined as “liberated Israeli territory.” And then Egyptian President Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem in November 1977. And then the Camp David Accords in September 1978 hosted by President Jimmy Carter. And then the signing in Washington of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979. We know elections have unexpected consequences, even in the United States. The biggest surprise in most of our lifetimes came four years ago with the ascendance to the White House of Donald Trump, a flamboyant billionaire real estate developer with no experience in politics or governing. His arrogance flaunted itself during his campaign in January 2016 when he proclaimed in signature Trump fashion, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn’t lose any voters.”As a born and bred New Yorker, I’ve been to Fifth Avenue many times. It’s a lovely street, gliding along the east side of leafy Central Park. St. Patrick’s Cathedral is there, near Rockefeller Center, its ice skating rink a winter lure. The avenue is home to the Easter Parade, which was canceled this year because of the coronavirus. It takes a particular mindset to project a scene of shooting someone on one of New York City’s glorious thoroughfares as a means of attracting voters. His statement served as a preview of what was to come, a mini trailer to a 4-year-old horror film that would furrow the brows of world leaders. Trump frightened tens of millions of us with his racism, far right authoritarianism and ultranationalism bordering on fascism, division, chaos, lying and a narcissistic personality disorder behind it all that disrupted, disturbed and disheartend governments and people around the globe. But for the other dictators, that is. That President-elect Joe Biden defeated Trump in an historic election is a blessing.“When the Devil’s ambassador from Hell is soundly defeated, we should all be crying tears of joy and salvation,” said Robert Morgart, 76, an adjunct professor of strategic management at Highlands University in Las Vegas, N. M. More poignantly, CNN commentator Van Jones, who is Black, broke down crying on live TV shortly after the network broke the news that Biden had won. His startling reaction echoed the relief felt about Trump’s defeat by the nearly 75 million people who voted for Biden, the most ever for president.“This is vindication for a lot of people who have really suffered,” he said. “You know, ‘I can’t breathe?’ that wasn’t just George Floyd. That was how a lot of people felt. They couldn’t breathe.”“Every day you are waking up,” Jones said, wiping away tears. “And you are getting these tweets, and you don’t know, and you go into the store, and people who have been afraid to show their racism are getting nastier and nastier to you. And you are worried about your kids. And you are worried about your sister. Can she go to Walmart and get back into her car without somebody saying something to her. And you spent so much of your life energy just trying to hold it together.”It’s understandable that he cried, for himself, his family, his country because “the character of the country matters. Being a good man matters. I want my sons to look at this.”Tears came as I typed those words. It hasn’t been easy for any of us who despised Trump for what he was doing to our beloved country, at home and abroad. And it isn’t over. It won’t be over until noon Jan. 20. There’s a lot of space between now and then for Trump to cause a great deal of mischief. We don’t know how he will react to his defeat. He already refused to concede, mounting spurious court challenges. Dr. Brandy X. Lee, a psychiatrist who taught Yale students and is the author of “Profile of a Nation: Trump’s Mind, America’s Soul,” emailed Salon diagnosing the president’s narcissism in reacting to loss:“. . . When there is an all-encompassing loss, such as the loss of an election, it can trigger a rampage of destruction and reign of terror in revenge against an entire nation that has failed him.“It is far easier for the pathological narcissist to consider destroying oneself and the world, especially its ‘laughing eyes,’ then to retreat into becoming a ’loser’ and a ‘sucker’ —which to someone suffering from this condition will feel like psychic death.”It’s an understatement to warn that we could be in danger. And the Republican Party increased its numbers. The problem is in the Senate where its leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, may wield a great deal of power to thwart Biden’s agenda. He did that to President Barack Obama. And behind them all will be Trump, somewhere out there with the support of the more than 70 million people who voted for him. He needs to be controlled before history suddenly is changed to a direction none of us want to go. Richard C.

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) on Sunday accused the Biden administration of violating the First Amendment in its push for social media companies to do more to combat false claims about the shot, joining other conservatives who have seized on the Biden administration’s recent offensive against coronavirus vaccine misinformation in their crusade against big tech. UNITED STATES - APRIL 29: Sen. Cruz, R-Texas, conducts a news conference outside the Capitol to... [+]discuss the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act, which would remove serious crime prosecution out of the chain of command, on Thursday, April 29, 2021. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Speaking during an appearance on“Sunday Morning Futures,” Cruz labeled the White House’s push for a crackdown on vaccine misinformation a “clear” indicator of “their willingness to trample on free speech, to trample on the Constitution.”The Texas Republican argued the efforts to boost vaccine uptake—including increased public pressure on social media sites and the “flagging” of problematic posts—amount to evidence of government censorship as he said the Biden administration is using the companies as a “tool.”He even suggested White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki should be on former President Donald Trump’s payroll because of how much her media briefings about the vaccine misinformation crackdown “strengthened” Trump’s long-shot lawsuit against big tech, which he has accused of censorship from his removal from the platforms.“It makes clear that everything we thought about the Biden administration—about their willingness to trample on free speech, to trample on the Constitution, to use government power to silence you—everything we feared they might do, they are doing and worse,” Cruz said. “I think President Trump’s lawsuit got much, much stronger this week.”The federal government took a new and energized aim at vaccine disinformation this week after U. S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy released his first health advisory deeming it an“urgent threat.”“Simply put: health misinformation has cost us lives,” said the top doctor.

230,"LBJ Stole an Election. 72 Years Later, Democrats Are Using the Same Bag of Tricks.",29.0,8.67,https://thenewamerican.com/lbj-stole-an-election-72-years-later-democrats-are-using-the-same-bag-of-tricks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-05,16,"The Bible says there’s nothing new under the sun. That certainly applies to voter fraud in American politics. The commonly parroted talking point among the mainstream media and other mouthpieces of the establishment is that voter fraud, at least to a degree that could sway an election, doesn’t happen in America; that it’s only found in third-world countries but could never take place in a nation as sophisticated as ours. Such assurances fly in the face of reality. In fact, voter fraud has been a long-time fixture of American politics and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ignorant of history or deliberately trying to obfuscate the truth. Anyone who has studied urban political operations, especially the infamousTammany Hallmachine, knows that vote fraud, including dead people voting and party bosses filling out absentee ballots on behalf of voters, has been a fact of life since at least the 19th century. Perhaps the most famous case of voter fraud is Lyndon Baines Johnson’s 1948 stealing of the U. S. Senate race against former Texas Governor Coke Stevenson. This election stands out because of its significance for America — Johnson had already forsaken his House seat and lost a Senate race in 1941, so a loss in 1948 would have ended his political career and prevented him from reaching the presidency — and because the fraud has been conclusively and definitively proven, even to the point of the biggest participants in the steal admitting to what they did years after. Aspreviously noted, LBJ overcame an 11,000-vote Election Night deficit against the conservative former governor in the Democrat primary thanks to tens of thousands of “block votes” he purchased, particularly from the Rio Grande Valley, where a group of corrupt political bosses took advantage of the heavy Mexican demographic’s willingness to play along and keep quiet in obeisance to their powerfulpatrones(Spanish for “bosses” or “chief”), who would win over commoners with favors (giving a local family cash for funeral expenses, helping an old lady with her medical bills, etc.) and silence dissidents at gunpoint. The ringleader of the Valley’s political bosses was George Parr, a sheriff and county judge known, like his father before him, as the “Duke of Duval” County. Parr’s dominion encompassed seven counties; he ruled Duval, Brooks, and Jim Hogg counties as a virtual satrapy and his control extended into Zapata, Webb, La Salle, and Starr counties through alliances with lesser local bosses. In Precinct 13 of the city of Alice in Jim Wells County, the precinct in which the mysterious last-minute 200 votes that pushed Johnson over the edge to an 87-vote victory were “found,” the votes were supervised by Parr’s enforcer, a tall, burly, savage Mexican by the name of Luis Salas, better known as the “Indio.”Salas left many a man near-death in fist fights and carried a revolver around his hip, often under the guise of the law (Parr made him a city policeman in Alice and a deputy sheriff in Duval, Jim Wells, and Nueces counties).“In all these years, George told me to give our candidate 80 percent of the total votes, regardless if the people voted against us,” Salas told author Robert Caro, as recounted in the book. How did Salas and other vote-sellers ensure their client, Johnson, won the election?One method was getting the dead to vote. As detailed in:The number of votes at the’ command was not necessarily limited by the number of eligible voters. Since voters over the age of sixty were not required to pay poll taxes, and since poll tax lists were checked irregularly to eliminate the names of those who died after sixty, “in the Valley,” as one expert on the subject puts it, “the ‘machine’ votes the dead men.”In many cases, votes were cast on behalf of individuals without their knowledge, as in the case of a young man who testified at the behest of the Stevenson team that, although a ballot was cast in his name, he had in fact been out of town and not voted when the election occurred. Even non-citizens were utilized to give Parr’s candidates an edge. Caro writes:Nor was American citizenship necessarily a requirement; on Election Day, voters were recruited in saloons on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande and brought across in truckloads to vote on the American side. Starr County was “an excellent location for bringing voters from across the border, a commentator notes. In Webb County, the small town of Dolores had about 100 American citizens — and in some elections recorded as many as 400 votes. Of course, in many instances, physical voters weren’t used at all. In precincts where the bosses had total control, such as the Salas-run Precinct 13 in Alice, they would simply add to the tally sheet as many votes as their candidate needed. This was the case with the scandalous 200 votes, which were a product of Parr, seeing that Johnson was still about 150 votes short a week after the Election, ordering Salas to say that the Johnson vote count was not the 765 originally reported, but(one of Stevenson’s attorneys, who saw the original tally sheet, said the “9” in the 965 had the appearance of having been a “7,” with a loop added to it to turn it into a “9”). The Johnson camp could afford all this thanks to the virtually unlimited financial resources of the interests who backed him, from Texas oil magnates to federal contractors such as Brown & Root to liberal Northeastern businessmen. Johnson’s 1948 Senate bid was, at the time, the most expensive campaign in the history of Texas. A ruling from Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black halted the trial and investigation of the fraud just minutes before the vote boxes whose contents would have proved the tampering of the count were to be opened in court. But those involved in the steal later admitted the truth. Salas, for example, told Caro that he lied under oath and did, in fact, falsify votes for Johnson, opening for the Democrat “the road to reach the presidency of this country.”“This is history like it or not, nobody can erase these facts,” Salas said. The shocking turn of events of the 1948 Senate race in Texas was not unlike what Americans witnessed in the 2020 presidential race: A popular candidate appeared to have the contest all but wrapped up on Election Night; then, in subsequent days, that lead was gradually eroded as new ballots, overwhelmingly skewed in favor of his opponent, were “discovered” in precincts known for their corrupt politics. Then, as now, the reason for the delay in reporting is clear: The bosses instructed their elections officials not to report their tallies until the rest of the state had already done so, allowing them to know how many ballots they needed to fabricate. LBJ lost his first Senate bid in 1941 because, already in the lead, he mistakenly told Parr and company to report their results immediately, allowing opponent W. Lee O’Daniel’s men to falsify the right amount of votes to pushover the top. In 1948, turnout percentages in the 80s and 90s alerted observers to the scam. In 2020, cities responsible for Biden’s victory likewise hadunprecedented turnoutin the 80s and 90s. In 1948, the media, which largely supported liberal and New Deal-supporter Johnson over conservative “neanderthal” Stevenson, took Johnson’s claims at face value and for years thereafter enshrined the narrative that the Stevenson camp were merely sore losers. And in 1948, as in 2020, the courts, all the way to the Supreme Court, ultimately failed to deliver justice. In the Johnson case, it was thanks to the brilliant political maneuvering of his army of lawyers and the local election officials he bought. A common stalling tactic in court by such officials on the Johnson side was saying that they had conveniently “lost” the vote tally sheets and otherwise doing all they could to prevent an inspection of the original records — not unlike Democrat precincts today, where officials resist efforts to audit and have even moved to destroy records as quickly as possible. Those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. Sadly, due in part to a mass media and leftist academia that misinforms and disinforms the public, we failed to learn in time to prevent a repetition of 1948 on a much grander scale in 2020. Now, whether President Trump wins the fight or loses, Americans’ faith in the integrity of our electoral system has forever been shattered.",0,Problematic,0.0664442591048095,0.4104025179713253,1814,0,The New American

Progressive Democrat John Fetterman, 51, announced Monday that he’s officially joining the race for the seat that will be vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Fetterman previously ran for the Democratic nomination for the same Senate seat in 2016, but lost to candidates with more statewide name recognition — who eventually lost to Toomey. But five years later, he’s built a name for himself with his consistent advocacy for issues like Medicare for All, raising the minimum wage, and cannabis legalization, as well as his work as a statewide leader during a critical election cycle. Prior to serving as Lt. Gov., Fetterman served as mayor of Braddock from 2005-2019, a small town in western Pennsylvania that features heavily in his debut campaign video:“The things that I learned, you know, in Braddock, is that every place matters. No place deserves to be written off,” Fetterman says in the video. “These places across Pennsylvania feel left behind, they don’t feel part of the conversation. That’s why Donald Trump went to these small counties and held these big rallies. Though the self-described democratic socialist disagrees with Trump on just about every policy issue, Fetterman has repeatedly given the former president credit for the crowds he drew in Pennsylvania. Trump won the key swing state over Hillary Clinton in 2016 by about 44,000 votes, while Biden won the state by about 80,000 votes in 2020. Inan interview with NowThison November 23, after Trump had lost Pennsylvania but continued disputing the legitimate election results, Fetterman said if he could talk to Trump, he would tell him:“You did a great job in Pennsylvania.” Trump “barnstormed the state, he understood this is how you win in Pennsylvania … You energize these small counties and his base. And I was impressed,” he said. But he also said it was clear that Trump lost, and he garnered a lot of national media coverage for speaking out against the baseless claims of voter fraud being pushed in and against his state — where Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani held hisinfamous Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conferencehe day media outlets called the race for Biden.“I can be objective about it,” Fetterman said in the November interview. “I might disagree with somebody politically. I can say yeah, he played Pennsylvania as good as he could play it in the last ten days...but he just came up short. At this point, it’s time to just hang it up.”In the new campaign video, Fetterman says, “We cannot afford to take any vote for granted, we cannot afford to take any place for granted.”“Talk is cheap,” he adds, summing up his no-nonsense approach to politics which involves speaking very bluntly and honestly. Fetterman isn’t just a refreshing voice in Democratic politics; he takes the same approach to governing.“I am the only Lieutenant Governor in the history of Pennsylvania to REJECT living in a mansion-with a chef and gardener-that YOU pay for, but@giselefettermanopened up its pool to the children of PA,” Fetterman tweeted, referencing his wife Gisele, and linking to aCNN article from June 2019about the couple opening the pool at their official residence to the public. Rare for someone in his position, Fetterman is also openly proud of that time he broke state and federal law —in order to officiatea same-sex marriage in 2013, which was still illegal in the U. S. at the time. The lieutenant governor faced his own kind of revolt in the Pennsylvania state Senate the day before the deadly U. S. Capitol riot on January 6. State Republican senatorsvoted to remove him from presiding over the sessionbecause he was blocking their anti-democratic attempts at control, including their refusal to seat a state Democrat who had legitimately won his election. The incident set a worrying precedent for small d-democratic politics in statehouses across America, and was soon eclipsed on a larger scale by an insurrection over presidential election results at the Capitol, egged on by Trump himself — andsome sitting Republican senators. Fetterman promises to be “sedition-free” if elected to the U. S. Senate. A handful of Republicans are also considered as early contenders for the seat,Politico reported.

Since his 2018 election, DeSantis has thrilled the GOP base by governing like a mini Trump. He defied public health guidelines during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic last year and kept Florida virtually free of a statewide lockdown. In May he perpetuated Trump’s 2020 election lie andsigneda restrictive voting rights bill live on Fox News. And last month hedispatchedFlorida law enforcement agents to Texas to “secure [the] southern border.” According to onerecentconservative poll, DeSantis beat Trump with a 74% approval rating (Trump scored 71%). But in the wake of the Surfside condo collapse, DeSantis’s claim to the MAGA mantle is facing its biggest test, with DeSantis putting management of the tragedy ahead of Trump’s need for blind loyalty. On June 30, the conservativereportedthat DeSantis’s team was furious that Trump intended to hold a MAGA rally in Florida while the search for survivors continued (DeSantis didn’t attend the rally). On July 1, DeSantis appeared alongside Presidentand praised him for the federal government’s response to the tragedy. (The moment recalled the greeting between New Jersey governorChris ChristieandBarack Obamaafter Hurricane Sandy.)In recent days I spoke with a half dozen GOP insiders about the recent flare-ups between DeSantis’s and Trump’s camps. The sources agreed that DeSantis and Trump are on an inevitable collision course as the 2024 GOP field takes shape. “There’s going to be a blowup,” a prominent Republican said. “Trump fucking hates DeSantis. He just resents his popularity,” a Trump confidant told me. Asked for comment, Trump spokespersonsaid: “Governor DeSantis has shown great respect.”Part of Trump’s irritation with DeSantis is that Trump famously claims credit for anyone in his orbit who gains attention. “Trump tells people, ‘I made Ron,’” the prominent Republican said. “Trump says that about a lot of people. But in this case it’s actually true.” According to sources, then congressman DeSantis cultivated Trump’s support during the 2018 gubernatorial primary by hanging out at Trump’s Washington, D. C., hotel. “Ron basically ran his primary campaign out of the hotel. He buttonholed Trump supporters and his friends,” the prominent Republican said. For much of the 2018 gubernatorial primary, DeSantis trailed Florida agriculture commissionerBut after Trump endorsed DeSantis in June, DeSantis zoomed12 points ahead. DeSantis won the primary by nearly 20 points. Once in office, DeSantis irked Trump by demonstrating an ability to push back, albeit in private. Ireportedlast year that DeSantis rejected Trump’s plea to close Florida’s beaches as the pandemic raged. DeSantis has also built an impressive fundraising operation of his own that gives him leverage in his budding rivalry with Trump. According to theDeSantis’s political action committeeraisedalmost $14 million in April 2021, bringing its total to about $31.6 million. Hedge fund billionairemade a $5 million donation. Spokespeople for DeSantis and Griffin declined to comment. DeSantis needs to walk a tightrope as he seeks to position himself for a 2024 run. According to a source, DeSantis has told donors that he won’t openly campaign in Iowa or New Hampshire before his 2022 Florida reelection campaign. But he’s clearly in a strong position. “Heading into 2024, DeSantis is primed to push Trump off the throne,” former Trump advisertold me",2,Generally Reliable,0.1565656565656565,0.5047799422799424,874,2,Vanity Fair

The rule reduced the number of streams, marshes and other wetlands that fall under federal protection. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said it “is leading to significant environmental degradation.”With the announcement, the Biden administration is wading into a decades-long battle over how far federal officials can go to stop contaminants from entering small streams and other wetlands. ajoint statementwith the Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA said it will work on a new policy that increases waterway habitats for wildlife and provides safe drinking water for millions of Americans.“The science says those streams and these wetlands are an important part of our clean-water system in the United States and should be protected,” Tom Kiernan, head of American Rivers, toldThe Washington Post. But the Trump administration yielded to home developers, oil drillers and growers who considered the regulations associated with the Clean Water Act too onerous. Regan said the Trump-era rule limiting the number of protected waterways gave a green light to 333 projects that would have previously required a Clean Water Act dredge-and-fill permit.

237,"A question of faith: Biden, Catholicism and the presidency",-2.67,40.33,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57825309,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,25,"Some bishops think America's second Catholic president should be denied the Eucharist. Are Biden's faith and job title an unworkable mix?On the matter of faith, President Joe Biden is not shy. Each weekend that he is in town, he goes to Mass in Washington. A motorcade takes him on Saturday evenings or Sunday mornings to Holy Trinity, the church where President Kennedy, the only other Catholic US president, used to attend services. He makes the sign of the cross at public events, and his Catholicism is woven into his speeches and policies. Yet Biden's stance on abortion, and his support for reproductive rights, clash with church teachings. He has seemed to be personally troubled by the idea of abortion. Years ago he wondered aloud whether Roe v Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the right in US law, went ""too far"". But today he supports a woman's right to choose whether or not to have a child, one of the core tenets of progressive politics. Liberal Catholics applaud Biden for his position on abortion while conservative ones denounce him. And now some bishops say he should be denied the Eucharist because of his views about reproductive rights. As a result, the Eucharist, a wafer that is made sacred through a church ritual, is now at the centre of a battle between conservative bishops and progressive Catholics. Six months after moving into the White House, Biden's effort to mesh progressive politics and Catholic faith has become a lightning rod for controversy. Decades ago, when Kennedy was in the White House, the president's faith was hardly ever in the news. Kennedy downplayed his religion, and made clear during his campaign that it would not play a significant role in his presidency. Kennedy minimised his religion, in part because he knew it could hurt his chances at getting elected. Many viewed Catholicism in a negative way at the time. ""I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic,"" he said in a campaign speech. In contrast, Biden has highlighted his faith. ""Kennedy was more a Catholic, in the background, whereas it's very much in the forefront of President Biden's life,"" says Drew Christiansen, a Jesuit priest and Georgetown University professor. Partly as a result, Biden's relationship with the church has been scrutinised during his time in office. At the same time, conservative bishops have criticised him for his progressive views, and say that he should be denied communion. In June, clergy members voted to draft a statement about the Eucharist during a meeting of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, an association that was chartered by the Vatican. A group of bishops are now writing a statement that explores the theology behind Holy Communion, as the ritual of the Eucharist is known.""When someone is formally co-operating with abortion, that's a great offence within the church,"" says Anna Lulis, a data strategist and activist, sitting in her Washington living room, surrounded by dried palm leaves and images of the Virgin Mary. Biden is ""living in mortal sin"", she says, because of his support for abortion rights, and should not receive communion. Biden was asked last month about the movement among conservative Catholics, and their efforts to deny him communion. He said he did not think that the church would implement a policy that would forbid him from receiving the Eucharist. ""That's a private matter,"" he said, when asked about the issue. ""I don't think that's going to happen.""But in fact, as the president knows, his relationship with the church is a subject of great interest to the public. That is unsurprising, given the way that politics and religion are mixed together in the US, a trend that has accelerated in recent years. Today, it can be hard to run for office without professing fealty to a Higher Power. Though America as a whole has become more secular, religious affiliation in politics is still important to many. Even fictional US leaders are religious - President Josiah Bartlet of the TV drama The West Wing, was written as a devout Catholic for whom faith and politics collide. And off screen, less than half of Republicans say they would be willing to vote for an atheist, according to Gallup, arguably making faith an unspoken credential for winning office. Within the structure of the Catholic church, archbishops and local priests would make their own decision on whether or not to give the president, or any politician, the wafer at Mass, or to send them away. Father Kevin Gillespie, the pastor at Holy Trinity in Georgetown, welcomes the president, and so do those in the parish. They are following the wishes of Washington's archbishop, Wilton Gregory, who hasmade it clearthat he does not believe priests should deny the Eucharist to the president.""We should be a church in dialogue, even with those with whom we have some serious disagreements,"" Gregory told the Catholic News Service. Today there are some 51m Catholics in the US, about one-fifth of the population. These faithful are split down the middle, 48-47%, between Republicans and Democrats. Only a small portion, 14%, say it is very important for a candidate to share their religious beliefs,according to the Pew Research Center. Yet there is a deep divide among practising US Catholics over the president and the Eucharist. A majority said they believed the president should not be denied communion because of his views on abortion, butnearly a third disagreed, including a majority of Republican or Republican-leaning Catholics. Adam Wozniak, a Latin major at Georgetown, a Jesuit university near Holy Trinity, says a hallmark of Catholicism is ""faith that does justice"". He thinks the president embodies this ethos through his efforts to help the middle class, and promote racial equity.""I think that Biden really does represent that kind of faith, because he does a lot for society,"" he says. ""Abortion is just one part, and I think if you just focus on that, you'll forget the bigger picture.""Manny Yrique, a self-described ""cradle Catholic"" who makes promotional products for companies in Phoenix, sees it differently. Biden and other politicians who support reproductive rights are going against church doctrine, he says. The president should stand back during Mass, and not take the Eucharist: ""He's placed himself above the teachings of the church.""Nate Tinner-Williams, who is studying black Catholicism at Xavier University in New Orleans, does not approve of Biden's stance on abortion. Still, Tinner-Williams says that the president should decide for himself whether or not to receive communion, and that a church edict about the matter would be excessive, even harmful.""You don't know what that person actually believes in that moment,"" says Tinner-Williams, describing the experience of waiting to receive communion, during Mass. ""Biden could show up in line, and then change his mind about abortion.""Tinner-Williams adds: ""A church policy could lend itself to misjudging a person.""Jamie Manson, an openly gay pro-choice activist, likes the way that Biden mixes faith with politics.""I think he's a good Catholic because of the way he dissents,"" Manson says, adding that he ""invokes his faith"" on a regular basis and ""uses his faith to understand his own suffering"". She believes Biden should be able to receive communion. The faithful are now arguing with each other about the Eucharist, and the president. If the bishops take additional steps to deny him communion, many liberals will rebel against them. Regardless of how the bishops vote, however, one thing is clear: politics in the US has become increasingly divisive among Catholics, reflecting a national trend outside of the church.

The Northern Cheyenne Tribe sued the federal government this week, claiming the feds have unlawfully stymied the tribe’s efforts to take over policing responsibilities from the government in the face of longstanding complaints about staffing levels, investigations and crime rates. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U. S. District Court in Billings, claims the Bureau of Indian Affairs delayed and then unlawfully denied the tribe’s application to take over some policing responsibilities on the Northern Cheyenne’s approximately 440,000-acre reservation. The BIA is an agency within the Department of Interior. The tribe relies on the BIA for law enforcement services on the reservation, which it described as chronically inadequate.“The Tribe has been dissatisfied with the level of law enforcement service provided by the Bureau for several years and has attempted to work with the Bureau to address the issues, including a lack of qualified officers assigned to the Reservation and a lack of adequate criminal investigations,” the complaint states. The lawsuit comes after the tribe and others — including Montana’s two U. S. senators — havecomplained about high crime rates and too few police officersto effectively respond to calls and conduct investigations. According to the BIA, it should have at least 19 law enforcement staff members on the reservation, the lawsuit claims. But over the last several years, an average of fewer than six have been assigned there. At times there is only one officer on duty, the lawsuit alleges, making it difficult or impossible to respond to every call for help. In a Thursday statement, Donna Fisher, the tribe’s president, said the tribe and its citizens “have paid the high price of violent crime, including missing and murdered indigenous women, unlawful drug use and distribution, and other crimes” as a result of the BIA’s failure to provide adequate policing.“BIA, which is solely responsible for enforcing the criminal laws on the Reservation, has fallen down on this sacred trust and statutory obligation for many years,” Fisher said. The tribe’s complaints culminated over the summer when a string of homicides on the reservation prompted Montana’s U. S. senators, Jon Tester and Steve Daines, to urge the federal government on the tribe’s behalf to increase the number of officers and investigations on the reservation and improve communication with tribal leaders and victims’ families. Dainesmet with tribal leaders in Octoberto discuss their concerns. Tester, in an Oct. 30 letter, asked for an update on what steps BIA was taking to address the complaints. A simple way to begin addressing crime rates on Northern Cheyenne land, Tester said, is to increase the number of officers available to respond to crimes and other calls for help — a responsibility he said falls to the federal government.“We have to have enough police officers on the ground to protect the people … And I think what adds to the situation in Indian Country is our trust responsibility,” he said in an early December interview with Montana Free Press. “We do have an obligation to make sure we’re doing right.”After the tribe and others raised concerns over the summer, the tribe began working to take over responsibility for criminal investigations and drug enforcement on the reservation from the BIA. Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, tribes can apply to take over roles, such as policing, otherwise assigned to the federal government. On July 20, the tribe sent a letter to BIA stating its intent to apply to assume criminal investigation and drug enforcement duties, according to the lawsuit. The tribe submitted its application Aug. 19. But since then, the tribe alleges, the government violated the self determination act by stalling consideration of the application, failing to share information necessary to complete an accurate application, and failing to offer guidance before ultimately denying the proposal on Nov. 17, based on a variety of inadequacies in the application. According to the tribe’s lawsuit, many of the reasons the BIA offered for the denial violated the self determination act. Fisher’s statement said the tribe is asking the court for an injunction ordering BIA to accept the tribe’s proposals. Neither the BIA nor the Interior Department, which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to emails seeking comment. In his Oct. 30 letter, Tester urged the agency to provide any assistance or information necessary for the Northern Cheyenne to complete the application process.“Senator Tester believes it’s imperative that the federal government upholds its trust and treaty responsibilities and work hand-in-hand with Tribes to advance self-determination,” Tester spokesman Roy Loewenstein said in an emailed statement. Daines, in an emailed statement, said, “It’s unacceptable that the BIA continues to play these bureaucratic games with the Northern Cheyenne.”“Montana’s tribes need to be empowered to ensure the safety of their communities,” he said.

239,U.S. adds to trade blacklist over China's abuse of Muslim minorities,-0.33,45.0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-muslim-uighur-us-trade-blacklist/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"— The Biden administration added 14 Chinese companies to a trade blacklist on Friday over their alleged role in that country's abuses of its Uighur civilians and other Muslim ethnic minorities. The Commerce Department said in a statement that the electronics and technology firms and other businesses helped enable ""Beijing's campaign of repression, mass detention and high-technology surveillance"" against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province. The penalties, which prohibit Americans from selling equipment or other goods to the firms, are the latest from the United States as it steps up financial and trade penalties over China's treatment of the Uyghur people. The Chinese government since 2017 has detained a million or more people in the northwest province of Xinjiang. Critics accuse China of operating forced labor camps and carrying out torture and forced sterilization there as it allegedly seeks to assimilate Muslim ethnic minority groups. In early January, the Chinese Embassy in the U. S.tweeted outlandish claimsthat such policies ""emancipated"" Uighur women and freed them from serving as ""baby-making machines."" Twitter labelled the tweet as violating its rules and subsequently removed it. The Commerce Department also added to the blacklist on Friday companies that it said appeared to be assisting military programs or prohibited nuclear development in Russia, or violating trade sanctions on Iran.""The Department of Commerce remains firmly committed to taking strong, decisive action to target entities that are enabling human rights abuses in Xinjiang or that use U. S. technology to fuel China's destabilizing military modernization efforts,"" Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement. ""We will continue to aggressively use export controls to hold governments, companies and individuals accountable for attempting to access U. S.-origin items for subversive activities in countries like China, Iran and Russia that threaten U. S. national security interests and are inconsistent with our values.""On the last day of the Trump administration, the U. S. Department of State on January 19 declared thatChina's policies on Muslims and ethnic minoritiesin Xinjiang constitute a ""genocide.""New Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not backed away from that determination, saying in his first official remarks in the post that China's Uighur populationhad been subjected to genocide.

241,New EPA Rule Change Saves Industry Money but Exacts a Climate Cost,-6.0,46.33,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28022020/epa-hfc-refrigerant-emissions-climate-hydrofluorocarbons-pollutant-andrew-wheeler/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-02-28,21,"For the latest Trump Administration rollback of Environmental ProtectionAgency rules, the math goes something like this: The change will save businesses and industries $24 million a year. Earth’s atmosphere, on the other hand, will receive emissions of pollutants equivalent to at least 625,000 new cars being added to the road. This week, EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheelersigneda new rule that relaxes the requirements that owners and operators of refrigeration equipment have leak detection and maintenance programs for hydrofluorocarbons, a set of refrigerants oftenreferred to as“climate super-pollutants.”The rule change—the latest reversal of an Obama-era regulation—was part of the administration’sagendato ease burdens on industry.“We just think it’s a baffling and wrong-headed move,” said David Doniger, a senior strategic director with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposed the rollback. “Considering there are thousands of facilities subject to these rules, [$24 million] is pocket change savings.”We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The rule applies to a large segment of the nation’s commercial sector, from agriculture and crop production to the manufacturing of food and beverage products, petrochemicals, plastics, electronics, medical equipment and even the operation of ice skating rinks. The NRDC said the agency used old data to underestimate the additional greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the rule change. In fact, Doniger said, therule changewill release into the atmosphere pollutants equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions of 1 million cars. An EPA spokeswoman defended Wheeler’s decision, saying that the agency determined that in 2016 it had exceeded its statutory authority by extending leak-detection and maintenance requirements to equipment using refrigerants like hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs replaced earlier refrigerants that severely damaged Earth’s protective ozone layer, and their use has beengrowing. In its new rule, the EPA echoed an industry assertion that the agency lacked the legal authority to retain the Obama-era requirements for HFCs. One of the industry groups backing the Trump administration’s rule change is the National Environmental Development Association’s Clean Air Project, representing major companies such as Boeing, BP, Procter & Gamble, Lilly and Koch Industries. The law firm representing the association did not respond to a request by Inside Climate News for comment. But in written comments to the EPA, a lawyer representing the association called the Obama-era rule “arbitrary” and “punitive.”HFCs are among a group of chemicals known as “short-lived climate pollutants,” which don’t last very long in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide, which in some cases canremainin circulation for thousands of years. Once released into the atmosphere, however, HFCs remain for only about 15 to 30 years, and their impact on global warming can be hundreds to thousands of times greater than that of carbon dioxide,accordingto the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a global partnership working to curb short-lived climate pollutants. Fifteen states and Washington, D. C., tried to persuade the EPA to retain the Obama administration’s leak detection and maintenance rules for HFCs. Led by Massachusetts and California, they argued that the Clean Air Act gave the EPA broad authority to stop leaks from ozone-depleting chemicals and their replacements.“Stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change are among the most severe environmental threats faced by modern human civilization,” the states argued. “The states strongly oppose any EPA action that unlawfully licenses industry to emit more ozone- and climate-damaging chemicals at the expense of human and environmental health and in contravention of the Clean Air Act and its core purposes.”Last year an amendment to the Montreal Protocol—the 1987 treaty that put in check ozone-depleting chemicals—went into force, requiring thephase-outof HFCs by 2030. Ninety-threecountries and the European Union have signed the treaty, although the Trump administration has not yet sent it to the Senate for ratification. Congress is also weighing bipartisan legislation to phase out HFCs. In November, Sens. Tom Carper (D-Del.), and John Kennedy (R-La.)introducedthe American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM), a bill that would authorize a 15-year phasedown of HFCs and has31 cosponsors, including both Republicans and Democrats. Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N. Y.), has introduced a similarbill, with 21 co-sponsors, also including a mix of Republicans and Democrats. Doniger said the strong bipartisan support to tackle HFCs is a sharp contrast to the EPA’s decision to relax the rule on leak detection and maintenance in refrigeration. One provision of the bill, he said, “makes clear EPA has the authority to require refrigerant leak management.”James Bruggers covers the U. S.

Then, the source said, several of the men stormed another recently arrived flight carrying families. The men assaulted the pilots of that plane, who work for a government contractor licensed to fly deportation flights for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while the families were still on board. Three ICE officers were also attacked on that plane, each suffering non-life-threatening injuries, the source said.

She had the bullshit White House position, her husband became a close advisor of her father’s, and her long career as a camera ready socialite already provided an adoring audience. But the truth about Trumpworld is that it doesn’t give a shit about poise, simpering smiles, or making nice with world leaders. They want rage. They want rebellion. They want shitposts. Ivanka couldn’t provide that, but her older brother,Donald Trump Jr, was built for drama. Donald Trump Jr’s political ascent has been evident to anyone paying attention. In just a few years time, Don Jr went from thechinlesseldest Trump promotingdad’s brandto a juggernaut of influence on the right. While Ivanka played diplomat, Don Jr was making the rounds in the right-wingspeaking tour circuit, joining the likes of Charlie Kirk and the Turning Point crew, giving campaign speeches for small-time Congressional hopefuls, andfrequently appearingon Fox News to bemoan the left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and whatever other alarmist content conservatives were feeding off that week. While Ivanka was tittering and feigning expertise indesigner dressesandpant suits, Don Jr was riling upcampaign crowdsinugly sneakers,flannel, andcamo. He even wrotetwobooksduring his father’s time in office, both of which lament so-called cancel culture, demean Democrats, and—most importantly—boldlystand byhis father’s regressivevision for America. And for those who couldn’t catch him on the trail or didn’t care to read his books, there was always his Twitter andInstagram accounts, the latter of which largely acts as a receptacle for right-wing memes, paranoid ramblings about tech censorship, fishing trips, and the occasional photo of his children playing in the pool orfiring machine guns. In 2019,ran alengthy deep diveof the Trump kids, notably the “cold war” that was brewing between Ivanka and Don Jr. Although Don Jr grew in popularity among influential figures on the right, President Trump was still wedded to the idea of Ivanka—gentle, well spoken Ivanka—becoming his legacy:None of this newfound excitement about Don seemed to rub off on the president, however. People close to Trump told me he remained enchanted by the idea of Ivanka as the inheritor of his political legacy. During trips to Mar-a-Lago, he was often heard rhapsodizing about her potential to be the first female president. Don’s political prospects, if they came up at all, were treated as an afterthought. But old dreams die hard, and even Trump couldn’t deny the reality that was before him: Ivanka might have looked good on paper, but Don Jr was the one who carried the flag of Trumpism best. The Atlantic piece noted that Republican tastemakers allprefered Donto his sister, and one Senator even credited Don Jr for helping the party maintain their Senate majority. Trump was impressed. While his sister is considered apariahamong her old acquaintances in New York and is granted only lukewarm reception among the Republican base she spent years cozying up to, Don Jr’s path ahead feels more promising. He has the clout from a loyal audience of extremists, and with his girlfriendKimberly Guilfoyleby his side, the two are light right-wing royalty. Don Jr has even helped launch a lifestyle brand calledField Ethos Journal, which can be summed up as “hunting and drinking but give it Aesthetic™.” So despite his father’s election loss, the path ahead of Don Jr as an influential force for the Republican party and the American right has never looked brighter. And while he’s coy about running for office in the future, it certainly can’t be ruled out. So as the Trump era comes to a close, Don Jr’s legacy is more sinister than simply “rich blowhard granted platform thanks to daddy.” This isn’t a man who shouts into the void, he preaches to his millions of followers, people who are ready to take the Trump doctrine to any and all lengths. If the last four years have taught us anything, it’s to take even the biggest fools seriously. During his father’s last weekend as president, Don Jrposted a photoof himself walking around the White House grounds, with a look of solemn determination.“Looking to the future and excited to see what it holds,” the caption read.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1288289296909986,0.4425865800865801,1016,1,Jezebel

Brushing off the appalling misogyny in the phrase “goes out and yaps,” Ocasio-Cortez immediately took to Twitter to respond — and challenged him to put his money where his mouth is.

Beginning in the ’80s, before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was even born, there were four “Colored Girls” trailblazing in Democratic politics — the Reverend Leah Daughtry, the historic campaign manager Donna Brazile, the Clinton whisperer Minyon Moore and the Democratic National Committee exec Yolanda Caraway. Together, the fearsome foursome (co-authors of For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics) have met for weekly dinners in Washington, D. C., since the early 2000s — and along the way reshaped American politics, emerging from the civil rights era to help elect the first Black president and shape his rhetoric on race. And in recent weeks, the critical Democratic operatives were pushing behind the scenes for the woman who ended up as Joe Biden’s vice presidential pick: Kamala Harris. [Black women] know how to lead; we’ve been doing it for years and it’s time for us to get the credit. Leah Daughtry “I just think she’s been tested on the national stage … and she’s whip smart,” says Caraway in the latest episode of The Carlos Watson Show, hosted by the OZY co-founder and CEO. Harris, the former California attorney general and sitting U. S. senator, ran for president but dropped out in December while facing low polls and fundraising numbers. With her clear eye on the White House — and past cutting attacks on Biden — some Biden allies criticized Harris during the VP search process for her ambition, a line of attack Daughtry finds “really quite ugly.” “It just reminds us how far we as women, we as Black women have to go to be seen as equal. What’s wrong with a little ambition? We’re talking about a business that is all about ambition,” Daughtry says. And Brazile, a two-time DNC chair who made history as the first Black woman to lead a presidential campaign with Al Gore in 2000, points out that Black women make up a critical part of the Democrats’ winning coalition: “Because of our civic participation … we are the future of the Democratic Party.” The four Democratic operatives gave insight into the VP search process, with both Brazile (Gore, in 2000) and Moore (Hillary Clinton, in 2016) having personal experience. Scores of lawyers and accountants investigate the potential nominees, Brazile says, and once it was down to three candidates, the top campaign staff weighed in. Ultimately, it is always the candidate’s choice. “At the end of the day, at 4:30 in the morning, I had no idea he was going to choose Joe Lieberman,” Brazile says. Moore says the Clinton search was similar, and that Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker were both finalists. “If it would have been [the search committee’s] choice, we probably would have said Cory Booker,” Moore says, but she believed Clinton “was just trying to calm the ticket down” with the uncontroversial Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. The four also talked about Black feminism, particularly with the backdrop of national racial justice protests. Daughtry says the marches have revived a conversation about what “good allies” look like. “We see our white sisters willing to have the hard conversations,” she says, a comment that causes Moore to chime in that those same women should have “kicked in” in 2016. “It kicked in for Black women. We saw a qualified white woman,” Moore says. Then “the numbers started rolling in. And we discovered that [52] percent of white women decided that she wasn’t good enough.” “For a long time, Black women have been leading, but we’ve been leading from the back as we push other people forward,” Daughtry says. “And now we are at an age and in an age where Black women are taking their place out front … not because other people can’t do it, but because we know how to lead, we’ve been doing it for years and it’s time for us to get the credit.” With Harris now cemented on the ticket, the credit is coming due.",3,Reliable,0.0135945767195767,0.4536772486772487,889,3,OZY

Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.11 things desperate Dems are willing to do to beat TrumpAfter almost five decades of legalized abortion and 60 million dead American children – a number equivalent to almost one-fifth of the current U. S. population – a seismic shift is occurring in the abortion world. It's all explored in-depth in the current issue of WND's acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, titled ""STOP KILLING BABIES.""They are among 44 Democrats who voted against a plan from Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., that would require those protections.

""The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies.""Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)February 26, 2019Northam, facing calls for his resignation over the blackface/KKK scandal, virtually affirmed infanticide in an interview last month when Virginia lawmakers were considering a bill that effectively would allow abortion at any time, even in the moments after birth. He described what would happen in the case of an abortion procedure in which the baby is born alive.

The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.""The president called it straight out infanticide. Mat Staver, chairman of the Christian legal group Liberty Counsel, charged Democrats are ""playing politics with the lives of newborn children.""""These babies are living, breathing human beings. They are completely separate from their mothers and yet Democrats are demanding these children be sacrificed on the altar of abortion. We must recognize that everyone has a constitutional right to life, no matter if they are one hour or one hundred years old,"" said Staver.

Ben Sasse's straightforward and common sense bill to protect human life is the latest sign of our needlessly polarized times.""""Too many in Washington are engaged in performative displays meant to appeal to fringe supporters,"" she said. ""As we know from our AUL/YouGov national poll, huge majorities even of pro-choice Americans oppose abortion in the final months of pregnancy and oppose denying babies medical care after birth. We’re living through a dark time when the Senate blocks a life-affirming bill that majorities of pro-choice Americans would appear to support.""Forty-four senators opposed Sasse's plan, and only 53 supported it, short of the 60 needed under Senate rules to advance the bill. Trump said: ""This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, it's protecting the lives of innocent babies.""Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said the plan wasn't about restrictions on abortion, which Democrats treat as a holy grail.""It's just about recognizing that a newborn baby is a newborn baby. Period.""The only Democrats to vote against leaving abortion survivors to die without help were Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Doug Jones of Alabama and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Sasse's effort was started after Northam's promotion of abortion after birth.""In Virginia, disgraced Governor Ralph Northam tarnished the American idea of equality under law. He betrayed the universal truth of human dignity and he turned the stomachs of civilized people not just in this country but in every country on Earth,"" Sasse said. The Gateway Pundit blog said: ""This means babies could potentially be murdered in the birth canal and if they are born alive — several Democrats RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT support it — truly scary and barbaric.""Fox News saidconservatives were wondering ""whether Democrats were embracing 'infanticide' to appeal to left-wing voters.""The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would have required that ""any health care practitioner present"" at a birth use ""the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.""""Senators who could not bring themselves to vote to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should reconsider whether or not they have what it takes to serve,"" March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a statement. ""Senator Sasse's common sense bill would merely require doctors assist a newborn struggling to survive after a failed attempt on her life. Anyone who lacks the basic level of human compassion needed to vote in favor of this should quickly find another job.""WND reportedwhen James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family and theJames Dobson Family Institute, the author of dozens of books on family and adviser to at least five presidents, commented just before the vote.""I am truly saddened that we as a country would even have need to protect a child who has survived the horrors of an attempted abortion and has been left to die on a porcelain tray. Shockingly, despite what some politicians like Sen. [Patty] Murray would have you believe, we do not currently have federal protection for babies who have survived such a procedure,"" he said.""Politicians such as Sen. Murray would have you believe that this bill is an affront to a woman's 'health,'"" he said. That's an outright lie and Sen. Murray knows this. She should be ashamed of herself for spreading such a fallacy. This has nothing to do with women's health, but with the health of a precious, struggling newborn gasping for breath after attempted murder,"" Dobson charged. The abandonment of babies who survive abortion procedures was endorsed by Barack Obama while he was a state lawmaker in Illinois. As president, his administrationargued in court on the side of the mob that chanted ""hail Satan"" in 2013in opposition to a Texas bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.",0,Problematic,0.0105642895116579,0.4777459747854484,1624,0,WND
250,A Former Sony Employee Says She Was A Diversity “Token.” She’s Suing For Discrimination,-9.33,38.67,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/sony-racist-discrimination-lawsuit,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Monica Hill was among the employees Sony filmed to promote the company’s diversity. But she says she experienced racism in the workplace and was driven out for speaking up. BuzzFeed News ReporterA still from the Sony Black History Month video showing HillMonica Hill had worked at Sony for about three months when she and other Black employees were invited to appear in the company’s Black History Month video earlier this year and speak about the power of Black voices as “Sony shining stars.” Actor Michael B. Jordan was featured in the video as well, which Hill said made her feel that the company was taking racial issues seriously. Yet Hill soon found that Sony’s representations of diversity did not match her reality, she said. She claimed that after she raised concerns about comments and treatment by her supervisor that she found to be racist, Sony management retaliated against her, excluding her from meetings she said she should have been a part of, stripping her of certain clients, and ultimately firing her while she was on sick leave after catching COVID-19. In a lawsuit filed this week in California state court, the “Sony shining star” claimed she was hired “as a token to fill Sony’s diversity numbers.” “It was a lie,” Hill said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Asked about Hill’s claims in the lawsuit, a Sony spokesperson said “the company does not comment on confidential personnel matters,” but that “diversity, equity and inclusion are core to Sony.” The spokesperson said the company takes complaints “seriously,” conducts proper and thorough investigations, and has a “committed focus” on the success of all of its employees. Around the country, people of color are wondering whether the reckoning over racial inequality over the last year will have any meaningful impact, including in corporate America. BuzzFeed News recently spoke to people at nearly a dozen companies who said theydread confronting racism in the workplace againwhen offices reopen. While Sonystatedon its diversity page that “diversity and inclusion are encoded in our DNA and shape a vibrant corporate culture” and last year expressedsolidaritywith Black Lives Matter and the Black community at large, Hill said that in her experience the company did not live up to such statements. Her experience at Sony was riddled with “microaggressions,” Hill, who is 40 and lives in Orlando, said in an interview. “It’s the disparaging comments that are often made, that people look past. It’s being blocked from opportunities that others would have.”After Sony asked Hill to appear in the Black History Month video in January, Hill said, her supervisor, senior sales manager Jaime Raffone, pushed back on Hill appearing in it. Hill claimed in her lawsuit that in conversations, Raffone said the “Black Lives Matter movement had made Blacks feel more powerful than they are and that Blacks should feel grateful for whatever they are given,” that “she appreciates Blacks ‘who know their place’ and are willing to work hard instead of being given welfare,” and thatKamala Harriswas picked to serve as vice president “because of pressure from the Black Lives Matter movement.”Raffone, who is among the defendants listed in the lawsuit and has worked at Sony for more than 20 years, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment. Sony and Raffone have not yet filed a legal defense to the claims. A third-party investigation conducted for Sony earlier this year looking into Hill’s allegations of mistreatment and offensive comments concluded that there was no evidence that company policy had been violated, according to the lawsuit. Monica HillHill said she spoke to sales director Kevin O’Connor, company vice president of B2B Rich Ventura, and human resources manager Matthew Whelan about her manager’s alleged statements and treatment of her, but said they dismissed her complaints. Hill later went back to Human Resources with concerns that Raffone, O’Connor, and Whelan were all personally close and therefore had a conflict of interest, according to the complaint. O’Connor, Whelan, and Ventura are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit. None of them responded to multiple requests for comment, and they have not yet responded in court to the suit. Raffone and other members of Sony management “began a campaign of retaliation against [her] in an attempt to sabotage her success at Sony and to cast her out,” according to the complaint. Her manager started a “success plan” on April 22 to improve Hill’s performance over the next 30 days but took opportunities away from her — like pulling her off certain accounts and excluding her from a meeting despite the client’s requests to include her, the complaint stated. Hill said that working for the company had been a dream since she’d gotten her first pair of Sony headphones years ago. When she was interviewing for a position last October, Hill said, Sony emphasized diversity and inclusion. She was encouraged to apply and was hired for a job forming strategic partnerships with companies that would buy Sony products such as projectors and screens. In her complaint, however, Hill said that she had been hired so that Sony could “fulfill its diversity requirements” but was not given “equal opportunities for success.”As anaffirmative action employer, a distinction granted to federal contractors, Sony is required to “recruit and advance qualified minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and covered veterans or lose its current contracts and eligibility for future contracts,” according to Hill’s attorney Nancy Abrolat. Hill claimed that despite these requirements, her managers at Sony subjected her to racial and gender discrimination during much of her nearly seven months at the company, a time she spent working remotely, communicating over phone and video calls. She is suing Sony for damages, lost earnings, and injunctive relief to comply with affirmative action employment laws and to stop discrimination based on race and gender at Sony. An employee who worked with Hill and asked not to be named to protect their privacy echoed Hill’s claims, recounting that managers asked them to not explain certain business practices to Hill and exclude her on relevant calls unless otherwise necessary. Often, the employee said, Hill was passed up for work opportunities.“It seemed very directed [against Hill],” said the employee, who was at Sony when Hill filed her complaints but has since left the company. The employee who worked with Hill said that a representative contacted them as part of an HR inquiry involving Hill, but that the gist of the questions revolved around Hill’s behavior, according to their interpretation of the conversation: “Was she out of hand? Was she, you know, was she an angry Black woman?” the employee recalled. “They didn't ask that question specifically, obviously, but that's what it felt like.”BuzzFeed News also reached out to four other Sony employees in an effort to corroborate allegations made in the lawsuit, though none had responded by the time of publication. In May, Hill’s husband, daughters, and eventually Hill herself got COVID-19, she said. Shortly after she went on sick leave on May 19, she was let go, her lawsuit stated. According to her complaint, “Sony’s reasoning for her termination was [her] supposed failure to meet the requirements set forth in her 'success plan.'”Hill saw it differently.“Diversity and inclusion fraud is real,” Hill said in an interview. She hoped to speak up for others experiencing discrimination despite their employers’ pledges, she said. “I want to give them a voice.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.0163112455726092,0.365137987012987,1570,3,BuzzFeed News
251,Rudy Giuliani Is Getting Roasted for Releasing a Statement on the Michael Cohen Testimony That May Have Actually Made Things Worse For Donald Trump,-21.67,17.33,https://secondnexus.com/news/rudy-giuliani-michael-cohen-donald-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/second-nexus-bias-and-reliability/,2019-02-27,25,"President Donald Trump's attorney and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has widely established a perception of ineptitude after months ofcontradictory explanationsfor Trump's actions and a series of verbal gaffes that have sincebeen immortalized. So it's fair to say he lived up to expectations when responding to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen's leaked opening statement ahead of Cohen's testimony to the House Oversight Committee Thursday morning. In the statement, Cohen calls Trumpa racist, a conman, and a cheat. What's more, he presents documents which supposedly prove the allegation. As usual, Giuliani attempted to defend the President, unequivocally denying Cohen's allegations and dismissing his credibility. Also as usual, Giuliani succeeded in making things worse for the President. Giuliani said:Giuliani cited Cohen's alleged ties to Russian organized crime while attempting to discredit his testimony against a President who's fended off allegations of entanglement with Putin for the better part of the last two years. Classic. Many noticed that Giuliani's statement made Trump look bad on the Russia front. They gave Rudy and Trump a challenge. Many demanded that Trump and Giuliani follow Cohen's lead and testify under oath. Some also warn that Giuliani will face the same fate as Cohen, with perhaps even less mercy. Cohen's testimony is seven hours away at the time of this article's writing. It's already making waves.",0,Problematic,0.0545454545454545,0.3182216905901117,327,1,Second Nexus

253,‘Boogaloo’ Believers Think a Civil War Is Coming. These Gun Firms Are Openly Marketing to Them.,-6.33,46.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/06/boogaloo-gun-ammunition-marketing-facebook-instagram/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-26,16,"In mid March, Fenix Ammunition, an ammunition manufacturer in Michigan, saw its daily online sales rise from$4,000 to $40,000. The coronavirus pandemic hadboosted demand for gunsand ammunition around the country, and Fenix was reaping the fruits of the national following it has cultivated since its 2016 launch. In addition to record high civilian demand, Fenix also counted at least three local police departments, a law enforcement training center, and KelTec, one of theleading rifle manufacturersin America, among its clients. But Fenix’s March profits were also driven by an aggressive social media campaign led by its owner, Justin Nazaroff. For months, Nazaroff had been posting memes to his company’s Facebook and Instagram pages referencing the “boogaloo,” slang for the armed uprising that a looseassortment of preppers, Second Amendment activists, and anti-government extremists is getting ready for — and in some cases trying to accelerate.“I’ll be honest, it drives sales,” Nazaroff said in April of his company’s marketing practices. “People think it’s funny. People click on boogaloo memes. It’s something that gun people enjoy joking about.”“You can look up any firearms social media influencer and probably find them using the term boogaloo at some point in time,” he added. Nazaroff cut off communication after a police department notified him of our records request seeking information about sales to Fenix and emails referencing boogaloo. The word itself is a reference to the 1984 movie, “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo,” but the imagined sequel would be a second civil war. Sometimes re-tooled as “big luau” or “big igloo” (adherents often don floral Hawaiian shirts or insignia bearing cartoon igloos), the conceptreportedlyoriginated on 4chan, the anonymous image board that’s long been a meeting place for the alt-right. While some spreaders of boogaloo memes claim to see them as provocative fun, their mushrooming popularity has concerned experts on extremism. They fear that the concept has re-energized the American militia movement and given anti-government extremists a rallying cry. Boogaloo is not a true movement in the sense that there is little — if any— structure or leadership. Adherents even seem to havedifferent visionsof what a civil war would accomplish. But to the extent that there is a central idea animating the boogaloo’s largely white, right-wing supporters, it’s that armed combatants will kick off a full-fledged rebellion to topple the federal government. “They don’t have a lot of beliefs other than they really like guns, they really hate cops, and they want some sort of revolution,” said Megan Squire, a computer scientist who researches online extremism at Elon University. “You pretty much have to be weapons-trained and interested in weapons to be a boogaloo adherent.”In the past month, at least seven people with boogaloo ties have been arrested for attempting or carrying out violence at recent protests. On June 6, Air Force Sergeant Steve Carillo allegedly shot two Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s deputies, killing one. He was arrested after scrawling the word “boog” in blood on the hood of a stolen car alongside phrases from memes that are popular in boogaloo groups. Carillo was also charged with shooting two guards outside an Oakland, California, courthouse during protests a week earlier. One died. That morning, Carillo had posted to Facebook: “Go to the riots and support our own cause. Show them the real targets. Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.” A boogaloo patch was recovered from the van that he used that day. A suspected accomplice was also arrested after confessing to the FBI. On the day of the Oakland shooting,three menwere arrested in Las Vegas on suspicion of possessing homemade explosives and on charges of conspiracy to commit an act of domestic terrorism near protests. Though they have since pleaded not guilty, the criminal complaint against them noted boogaloo ties. And, inSouth Carolina, two men with boogaloo connections were separately arrested on charges of looting and attempting to incite a riot. At least two more boogaloo supporters were arrested for the possession of illegal firearms inOklahomaandTennessee. InColorado, police seized multiple weapons from one boogaloo supporter at a protest, but did not make an arrest. On June 26, Attorney General William Barr created a task force aimed at fighting extremism, and in a memo he singled out boogaloo supporters, as well as members of the left-leaning antifa. Even before the protests, several boogaloo supporters had attempted to incite violence. In March, a Missouri man who planned to bomb a hospital in what he called “operation boogaloo” shot and killed himself before he could be arrested by the FBI. In April, a member of several boogaloo Facebook groups was arrested in Texas, live streaming as he searched for police to kill.“Boogaloo boys,” as they call themselves, have been spotted at protests following the killing of George Floyd, both marching with demonstrators and as counter-protesters. Some have also beendiscussinghow to use the protests to encourage violence. The varied response is indicative of supporters’ lack of a unifying ideology. Their fixation on guns and tactical gear makes boogaloo supporters attractive clients for gun sellers. And hashtagged social media posts are an effective way for weapons dealers to boost their brands. Firearms sellers are not allowed to purchase ads on Facebook, though some havefound ways around this, but they can use their official pages to reach niche audiences. When COVID-19 lockdowns seemed to validate adherents’ expectations of government overreach, use of the term boogaloo exploded on mainstream social media sites like Facebook and Reddit. In April, the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit that monitors activity on major online platforms, documented 125 boogaloo Facebook groups with over 72,000 members. More than 60 percent had been created since February — the same time that Fenix’s use of boogaloo-related hashtags peaked, according to data from the company’s Instagram page. Around the same time, a review posted on Fenix’s Facebook page revealed that the company was sending stickers to online customers that featured the “boogaloo flag,” a black and white American flag with a floral Hawaiian stripe and a cartoon igloo instead of stars. When contacted, the reviewer said he had found the company by searching for competition-grade ammunition, and that the sticker helped cement his loyalty to Fenix. A December 19, 2019, post on Fenix’s Instagram page, which has nearly 34,000 followers, shows the Sesame Street character Cookie Monster photoshopped so that he’s holding an AR-15 and wearing night-vision goggles. “B is for Boogaloo” is written over the bright yellow background. “And V is for Virginia,” read Fenix’s caption, which went on to offer “free shipping on ammunition, body armor and medical products” sent to the state. The offer lasted through a January 20 rally to oppose new gun laws, one that sparked a state of emergency order from Governor Ralph Northam asarmed militiasand white nationalist groups implored their members to attend the demonstration. In the days before the rally, members of a neo-Nazi group calledThe Basewere arrested after federal agents said two of them discussed opening fire on the rally. An FBI affidavit claimed the group wanted to use the event to start the boogaloo, which some neo-Nazis see as a race war or civilizational collapse. There is no evidence that The Base acquired ammo from Fenix, and on June 25, Fenix posted on Instagram about our reporting, writing: “Our company wants nothing to do with anyone claiming to be a Nazi, or a white supremacist. We’ve banned people from our page for saying such things in the past and we’ll continue to do so in the future. The Boogaloo is for everyone. “Since October 2019, Fenix has made over 100 posts using hashtags and imagery related to the boogaloo. Many were linked to events like the Virginia rally, national anti-lockdown demonstrations, and recent anti-racism protests. “This is what the politicians and media fear the most” read a June 5 post showing a diverse group of protesters holding a boogaloo flag on a city street. In another post, Fenix responded to a suggestion that looters target white neighborhoods, like Novi, Michigan, the Detroit suburb where Fenix is located. The response included a picture of four high-powered guns with the comment “send bachelors.”The Trace has identified 35 more dealers and manufacturers of firearms or tactical supplies across the country that have posted references to the boogaloo on social media. They range from small town stores to multi-million dollar manufacturers of AR-style weapons, like the South Carolina-based Palmetto State Armory. We also reviewed the online presence of 548 federally licensed firearms dealers in Michigan,where armed protesters converged on the state Capitol, and identified 48 with active social media profiles. Six of those posted memes or hashtags referencing the boogaloo. Eight promoted insignia from militia groups like the Three Percenters, an armed anti-government group with chapters around the country. Another six promoted coronavirus conspiracy theories or encouraged disobedience against state lockdown measures. Three made suggestive posts about shooting looters during the protestsInstagram no longer allows searches for #boogaloo and some related hashtags on its site. However, as of June 24, if you typed #boogaloo into the search bar, it still autofilled suggestions of related hashtags. After being asked about this by The Trace, a spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram and has been criticized for itsfailureto rein in boogaloo content, said, “The hashtag #boogaloomemes was already blocked and we’ve since further blocked #boogalooboys, #boogaloocrew, and #boogalootime given the amount of content using these hashtags that violated our policy.”The spokesperson added, “we continue to remove content using boogaloo and related terms when accompanied by statements and images depicting armed violence. We are also preventing these pages and groups from being recommended on Facebook.”Boogaloo marketing isn’t limited to social media. Some companies, like Fenix, sell boogaloo-themed merchandise. For instance, in February, Palmetto State Armory sold a limited run of custom boogaloo-themed AK-47-style guns, finished with Hawaiian patterns, mimicking the shirts boogaloo supporters have adopted as an unofficial uniform. They also advertise boogaloo T-shirts on Facebook. Palmetto State Armory CEO Jamin McCallum did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. Hoplite Armor, a body armor manufacturer in Kalispell, Montana, sells a Hawaiian-patterned plate carrier — a kind of bullet-proof vest — as a part of its “Aloha Line” of products. The traditional flowers have been replaced with a blood-stained bauhiniaflower, which adorns the Hong Kong flag frequently carried by protesters there. During an interview, Hoplite’s owner, Lyman Bishop, said he was inspired to make the shirt on a trip to Hawaii, and not because of the boogaloo. Yet a September 27, 2019 Facebook post introducing the plate carrier was tagged with #boogaloo. The company’s page, with more than 142,000 followers, has continued to use the hashtag as well as associated language and imagery. Bishop is currently a long-shot candidate for governor of Montana on the Libertarian Party ticket, running on an apocalyptic platform that suggests violent secession. In spite of significant anti-police sentiment among boogaloo boys, Fenix’s website lists four Michigan police departments as major clients, as well as the law enforcement training center at Schoolcraft College. Records from police departments in the small cities ofDowagiacandBerkleyshowed receipts from Fenix totaling $4,899 and $18,076, respectively, since 2017. The Grosse Ile Police Department confirmed that it had records of purchases, but has yet to release them. The Northville Police Department denied buying ammunition from Fenix, and a records request returned no receipts from the company. The Schoolcraft training center confirmed it had purchased ammo from Fenix, but refused to say how much. All of the organizations said they had no knowledge of Fenix’s support for boogaloo, and don’t have policies on checking suppliers’ social media accounts. Fenix’s social media posts have been largely pro-police, sprinkled with some criticism of police brutality, including the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Interviews with firearms dealers revealed a host of reasons for posting about the boogaloo or selling related merchandise. Chris David, the owner of Route 6 Guns, a small shop in Torrington, Connecticut, said that he posts about boogaloo for his company’s 650-odd followers because he believes in the movement’s libertarian messaging. “It’s a lot more mainstream than I think people give the movement credit for because of the portrayal that it’s just this group of people that have these violent intentions, which is just not the case,” said David. David successfully lobbied for a spot on a list of pro-boogaloo companies in one of Facebook’s largest boogaloo groups, which, as of June 8, no longer appears in Facebook searches. It’s unclear whether this is because the group was made secret or if it was taken down by Facebook. All five firearms and armor dealers that agreed to be interviewed for this story denied that their posts should be interpreted as calls to violence. Nazaroff likened spreading the memes to being an ammunition seller: He said he’s aware of the possibility that his product may be used in violent crimes against innocent people. “That’s the nature of the product,” Nazaroff said. “There’s nothing to be done about that. It doesn’t mean that my company shouldn’t exist.”“It’s literally an internet joke. It’s like ‘Harambe,’” said Dimitri Karras of Firearms Unknown, which sells “ghost guns,” unserialized but legal firearm parts that can be assembled by customers at home. “I’m a Marine who’s fought in two wars. I have a dark sense of humor. That’s just who I am.”The use of humor to cover up intentions or shift the boundaries of acceptable discourse has a history in the alt right. In 2017, The Huffington Post publishedexcerptsfrom the style guide for the Daily Stormer, one of the largest white supremacist websites, instructing supporters to employ jokes instead of screeds, noting that the latter may be a “turnoff” to potential converts. “The reader is at first drawn in by curiosity or the naughty humor,” it stated, “and is slowly awakened to reality by repeatedly reading the same points.” According to historian Elaine Frantz Parsons, the use ofhumoras a way to destigmatize extremist ideologies dates back at least to the creation of the Ku Klux Klan. Whether the inflammatory memes that boogaloo supporters share reflect their true beliefs can be hard to pin down — and some experts say that’s by design. Nazaroff, for instance, said he considers himself a liberal libertarian and boogaloo “prepper.” He believes in the possibility of civil war, but like other arms dealers interviewed for this story, stressed that the memes shouldn’t be taken seriously. But Cassie Miller, a researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said: “They pretend that it’s a joke. In some ways that’s to conceal just how serious and sometimes dangerous the ideas that they’re pushing are.“Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington all closed dealers because of the coronavirus. Firearms were still flying off shelves.",3,Reliable,0.0209496984496984,0.3797152615902617,3596,3,The Trace
254,How Covid vaccine incentives failed America,-16.67,28.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/how-covid-vaccine-incentives-failed-america-n1274844,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"The other night, I told my two kids to “put on your socks and shoes” so we could all go out and pick up dinner. But my oldest insisted that she didn’t want to go. ""That’s fine,"" I told her, ""but we’re picking up dessert and if you don’t come, there will be none for you."" To my surprise, she agreed to forgo a treat. As a country, we need to stop bending over backwards to appease those who are ignoring science, common sense, and their civic responsibilities. I share that experience because in that brief parenting moment lies the solution for the continued refusal of millions of Americans to get vaccinated against Covid-19. If people want to make the choice not to protect themselves, they can do so. It’s a free country after all, as many of those arguing against vaccination are quick to remind us. But there are also consequences for our choices. Want to see a movie or play, eat in a restaurant, hear a concert, shop at the mall, visit a museum or board a train or a plane? Then get vaccinated and be prepared to show proof of it. Otherwise, be prepared to miss out on those experiences. In other words: No vaccine = no treat. No longer can the country be held hostage to the stubbornness and selfishness of those who are making it impossible for America to move past the pandemic. And we’ve seen proof that mandates work in dislodging the holdouts. Last week in France, where vaccinations hover around 40 percent, President Emmanuel Macron announced this exact policy would begin in August. Within 72 hours,more than 3 million peoplebooked online vaccination appointments. As any parent will tell you, this is not a surprising outcome. Contrary to the current hysteria over vaccination mandates, there is a long history in this country of requiring vaccinations. In the United States, however, it’s the responsible Americans who are being forced to change their behavior. InLos Angeles County, mask-wearing is again mandatory— even for those who are fully vaccinated. There’s a push to do the same in New York City, even though nationwide more than99 percent of people still dyingfrom Covid-19, and the overwhelming majority of those who are hospitalized, are not vaccinated. Since unvaccinated people cannot be trusted under the honor system to wear a mask in indoor settings, the rest of us have to go back to the way things were before vaccines became readily available. Why should the Americans who have done the right thing for themselves, their families and their communities be forced to sacrifice on behalf of those who act as though their “personal choices” have no consequences?Last week, the conservative magazineNational Review published a piecearguing that vaccine-hesitant people “can’t be persuaded if they feel disrespected.” The author has it completely backward: Vaccine-willing people need to be respected. As a country, we need to stop bending over backward to appease those who are ignoring science, common sense and their civic responsibilities. The issue is, of course, much larger than the comfort of vaccinated people. It’s about the millions of Americans who are immunocompromised and still at risk. It’s about safeguarding the children under 12 whostill can’t get the shot. It’s about the small segment of the population that has gotten sick even after getting both vaccine shots. It’s to prevent further variants, like thedelta variant, from developing and spreading. Putting in place vaccine mandates will undoubtedly stir a political backlash, but what other choice is there?America needs to get a significant share of the population vaccinated to build herd immunity, a goal that keeps slipping further and further into the future. Those who refuse are not just hurting themselves: They are hurting all of us — while making it more difficult for the country to finally enter the post-pandemic world. Contrary to thecurrent hysteria over vaccination mandates, there is a long history in this country of requiring vaccinations. Every single state has such requirements for public school students. Since the Covid-19 vaccines were made available under the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization, there isonly so far that the federal government can goin mandating vaccination. But that doesn’t mean it’s powerless to hold unvaccinated people accountable while the FDA moves toward full approval. First, the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has already issued guidance allowing employers to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for workers. Several major companies, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have already implemented such or similar policies. No one is getting fired, butanyone who wants to work in an officehas to be vaccinated. EvenFox Corp. has its own versionof vaccine passports. More than 500 collegesare also requiring students to have proof of vaccination. The Biden administration may not be able to force businesses to implement mandates at present, but the White House should still be encouraging others to follow suit. In addition, the FDA needs to expedite the process of fully approving the vaccines. Considering every public health official both inside and outside of government has declared them safe for use, it shouldn’t be taking so long for the FDA to take this necessary step. Once it happens, the administration should follow France’s path in tightening the mandates on vaccinations. Second,about one-third of the military is unvaccinatedcurrently. President Joe Biden should order every military member to get the Covid-19 vaccine — andhe has the legal authorityto do so. He can also reverse guidance issued last month thatallowed federal employees to go unvaccinated. He should also make it a requirement for federal contractors. Rather than require some international travelers to have proof of a negative Covid-19 test, require them to have proof of vaccination, and that includes Americans. Encourage private airlines to do the same and make it a requirement to board an Amtrak train. (ConsideringAmtrak is a quasi federal organization, it’s hard to see how this couldn’t be the case.)Third, private companies need to pick up the slack. Rather than enact new mask requirements as Covid-19 cases increase and the delta variant runs rampant, they should require customers to provide a record of vaccination before entry into their events and venues. Already, some states have created digital apps that show proof of vaccination;so too have some nonprofitsand private companies. Requiring proof of vaccination would likely push millions of Americans to download and use these digital tools. Knowing they can’t see a movie or go to a concert without getting a shot would almost certainly have a similar effect. There are undoubtedly some hardcore groups and individuals who will never get vaccinated. But, as the recent case in France shows, many Americans are likely on the fence and not sure if a shot is necessary. Depriving them of the opportunities vaccinated people get to enjoy might be enough to convince them. Putting in place vaccine mandates will undoubtedly stir a political backlash, but what other choice is there? Cajoling, encouraging,even incentivizing people who are hesitanthas hit its limits. It’s time for another approach. If people want to make the choice not to vaccinate themselves and put themselves and others at risk, well, you do you. But the rest of us need not bear the consequences of that decision. Michael A.

255,OPINION: The Media Don’t Care That Chris Cuomo’s Wife Was In Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘Little Black Book’,12.0,30.0,https://www.dailywire.com/news/opinion-the-media-dont-care-that-chris-cuomos-wife-was-in-jeffrey-epsteins-little-black-book,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-wire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-19,25,"Earlier this week, it was reported that one name listed in Jeffrey Epstein’s recently published “little black book” was the wife of CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, Cristina Greeven Cuomo.“Jeffrey Epstein’s newly discovered 1997 address book, published by Insider on Tuesday, connects dozens of new names to Epstein and traces previously known relationships back to the 1990s,” reportedBusiness Insider. “One of the new names belongs to Cristina Greeven Cuomo, a New York editor, and entrepreneur. She married Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor and brother of Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, in 2001.”Imagine, for just a moment, that the spouse of a prominent conservative news anchor wasfoundin the “little black book” of one of the most infamous convicted sex offenders in modern history. Based on the legacy media’s reaction to any and all stories related to prominent conservatives in recent years, we could assume that such a discovery would prompt 24/7 wall-to-wall coverage. Don Lemon would cry, Jim Acosta would curse, and Brian Stelter would discuss Fox News’ coverage of the incident. Well, luckily for the Cuomo family, they have a nice blue D next to their name. CNNdidn’t cover the story. Neither didMSNBC,The New York Times, orThe Washington Post. NBC News? Nothing. USA Today? Nope. ABC News? Huh?While it’s important to acknowledge that Cristina Greeven Cuomo’s inclusion in Jeffrey Epstein’s address book doesn’t necessarily imply wrongdoing on her part, does it not seem at least mildly interesting that Epstein’s network appears to include high-profile Leftist after high-profile Leftist … and that the media couldn’t care less?And don’t get me started on the meatball-shaped shield from criticism or controversy that is Chris Cuomo. Throughout 2020, as his big brother oversaw one of the worst COVID-19 policies nationwide, he stood as the face of CNN and spent hours giggling about newsworthy topics, such as Andrew Cuomo’s nostril size. When Andrew Cuomo’s numerous scandals unsurfaced, suddenly it was no longer appropriate for Chris Cuomo — the “Fredo” of the Cuomo family — to voice an opinion. Funny how that works. The problem goes far beyond Chris Cuomo or even the Cuomo empire, however. The fact is that the legacy media are routinely reluctant to even scratch the surface of a story which may not result in gold-plated propaganda for the Leftist involved. If the target is a conservative, then even reality itself comes second to the “scoop.” When a Democrat could suffer, the entire legacy media establishment turns its collective head and points at something shiny and irrelevant. Don’t look over there, they shriek, while continuing to claim to be the defenders of truth. Being a Democrat apparently means never having to say you’re sorry.“Sorry for what?” they say.

It is the most infected county of the most infected state in the most infected country in the world. In the pandemic’s spring wave, New York held that distinction — and it still is the state to have seen the largest single daily number of deaths. But given that the tally of daily cases and hospitalizations continue to skyrocket in L. A. and the fact that ICU availability was 0% in Southern Californiaon Thursday, Los Angeles is unfortunately catching up. On Thursday, another 14,418 Covid-19 infectionswere confirmedin L. A. County. The new cases lifted the countywide cumulative total to 581,519. In a county of 10 million people, that means 1 in 20 residents has had the virus.

L. A. MayorEric Garcettirevealed Thursday evening that city testing results were “seeing a seven-day positivity rate of an alarming 19.6%. Some of our sites have a positivity rate as high as 30%,” he said. For L. A. County, the seven-day rate was 13.7%.”For comparison, at the very beginning of the pandemic, California-at-large had a 40% test positivity rate. But that was when the state was conducting about 2,000 tests a day. And since lower testing numbers tend to produce higher test positivity rates, for L. A. to have 19.6% test positivity even as it is now delivering nearly 41,500 tests a day is frightening. In the past week, San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties have, respectively, registered 1,415 and 1,102 average daily cases per million residents. Of hose are the highest rates in the country aong counties with at least 1 million residents. Riverside County has the fourth-highest daily cases per million. That datais per an aggregator of government statistics used by the CDC called USAFacts. The pandemichit homefor Garcetti on Thursday. The mayor revealed that his nine-year old daughter had tested positive for Covid-19. “Maya is doing fine and her symptoms are mild,” Garcetti said of his daughter. “My wife and I have both been tested and our test results have come back negative,” he said, before adding that he himself was quarantining.“Our family is incredibly careful and what’s happening in my home this week is playing out across Los Angeles and this country,” said Garcetti. The mayor said hospital officials are telling him and his staff that if Los Angeles continues on its upward trend of COVID-19 hospitalizations through Christmas, the medical facilities will “go under,” meaning they won’t be able to adequately servicecoronaviruspatients or patients of other ailments. He also said a “systemwide crisis” may need to be declared and a countywide emergency order could be issued if hospitals remain inundated with patients.“Some hospitals can convert non-[intensive care unit] spaces into ICU spaces, but other hospitals can’t,” Garcetti said, adding ambulances have to be rerouted at times if a hospital is at capacity. That’s if there is capacity elsewhere. Some ambulances in Southern California have had to wait 5 and 7 hours outside ERs to deliver patients. An emergency declaration, Garcetti said, could force the county to enact stricter measures on businesses and order other closures to make sure “we don’t have to have those harrowing visions of doctors deciding who gets that last ventilator and who doesn’t.”Earlier this week, a consortium of powerful unions representing teachers (UTLA), nurses (California Nurses Association), healthcare (National Union of Healthcare Workers), grocery (UFCW 770) and hotel employees called for something similar. Specifically, the unionsaskedthe L. A. County Board of Supervisors to “enact stay at home orders that are strict enough to truly suppress the virus by closing all non-essential businesses and activities in the County, for the first four weeks of January. Garcetti said on Thursday that if the current trends continue for the next three to five weeks, the county’s health system will “have nothing left.”You can watch the Mayor’s news conference below.

The complaint, filed on behalf of several detained immigrants and a nurse named Dawn Wooten, details several accounts of recent “jarring medical neglect” at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, which is run by the private prison company LaSalle South Corrections and houses people incarcerated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In interviews with Project South, a Georgia nonprofit, multiple women said that hysterectomies were stunningly frequent among immigrants detained at the facility.“When I met all these women who had had surgeries, I thought this was like an experimental concentration camp,” said one woman, who said she’d met five women who’d had hysterectomies after being detained between October and December 2019. The woman said that immigrants at Irwin are often sent to see one particular gynecologist outside of the facility. “It was like they’re experimenting with their bodies.”In one case, Wooten said, a woman who ended up with a hysterectomy was not properly anesthetized and overhead the doctor say that he’d taken out the wrong ovary. That woman had to go back and get her other ovary removed as well, Wooten said.“We’ve questioned among ourselves, like, goodness, he’s taking everybody’s stuff out,” said Wooten, who was a full-time employee at Irwin until July. “That’s his specialty, he’s the uterus collector. I know that’s ugly.”“Is he collecting these things or something,” she continued. “Everybody he sees, he’s taking all their uteruses out or he’s taken their tubes out. What in the world.”Wooten also said she’d talked to several detained immigrants who’d had hysterectomies but didn’t know why. One detained immigrant told Project South that, ahead of the scheduled procedure, she was given multiple different explanations about what would happen and why it was necessary. While ICE reported in August that 41 immigrants at Irwin have tested positive for COVID-19, Wooten believes that the true number may be much higher, according to the complaint. Women housed in multiple units in the facility allegedly exhibited COVID-19 symptoms, but were not tested for the virus for weeks. Immigrants have also allegedly continued to be transferred in and out of the facility, against guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and the advice of Irwin’s own medical director. The complaint also alleges that both the detained immigrants and staffers at Irwin lacked the personal protective equipment they need to stay safe during the coronavirus pandemic: People in both groups have only received one mask each since the pandemic broke out. It is also impossible to socially distance within the facility, according to the complaint.“There is no way to protect [against COVID-19] at all here in the facility,” one immigrant said. “We share everything together. There is no way at all we can feel protected here in the facility. Detained immigrants also said that the medical and quarantine unit in one part of the Irwin facility were filthy. One woman said she had to clean her cell using shampoo because staffers wouldn’t give her any cleaning chemicals; she recalled seeing another woman use her socks to do the same.“If it wasn’t for my faith in God, I think I would have gone insane and just break down and probably gone as far as hurting myself,” the woman said. “There are a lot of people here who end up in medical trying to kill themselves because of how crazy it is.”Some men at the facility even went on hunger strike, demanding to be released or to have better protections against the coronavirus, according to the complaint. But nothing changed. Meanwhile, employees are also expected to work even if they have COVID-19 symptoms and are awaiting their test results, Wooten said. And management at the facility also allegedly refuses to tell officers if any detained immigrants have tested positive for COVID-19, which could heighten their risk of contracting the virus.“Ms. Wooten explained that she believes ICDC is hiding information about COVID-19 in order to keep things quiet,” the complaint alleged. “She stated that everyone in the facility is scared at this point, so management does not want to tell officers and detained immigrants the truth because they are afraid of an uproar. Instead, the secrecy has created a ‘silent pandemic’ where even if officers get COVID-19 from the facility, the officers won’t be able to blame ICDC because no one knows how prevalent COVID-19 is inside ICDC due to not testing detained immigrants and not sharing who has the virus.”Besides Project South, the advocacy groups Georgia Detention Watch, Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, and South Georgia Immigrant Support Network helped file the complaint with the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General. Law and Crime published the complaintafterthe Intercept covered some of the allegationsinside it. LaSalle Corrections didn’t immediately respond to a VICE News request for comment. In the past, the Irwin County Detention Center has repeatedly been found to be in compliance with ICE’s detention standards. In a statement, ICE said it does not comment on matters handled by the Office of the Inspector General.“ICE takes all allegations seriously and defers to the OIG regarding any potential investigation and/or results,” the agency said. “That said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve.”",2,Generally Reliable,-0.0504704580047045,0.3706136709561367,1276,3,Vice

Trump demonstrated yet again his inordinate ability to turn any expression of sympathy or respect into ultimately a statement about himself when he attempted to pay tribute to Sean Connery, the Scottish actor who gained his initial fame as the first man to play the iconic fictional British secret agent 007, James Bond. Trump posted a couple of tweets this morning about Connery that mostly ignored everything for which the actor was most noted and instead focused on his “tough “character” — an apparently appealing attribute to the over-compensating macho president — and Connery’s role as a life-long avid golfer, an avocation that led the renowned Scottish thespian to urge the local government in his home region of Great Britain to speed approval of Trump’s golf resorts in the area.….all I needed, everything went swimmingly from there. He was so highly regarded & respected in Scotland and beyond that years of future turmoil was avoided. Sean was a great actor and an even greater man. Sincere condolences to his family!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 1, 2020Yes, it appears as if the way to worm oneself into this president’s good graces is simply to do something that he sees advancing his own financial interests. Forget about all the artistic achievements that gave Sean Connery the prominence and credibility to have his words be heeded by the Scottish authorities. The only reason that Trump sees to commemorate the late actor is his role in helping the president see his golfing empire succeed and grow. Trump’s tweet about Connery is the perfect example of Trump’s extreme self-centeredness and his malignant narcissism and should provide one more reason to reject his bid for a second term in office. His inability to use the proper form of the past tense of the verb “to pass” alone should disqualify him from office. With only a few days left until this election becomes history, make sure that you cast your vote for Joe Biden to ensure that empathy and consideration for others beyond one’s own financial self-interest can return to the White House.

259,More than a Meal: How Austin Ministries Are Expanding Thei......,-1.67,46.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/may/austin-camping-ban-tx-homeless-ministry-housing-church.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"East of downtown Austin, a row of more than 20 closely linked tents and makeshift shelters are set up outside the Terrazas Branch of the Austin Public Library, around the corner from Christ Church of Austin. The church’s associate rector, Matt Dampier, visits the homeless encampment on Sundays to meet with people and offer Communion. I walked with him to the encampment shortly after a recent election that reinstated a camping ban designed to remove growing homeless encampments throughout the Texas capital.“They’re trying to get all those homeless people out of sight,” Amy Goldman, 44, told us. “What they need to do is lower the cost of living and allow a living wage.”Goldman, wearing a clean Philippians 4:13 T-shirt, has been homeless for nine years. She moves between this camp, where she shares shelter with another person, and one further south where she keeps her own tent tucked away. Goldman’s response accurately reflects that someone with a minimum-wage job ($7.25 an hour) would have to work 120 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Austin, according toEnding Community Homeless Coalition (ECHO) 2020 data. Limping along the wet sidewalk after a heavy downpour, Stephen Holmes, 54, stops to speak with us, his bare feet splattered with post-rain debris and his disabled left leg jutting outward.“I’m not living the American dream,” Holmes said. He’s originally from Austin and attended Anderson High School on the northwest side of town. “I’m an Anderson Trojan,” he said proudly, as my heart sunk even further when I heard him name my neighborhood school. Holmes had been on disability and taking care of his father for 10 years before he died. He became homeless for the first time three months ago. “I want to be self-sufficient,” he said. “The state is going to need to find some cheap housing.” Dampier asked Holmes if he could pray for him, which he did. Goldman and Holmes are among some 3,160 people experiencing homelessness in Austin/Travis County, with 2,238 of those living unsheltered in tents, cars, and abandoned buildings as opposed to traditional shelters, according to 2021 statistics fromECHO. Austin’sHomeless Response Systemshows a 4.5 percent increase in the unhoused from 2019 to 2021, with a 20.6 percent increase for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Historically, the role of churches has been to distribute meals, clothing, and hygiene items, as well as offer community and fellowship, said Emily Seales, a Christian social worker who was a case management supervisor at Trinity Center in downtown Austin and is now engaged in a technology and health research study for Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center and the University of Texas. Growth in encampments over the past two years and recent debate over the reinstated public camping ban have led more leaders, such as Seales, to focus both on temporary assistance for their vulnerable neighbors and on advocacy to fix what they see as broken systems that have left people without livable wages and affordable housing in the first place. Part of that advocacy includes accelerating cooperative efforts between the city, established nonprofits, churches, faith-based organizations, and individuals.“I don’t think the city knows what to do with faith communities,” said Cathy Stone, associate pastor at First United Methodist Church in downtown Austin. “But I think it’s important that we start practicing and showing that we can do more and that we also want to be involved in advocating and decision making.”The bipartisan advocacy group Save Austin Now campaigned this spring to reinstate the public camping ban that Austin city leaders lifted back in 2019. The proposed ban, called Proposition B, passed in a May 1 special election, with 58 percent of voters in favor and 42 percent against. The ban now makes sitting, lying, or camping in public a criminal offense and prohibits soliciting money at certain times and locations. Now, Texas ismoving toward banning camping statewide. The clearing of encampments will be delayed to allow the city time to implement a four-phase plan that includes conducting outreach and community engagement before enforcing the ban through citations and arrests. Austin’s city manager, Spencer Cronk, said at a press conference that the city is looking into a variety of housing options, including city-sanctioned encampments—with the possibility of some on church properties. As one of its temporary solutions, the city has purchased three hotels to help with the transition to permanent housing. Stone’s downtown church was highly vocal against the ban, including its senior pastor, Taylor Fuerst, who preached against it prior to early voting. Christ Church on the east side, where Dampier has been building relationships with members of the homeless community, was more divided. In Dampier’s 800–900 person congregation, those in favor of reinstating the camping ban argued that the city failed to find housing solutions in the two years that the ban was lifted and raised concerns about the lack of dignity and vulnerability of living on the streets. Last year was one of the deadliest for people experiencing homelessness in Austin, with at least 256 deaths, KUTreported, based on figures from Austin’s street newspaperEven those against the ban did not want to see people living permanently in encampments, Dampier said, but they were concerned about the lack of space at shelters to house them. Most of the people he spoke with preferred a more phased-out approach to empower those in encampments and incentivize cleanup. For years, Christians in Austin have offered aid and assisted in rehousing, and those efforts have continued during the pandemic. In downtown Austin, Trinity Center provides meals, bus passes, and case management, and in East Austin, Angel House, Austin Baptist Chapel’s soup kitchen, has remained opened for breakfast. Austin’s well-known Mobile Loaves & Fishes food truck ministry has served millions of meals since 1998, and its tiny house Community First! Village is planning its fourth phase of development that will add 1,400 tiny houses over the next decade to its existing 500-house, 51-acre full-service community northeast of town. First United Methodist houses a Mobile Loaves & Fishes food truck and supplies volunteers for its downtown run. Prepandemic, the congregation also fed breakfast to 250–300 people twice a week followed by a worship service, and it continues to provide showers for women. Mission Possible sets up Church Under the Bridge, where four churches sponsor a Sunday a month to host weekly worship at encampment sites beneath overpasses. Amy and Simon Kenyon, members of Christ Church, can walk to the bridge at Sixth Street and I-35 where they’ve been leading services for 50–60 people on the first Sunday of the month for eight years. They hand out sausage wraps and coffee, which is secondary to the worship service, they said. The Kenyons consider the gospel as the transformative factor for those experiencing homelessness. “It’s shocking to us how little faith Christians have in the gospel,” Amy Kenyon said. “It’s usually heart issues that lead people to the streets.”Factors around homelessness abound, according to social worker Emily Seales, and include trauma, domestic violence, chronic health conditions, growing up in foster care, mental health diagnoses, intellectual disabilities, issues with the criminal justice system, and systemic racism and housing policy, atop the lack of affordable housing. Simon Kenyon, who is ordained through the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches, said that he believes in more potential for those on the streets and that God has a better plan for them.“I think of Ephesians 2:10,” he said, “to be God’s workmanship; something that he’s created beforehand for each one of us to do and to be.”The Kenyons voted to reinstate the camping ban partly to help incentivize getting off the streets but also because they were told by those experiencing homelessness that Austin streets have become more dangerous due to the influx of people from other states. Despite those perceptions, 83 percent of people who are homeless in Austin started that journey in Austin or Texas, according to Seales. With the passage of Prop B, “there’s literally nowhere to go,” she said. “People will go deeper into the woods, or there will be efforts in the same place over and over again to help people move along.”Some Christians are trying to simplify and accelerate the process of helping those experiencing homelessness by partnering with various agencies under one roof. Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center provides that kind of integrated model. The ministry grew out of Sunrise Community Church’s desire to offer assistance to those in several nearby south Austin encampments. The center now serves food and offers showers, an address for mail, mental health workers, a health clinic, and housing case managers. Over six years, Sunrise has become its own entity with five paid staff and more than 100 volunteers, although it still shares a building with the church. They work together with various agencies’ staff to serve 200–300 clients every day and recently helped house their 550th person, said Mark Hilbelink, lead pastor of the church and director of the navigation center. Hilbelink operates from a Calvinist theology, he said, that believes strongly in God’s election of people. “We’re not constantly in fear of people’s salvation status,” he said. For that reason, the social work aspect takes precedence over evangelism, he said. Sunrise’s current goal is to replicate its integrative model through a program called Compass Network that helps train and connect churches with the social services community. Sunrise adheres to the approach that handouts need to go hand in hand with a connection to the larger social services community. Hilbelink has also been mentoring Leah Hargrave, a deacon at Mosaic Church and director of Mosaic Street Ministry, to create a navigation center in north Austin. Currently Sunrise is working with three teams of four to seven churches per team that have adopted a nearby microhomeless population (about 100 people). Christians with different theologies and different politics have come together to help, Hilbelink said.“They would never worship together,” he said, “but they are on this team because mission is on the forefront and everything else is behind.”On Sundays, a church from one team, with the help of interns from a variety of Texas universities, sets up a citywide database, ID printers, and connections to referral systems at a shopping center parking lot that is within one mile of the churches. The church hands out aid, while the interns work on the social services part. One location in south Austin has already helped house 20 people. Christians, like at Sunrise and Community First! Village, have developed some novel ideas that focus on more-integrated services and a communal approach, and cities all over the country are examining those models. In 2020, more than half a million people experienced homelessness in the United States, a 2.2 percent increase from 2019, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The lifting of national and local eviction moratoriums and the end of pandemic unemployment benefits by end of summer will also contribute to people losing their homes. Other municipalities—such assuburban SeattleandAurora, Colorado—have considered similar camping bans. Due to ahousing crisisin Austin and other cities—rents have risen 3.3 percent since 2019 and 1.6 percent nationally—Hilbelink believes homelessness will become one of the biggest problems America will face in the next 10–15 years and will require an army to tackle. To take up the challenge, some churches will donate money, some will volunteer with an organization, others will adopt a micropopulation, and some will build navigation centers, Hilbelink said. Others, such as Seales and Stone, will advocate with city and state governments about equity and social justice issues, affordable housing, and living wages.“Every church is going to have to figure out what our response to this is going to be,” Hilbelink said.

260,"Marine Raider ‘betrayed’ Green Beret, lied with SEALs to cover up his hazing death, prosecutors say",0.0,45.67,https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/06/11/marine-raider-betrayed-green-beret-lied-with-seals-to-cover-up-his-hazing-death-prosecutors-say/,https://adfontesmedia.com/army-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-11,17,"NAVAL STATION NORFOLK, Va. — Prosecutors in the murder trial of aMarine Raidercharged along with three others in the death of an ArmyGreen Berettold the jury that the Marine betrayed his comrade, helped kill him during a planned hazing incident, and then tried to cover up the incident by lying to investigators. Gunnery Sgt. Mario A. Madera-Rodriguezfaces charges of conspiracy, assault, obstruction of justice, burglary, false official statements, involuntary manslaughter and felony murder in the June 4, 2017, strangulation death of Army Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar in Bamako, Mali. Three fellow co-defendants, another Marine Raider and two Navy SEALs, have already pled guilty to their part in the death and have been sentenced. Madera-Rodriguez is the only one of the four to go to trial. He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of murder, he faces a possible sentence of life without parole. Marine Capt. Jason Samuel, a prosecuting attorney, laid out a blow-by-blow timeline of events the night and early morning hours before Melgar’s death in his bedroom of the Army-Navy residence he shared with Navy SEALs and fellow soldiers on deployment to the African nation.“Their plan was to haze him that night, to humiliate him, but they killed him,” Samuel told the jury. Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar was found dead of strangulation on June 4, 2017, in housing he shared with three other special operations forces personnel in Bamako, Mali. (Army)The defense team’s opening statements were held in a session closed to the public because their statements contained classified information, officials said. The four men involved in Melgar’s death immediately tried to cover up the crime, Samuel said, repeatedly lying to officials. But Jennifer Brown, a female friend of Madera-Rodriguez who was with the men the night before Melgar died, later told investigators what they had planned. Navy SEAL Chief Special Warfare Officer Adam C. Matthews came to Bamako, Mali, shortly before the events that led to Melgar’s death. Soon after arriving, Matthews met with Chief SWO Tony E. DeDolph and other members of the special operations team for a contingency planning support mission. But DeDolph told Matthews that he and others had problems with Melgar and wanted to put him in line by hazing him. In interviews, those who’d talked with Melgar revealed the staff sergeant was fed up with “juvenile behavior” by DeDolph and other special operators. He said he was anxious to finish his deployment and return home. Samuel told the jury that on the night of June 3, Melgar was driving to a party at the French Embassy in Bamako. DeDolph, Madera-Rodriguez and fellow Marine Raider Staff Sgt. Kevn Maxwell were following him in another vehicle, but they became separated. The trio thought that he’d deliberately ditched them and saw it as a sign of disrespect. They then diverted to a local bar called the “Appaloosa.” While drinking, DeDolph came up with the idea to teach Melgar a “lesson” by hazing him, Samuel said. They contacted the two Malian guards at the Army-Navy house, telling them they needed to be ready to help pull a “joke” on Melgar. Over the next few hours, they hatched a detailed plan. Madera-Rodriguez would bust open Melgar’s door with a sledgehammer. They’d all rush in on the sleeping Melgar, and Maxwell would pull back the mosquito netting around his bed. Then, DeDolph, a former professional in mixed martial arts, would pounce on Melgar and put him in a chokehold. Matthews would then jump in, helping duct tape Melgar, the prosecutor said. They needed him restrained so that they could remove his clothing and bring in one of the Malian guards in his underwear with a belt around his neck like a leash. They then planned to take compromising photos and videos of Melgar with the Malian man. Madera-Rodriguez’ other task was to put on music for the event.“He broke into that room and provided the soundtrack to Staff Sgt. Melgar’s strangulation,” Samuel said. The group dubbed the event “Operation Tossed Salad,” a name for a sex act. The quartet and the Malian man, lined up outside Melgar’s door and broke through with the sledgehammer, according to court testimony. Suddenly awakened, Melgar fought back, but DeDolph put him in the chokehold facedown on the bed as the others began to restrain and duct tape him, Samuel said. As they struggled, Melgar stopped breathing. The men stopped and began attempts to resuscitate him. They even tried a field expedient tracheotomy. But when that failed, they took him to a nearby medical clinic where he was later pronounced dead. Almost immediately, the two SEALs told the Marines they would deal with the incident and not mention them, Samuel said. They made up a story that DeDolph had been practicing hand-to-hand combat drills with Melgar, who stopped breathing. They later said they thought Melgar had been drinking and that might have contributed to his death, according to prosecutors. But witnesses later told investigators that Melgar didn’t drink alcohol. A week after Melgar’s death, Madera-Rodriguez and Maxwell accompanied Army investigators to the crime scene as security. Madera-Rodriguez even walked them through the fake story of a wrestling match gone wrong between DeDolph and Melgar. But investigators found duct tape under Melgar’s bed with his blood on it. They also had talked with Brown, who had been at the Appaloosa bar with the men the night they talked about their plan. Cell phone records and text messages showed that Madera-Rodriguez and the others had gone from the Appaloosa bar to a restaurant, then stopped at a Marine house to pick up duct tape and the sledgehammer at about 4 a.m. before heading to the Army-Navy house. The men broke into Melgar’s room and committed the attack between 5:25 a.m. and 5:35 a.m., Samuel said. The timing matters because whether it happened at night or during the day may have bearing on some aspects of the burglary charge. Samuel told jurors an expert would testify, explaining why it was nighttime when this occurred. Subsequent interviews by military investigators uncovered what had happened, which resulted in the charges the men faced in their respective courts martial. The trial began Monday with jury selection, which lasted until late Thursday. An all-male jury of eight members, four enlisted and four commissioned officers, four Marines and four sailors were selected. Madera-Rodriguez chose to have a jury trial for his general court-martial. The members must have a rank equal to or greater than the defendant’s. The highest ranking member is an O-5, Navy commander. The lowest ranking member is an E-8, Navy senior chief petty officer. In January, DeDolph pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, reduction to E-1, forfeiture of pay and a dishonorable discharge. Maxwell pleaded guilty in June 2019 to negligent homicide, conspiracy to commit assault, hazing, obstruction of justice and making false official statements. He received four years of confinement, reduction in rank to E-1 and a bad conduct discharge. In May 2019, Matthews pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and related charges. He was given one year of confinement, reduction to petty officer second class and a bad conduct discharge. All three are expected to testify as prosecution witnesses as part of their plea agreements in the trial of Madera-Rodriguez.

261,Adbusters and the roots of the contemporary left,-7.0,41.33,https://www.cjr.org/special_report/adbusters-occupy-great-magazines.php/,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-15,18,"On November 15, 2011, just outside a boarded-up vacant lot in Lower Manhattan, several NYPD officers held down a protester and beat him with batons while a number of onlookers, including the actor Frances McDormand, chanted “Shame, shame, shame.” (It was the first time I’d seen such an assault; I was working forVarietyand on the lookout for quotable celebrities.) The protesters had gathered at the request of the Estonian-Canadian documentarian and activist Kalle Lasn, the charismatic founder and primary creative force behind the glossy magazineAdbusters. They had set up tents in Zuccotti Park and declared themselves Occupy Wall Street. This was not quite the second month of the occupation; it had begun on September 17, Lasn’s mother’s birthday. Few publications are as synonymous with the early-2000s political left, such as it was, asAdbusters—the journal of catchy font design, broadsides by SlavojŽižek, and that one picture ofa ballerina atop the Wall Street Bull. In the public memory, it now takes some contemptuousknocksabout directionless radicalism (you can still buy itsupcycled Fluevogs), but it remains a part of our shared nostalgia for bookstores with magazine racks, as well as the birthplace of much of contemporary leftist American activism. Screengrab from a video announcing issue number 149, via Adbusters’ YouTube page. In 1989, Canadian television networks refused to sell Lasn thirty seconds of airtime for one of his “subvertisements,” this one featuring Claymation trees denouncing the lies of the logging industry. Lasn and Bill Schmalz, his friend and collaborator, sued, and foundedAdbustersas a newsletter instead. The newsletter grew popular and became the magazine in 1992. A given issue might include pithy contrarianism fromŽižek, an excerpt—possibly defaced, possibly simply stolen—from a Starbucks training manual, and a collage of images fromSoldier of Fortunemagazine juxtaposed with screencaps from Activision’sSoldier of Fortunevideo game. Articles rarely moved with the tides: older pieces from the 1990s gleefully vandalized brands; the magazine spent the 2000s inveighing against the war in Iraq and mindless patriotism; Obama-era articles tended to pick on Big Tech. In a sea of lifestyle magazines, it was, to some extent, also a lifestyle magazine, suggesting ways to change your daily routine to protect yourself from the invasion of the brands.“I’m nostalgic for it sometimes,” Stefanie Krasnow, who was the publication’s editor from 2012 until 2014, says. “It seemed to be a place perennially full of idealistic, radical people in their early twenties.” The magazine is still published, bimonthly, by the not-for-profit Adbusters Media Foundation; its website recently plugged a forthcoming issue alongside a critique of the coordinated GameStop investment campaign, which it termed “a deserving blow” to hedge funds delivered by investors who were nonetheless “playing into the very system that screwed them in the first place.” Krasnow saysAdbustersis a “single-voiced” publication, with Lasn as its driving creative force. Jonathan Barnbrook, a graphic designer who contributed to the magazine and art-directed it twice, first encountered it in the late 1990s, at the Tower Records flagship in Piccadilly Circus, London. “I couldn’t breathe, looking through it,” Barnbrook says. “It was exactly how I felt and how many people I knew felt at the time.” Back then, few issues felt as urgent to the perennially disenfranchised left as the rise of globalization; the end of the decade saw the J18 and Battle of Seattle protests over trade deals that exploited laborers in poor countries, and Barnbrook was disgusted with his profession’s complicity in the corresponding rise of lucrative advertising campaigns calibrated to drown out criticism.“It was a certain point in design where multinationals had started using sweatshop labor and designers had been very complicit,” Barnbrook recalls. “They just went for it, because they liked working with companies like Nike and Adidas because they had this cool aura.”Adbusters, he says, offered a necessary corrective: “Here was something that fought advertising using its own tools. The line was very clear, and the copy was very well-written.” For Barnbrook,Adbusterscarried a more important message than its anti-corporate stance: it told him he wasn’t alone. Lauren Bercovitch, public relations and production manager of Adbusters, shows the magazine’s centerfold of a ballerina on the Wall Street bull. Image from 2011. Photo credit: Deborah Jones/AFP via Getty ImagesDuring the final years of the print-media boom,Adbusterswas a sort of anti–September Issue—a glossy magazine filled with fake ads for fashion designers and liquor companies, Banksy-style invective against industrial farming, and announcements of protest. “Kalle always says inAdbustersthat advertising is brain damage,” Krasnow recalls. “What he did withAdbustersin terms of ‘jamming’ the magazine space was brilliant and radical aesthetically.”The magazine was many things, but consistent was not one of them. “So many ofAdbusters’actual prescriptions—at least the ones they’re best remembered for—are lifestyle choices,” recalls Luke Savage, a staff writer forJacobinwho callsAdbustersone of his entry points to leftist politics as a teenager. “I remember one article about treating your media diet like mainstream media is junk food. And I remember another article that said you should connect with Mother Nature by making tea out of dandelions.”Trevor Clarke, 26 and a writer-editor at the magazine, remembers first discovering it at “sustainability camp” during his freshman year of high school. “The camp counsellors had all of us students eat vegetarian food and coin woodland nicknames for ourselves,” Clarke remembers. “They also furnished us with various kinds of radical literature, including copies ofAdbusters.”In many ways,Adbustersis a 1990s time capsule, but part of the 1990s was nostalgia for the 1960s, and if back issues of the magazine look politically suspicious and filled with crackpotism today, at the time it looked like a gloomy, concretizedWhole Earth Catalog. Occupy Wall Street, Savage says, was the magazine’s greatest contribution to the world. To Savage and others for whomAdbustersonce marked the furthest reaches of radical thought, its legacy outstrips its own achievements. During Occupy, even sympathetic journalists expressed frustration with what they came to regard as a disjointed coalition without clear demands. But from that group came theFight for $15 minimum-wage walkouts, and other publications, too—filled not with slick anti-corporate un-branding, but calls to action on pulp—likeThe Occupied Wall Street Journal, which published writers including Arun Gupta (now ofThe Intercept) and reporter and commentator Michael Levitin. It was a moment that prefigured the leaderless protest movements to come, especiallyBlack Lives Matter. The Occupy protests were also a watershed in publicity around police misconduct: grainy video of riot-geared cops beating protesters, some of them homeless, informed a new generation of leftists’ understanding of capital’s resistance to change. That generation has rejected much of whatAdbustersstood for, in part because of the urgency publications likeJacobinandCurrent Affairshave brought to the need for a fairer political system. Krasnow, the formerAdbusterseditor, also cites Micah White, Lasn’s close colleague during Occupy and the publication’s longest-serving editor, as an inspirational figure—one who understood the use of the levers of power. White was instrumental in creating the buzz around the Occupy movement, which he has said he now considers “a constructive failure.” (White declined to be interviewed for this piece. “I don’t feel like doing the interview, so I’ll pass, but I wishAdbustersand Kalle all the best,” he said.) He is now a regular guest on MSNBC and recently wrote forTheGuardianaboutattending the World Economic Forum in Davos“to discover its revolutionary potential”; other leftists havecriticizedhim for seeking to rebrand himself as a consultant for activist groups after the end of Occupy, but it is hard to write him off as ineffective. In many ways, the frustrating, inspiring hippiedom underneathAdbusters’ aesthetically daring exterior is simply Lasn himself. In conversation, Lasn, now seventy-nine, is the exact inverse of an angry radical. Determinedly avuncular, he can easily steer all topics of conversation, no matter how personal, toward the need for a sustainable future, the promise of an economy built around the “true cost” of producing goods that despoil the environment, and the need to escape capitalism. It’s a quality that would be annoying if he were less sunny about everything. Was life hard as a two-year-old child refugee in Nazi Germany, where his parents had fled the Russian invasion of Estonia? “In Germany, it was a little tougher because, yes, it was still hard to get food right after the war,” he admits. “But when we were in the refugee camps in Australia [where his family relocated after they and many Estonians weredisplaced by World War II], you know, there was good food! We were living in corrugated-iron shacks, but still, you know, we had a nice bed!”Did the global financial crisis of 2008 represent the triumph of capital? “It was a dark moment, but then, in our brainstorming sessions, we suddenly came up with this idea: Let’s do something really dramatic! Let’s go to the very iconic heart of global capitalism, which is Wall Street, and let’s occupy the damn place!”Is he discouraged by the failure of Occupy to upend the global financial system? “We’re left with hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people who got politicized during Occupy Wall Street—the same way that I was politicized, you know, fifty years earlier!”Lasn is still waiting for the revolution, he says. He finds the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements “absolutely fascinating, but somehow they don’t get to the heart of the matter.” He says he celebrates intersectionality, but that “it doesn’t quite amount to what I dream of, which is a world revolution, and a moment when we the people, using the power of the internet, launch a global movement that changes the way governance works, that changes the way our leaders behave, and that changes the way that the democracy functions.”Krasnow, who left journalism to work as a clinical counselor, says that while there are trenchant critiques of identity-driven intersectional leftism to be made, it’s wrong to consider the competing wing of the movement subordinate. “The Black Lives Matter, Indigenous-sovereignty, and anti-pipeline movements—I can’t say why they gained popularity, but they have an urgency to them, and a strength, because they are coming from a place of survival, and not from a place of ‘leftist critique,’ or intellectualism, or post-whatever aesthetic,” she says. “I resent those movements being seen as leftist. I know why they are categorized as leftist, but I feel they ought to be seen in a space that’s beyond the right-left divide.”Clarke hopes for further intra-left cooperation. “If your concern is to identify and alleviate one form of abuse—let’s say corporate malfeasance—then you ought to be attentive to other abuses which may compound, or be comorbid with, the first,” he tells CJR. “You can’t honestly claim to have justice at heart unless you do so. If the goal is to foster more just, more respectful, and more decent relations among human beings, then one must try to take note of all means by which that goal might be either advanced or impeded.”Corporate dehumanization is still, at least,anenemy, and both theAdbustersteam and its critics agree that it can be frustrating to see capitalists recycle criticism. “I remember when BP changed their logo to a green flower and spent more on their identity than they did on actual environmental work,” says Barnbrook. Savage agrees. “Every brand was getting a piece of it after George Floyd’s murder,” he says. “It was savory snacks for social justice. Call of Duty: Modern Warfareput out a statement of support for Black Lives Matter. Adbusterswas right to critique that stuff, but what was missing was a programmatic response.” Un-branding, too, gets co-opted and reworked into branding; there’s no escape from capitalism. But that doesn’t invalidate the criticism, either from activists focused on social justice or from anti-globalization anarchists. Barnbrook says it’s important not to be discouraged by seeing criticism deracinated by cynical brands. “I don’t think you necessarily have to reconcile it,” he says. “I think everybody’s okay being fragmented, in a way.”",3,Reliable,0.1050735458324744,0.4522271841914698,2963,3,Columbia Journalism Review

Trump attorneys met with local prosecutors Thursday in an attempt to persuade officials not to proceed, Trump Organization lawyer Ron Fischetti said in an interview with USA TODAY.“In my more than 50 years of practice, never before have I seen the District Attorney’s Office target a company over employee compensation or fringe benefits,"" Fischetti said. ""Even the financial institutions responsible for causing the 2008 financial crises, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, were not prosecuted.”A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. declined to comment. The timing of the possible criminal charges was first reported bythe New York Times. Fischetti said prosecutors have not succeeded in securing the cooperation of Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer and the most knowledgeable of the former president's business operations. For more than two years, Vance has been digging deep into the operations of the Trump family business for possible fraud involving banks, insurance companies and taxing entities. The New York prosecutor won a major, public victory in February when Trump's accounting firm was forced to turn over eight years of tax records as part of a protracted legal battle that ended at the Supreme Court. Vance's investigation appeared to have accelerated last month with the disclosure that a special grand jury had been convened to consider possible evidence of criminality by the president, his business associates or the company itself. The district attorney has been examining the far-flung Trump Organization's banking, tax and insurance transactions with a focus on whether the company manipulated property values to obtain favorable loans and reduced tax rates. Prosecutors also have been weighing hush-money payments made to women on Trump's behalf and how that money was documented. Former Trump personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen has acknowledged meeting with New York prosecutors multiple times in cooperation with their investigation. Cohen has told USA TODAY that he would not comment on any aspect of the case, citing the ongoing investigation and his potential role in it as a key witness for the prosecution. But he has commented extensively on Twitter on how grand jury proceedings significantly accelerate the investigation. Cohen, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges that included campaign-finance violations for paying hush money to women who claimed to have had sex with Trump and for lying to Congress, has repeatedly pointed to Weisselberg as most knowledgeable of the former president's business operations.",3,Reliable,0.0611940836940837,0.4313347763347763,537,3,USA Today

Fort Worth-based American Airlines has cut its global schedule by 55% from a year ago for the October month, the company confirmed, including a 48% decrease in domestic flying as the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of letting up and passengers show little eagerness to return to the skies. It leaves American with about 99,000 flights for October, slightly more than it has planned for a slimmed down September schedule. The carrier continues to shrink its schedules the closer it gets to the actual month of flying, an indication of how tricky it is to forecast demand during a global health pandemic, said Jeff Pelletier, managing director of Dallas-based Airline Data Inc. More cuts could be coming, Pelletier said. American still has hundreds of flights on the schedule for 15 cities where it wants to halt service in early October. Stay prepared. Receive the latest airlines news, delivered straight to your inbox. “While there have been numerous press releases on the removal of flights to the 15 stations throughout their network in October, what AA has actually done is they haven’t yet pulled the schedule,” Pelletier said. “The schedules are still intact, just at reduced frequencies, in the hopes that Congress may come back with some money.”American has also recently cut 9,000 flights from its November plans, too, but it will likely make more reductions as the usually busy holiday month gets closer, he said. The bare-bones schedule shows just how conservative airlines are being as fall approaches after planning an aggressive number of flights in July and August before a summer surge in COVID-19 cases lowered expectations. American recently announced it was furloughing or laying off 19,000 workers as fall begins, workers that aren’t needed because of the reduced number of flights and passengers. United Airlines on Wednesday said it was furloughing and letting go of 16,370 workers. For American and other airlines, the biggest cuts are in international flying. American has cut its October international schedule by 68% compared to last year, particularly to Eastern Hemisphere locations. The constantly changing schedule does cause hiccups for employees at American, who are becoming used to the disruption. On Wednesday, American told pilots it was pushing back the window by one week to bid on October schedules. The closing window is now Sept. 17, just two weeks before the new month. That could give the company a few more days to see if Congress passes a stimulus package before setting pilot schedules. Allied Pilots Association spokesman Dennis Tajer said there is also an unusually high number of pilots working standby in recent months. But overall, he said the company is doing a good job handling schedules considering the state of the industry.“It’s much better than it was back in April and May,” he said. American isn’t the only airline cutting schedules. Southwest has reduced its October schedule by 35,000 flights during the last few weeks, a number that continues to decrease as the industry’s recovery remains dim. Delta has reduced its schedule, too. On Tuesday, only 516,000 passengers went through TSA security checkpoints at U. S. airports. That’s the lowest passenger count since mid-July. Numbers are down partly because summer travel is mostly over as public schools and colleges begin instruction, but also because few business travelers are getting on planes to go to meetings and on sales trips. Even American Airlines’ fortress hub at DFW International Airport is suffering. American’s departures at DFW are down 24% year over year, Pelletier said. As a share of American’s flight schedule, flights to DFW and its other major hub in Charlotte, N. C., have actually increased. But the shrinking pie has meant smaller pieces for everyone. American has cut traffic from DFW the most to its other major hubs, particularly in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D. C. In fact, American has cut its schedule in D. C. by 80% compared to a year ago. In Texas, American’s service to Austin has also been cut deeply, down about 41% year over year.",3,Reliable,0.0555654647743255,0.2716832885820228,900,3,Dallas Morning News

The state's largest urban district to reopen since schools closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Hamilton County isn't alone. Less than three weeks since the first school districts in Tennessee reopened to students,many are already closing their doors. Nearly 109 school districts have started the school year as of Thursday, Aug. 13 — the majority of them in-person — and at least 97 confirmed COVID-19 cases connected to schools have already been reported. Hundreds of students and teachers across the state are also being isolated or quarantined after potential exposure as well. At least 25 school districts, including Williamson County Schools, Coffee County Schools and Blount County Schools, have already closed schools or altered their schedules as a result of exposures to the virus. Coffee County Schools announced Aug. 5 that two schools, Coffee County Middle and North Coffee, would be closed for the rest of the week due to ""an abundance of caution over COVID-19,""according to a post on the district's Facebook page. By Aug. 7, the district announced that schools would switch to a hybrid schedule beginning Aug. 12, with students attending school in-person only two days a week because of ""a trend in increasing cases,""according to WSMV. The district had already announced its first confirmed COVID-19 case even before schools reopened on Monday. On July 31, Coffee County Schools announced that an employee had tested positive after they began working and preparing for the school year. Blount County Schools, which reopened July 29, announced on Aug. 4 thatthe district would switch to a staggered schedule starting Friday for the next two weeks. Just days after the district reopened, an individual at Carpenters Elementary School tested positive for the virus, according to an email from the school's principal obtained by the Knoxville News Sentinel.

Gov. Bill Lee said that his administrationis in the process of creating a planthat would allow schools to share information about the number of COVID-19 cases in their facilities. The governor's comments come just days after officials with the state Department of Health and the Department of Education said the agencieswould not ask for and collect dataon the number of cases and deaths at each school. Transmission of COVID-19 in schools expected, not alarming, Tennessee public health commissioner saysWhen Lee announcedguidance for school reopenings last week, state Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey said Tennessee had no plans to provide the public with such data. But the governor has since reversed course.""We’re developing a plan for reporting cases in schools,"" Lee said Tuesday.

266,"Trump appears at rally in Londonderry, N.H., riffing on ‘fake ballots,’ 2016, and Air Force One",-9.0,46.0,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/25/nation/trump-hold-what-might-be-his-last-campaign-rally-ever-new-hampshire-sunday/?p1=HP_Feed_ContentQuery,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-25,25,"LONDONDERRY, N. H. — Nine days before the election, President Trump rallied supporters in New Hampshire, claiming that the country is “rounding the turn"" on the deadly coronavirus pandemic, sowing mistrust in the electoral process, and generally offering a joyful jumble of roving anecdotes and well-worn attack lines in place of a clear and comprehensive closing message on why he deserves four more years. After the airport rally, Trump flew to Maine, where he stopped by an apple orchard and signed a pumpkin and red Trump hats before using a megaphone to greet hundreds of cheering supporters. The last-minute visit was a bid for the single electoral vote he won in Maine’s Second Congressional District in 2016. AdvertisementIn New Hampshire, Trump’s 90-minute tarmac soliloquy ranged from bragging about how many times he’d been nominated for the Nobel Peace prize to an eight-minute riff on years-old negotiations for purchasing a new version of Air Force One to blaming grim coronavirus numbers on increased testing. Only occasionally did Trump clearlypitch voters on why they should support him. At one point, he painted the election as a fight against socialism. Later, he framed the race as pivoting on coronavirus closures with Trump as thecandidate whowould resist shutting downbusinesses and other aspects of daily life because of COVID-19.“This election is a choice between a Trump recovery, and I call it a Trump super-recovery because that’s what’s happening . . . and a Biden depression,” Trump told thousands of supporters gathered outside at the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. He said Biden would raise Americans' taxes “through the sky” and layer on burdensome regulations. Biden has called for overturning the 2017 GOP tax cuts on households making over $400,000 a year and increasingsome business taxes. Trump repeatedly claimed Biden would cut Social Security and Medicare, playing video, as he has at rallies all week, that portrayed Biden as untrustworthy on protecting those popular entitlement programs. AdvertisementGoing back to COVID, Trump charged that,“Biden is the shutdown candidate.”“The Democrats are the shutdown party,"" he continued. ""They will shut down your job, shut down your schools, your businesses, your police departments, your energy. They shut down your freedom, and they will shut down the greatest economic comeback in the history of our country.”The topic of the raging pandemic wove through Trump’s rally, in both what the president said and did not say. He did not mention, for instance, that a fresh outbreak of the virus has struck the White House, withat least five aides to Vice President Mike Pence, including his chief of staff, testing positive in the past few days. Instead, Trump claimed that the country is “rounding the turn” and that the pandemic is “going to be over.”In reality, the United States set a daily record Friday for new confirmed coronavirus infections and came close to matching that number again Saturday with more than 83,000 new positive cases, according to data published by Johns Hopkins University. Polls suggest the president’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic has damaged his standing with many voters, including older voters who had been part an important part of the president’s winning coalition four years ago. As it happens, Maine is the oldest state in the country and New Hampshire the ninth. AdvertisementIn the Granite State,Trump played many of his usual hits. He called his Democratic rival “sleepy” and questioned his mental acuity. He mocked the low numbers of people at Biden’s campaign events (the Biden campaign has sought to adhere to strict social distancing and other health measures) and threw in an unsubstantiated reference to former president Obama drawing only 42 people to a recent event, seemingly just for the chance to call him by his full name, “Barack Hussein Obama.” (On Saturday, Trumpclaimed on Twitter itwas 47 people.)At times, Trump’s comments were a bit strange. Discussing his recent bout with COVID-19, Trump described the excellent medical care he received as president by telling supporters that “you have a doctor for every single part of your body. And they want to touch it, too. They want to grab you.""While Trump campaign officials assert the president is stumping only in battleground states, and the Granite State gave him a 20-point win in the 2016 primary before he narrowly lost it to Democrat Hillary Clinton in the general election, New Hampshire doesn’t seem inclined to break Trump’s way. Trump has trailed Biden in every New Hampshire poll this year. In a Suffolk University/Boston Globe survey earlier in the month, Biden led Trump, 51 percent to 41 percent among likely New Hampshire voters. And ahead of Sunday’s rally here, the editorial board of the Union Leader, the state’s largest newspaper,announced it is endorsingBiden, despite its reputation as a conservative paper with a long history of backing Republican candidates. Advertisement“President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America,” wrote the editorial board, which four years ago backed Libertarian Gary Johnson rather than support Hillary Clinton or Trump. A spokesman for Governor Chris Sununu, a Republican, said Sundaythat Sununu did not attend the outdoor rally. The popular chief executive did receive a heaping of praise from Trump during the event. A relative benign reference to Mitt Romney, the Republican Utah senator and former Massachusetts governor, didn’t go as well. The crowd booed. Loose and looking like he was having fun, Trump ignored the existence of polls about his standing in the state and asserted that the large crowd gathered for him meant he was likely to prevail.“It’s like a poll, right, except much more accurate,” he said of the number of attendees, many wearing red Make America Great Again hats or sporting Trump 2020 campaign flags around their shoulders. Trump continued to sow distrust in the electoral process. “The biggest risk we have are the fake ballots,” the president said, offering no evidence why that is the case. Experts say widespread electoral fraud does not exist in the United States. That said, the Trump campaign is the only one that has fully embraced routine Granite State campaign events. Trump’s Sunday visit came less than a week after Vice President Mike Pence’s campaign rally in Portsmouth and an Eric Trump event in Manchester. AdvertisementNearly every week since August, some member of the Trump administration has held an official visit to the state. This includes first lady Melania Trump, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx and many less high profile roles such as the administrator of the Small Business Administration, Jovita Carranza. Meanwhile, Biden hasn’t been in New Hampshire since he skipped town early on the day of the New Hampshire primary. His vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris hasn’t been to the state in well over a year, but her husband, Doug Emhoff, visited New Hampshire on Saturday to help campaign workers who were knocking on doors. After 94 minutes of speaking, Trump climbed the tall mobile staircase — which he had discussed in great detail during the rally — to Air Force One, pumped his fist, and boarded for the flight to Maine, where the campaign continued.

But first, here’s the quick backstory. Since yesterday, when we explained how theon Reddit figured out how to game the system and cause major Wall Street hedge fund firms to lose big money, the company controlling the buying and selling of these stocks have stopped allowing them to be purchased:Robinhood has stopped allowing users to buy GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, and Nokia stock.— Motherboard (@motherboard)January 28, 2021More than half of all Robinhood users own at least some GameStop stock. They are now unable to freely trade it; the app is only allowing users to close out their positions.— Motherboard (@motherboard)January 28, 2021 In other words they are trying to rig the game. AOC responded to the report calling for a hearing on Robinhood’s decision to block these specific stock purchases while still allowing the big hedge funds to freely trade the stock. And Ted Cruz agreed with her:Fully agree. 👇— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz)January 28, 2021That’s when AOC attacked Cruz and accused him of trying to have her murdered:I am happy to work with Republicans on this issue where there’s common ground, but you almost had me murdered 3 weeks ago so you can sit this one out. Happy to work w/ almost any other GOP that aren’t trying to get me killed. In the meantime if you want to help, you can resign.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)January 28, 2021That’s completely unhinged and false. All Ted Cruz did was what other Democrats have done in the past, which was to object to the results of the electoral votes from states which illegally changed their laws to enable tons of voter fraud. Yet because there happened to be a riot, loathsome Democrats like AOC are now lying and smearing their Republican colleagues like Ted Cruz for inciting it. And just for the record, there was NEVER any proof of a plot to murder anyone at the Capitol. Those wererumors dispelled by the DOJ.

Rodrick Webber, 47, allegedly spray-painted the word“Daddy”on a wall inside the New York City art gallery. Webber later revealed to investigators that he was trying to write the phrase “Daddy is a war criminal” on the wall, in reference to Hunter Biden’s father, President Joe Biden. Webber could not finish his message as he was approached by a gallery employee who attempted to stop him, and who was then allegedly assaulted. The vandalism reportedly damaged a painting worth over $14,000, though none of Biden’s paintings were ruined. Biden’s fall show will reportedly be bringing in figures as high as $500,000. The upcoming show has faced scrutiny from critics, who have described the costly art show as an ethical issue for the administration, especially considering past allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden. In response to the controversy, the White House helped draft an agreement with the gallery keeping all buyers anonymous, even from the artist himself – a move that has only earned further criticism and concern.“The president has established the highest ethical standards of any administration in American history, and his family’s commitment to rigorous processes like this is a prime example,”White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement. Webber said his protest had nothing to do with Hunter Biden’s art, and everything to do with his father’s alleged “war crimes.”The man told the New York Post that he was also suspicious of the prices Biden’s artwork is demanding.“While Hunter Biden and his artwork is, you know, it’s not bad, it’s curious to me that it’s raising prices of half a million dollars just out of the blue. It says to me that there’s some kind of malfeasance there,”he said. In a previous social media post, Webber accused the art gallery hosting Hunter Biden’s work of supporting a“war crime family.”Webber also appeared to defend the physical incident with the gallery worker, saying,“his big a** girthy body was on top of me.”According to Webber, the employee actually assaulted him and he is open to filing a civil suit in the future.

The state's overall case count reached 75,248 and the death toll hit 6,141, according to the daily report from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. After the virus peaked here in April, state health officials have been monitoring upticks in new cases and the percentage of COVID-19 tests bringing positive results in recent weeks. However, the numbers of deaths and hospitalizations linked to the virus have remained relatively low. As of Friday, the state Department of Health and Human Services listed 55,162 recoveries from COVID-19, people who are still alive 30 days after the onset of symptoms. Last week brought an 11-week high for new cases with 4,232 new cases confirmed over the seven-day period. So far, this week is on pace for fewer cases than last week. But the percentage of tests bringing positive results — a key metric for measuring the prevalence of the virus — has been trending upward since early June. Over the first three days of the week, about 3.7% of the tests have been positive. Last week, about 3.5% of the tests were positive. The state confirmed its first cases of COVID-19 on March 10.

270,Detroit City Councilman Gabe Leland expected to plead guilty to misconduct in office,-0.33,51.83,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/07/22/detroit-city-council-gabe-leland-expected-plead-guilty-misconduct-office/5490041002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"Detroit City Councilman Gabe Leland is expected to plead guilty to a felony misconduct charge as part of a plea deal that will resolve all criminal charges against him and force him to leave office. A federal grand jury indicted Leland on multiple bribery charges in 2018. That case is scheduled to go to trial in U. S. District Court next month, but may ultimately be dismissed after the Monroe County Prosecutorcharged Leland last Fridaywith misconduct in office. The charges filed in Detroit's 36th District Court allege that Leland ""accepted payments of money to influence his vote on certain city matters over the course of his employment as a city councilman.”The charging document was changed Wednesday to say Leland allegedly ""accepted a campaign contribution of $7,500 in cash in violation of Michigan law.""""The language in the amended complaint now reflects what actually occurred, which is that Mr. Leland improperly accepted a campaign contribution in cash in violation of Michigan law,"" said Steve Fishman, Leland's attorney. Detroit City Council is mute on latest charge against colleague accused of misconductThe Corrupt Quartet: A look back at other Detroit Council members charged with wrongdoingThe misconduct charge stems from allegations that Leland demanded $15,000 from a Detroit businessman in a dispute with the city. Bob Carmack said he paid Leland $7,500 to help prevent the city from selling property Carmack claimed to own. The misconduct in office charge, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of $10,000, was brought by Monroe County Prosecutor Michael Roehrig after U. S. Attorney Matthew Schneider asked Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy to take the case. Worthy cited a conflict of interest in any case involving Carmack, who is suing county officials, so the Michigan Attorney General's office assigned the case to Monroe County. Leland, who represents District 7 on the city’s west side, continues to serve on the City Council without restrictions. He has declined repeated requests to comment on the new charge. Mayor Mike Duggan and City Councilman Scott Benson both said Wednesday during a news briefing on new city projects and an upcoming ballot initiative that Leland was innocent until proven guilty. Duggan said that if Leland admits guilt, he should leave office. On Oct. 9, 2018, after the first full council meeting since his indictment, Leland told reporters: “I’m innocent until proven guilty and that’s my statement until further comment.”Six days later, Leland was arraigned in U. S. District Court, one block away from the Caucus Club where the feds say he met with Carmack. As he walked away from the courthouse, Leland said: “I’m innocent, and I’m looking forward to trial.”It is unlikely the federal case would proceed after Leland enters his plea on the state charge. Because the charge was filed Friday, there is no timeline yet for the state case. There are several reasons Leland may prefer to resolve the case in state court. The maximum sentence for the misconduct in office charge is half the 10 years Leland faces if convicted of bribery in federal court. There is also just one charge in state court, instead of the three counts he faces in federal court. If convicted, multiple guilty counts would likely increase Leland's sentence. And Leland may eventually be able to get a single felony conviction removed from his record, whereas multiple counts would be there permanently. Pleading guilty to a felony would end Leland's career on City Council. Under the Detroit City Charter, an elected official who “engages in official misconduct,” “corrupt conduct in office” or pleads to “or is convicted of a felony while holding office” forfeits their office. Neither the City Council nor the city’s Board of Ethics has taken any action to remove Leland or limit his authority. On Tuesday,he cast a key vote as the City Council voted 5-4 to put a $250 million bond proposal on the November ballot.",3,Reliable,0.0146055796055796,0.5391438191438193,858,3,Detroit Free Press
271,"8chan, the central hive of Gamergate, is also an active pedophile network",-3.33,42.0,https://www.dailydot.com/debug/8chan-pedophiles-child-porn-gamergate,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-dot-bias-and-reliability/,2014-11-17,15,"The banner of free speech flies high above8chan.co, the central hive of Gamergate, where thousands of users have converged in recent weeks to build their movement. But clinging to that noble First Amendment ideal is a community of pedophiles, walking just barely on the right side of the law. On numerous public forums, 8chan users share graphic images of children, plus links to hardcore child pornography. No content is hidden. Thousands of posts are accessible within two clicks of the homepage.8chan’s founder, Fredrick Brennan, created the site in response to what he sees as the ongoing and vast loss of free speech on the Internet. On 8chan, “anyone can say what they want and mean,” Brennan told the Daily Dot. It’s easy to find what Brennan calls “proof” of his ironclad commitment to free speech: numerous forums filled with radically sexualized images of little girls and boys. Alongside photos of children in varying states of undress, guided intomodel poses by unseen older hands, user-submitted stories chronicle their interactions with children.• • •8chan has been around since Oct. 2013, but it was4chan’s expulsion of Gamergate, a group of anti-feminist crusaders, that set off an explosion in 8chan’s popularity. The site is now the indisputable home base of a popular but divisive online movement. Gamergate has been described as a modern culture war between left and right. The side that most 8channers land on is clear. Advocates say Gamergate champions fairness and transparency in journalism. Critics call it a delusional and violent harassment campaign against women in the gaming industry and their allies. The discussion first spread on 4chan’s video game forum after a blog post inspired death threats against a female game developer. 4chan founder Christopher “moot” Poole banned the conversation, allegedly because it violated 4chan’s rules against harassment. The promise of unrestricted chatter led Gamergate to 8chan. Brennan welcomed the group with open arms, and some of the Internet’s right-leaning political activists made 8chan a cause celebre. Brennan now calls 8chan a “free-speech-friendly 4chan alternative.”It’s odd for some to hear 4chan thought of as a restricted community. The site, known for years of high-profile online pranks against everything from major corporations to 11-year-old girls, has always had a mainstream reputation as an anything-goes free-for-all. Brennan unceremoniously rejects that idea. He called 4chan “authoritarian” and accused it of turning into a soulless for-profit venture.• • •Free speech, two simple words that evoke a torrent of political emotion in the West, is simultaneously the flag raised above our most important self-expression and the shield protecting some of humanity’s most nauseating acts. When some of the biggest and most influential websites on the Internet—such as massive communities like 4chan andReddit—are criticized for hosting abhorrent material, you can be sure you’ll hear those two words repeated ad nauseum in their defense. When redditors postupskirt photos of unsuspecting women in public: free speech. When 4channersharass a preteen girlto the point of needing police protection: free speech. When one of Reddit’smost popular communitiesis dedicated to a celebration of bigotry: free speech. Of course, the issue is often more complicated than a simple two-step like that. Pageviews, profit motives, corporate parents, public relations, and the basic morality of community administrators all influence site rules and enforcement. Reddit and 4chan have defended grisly content in the past with the words “free speech,” but each has adopted a progressively stricter rule set as it’s grown more popular.“We stand for free speech,” Reddit’s former CEO Yishan Wong oncesaidin response to a wave of controversy that washed over the site because of a forum dedicated to surreptitious, sexualized shots of women on the street known as “creepshots.”Still, many redditors don’t feel that the site adequately allows them to exercise their right to free speech. So that movement, too, migrated in a small way to 8chan. It’s shown up several times on 8chan but has died off repeatedly because of inactivity. In truth, creepshots is still anactive movementon Reddit. Under increasingly bright spotlights, both Reddit and 4chan now regularly ban some technically legal but controversial content that was once deemed acceptable.8chan strives to be different.• • •On 8chan’s pedophile forums, users insult and dismiss most anyone who might object to the content they’re sharing, calling them “moralfags.”Moralfags, the thinking goes, are not worth listening to because the self-described pedophiles, hebephiles, and ephebophiles (each word specifies the age of children that an adult is sexually attracted to) who populate these forums have heard “moralfag arguments” a million times already. No amount of indignant Internet posting, they reason, changes the fact that they’re attracted to children, or that they want to look at sexualized images of them. So ignoring or berating the inevitable crusaders is the only retort they have. Several 8chan forums feature children as young as toddlers dressed in swimsuits or thongs and posed suggestively. If this isn’t outright illegal hardcore child pornography, it’s walking up to the line of the law and spitting over it with a smirk.8chan’s userbase leans conservative, says Brennan, although there are left-leaning forums too, such as /marx/ and /leftypol/. 8chan’s supporters laud the aggressive political allegiance to free speech. According to Brennan, “the very fact that the boards are full of things that your average person (myself included) would find reprehensible” proves his site is dedicated to unrestricted conversation. “Once you get past all of the terrible content posted by teenagers to feel cool, you get to very interesting discussions and opinions that could simply not happen on Reddit or Facebook,” he said. Public traffic data for 8chan.co is not available, but Brennan said the site “has held steady at a little over 1 million page views per day, 35,000 unique visitors per day, and 400,000 posts per week for the last few weeks.”The site’s biggest boards are not pedophile-centric. Instead, many of 8chan’s most active boards are political. These are where Brennan’s “very interesting discussions” occur. Self-described conservatives make up the majority of these boards. “Our largest politics board, /pol/, is very right-leaning,” Brennan explained. I checked into /pol/ to take a sampling of the content. I saw discussion of small-government Republicanism, angry criticism of “n****r culture,” a long thread saying Bill Cosby’s alleged rape victims are faking it, and multiple rants against Muslim immigration to the West. Brennan is himself a registered Republican, he told me, but only so that he could vote (for Ron Paul). 8chan has boards visited by people across the political spectrum, but there’s no doubt where the majority weighs in. The right-wing ideology that permeates the site is made evident by 8channers’ preoccupation with feminism and other liberal ideologies, which they see as the root of evil. That’s not a surprise, given that Gamergate was the major catalyst for 8chan’s popularity.• • •“I don’t give a shit about what any news agency has to say about me or my website,” Brennan told me. “I only care what law-enforcement agencies have to say.”He said he expects regular backlash, but “I don’t care about media crocodile tears for pageviews.”With that, he dismissed the idea that a journalist might have genuine concern about a website hosting photos of what many would call sexual abuse of small children. In his caricature of the media, reporters aren’t human beings so much as they’re digital machines fueled by advertising dollars. I asked him about a forum called /doll/, which hosts provocative photos of barely clothed little girls.“If you want /doll/ shut down,” he countered, “you should instead focus on the studios who are producing this content. Some of them are even legally based in the USA. That’s the real story here, not some perverts posting them online after the fact.”The photos already exist, Brennan argues. So what if he’s building a directory through which they can be shared and discussed? In other words: Someone else is in the wrong already, and he’s merely using the fruits of that labor. Brennan’s 8chan hosts no advertising, it should be noted, but he does solicit donations on top of every page on the site. According to records fromhis Bitcoin walletandPatreon page, Brennan receives about $1,500 in monthly donations from 8chan’s users. In Brennan’s eyes, his only responsibility is to free speech and the laws that govern the United States, where his website is hosted. If the laws get too restrictive, he noted, other options are available. Do thoroughly sexualized images of small children qualify as free speech? The images found on 8chan are often legal “softcore” photos in which the content does not definitively qualify as sexually explicit, i.e. featuring simulated sex, intercourse, and visible genitalia. The tone and context of 8chan’s forums make the sexual references clear, however, and there are multiple threads throughout the site in which users discuss and link directly to hardcore child pornography. Much closer to a pure free-speech issue are 8chan forums like /younglove/. Rather than feature photos of children, this forum emphasizes safe discussion between pedophiles, the sort of interaction that many can’t get in real life. On /younglove/, pedophiles gather to discuss their urges, lament what they perceive as their persecution, and ask about how others interact with children.“I tend to do ‘childish’ things that tend to annoy other adults,” one anonymous poster wrote. “People constantly complain that I’m ‘making noises’, tapping on things, playing with the buttons, windows and vents while in a car. One time at a party I was just kinda sitting there ripping up the dirt with a stick. A cute girl about 5 came over and asked me why I was doing it and wanted to join me. So I was wondering if it might be some kind of unintentional thing pedos to do ‘attract’ kids.”Some observers doubtlessly read conversations like this as sharing strategies for grooming children to become victims, but the pedophiles themselves see it differently. The discussions are, they say, a chance to open up in ways that they simply can’t in day-to-day life. The freedom to post sexualized images of children on sites like 8chan is a signpost not just for those who enjoy them. The fact that those photos are fair game sends other users a clear message straight from the top of 8chan: Brennan is truly dedicated to his ideals of free speech with as few limits as possible. Pedophiles, likelythe Internet’s most reviled subculture, are among the digital groups most heavily targeted by police. Wherever in cyberspace they are able to survive despite pressure from the law, it’s seen as signal to others that the coast is clear. When law enforcementshut down 27 Dark Net sitesin a global police operation last week, the chaos led many to wonder if theToranonymity network had been profoundly compromised. One early sign that Tor was not totally broken was that the Dark Net’s biggest child pornography sites survived and even thrived under the police pressure. Much of the rest of the Dark Net’s diverse population, even those whose stomachs turn at the very mention of child porn, took that as a sign that all was not lost. I asked Brennan if child pornography and the kind of pedophilic content found on 8chan are inevitable fixtures in the landscape of hardcore free-speech zones like his website.“Unfortunately, yes,” he said. “I don’t support the content on the boards you mentioned, but it is simply the cost of free speech and being the only active site to not impose more ‘laws’ than those that were passed in Washington, D. C.”Brennan sees his site as a bulwark against an Internet that he believes is in rapid decline, one losing free speech and gaining surveillance.“I hope that with my help we’ll [be] heading towards more free speech, but I fear that the reality is that we’re heading towards less,” he explained. “All the major discussion sites are owned by large money-grubbing corporations, and their platforms are closed source. It’s incredibly toxic.”Toxicity that, in Brennan’s opinion, warrants the images of child abuse his users are sharing right now.• • •Brennan’s personal dream of free speech is idealistic and popular, but ultimately an abdication of responsibility for the role consumers of this content—and administrators of these websites—play in a realm where children are victimized.8chan’s servers run within the United States, but the site is not bound by the U. S. Constitution. Brennan has no obligation to the First Amendment. The rules that govern his website are strictly his own decision. As such, there’s one person who is ultimately responsible for what is allowed on 8chan: Brennan himself.",3,Reliable,0.1228580366080366,0.4908640646140649,2954,2,Daily Dot
272,Michigan GOP Leaders Work to Prevent Conservative Lawmakers From Seating Pro-Trump Electors,30.0,9.0,https://bigleaguepolitics.com/michigan-gop-leaders-work-to-prevent-conservative-lawmakers-from-seating-pro-trump-electors/,https://adfontesmedia.com/big-league-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,25,"Michigan Republican Party leaders are standing in the way of principled conservatives in the legislature hoping to seat a slate of pro-Trump electors to combat the vote steal in the state. State representative Gary Eisen (R-St. Clair) has beenyanked from his committee assignmentsby Republican state house leadership after going public about the plan and saying that violence could come as a result of the fallout from Republican lawmakers doing the right thing.“No. I don’t know. Because what we’re doing today is uncharted. It hasn’t been done. And it’s not me who’s doing it…it’s the Michigan Republican Party,” Eisen said about the possibility of violence in the Capitol. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarkville) has shut down the Capitol, using COVID-19 and the potential of violence as an excuse. Eisen believes that this is abdicating the duty of the legislature and another example of extreme cowardice by Republican leadership.“So they’re going to lock us out of our offices, they’re going to lock us out of the Capitol,” Eisen said.“How convenient is that, when they’re going to sit electors today, so that we can’t support our options. Whether it was true or not, we don’t know,” he added. House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R-Levering) is receiving the blame from grassroots activists in Michigan who are enraged by this betrayal:’s office has made it abundantly clear that they intend to go along with the vote steal and plan to help Michigan Democrats get away with their illicit electoral heist.“The speakers position has not changed. Michigan will follow the law and allocate the state’s electors to the candidate who won the most votes,” Chatfield spokesman Giden D’Assandro said. Chatfield released a statement of unconditional surrender to Democrats earlier today: League Politicsreportedon how it was a top Republican attorney in the state house who voted to certify the dubious vote in Michigan last month even before the many voter fraud whistleblowers could share their testimony at the hearing:Earlier this week, Big League Politicsreportedon the cowardly Republicans on the state board of canvassers who signed off on a dubious vote evenafter dozens of conservative whistleblowers have come forthdetailing a third-world gangster vote steal operation that occurred in the city of Detroit. One Republican on the state board of canvassers, Norm Shinkle abstained from the vote, being too weak to actually oppose electoral impropriety. The other Republican on the state board of canvassers, Aaron Van Langevelde, actually voted with the Democrats to certify election results marred with improprieties and abnormalities.“We have a clear legal duty to certify the results of the election, as shown by the returns that were given to us,” Van Langevelde said. “We cannot and should not go beyond that. As John Adams once said, ‘We are a government of laws, not men.’”“This board needs to adhere to that principle and do its part to uphold the rule of law here today. This board must uphold the law and comply with our legal duty to certify this election,” he added. Van Langeveldereceived a great deal of supportfrom the liberal media. He also received the backing of the House Republican leadership in the state,who will keep him employedin his cushy role with the party for going along with the façade.“Aaron has been a very valued member of this team and will continue to be next session,” said Republican Speaker-elect Jason Wentworth of Farwell. Republican House Speaker Lee Chatfield of Clarklake praised Van Langevelde’s betrayal as a great example of “America at work.”“As we have been saying consistently for weeks, the Legislature will uphold the law and respect this result as it works to improve the process for next time,” Chatfield said. Van Langevelde works as a policy adviser and deputy legal counsel for the Michigan House Republican Policy Office. He was effectively carrying out policy from his GOP establishment masters when he joined Democrats to betray his oath of office earlier this week. It has never been easier to see who the RINOs and traitors are than ever before, and the Michigan Republican Party seems to be chocked full of them.

273,Exclusive — Pence: Biden's ‘Bad Policy’ Could Derail Pandemic Recovery,18.67,25.0,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2021/07/18/exclusive-mike-pence-bidens-bad-policy-threatens-short-circuit-american-recovery/,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Former Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively that Democrat President Joe Biden’s “bad policy,” including his $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package and massive new spending proposals under consideration in Congress, could derail economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Pence’s comments came in a wide-ranging interview Friday evening about the Biden agenda and the upcoming midterm elections at the Family Leadership Summit after he gave remarks to a crowd of about a thousand Christian conservatives in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. While Pence has made a number of speeches since leaving office on January 20 this year, this interview with Breitbart News is his first since he left office.“The extension of, the plus-up on unemployment benefits by the Biden administration has worked a real hardship on small businesses and our recovery,” Pence said. “Look, this economy started to recover in the summer of 2020 demonstrating the resilience of the American people and the rightness of our agenda. With tax cuts, and rolling back regulations, and unleashing American energy, and America First trade deals, we had laid a foundation within the first three years that created 7 million jobs. I believe it also was the foundation on which America has made this historic recovery and in so many ways what the Biden administration has done and continues to do — and adding to that they’re pushing for the largest tax increase in 50 years to pass the largest spending bill in American history — I think what the Biden administration is doing threatens to short-circuit the American recovery we all long to see and that is underway. It is. But I think the fact that inflation is now rising at the most rapid pace in 13 years is evidence of the fact that markets are starting to respond to the big government solutions — higher taxes, more regulation — being planned and coming out of this administration. That’s why we got to fight back and fight back hard.”Pence said he is “incredibly proud” of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for holding House Republicans together “in opposing the radical left agenda of [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi.” He pointed specifically to that $1.9 trillion coronavirus spending plan, passed in March along purely partisan lines in both the U. S. House and Senate, that extended the newly-created federal unemployment benefits program that, at the beginning of the pandemic, supplemented similar state benefits. Combined, the federal and state benefits collected together could often pay people more to not work than to actually work — something that has led to small businesses like restaurants and stores across America having trouble hiring employees. The federal government never before offered supplemental unemployment insurance benefits. But, at the beginning of the pandemic, the Trump administration — with support on a bipartisan basis in Congress — passed such benefits. The program, meant to be temporary as the government was literally telling people to stay home and not work, was extended as part of the partisan plan Biden pushed at the beginning of his presidency. Pence ripped Biden for turning this into a partisan matter.“Even in the early vote on COVID [Chinese coronavirus] relief, they were able to stand united in opposition to a massive spending bill which really was a betrayal of the whole posture our administration had taken during the pandemic with regard to Congress,” Pence said. “Every bill we passed for COVID in Congress passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities. We said we’re going to check politics at the door. Everything we did, everything we did was bipartisan. For President Biden and [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer and Pelosi right out of the gate to abandon the bipartisan precedent we had established in combatting the coronavirus pandemic I thought was a betrayal of everything we’d done to bring the Congress together around a united effort to end the pandemic.”It is not just the economic recovery that Biden is bungling, though, Pence said. When it comes to the vaccine, Pence said Biden should give former President Donald Trump and the previous administration credit for developing the vaccine — and getting the rollout up to speed — as there were a million shots a day being administered by the time Trump and Pence left office. Pence said that he does believe Americans generally see through Biden’s politicization of the pandemic.“I couldn’t be more proud of what the American people accomplished over the last year and a half,” Pence said. “Only in America, in the face of a global pandemic, could we reinvent testing from a standing start and do a billion tests within a matter of months. Only in America could you stand up a supply chain and enlist companies to manufacture medical company [sic] and fly medical equipment from all around the world so that no American was ever denied the healthcare that they need facing this pandemic. And only in America could you have the kind of research companies and the kind of innovation at the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] that would permit the development of therapeutics and vaccines within nine months. We when we first sat down, when I first became head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we called all of the heads of all of the major pharmaceutical and research companies in — we were in the Cabinet Room. I remember the President asking them how long it would take to get a vaccine? Vaccines take five to seven years, if you can get one. We all said ‘not good enough — what do you need? What needs to happen?’ And that’s where the idea of clearing the way for FDA review and approval without shortcutting safety measures and initiating the idea for Operation Warp Speed because early on we were hearing that several of these vaccines showed very promising returns in the early Phase One trials. We just made the decision we’ll pay you to go ahead and manufacture millions of doses so that, if it’s approved, we won’t wait another year for you to manufacture. The combination of all of those things is an American accomplishment”“The fact that the Biden-Harris administration, that spent much of the campaign talking down a vaccine developed under the Trump-Pence administration, now has seen its way clear to ignore our administration’s efforts is disappointing but not surprising,” Pence lamented. “The thing is, I think the American people see through it. Everywhere I go—today I had a man come alongside me at a picnic I was at in Western Iowa. It was tough. He told me he lost his wife to COVID. But he wanted to express his appreciation to me. I was very moved. I told him ‘I’ll be praying for you and I’m very sorry for your loss.’ He said ‘I just still wanted to thank you for what you’ve done and what the vaccine has meant for other people.’ I just honestly believe the Biden-Harris administration would do well to give credit where credit is due, first to the American people and second to efforts of a prior administration to demonstrate everything we’ve accomplished putting the health of the American people first in this pandemic is a tribute to the American people and American innovation and only in America could we be at a place where we are today where America is coming back and we’re seeing life returning to normal. I flew out to my daughter’s wedding not long ago and couldn’t barely get through the airport and I just found myself walking through the airport thinking ‘Only in America.’”With the upcoming midterm elections, Pence said that Republicans can turn the tide and slam the door shut on the Biden agenda. To retake the U. S. House majority, Republicans only need to flip a net five seats from Democrat hands into GOP hands and, to retake the Senate majority, the GOP only needs to flip a net one seat.“We’ve seen this movie before. I was in Congress in 2010 with a Democrat president, a Democrat Senate, and a Democrat House,” Pence said. “What we did was we brought Republicans together around a unified conservative agenda and we stood strong against the Pelosi majority and we won 63 seats in the House of Representatives in 2010. We won the Senate a few years later and the White House two years after that. I think we’re going to do it all again in the next three and a half years.”Pence said he is noticing “buyer’s remorse across America” with regard to Democrat control in Washington and the Biden agenda.“I heard about it today when I was in western Iowa,” Pence said. “One of the families I met with spoke of a friend who voted for the Biden-Harris ticket and now admitted she was wrong. People see that what Biden is attempting to do is not advance kind of traditional Democrat policies but is literally trying to transform the country into a European-style welfare state.”Pence then called one Biden administration proposal — the implementation of an international minimum corporate tax rate, whereby other countries and the United States would agree to tax entities at the same levels at least and the U. S. would essentially be handing control over tax rates over to some international community entity — “downright un-American.”“You look at the international minimum corporate tax rate that is being orchestrated and discussed with powers around the country that I think is unconstitutional — the power to tax falls squarely with the government and the power to initiate taxes falls squarely with the United States House of Representatives,” Pence said. “The idea that the Treasury Secretary or the Biden administration could negotiate with President Macron to establish a minimum corporate tax rate that would be imposed on our companies is downright un-American. But I think your point is well taken that what the administration is advancing is agenda that is destined to short-circuit the economy but more than that it’s an attempt to transform America into a fundamentally different place than it’s ever been before.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced this past week that he intends to try to force a vote on the so-called “Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework” — for which there still is no bill text — this coming week in the U. S. Senate. Combined with that, the Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration are backing a separate but parallel plan that would spend another $3.5 trillion through reconciliation — which allows them to use a budget gimmick to pass bills out of the Senate with a simple majority. Pence warned his Republican friends in the U. S. Senate against going along with this plan.“With regard to the infrastructure bill, I will just tell you during my years in Congress I always thought it was good to let your yes be yes and let your no be no,” Pence said. “And I’d rather Republicans in the Senate simply made it clear that unless all the Green New Deal stuff is out, they’re not voting for an infrastructure bill. I think there is great risk in a two-bill strategy that could result in us seeing them advance the radical left’s climate change agenda. I would encourage Republicans to think really hard before going along with a first infrastructure bill as it might pave the way for policies that have very little to do with infrastructure but will stifle American prosperity for generations.”Pence also, as he did in his speech here, told Breitbart News about how during the Trump administration the United States became energy independent — and a net exporter of energy — for the first time in 70 years. But, he said, Biden has already undermined that.“America is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas,” Pence said. “This administration, with its climate change agenda, has set itself against the American people permitting to use the resources of our land in an environmentally responsible way. But what’s incomprehensible to me is that President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline but approved the Russian pipeline to western Europe. Think about that? One of your first acts in office is to kill a natural gas pipeline in the United States of America — one that had been tied up for years, one that we cleared the way on, and one that would add to our energy infrastructure — and then to allow Nordstream 2 to go forward? We have tens of thousands of troops in western Europe ostensibly under the mission of NATO protecting Europe from Russian aggression. The idea that they would now pave the way for European countries to become dependent on Russia for natural gas — it’s incomprehensible to me. What we ought to be doing is seeing our European trading partners building ports to be able to import natural gas from the United States of America. Again, what you’re seeing is I think an administration that’s lapsing back into the bad policy decisions of the past and they were policy decisions that the American people were glad to see our administration overturn to the benefit of an incredible boom economy before the coronavirus pandemic struck.”Pence also ripped the Biden administration — and specifically his successor as vice president, Kamala Harris — for mishandling the border crisis.“The Biden-Harris administration took the most secure border in American history and has turned it into the worst immigration crisis in my lifetime,” Pence said. “Suspending construction on the wall, ending the policies that we put into effect that had ended asylum abuse, I thought it was one of the signature accomplishments of our administration. President Trump tapped me and Secretary of State [Mike] Pompeo to sit down in the Roosevelt Room and negotiate out an agreement that anyone applying for asylum in the United States would be required to remain in Mexico. It had been talked about for years and years and in the early years of our administration the Mexicans were only allowing it on a fraction of their border, so President Trump said ‘we’re going to tariff everything coming across the border from Mexico unless you agree to the remain in Mexico policy.’ The secretary of state and I sat down with the Mexican foreign minister and the ambassador and, over the course of several days, we negotiated and secured a remain in Mexico agreement for the entire southern border. That, which essentially ended catch and release on the southern border, sent a message to the northern triangle countries of Central America that the opportunity to game the system was over.”",1,Questionable,0.0559014082625193,0.3348658543102986,3009,1,Breitbart

Officers with the Batesville Police Department responded to a report of a disturbance at a residence on Bridlewood Trace Road in Batesville — about 70 miles southeast of Indianapolis — around 8 a.m. Monday, according to a statement from state police. After police escorted a woman and three children out of the house, a man inside the house fired a shot ""in the direction"" of an officer, who received minor injuries from debris caused by the shot, police said. The Indiana State Police SWAT Team and Hostage Negotiation Team responded to the scene, and law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. Negotiators were able to make brief contact with the man, but shortly after 11 a.m., the man fired more shots from the house, police said.""At approximately 11:30 a.m., the suspect exited the garage of the home with a handgun,"" state police said in a statement. ""Officers fired their weapons, striking him with at least one shot.""The man was transported to Margaret Mary Health in Batesville, where he later died. Police have not yet released the man's name, and detectives from the Indiana State Police-Versailles post are leading the investigation into the shooting.",3,Reliable,0.0374999999999999,0.3631944444444444,320,3,Indianapolis Star
277,DOJ Blocked FBI from Pursuing Criminal Charges Against Clinton,28.5,12.0,https://newspunch.com/doj-blocked-fbi-criminal-charges-clinton/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newspunch-bias-and-reliability/,2019-02-27,22,"The DOJ decided early on in the Clinton email investigation to set an unusually high threshold for the prosecution of Clinton, ensuring from the outset that she would never be charged. BYPASS THE CENSORSSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox.ΔYou can unsubscribe any time. By subscribing you agree to ourTerms of UseTheepochtimes.comreports: In order for Clinton to be prosecuted, the DOJ required the FBI to establish evidence of intent—even though the gross negligence statute explicitly does not require this. This meant that the FBI would have needed to find a smoking gun, such as an email or an admission made during FBI questioning, revealing Clinton or her aides knowingly set up the private email server to send classified information. Hillary Clinton was famously exonerated by FBI Director James Comey in a July 5, 2016,press conference, which immediately became the subject of controversy. Notably, Comey had been convinced to remove the term “gross negligence” to describe Clinton’s actions from his prepared statement by, among others, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, FBI agent Peter Strzok, senior legal counsel Trisha Anderson, and FBI analyst Jonathan Moffa. Because of Comey’s statement, many have mistakenly concluded that the FBI acted independently from DOJ influence in their investigation of Clinton. Congressional testimonies by high ranking FBI officials involved in the investigation reveal, however, that this was not the case. The testimonies, which were conducted last year behind closed-doors, have not been publicly released, but were reviewed for this article. Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer who served as special counsel to Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe during the time of the Clinton investigation, noted during her testimony in July 2018, that the DOJ was intimately involved in the investigation.“Everybody talks about this as if this was the FBI investigation, and the truth of the matter is there was not a single step, other than the July 5th statement, there was not a single investigative step that we did not do in consultation with or at the direction of the Justice Department,” Page told congressional investigators on July 13, 2018. Comey had also hinted at the influence exerted by the DOJ over the Clinton investigation in his Julyrecommendation, stating that “there are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.”Intent is a requirement of several statutes the FBI was looking into. But intent is specifically not a factor under the charge of gross negligence—contained within18 U. S. Code § 793(f)—a fact that was brought up by Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) during Page’s testimony:Page made clear during her testimony that the DOJ had decided that due to “constitutional vagueness” a charge of gross negligence would not be supported without accompanying proof of intent—a seemingly oxymoronic position:The word “intent” drove the entirety of the FBI’s investigation into the Clinton email server. It appears, however, that there were differing understandings of the word “intent” within the FBI. Trisha Anderson, the No. 2 lawyer at the FBI, told investigators that what she viewed as intent was “an email that the Secretary sent saying, I set up this server for the purpose of sending unclassified information for my convenience, even though I know it’s not a secure system.”Page viewed the situation somewhat differently, agreeing they were looking for “an intent to do an act which is in violation of the law’s central command.” As she told investigators, the FBI “couldn’t find any indicia of knowledge that she knew that these [classified emails] shouldn’t be traversing her server.”In Anderson’s understanding, she was looking for a prosecutable reason behind the establishment of the server itself. Page, however, was looking at whether Clinton knew which emails should not have traveled through the private server. Meanwhile, Bill Priestap, head of the FBI’s counterintelligence division and who was officially in charge of the Clinton investigation, said during testimony that he thought the “number of instances is absolutely a proper consideration” in establishing intent. According to Ryan Breitenbach, who was the House Majority Counsel at the time of Priestap’s interview, the State Department had identified 22 top-secret emails and 1,300 classified emails on Clinton’s email server. As Breitenbach noted to Priestap during testimony, “I think there might be many who would question whether people in this room would still be in this room if we had hit 1,300 emails on our personal Gmail service.”Priestap was shown an email sent from an unknown individual in the FBI general counsel’s office to Priestap’s former boss, Michael Steinbach, which contained a chart of “available statutes for prosecuting the former Secretary of State.” Gross Negligence was specifically excluded from the chargeable statutes available to the FBI. Priestap, who had not previously seen the document, expressed concerns that this might have hindered the work of FBI investigators. Priestap said that it was his understanding that the gross negligence standard had not been met—as opposed to not pursued—in the Clinton case. As Priestap noted, “if I understood from the department that they would never charge a particular statute, I would want to know that before I’m going to dedicate resources to a particular topic. I didn’t know that.”But Lisa Page, a lawyer by training, seemed to have a very different understanding of what would be allowed by the DOJ. Page appeared to indicate during her testimony that because of the DOJ’s position, there was no reason for the FBI to even pursue evidence related to the specific statute of gross negligence.“Let’s assume things are going swimmingly and, in fact, all 17 of those witnesses admit, ‘We did it, it was on purpose, we totally wanted to mishandle classified information,’ gross negligence would still have been off the table because of the department’s assessment that it was vague. We would have other crimes to now charge, but gross negligence would not have been among them.” Page said in her testimony. FBI General Counsel James Baker, who called Clinton’s behavior “alarming, appalling”, told congressional lawmakers that: “I thought these folks should know that this stuff is classified, that it was alarming what they were talking about, especially some of the most highly classified stuff.”Baker said that he “argued with others about why they thought she shouldn’t be charged.” However, Baker said he was eventually persuaded by other senior FBI personnel, including Director Comey, “that charging her was not appropriate because we could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that — we, the government, could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that she had the intent.”Interestingly, despite DOJ unwillingness to pursue the gross negligence statute, the FBI utilized it while obtaining a search warrant in the Clinton email case:Anderson also was questioned regarding the search warrant and appeared to struggle when asked why the FBI was requesting search warrants based on “a particular statute that has real potential legal problems, according to the DOJ analysis.”“In this particular case, had we had evidence of intent, it’s theoretically possible that we could have brought a prosecution, might have brought a prosecution under that statute. I’m not saying that’s, you know, what would have happened necessarily, but the statute is not — it is not the Department’s view, as I understand it, the statute is invalid for constitutional reasons in every circumstance,” Anderson said. Page, Baker, and Anderson all testified that the gross negligence statute was rarely, if ever used, as part of their explanation for the DOJ’s unwillingness to pursue, but this logic was repeatedly challenged by then-majority House counsel Breitenbach:“If part of that rationale was that it had never been used, then, by extension, one might presume that other statutes that are on the books, if they aren’t being used, should not be ever considered as predication for a prosecution.”Breitenbach was providing a less-than subtle reminder that it is Congress, not the DOJ or the FBI, who create the laws. The DOJ, as part of the Executive Branch, has an obligation to enforce the statutes put in place by Congress, not to pass legal judgement on them. Anderson had no material response to this rebuttal, only noting “that was not the intent of my statement.”Included within Clinton’s emails was “classified information up to the Special Access Program level.” SAPs, as they are known, areestablishedto “control access, distribution, and provide protection for sensitive classified information beyond that normally required” on a need-to-know basis with only a small number of individuals cleared to view the information. The classification level of SAPs is so high that Anderson actually refused to define her understanding of an SAP in the unclassified interview setting before congressional investigators, which led to an obvious question: In addition to considering the frequency of violation, would not the sensitivity of the emails also be a factor? Anderson’s answer was eye-opening:In other words, under Anderson’s understanding of the DOJ’s standard, the extreme volume of emails was not a factor, nor was the classification level of the emails, as long as those being investigated were able to say they simply didn’t know any documents were actually classified—even if the primary subject of the investigation, the Secretary of State, should have been qualified to discern between classified and unclassified information. Anderson was asked about her understanding of the difference between gross negligence and extreme carelessness. Anderson answered that she didn’t “know exactly what the precise difference is between extremely careless and gross negligence.”In her testimony, she was forced to admit that the team working on the case should have tried to better understand the difference between the two:“Obviously, the use of the phrase “extremely careless” has been open to interpretation and confusion after the fact. So, perhaps, that issue is something we should have more carefully considered, we as a group. I’m not saying, you know, there was anything that I did incorrectly here, but — so I don’t know that there is a single meaning of extremely careless.”Which begs the question of why Anderson, among others, felt compelled to push Comey to change the language within his statement from the legal term of gross negligence to the non-legal term of extremely careless. Anderson, who told congressional investigators that the extremely careless phrase had been subject to competing interpretations, was quickly countered by Breitenbach, who noted, “It’s competing, because it has no legal effect, whereas gross negligence does.”“I think you would agree with me that negligence is different than intent,” Breitenbach told Anderson. But according to Anderson’s testimony, the FBI never even looked into negligence due to the DOJ’s legal position:The issue at the heart of the Clinton email investigation was summarized by Breitenbach, who said that “the Department of Justice made a decision that intent was required, even though we have a statute on the books that does not require intent that [only] requires gross negligence.”Gross negligence is different than willfulness and intentional conduct. But with the decision to require evidence of intent on the part of Clinton in order to prosecute, the DOJ managed to circumvent and in effect neutralize the entire FBI investigation from the outset. This could have been why Comey and the hierarchy of the FBI felt comfortable in drawing up an exoneration statement in advance of Clinton’s actual interview. No actual evidence of intent, such as an email where Clinton overtly admitted she established her knowingly unsecure server for the purpose of sending classified information for convenience, had been found. Clinton was almost certain not to admit to this during her own FBI interview. Absent a slip-up on her part, Clinton was effectively in the clear from the outset of the FBI investigation due to the DOJ’s decision to require intent. It was Page that testified as to whom was responsible for the decision within the DOJ to require intent as part of a gross negligence charge—Richard Scott and, secondarily, David Laufman. Scott, the deputy chief of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES) of the Justice Department’s National Security Division (NSD), was involved in the investigation into Clinton’s private email server and reported to Laufman. Laufman, chief of CES and Scott’s direct supervisor, was cited by Page as the individual responsible for altering the FBI’s normal policy of interviews by insisting on being personally present for the interviews of “not just Mrs. Clinton but also Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, and her sort of core team.”Both men were overseen by George Toscas, who was selected by the DOJ’s head of the NSD, John Carlin, to oversee the entirety of the Clinton investigation from the DOJ’s perspective. Working alongside Toscas was Stu Evans and Adam Hickey—both deputy assistant attorney generals like Toscas. According to Toscas, Evans, as the DOJ’s point person on the FISA application on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, was responsible for managing—and reading—not only the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, but also the three subsequent renewals. Notably, with the exceptions of Moffa, Evans, and Hickey, every individual from the FBI and DOJ mentioned has either been fired or has resigned. Most have been the subject of congressional interviews.",0,Problematic,0.04445620223398,0.4286272780717224,2974,0,NewsPunch

S. political/media class have beenpushing hard for more authoritarian policiesto stave off the threat of “domestic terrorism” in the wake of the Capitol riot. President Biden, whowas already workingon rolling out new domestic terror policies well before January sixth,confirmed after the riotthat he is making these new measures a priority. Political internet censorship is becomingincreasingly normalized, anti-protest billsare being passed, and now we’re seeing liberalsencouraged to form “digital armies”to spy on Trump supporters to report them to the authorities. And an amazingly large percentage of the U. S. population seems to have no problem with any of this, even in sectors of the political spectrum that should really know better by now.“What else can we do?” they reason. “What other solution could there possibly be to the threat of dangerous fascists and conspiracy theorists continuing to gain power and influence?”Well there’s a whole lot that can be done, and none of it includes consenting to sweeping new Patriot Act-like authoritarian measures or encouraging monopolistic Silicon Valley plutocrats to censor worldwide political speech. There’s just a whole lot of mass-scale narrative manipulation going on to keep it from being obvious to everyone. The New Domestic War on Terror is Coming— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald)January 19, 2021The way to stem the tide of Trumpism (or fascism, or white supremacism, or Trump cultism, or whatever term you use for what you’re worried about here) is to eliminate the conditions that created it. Trump was only able to launch his successful faux-populist campaign in the first place by exploiting the widespread pre-existing opinion that there was a swamp that needed draining, a corrupt political system whose leadership does not promote the interests of the people. Conspiracy theories only exist because the governmentoften does evil things and lies about themwith the help of the mass media, forcing people to just guess what’s happening behind the opaque wall of government secrecy. People only get it in their heads that they need a trustworthy strongman to overhaul the system if the system has failed them. People who are actually interested in ending Trumpism would be promoting an end to the corruption in the political system, an end to the opacity of their government, an end to theiruniquely awful electoral system, and an end to theneoliberal policieswhich have been making Americans poorer and poorer with less and less support from the government which purports to protect them. But these changes are not being promoted by the U. S. political/media class, because the U. S. political/media class speaks for an empire that depends on these things. Without corruption, the plutocratic class couldn’tuse campaign donations and corporate lobbyingto install and maintain politicians who will advance their interests. Without government secrecy, the oligarchic empire could not conspire in secret to advance the military and economic agendas which form the glue that holds the empire together. Without a lying mass media, people’sconsent could not be manufacturedfor wars and a system which does not serve their interests. Without widespread poverty and domestic austerity, people could not be kept too busy and politically impotent to challenge the massive political influence of the plutocrats. Since the day of the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, at least nine states have introduced 14 anti-protest bills.— The Intercept (@theintercept)January 22, 2021So the option of stopping the rise of Trumpism by changing the system is taken off the table, which is why you never hear it discussed as a possibility in mainstream circles. The only option people are being offered to debate the pros and cons of is giving more powers to that same corrupt system which created Trump, powers which will be under the control of the next Trumpian figure who is elevated by that very system. You’re not going to prevent fascism by creating a big authoritarian monster to stomp it into silence, and even if you could you would only be stopping the fascism by becoming the fascism. To stop the rise of fascism you need to actually change. Drastically. Believing you can just make it go away without changing your situation is like believing you can avert an oncoming train by putting your hands over your eyes. There is no valid argument against what I am saying here. Saying the powerful won’t allow any positive change is just confirming everything I’m saying and confirming the need to remove the powerful from power. Saying that ending corruption, government secrecy and injustice would just be giving the terrorists what they want would be turning yourself into a bootlicker of such cartoonish obsequiousness there aren’t words in the English language adequate to mock you. Yes, change is desperately needed. Yes, the powerful will resist thatchangewith everything they have. But the alternative is letting them plunge the world into darkness and destruction.at Medium.

Two days later, Carranza was taken to Nogales, Mexico, as first reported bythe Arizona Republic. Carranza told the Republic he was living at a shelter for deported migrants in Nogales, even though he did not know the city. It is unclear why ICE allowed Carranza to return to the United States, though his attorney believes it’s because the media brought attention to the story. ICE does not yet have a statement on the situation.“Once I have a statement to issue, I will be sure you receive it,” an ICE spokesperson told VICE News in an email. Carranza entered the U.

After Vieyra’s death, Carranza was allowed to remain in the United States after he was granted a “parole in place” status, according to reports, which allowed him to stay in the country without the looming threat of deportation.

The U. S. government has been aware of the approach of “Planet X” for over forty years, warns John Moore “The Liberty Man,” in a jaw-dropping new interview on. (See below.)While Planet X won’t strike the Earth, it’s nearby approach will unleash cataclysmic consequences across our planet that may bring an end to human civilization as we know it, Moore explains in the interview. Those effects may include a global “pole shift,” which means the Earth’s crust slips to a new orientation, unleashing extreme winds, volcanoes, earthquakes, flooding, tidal waves and more.“Every structure on the surface of the Earth would be destroyed,” explains Moore, who reveals the governments of the world are frantically constructing more underground bunkers in anticipation of catastrophic events. John Moore is a former U. S. Army intelligence analyst and took part in 57 air combat missions over Vietnam and Cambodia. He later become a homicide detective for the state of Missouri. As a long-time radio host, Moore has developed a long list of sources inside government and the U. S. military. He hosts a radio show each weekday from 8 – 10 am central time, via Republic Broadcasting. Learn all the details atTheLibertyMan.comAs Moore explains in the video below, the pole shift would place North America closer to the equator than its current position, and the “bulge” of ocean water at the equator (due to centrifugal forces of the rotating planet) would raise the level of the ocean by hundreds of feet compared to the continental United States. John Moore’s website — TheLibertyMan.com — hosts this map of anticipated changes. Note that Florida and much of the Eastern seaboard are under water in this depiction:In the video below, John Moore explains how people living in other areas of the world can easily determine whether their current locations will be inundated with higher relative ocean levels. The Planet X fly-by would likely also bring asteroid impacts to planet Earth, causing global chaos and mass destruction as large space rocks impact the planet at extreme relative velocities. A recent study found that just one such impact in any ocean would unleash 400-foot ocean waves that would devastate coastal cities around the world (and flood coastlines for potentially a hundred miles inland). Asteroids that impact the land could unleash large volumes of particulate matter into the stratosphere that would block sunlight from reaching food crops, leading to mass famine and the collapse of human civilization. If large volcanoes also erupt due to the destabilization of the Earth’s crust, the amount of participate matter circling the globe could block out the sun and absolutely devastate nearly all plant life on Earth for several years. (Plants depend on photosynthesis via sunlight and carbon dioxide for energy, a fact that 99% of today’s climate scientists still refuse to acknowledge because they are scientifically illiterate brainwashed zombies.)The United States government is fully aware of the approach of Planet X but has chosen to withhold this information from the American people for the simple fact that. Moore recommends people move inland and get above 500 feet in altitude in order to survive the ocean inundation of North America. See the full interview here:Direct Brighteon.com link:Brighteon.com/c0fdc799-ac8c-42a9-9447-69f3735e1147Censorship-resistant link (for sharing on social media):Brlghteon.com/c0fdc799-ac8c-42a9-9447-69f3735e1147As far as the timing of the return of Planet X, Moore explains that people who keep asking about the timing are those who refuse to prepare. Since the public isn’t being told about the timing,. Any who hope to survive the return of Planet X, whenever it occurs, must move away from coastal areas and construct Earth-bermed or underground structures, then stock them with survival supplies and prepare for a global food wipeout lasting 1-2 years. You won’t even be able to grow food, since the sunlight will be blocked by particulate dust in the atmosphere. Needless to say, in this scenario, as will all fiat currencies. The only things that have value from that day forward are gold, silver, firearms, ammunition, food, fuel, first aid, land and other “real” items. The Book of Revelation openly warns humanity about a fiery mountain falling out of the sky and impacting the ocean, devastating the planet and destroying a third of the world’s ships. To follow this rabbit hole, research the terms “Wormwood” or “Nibiru.”Note that the areas of America which will be flooded first tend to cover the anti-God Leftists who mass murder babies, sexually assault children and worship Satan. Many people have speculated that God will judge America’s sins by unleashing catastrophic events against this nation, similar to the fiery events described in relation tobut on a much larger scale. Other guests we’ve interviewed say that America must, beg God for forgiveness and unleash a national revival in order to avoid God’s wrath.

Cleaning and votingThere were slight adjustments in the routine motions of voting at the Colonialtown Neighborhood Center, located in a quiet, brick-street neighborhood near the corner of Mills Avenue and Virginia Drive. Before you sign your name on the computer screen when you check in, a volunteer poll worker from the Boy Scouts immediately suggests using a Kleenex to hold the device’s pen so that way, your hands never actually touch the device that’s been out all day. And without any prompt, the same poll worker also says all the ink pens used to circle in the ballots are cleaned. Inside the polling place, hand sanitizer is available too.—Gabrielle RussonOutweighing coronavirus concernsOnelia Colón was voting in a pandemic. She was a senior whose age left her more vulnerable to the highly contagious infection, according to health experts. But she said she felt safe voting Tuesday afternoon at the Osceola County Welcome Center.“I was not nervous,” said Colón, a retired hospital administration officer worker who lives in Kissimmee. “I used my mask. I used hand sanitizer. I kept the distance.”She said she felt it was important to cast her ballot, leaning toward the incumbents running for re-election. Voting is essential: Everyone should do it, she said. Another man voting at the same poll also wasn’t concerned about catching the coronavirus. Why?He already had it. The 54-year-old Kissimmee man who declined to be named said he has since recovered from the fever and muscle pain when he was sick two months ago.— Gabrielle RussonBattling COVID and rainBecki Talley has stood on the curb of U. S. Highway 192 since 7 a.m. holding up signs. She counted, on average, only about 10 cars or so an hour pulling into vote at the Osceola County Welcome Center, which was located a few minutes from the Medieval Times castle in Kissimmee.“It’s not going to be a big turnout,” said Talley, a retired human resources manager from the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office who flew in from Palm Springs, Calif. to support Mike Fisher’s bid for sheriff. “Because of COVID.”Just after 2 p.m., the weather seemed like it also might scare off more voters. Lightning flashed in the not-so-far-off distance and it started to lightly rain. In the approaching storm, several Unite Here supporters held signs for Kissimmee Mayor Jose Alvarez’s campaign for Osceola County Commission as passers-by honked.— Gabrielle Russon‘We must vote to let them know’The turnout was light at the VFW precinct 322 polling place on South Goldenrod Avenue in Orlando with sparse but present voters ready with their choices. Nonpartisan voter Elizabeth has only lived in the county for two years but still felt voting was important enough to brave the pandemic. “It is our right to decide who we want, and we must vote to let them know, even if we aren’t in the party,” she said.— Trevor FraserSocially distant in Mount DoraSeveral items at a polling place in Mount Dora made it clear this is primary day in the age of COVID-19: disposable cotton swabs for voters to sign their names on the electronic signature device, pens to use once and take home (with the name of the Supervisor of Elections Alan Hays on them), and fewer booths than normal. When you left the First Baptist Church after voting, the poll worker did not hand you the usual “I Voted” sticker. You picked one up from a chair beside her. And, of course, everyone from workers to voters wore masks. By 1:20 p.m., more than 12,000 people had voted in Lake County in person on primary day, with an addition 9,140 who took advantage of early voting. More than 29,000 mail-in ballots were submitted, for a turnout at this time of about 20 percent.— John CutterSmooth morning in OrangeOrange County elections supervisor Bill Cowles said at about noon that voting had gone smoothly this morning in the county’s nearly 250 precincts, with no major issues reported. Cowles has said early voting was similarly uneventful, with no lines, and the trend continued on Election Day.— Steven Lemongello‘Splitting hairs’ near Winter ParkMid-morning voters reported no lines or crowds at St. Richard’s Episcopal Church in Seminole County near Winter Park.“I took the day off of work to be able to research the candidates,” said registered Democrat Jeremy Reinhard, though he added that in a lot of races, deciding who to vote for was like “splitting hairs.”Reinhard said he fears President Trump interfering with the U. S. mail system in the November general election and plans to vote in-person then, too. He’s even considering volunteering at a polling place. Registered Republican Stephanie Dalvit, 50, said she didn’t see many people on her ballot who excited her.“I feel like you’re always picking the lesser of the evils,” she said, adding she doesn’t agree with any one party’s stances on every issue.— Annie MartinDalvit, a nail technician and esthetician who trains others in her profession, said she wants to see more support for small businesses struggling during the pandemic. Kimberly Grovenger snapped a selfie with her voter sticker as she left the precinct. The 28-year-old had come without rest from her overnight shift as a security worker to the polls.“You can’t have any change” if you don’t vote, she said. Grovenger said she wasn’t drawn to any particular race during the primary but is eager to vote again in November to try to oust Trump.“It’s been a long four years,” she said.— Annie Martin‘There’s nobody here’Precinct 26 in Altamonte Springs was too quiet this morning for the liking of Seminole County resident Debbie Paschal.“There’s nobody here,” the 67-year-old said shaking her head and wearing a blue “Trump” t-shirt in front of the voting precinct at 742 Sanlando Road, where everyone wore masks. Paschal was not interested in any particular race, but said she believed in the importance in voting solely Republican during the primary election as a show of red strength before November’s presidential election. Poll workers confirmed attendance at the precinct this morning was lackluster.“I always vote,” Paschal said. “This is important. We need to be out here now, so our president knows we’re behind him.”Other residents trickled in with local candidates in mind, including Doreen Leavitt, 62, and her husband Brad Leavitt, 64. After doing their research, the couple decided they were voting for Wayne Culver for a spot on the judicial bench in Seminole County Court.“Jessica Damoth is too liberal for us,” Doreen said. The couple voted for Yukong Zhao in the District 7 representative race.“He understands the socialism and knows that’s not what we need. We’re against socialism. So, we like him,” Brad said. On the topic of attendance, Doreen agreed it could be better and stressed the importance of voting even if it’s for the opposition.“We come out to all elections. It’s your duty. It’s our duty as American citizens,” she said. “Even if you don’t vote for who I’m voting for, you need to take an interest and come out.”— Joe Mario PedersenEager in AltamonteVoters trickled into the Hilton hotel in Altamonte Springs early today, with people leaving the polls reporting no lines and plenty of distance between them and others. Jeff Zolkes, 50, a registered Democrat who said he voted “blue all the way,” said he wasn’t well versed about the individual candidates but knew what he was after.“When I saw women, I chose them. When I saw ethnic last names, I chose them. We’re represented always by rich, straight, white men and that’s not America,” said Zolkes, who is white and gay. Zolkes, who wore a mask, said he’s concerned about the virus but didn’t hesitate to vote in person and intends to do so again in November and cast his ballot to “dump Trump.”Another Altamonte Springs voter, Duane Gardner, 60, said he was eager to support Seminole County Commissioner Lee Constantine, who he said “seems honest.”— Annie MartinWipes and PlexiglasA bottle of disinfectant wipes next to a pile of Orange County “Vote (I did!)” stickers set the new COVID-19 voting scene for residents this morning at the First Unitarian Church of Orlando. The 502nd precinct at 1901 E. Robinson St. was abuzz as the doors opened at 7 a.m. with residents walking in and out of the building, yet the building didn’t seem full, which early-morning voters appreciated. Everyone who was there was wearing a mask, a county mandate because of the coronavirus.“There was no one in there,” said Matthew Bauer, 59, after voting. “Of course, I felt safe in there. I always vote. I thought it would be fine here. I think it’s important to keep up the protection against COVID. And they’re wiping everything down.”Some differences were apparent, however, including hand sanitizer and a large sheet of Plexiglas between them and the poll workers handing out ballots. Only seven booths are available at the Unitarian Church, all 6 feet apart. Despite COVID concerns, Orange County resident Patsy Mcclelland, 55, wasn’t going to miss voting.“I’m always up early to vote. It’s important to me,” she said. “I felt very safe inside. You know, they’ve got Plexiglas. They’re wiping everything, and there’s practically no one inside when you walk in.”— Joe Mario PedersenLast-minute appealsIf you haven’t already noticed the flood of text messages and emails hitting your smartphone yet, get ready for a potential deluge today. Registered voters should expect final appeals from candidates in many races, sprinkled with the occasional digital attack on their opponents. The first example to hit my mailbox this morning came from Orange County Sheriff John Mina, who is facing four opponents today: Andrew Darling, Darryl Sheppard, Jose “Joe” Lopez and Eric McIntyre. Mina’s email urges me to vote and provides a link to look up my precinct. But here’s the thing: I early voted more than a week ago.— Mark Skoneki",3,Reliable,0.1556916792588962,0.3917896621198506,5995,3,Orlando Sentinel

The FTC's suitalleges that the brothers' company, Environmental Safety International (ESI), based out of Fairview, New Jersey, hired telemarketers to initiate calls all across the U. S. Roughly 45 million of these calls were made between January 2018 and March 2019. Additionally, around 31 million of these were illegal calls made to people on the FTC's 'Do Not Call' registry. These scam calls reportedly began by purporting to offer free information on septic tank products, but those who listened and agreed to stay on the call were eventually given a sales pitch for ESI's ""Activator 1000"" line of septic products.""The complaint also alleges that ESI sent letters to consumers who agreed to buy their products but had unpaid invoices, falsely claiming that they would be referred to a 'national collection agency' or to an attorney,"" the FTC's press release read. ""However, ESI never took either of these actions.""The settlement stipulates that ESI must be dissolved within 30 days.

During breaks at her part-time UPS job, the Manual High School senior filled out college applications, refusing to let her lifelong dreams of attending a historically Black college or university fade despite the onslaught of stressors the COVID-19 pandemic presented.“My community — we are just struggling to survive to be honest,” Barnes said. “Struggling to survive is something I don’t want to have to keep doing. I want to be able to set up my family and their families and make sure my kids and their kids don’t struggle, and I can do that by going to college.”College application season can be stressful in a normal year. In 2020 as the coronavirus has annihilated normalcy in most aspects of lifeincluding higher education, experts worry about the consequences of thenewfound uncertainties of a traditional college lifeand theadded pressures of pandemic lifemaking an already taxing application process that much harder. Compared to last year, nearly 22% fewer high school seniors who graduated in 2020 nationally went to college in the fall, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. In Colorado, state higher education experts are concerned as preliminary data shows declining enrollment among the class of 2021, particularly among first-generation college students, students of color and those applying to community college, said Carl Einhaus, senior director of student success and academic affairs at the Colorado Department of Higher Education.“This is a very significant concern,” Einhaus said. “These are all student populations we have been working hard to make sure higher education is accessible to.”Almost 89% of top jobs in the state require some form of credential past high school, according to anew report from the state higher education department. Cassandra Willis, a 17-year-old from Alamosa, has her eyes set on one of those top jobs.“I’ve always been that nerd who gets straight A’s, and I’ve always wanted to make a name for myself and show people that a kid from a small town can go to a big college and have a great career,” Willis said. “But this year is just awkward trying to figure out all the college application stuff when everything is different.”Willis said she and a friend made a pact to apply to colleges together so they could hold each other accountable to getting the work done and be supportive when acceptance or rejection letters arrived. The high school senior applied to most Colorado higher education institutions and is especially interested inRegis University’s pharmacy program. Willis said many of her peers, even those who may have considered college in the past, are burned out from the difficult pandemic year.“This year has taken a toll on everyone because when I talk to my classmates about college or somebody brings it up in class, a lot of them are not very not motivated to apply,” Willis said. Renae Bellew, senior program director with the Denver Scholarship Foundation, which works toward enrolling and graduating Denver Public Schools students into postsecondary institutions, said students this year are in survival mode.“Planning for the future right now is not the priority for some students,” Bellew said. “There’sfood insecurity,housing insecurity,mental health concernsthat we’re addressing with students, so we have to be sensitive to the realities of what our students are experiencing and adjusting the support we provide.”Bellew said Denver Scholarship Foundation employees are used to tracking down students in schools — even waiting outside their classrooms to catch them in the hallway — to make sure they have the resources they need when applying to colleges. Due to COVID-19 and themassive shift to remote learning, Bellew said those critical face-to-face interactions have been replaced with asking students to hold up financial aid forms to laptop cameras or trying to talk through confusing paperwork over the phone. Bellew’s department has seen a rise in students considering a gap year in the hopes they could have amore traditional post-pandemic college experience,pondering part-time enrollment and looking at colleges closer to home. Willis has concentrated her college search mainly to Colorado due to the pandemic.“If I go to school out-of-state and am so far away from my family, what if our school gets shut down and then I don’t really have anywhere to go and I’d have to book a flight and quarantine and all that sounds like a lot,” Willis said. “I’m nervous about that. I want to stay in Colorado or close to it.”Barnes, on the other hand, is anxious her aspiration to attend college out-of-state may be in jeopardy due to the pandemic. The Manual High School student has applied to eight HBCUs, all outside Colorado, and intends to study business management and become an entrepreneur.“My main thing was getting out of state, so if I wasn’t able to do that, that’s the part that scares me,” Barnes said. From a college admissions standpoint, Karla Hardesty, executive director for enrollment management at Adams State University, said higher education institutions need to innovate to reach students in this trying year. Normally, Adams State University — a smaller institution in the San Luis Valley — is able to make in-person connections and introduce the school to potential students at college fairs and inside high school classrooms, but pandemic restrictions threw a wrench into many of those plans. Virtual is always an option, but Hardesty said the institution is aware of Zoom fatigue. For alternative recruiting, Hardesty said Adams State has begun texting campaigns, social media outreach on platforms like Tik Tok and connecting with parents and families, too. Applications at Adams State are down compared to last year, Hardesty said, but admission numbers are on the rise as the university is able to admit students faster because thestate made SAT and ACT scores optional this yeardue to pandemic complications.“If a student had challenges this year academically, we’re certainly going to take those circumstances of this year into consideration,” Hardesty said. Clark Brigger, executive director of admissions at the University of Colorado Boulder, echoed Hardesty’s sentiments. Applications to Colorado’s flagship university are actually 26% ahead of last year, but Brigger said he understands this is a difficult time for many families.“We certainly understand that some students won’t excel in a remote learning environment and some transcripts have pass/fail grades on them, and we have to look past that passing grade to previous grades and look at sequence of courses and extrapolate,” Brigger said. “We’ll be focusing on the entire academic record and paying special attention to essays, letters of recommendation and any COVID-related statements.”If a student or family had a recent change in financial situation due to the pandemic — or for any reason — Brigger and Hardesty urged them to call the institution’s financial aid department and talk it through.“There is money available and we’re certainly very understanding,” Brigger said. “There are compassionate people that work with them in this process because the world is absolutely changing around everybody right now.”",3,Reliable,0.1170215843346684,0.4701780151312861,1576,3,Colorado Daily

Instead, he said at a news conference that House Republicans will conduct their own investigation of an attempt to reject last November’s election results thatmost of them supportedand that was instigated by the leader of their party.“We will run our own investigation,” McCarthy said, adding later that “no committee in Congress will work if one person is picking all who can serve.”Kevin McCarthy says that Republicans will run their own investigation into the insurrection instigated by the leader of their partypic.twitter.com/SkclfTS3hgMcCarthy’s news conference came hours after Pelosi rejected the nomination to the committee of two of McCarthy’s five proposed Republicans: Reps. Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, who both voted in January against certifying two states’ results which contributed to President Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump. Instead of nominating more suitable Republicans to the committee, McCarthy opted to try to blow the whole thing up. And while McCarthy accused Pelosi of “playing politics” by rejecting Jordan and Banks, the irony is it’s his party that has an electoral interest in maintaining a fog of confusion around an insurrection that will be a major issue heading into next year’s midterms and the 2024 presidential election. In May, the top Democrat and Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee — Reps. Bernie Thompson (MS) and John Katko (NY), respectively — hammered out a deal for a January 6 committee that hadthe features McCarthy now says he wants: equal representation of Democrats and Republicans, and Republican veto power over subpoenas. But McCarthy torpedoed that deal because the scope of the committee’s work wouldn’t include an investigation into “interrelated political violence” purportedly perpetrated by leftist groups like Black Lives Matter and antifa.“Given the Speaker’s shortsighted scope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannot support this legislation,” astatementfrom his office concluded, in a talking point that McCarthy also raised on Wednesday. Kevin McCarthy says he opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate Jan. 6 -- the thing he says he wants now -- because Pelosi wouldn't empower it to study ""what built up to"" the insurrection (in other words turn it into a forum to bash antifa)pic.twitter.com/JO5rwE4jyiDespite McCarthy’s opposition to the Thompson-Katko deal, legislation to set up an independent commission passed the House with 35 Republicans voting in favor, but was blocked by Senate Republicans in their first filibuster of the Biden era. Pelosi responded by creating a commission with eight Democratic appointees and five Republican ones, with Pelosi having veto power over the members McCarthy appointed. One of the Pelosi appointees is Republican Rep. Liz Cheney (WY). McCarthy’s move to appoint Jordan and Banks to the commission, meanwhile, signaled how disinterested he is in an independent January 6 investigation. Not only did Jordan and Banks vote against certifying parts of Trump’s loss, but as recently as two months ago, Banks was still unable to say Biden’s win was “legitimate” (despite Trump’s own officials repeatedly stating there is no evidence of widespread fraud) and was defending his vote against accepting the election results.

He was part of a group of House Republicans who publiclyworked with the Trump White Houselast December to scheme about ways to overturn the election results on January 6. Beyond trying to protect Trump and his party from an investigation that is likely to result in a damaging report issued just before next year’s midterm elections, McCarthy has self-interested reasons to try to kneecap a January 6 committee. He’s just as guilty as anyone for pushing lies about the 2020 election that persuaded Trump supporters the presidency was stolen and motivated them to storm the Capitol. Just days after the election, for instance, McCarthy went on Fox News and proclaimed, “President Trump won this election, so everyone who’s listening, do not be quiet. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes ... join together and let’s stop this.”.@GOPLeaderKevin McCarthy was laying the groundwork for the attack on the Capitol for months. 11/5/2020:“President Trump won this election, so everyone who’s listening, do not be quiet.

McCarthy might not have been in favor of the storming of the Capitol itself — as Trump supporters rioted inside the Capitol on January 6, McCarthy had a phone call with Trump that remains shrouded in mystery, but during which McCarthyreportedlyconfronted Trump about why he wasn’t doing more to quell the unrest. But he also doesn’t seem in favor of interrogating why that unrest happened or what role his party and the former president could have played in prompting it: Asked about that call during Wednesday’s news conference, McCarthy quickly pivoted to law enforcement failures on January 6 — a topic he made clear will be a focus of the Republican investigation. Asked about his mysterious phone call with Trump while the insurrection was ongoing, McCarthy quickly changes the topic to law enforcement failurespic.twitter.com/uYxjU1Un00In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, McCarthy gave a speech on the House floor in which he acknowledged that Trump “bears responsibility” for the events of January 6 — but in a remarkable turnaround, during a July 1 news conference herefused to acknowledgeTrump bears responsibility for January 6. Shortly before Pelosi announced she wouldn’t accept Banks and Jordan on the January 6 commission, Banks released a statement in which he indicated he intended to turn the committee into a circus.“Make no mistake, Nancy Pelosi created this committee solely to malign conservatives and to justify the Left’s authoritarian agenda,” Bankssaid. Pelosi on Thursday cited statements of that sort as a reason she rejected Banks and Jordan.“They had made statements and taken actions that I think would impact the integrity of the committee,” Pelosi said during a news conference. “It’s my responsibility as Speaker of the House to make sure we get to the truth on this. We will not let their antics stand in the way of that.”Pelosi on rejecting Jordan & Banks for Jan 6 committee: ""They had made statements & taken actions that I think would impact the integrity of the committee ... it's my responsibility [to] make sure we get to the truth on this.

Republican Rep. Cheney already agreed to serve on it, and on Wednesday she criticized McCarthy for “at every opportunity attempt[ing] to prevent the American people from understanding what happened.”“We must have this select committee investigation,” Cheney told reporters. “We cannot allow those voices who are attempting to prevent the American people from getting the truth to prevail.”Republicans, predictably, have responded bysuggestingCheney isn’t really a Republican.

The 10 adults and 10 children, whose ages ranged from 3 to 13, were forced to board different flights Sunday as they protested the airline’s decision. One of the passengers, Scott Wilson, told local news outletKSL-TVthat everyone in his family was wearing masks at all times, though he believes one person accidentally dropped their mask below their nose before quickly correcting it. He said fellow passengers and even gate agents saw what happened and sided with his family, accusing the captain of treating them unfairly.“There was actually a couple families around us that stood up and was like, ‘This is wrong, that guy is being a jerk,'” Wilson told the station. “He was yelling at other people as they came on, too, and he was already mad at these guys.

In a statement Wednesday morning, American Airlines said the passengers were “reported to be noncompliant” with the carrier’s mandatory COVID-19 policy, “which requires face coverings be worn properly over the nose and mouth.”“Per procedure, the customers involved were asked to exit the aircraft before departure and the flight departed for DFW shortly after,” a company spokesperson said in an email. An internal airline probe also suggests that the passengers were reminded to wear their masks properly before they were removed. U.

290,Chancellor Rishi Sunak hints at ruling out 8% pension rise,-4.33,45.0,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57762787,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,25,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""We want to make sure the decisions we make are fair... both for pensioners and for taxpayers""The chancellor has given his strongest indication yet of ruling out a predicted 8% rise in the state pension next year. Official forecasts suggest that the link with earnings growth could mean the bumper rise in the amount paid from April 2022. Rishi Sunak told the BBC a decision on pensions would be ""based on fairness for pensioners and for taxpayers"". Various commentators have called for an overhaul of the rules. However, groups representing older people say the government's promises to pensioners should remain. Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The triple lock is government policy but I recognise people's concerns about what that might mean, given some of the numbers that are being put around.""We will approach these decisions with fairness in mind - fairness for both pensioners but also for taxpayers.""He said there were ""some questions around the earnings numbers"". The rise in pensions each year is governed by what is known as the triple lock - a Conservative manifesto promise until at least 2024. This means the state pension increases in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever of those three is highest. Predictions by the Bank of England suggest that average earnings could go up by 8%, hence the equivalent rise in the state pension. That would cost the Treasury £3bn more than previously anticipated, according to the government's official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility. Many economists point out the sharp rise in earnings is an anomaly created, in part, by calculations being affected by people coming off furlough. There is no reason in law why the chancellor cannot change the way earnings are judged in the triple lock system. He is certainly under pressure to do some from some quarters. Lord David Willetts, president of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, said: ""The Covid crisis has laid bare the design faults of the triple lock, with a severe jobs crisis last year inadvertently contributing to an unnecessary and unjustified 8% rise in the state pension next year.""The chancellor should take the opportunity this autumn to replace the triple lock with a smoothed earnings link. This would mean the state pension would rise in line with the living standards of working age people - a change that would be fair to all generations.""However, Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""We do not think the government should rush headlong towards a decision to suspend it. Pensioner poverty has been rising in recent years.""While older people we speak to are generally keen to do their bit to help as the pandemic continues, they are also wary of unscrupulous policymakers who might want use exceptional times as a reason to make permanent changes - a government sleight of hand that would not be acceptable at all.""The chancellor said that he would hold ""fairness in mind"" for any decision that it is made, but fairness can be hard to quantify. At present:That is one of the least generous state pensions in Europe, even if there was a significant rise next year. The former pensions minister, Baroness Ros Altmann, also pointed out that, for many people, the state pension was their only retirement income.""Millions of pensioners - especially women - rely solely on state pensions because they did not have the opportunity to build up private pensions when younger,"" she said. She has called for a wholesale review of pensioner benefits, rather than a short-term change in the rules. Other considerations of ""fairness"" might also include the wide range of life expectancy in different parts of the country, the different rules determining the rise in Pension Credit - a state pension top-up, and the expectations of younger people about their eventual state pension entitlement. At a time when the official recommendation for the main NHS pay award is well below inflation, a rise of 8% for the state pension would appear to be an outlier. The chancellor's comments this morning are the clearest indication that it will not happen. To be clear, it is very much a distortion. Average earnings were depressed in the pandemic by a reduction in hours worked. The official figures showed earnings were falling. From this lower base, the resumption of normality will lead to a very high number, when comparing one quarter this year to the same quarter in 2020 during lockdown. But this also reflects the design of the triple lock. As the OBR put it, ""it has no memory"". The point of the lock was, last year, to deliver a 2.5% rise in pensions this year, despite earnings being -1% and inflation being just 0.5%. The state pension was shielded from what was happening everywhere else in the economy last year. But its current design disregards that history and will lead to a compensatory bumper boost, if it is measured as in the past (growth in the quarter to July over same quarter last year), although we won't get the figures until autumn.

And the leftists they most wanted to purge at the time (with the possible exception of Ralph Nader) were Jesse Jackson and his multi-ethnic, working-class Rainbow Coalition. Instead of embracing the promise of Jackson’s remarkable movement, they moved to crush it, so that they could transform the party into a hospitable receptacle for Wall Street money.+ If there’s anything that lends a fractal of credence to Trump’s voter fraud conspiracy it’s that Biden appears to have won, while the Dems failed to take the Senate and nearly lost the House. How bad do candidates have to be for people to vote for Biden & not them? Plenty bad, mon, plenty bad…+ If the senate ends up in a 50/50 split after the Georgia runoffs, Joe Manchin is the most likely Democratic senator to bolt to the Republicans.

Biden’s probably read The Prince twice, yet shows scant evidence of even the vaguest understanding the book’s most basic political messages.+ Isn’t the only rationale for Kamala Harris that in moments like this she can play the role of a legal hard-ass? Yet, as Trump, Barr and McConnell move on different fronts to delegitimize the election, she’s MIA.

Who would join their movement? We should cheer the fall of all rulers of the empire, knowing that what comes after is likely to be the same shit, reconstituted. I think of the poor of Paris celebrating the dismantling of the Bastille, knowing the government would fall into the hands of lawyers and reformist aristocrats, like the Marquis de Lafayette who would later gun down some of the same peasants protesting two years later on the Champs de Mars the lack of fulfillment of the promises of the Revolution. Two years after the massacre, the monarchy had been overturned and the king was dead. (Lafayfette’s treachery is vividly depicted in the 2018 French film One Nation, One King, directed by Pierre Schoeller, now available on Amazon Prime.) Yet another reason to rename Lafayette Park.+ So Biden found his new Neil Kinnock after all, excepthistorian Jon Meacham, unlike Kinnock, is a one-man cliché factory. Is there any phrase more hackneyed and less meaningful than “the soul of America”? How much did the Biden campaign pay Meacham to insert “soul of America” four or five times into every Biden speech? As stale platitudes go, the sell-by date on that one expired 150 years ago and even then Mark Twain would have had rich sport illustrating just how moronic it is.+ Tolstoy: “Historians are like deaf people who go on answering questions that no one has asked them.”+ Biden’s share of the popular vote (50.8%) now exceeds Reagan’s share (50.7%) in defeating Carter in 1980.+ If the purpose of Trump’s refusal to concede the election is to bring the current American electoral system into further public disrepute, then I say, “Good luck.” If it’s merely to troll liberals, then I say, “Godspeed.”+ “What we have seen in the last week from the president more closely resembles the tactics of the kind of authoritarian leaders we follow,” says ⁦Michael J.

292,Trump’s Unexpected Power Helps Republicans Win Even If He Doesn’t,-18.33,39.83,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/11/04/trumps-unexpected-power-helps-republicans-win-even-if-he-doesnt/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"The news is this: Everything has changed and nothing has changed. In his upset victory four years ago, Donald Trump plowed through the nation’s political terrain. He tapped into deep-seated rage and anguish among a large swath of Americans that the establishment of both parties had failed to recognize, let alone address. Since then, Trump has changed Washington, not by “draining the swamp” as he promised, but by taking over the Republican Party, by turning GOP lawmakers into rubber stamps and squelching or crushing them if they didn’t comply. Few put up a fight, and the reason became clear this week: Trump is good for them. Not just for their policy goals, such as cutting taxes and packing federal courts with conservatives, though that is undeniable. But for the lawmakers themselves. He is particularly good for those who cling to him. Take Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Graham harshly criticized Trump – and briefly ran against him — in 2016. But the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee now embraces Trump, and Tuesday, he trounced a Democrat who had polled strongly in recent weeks. Likewise, Sen. Thom Tillis once earned Trump’s wrath by offering a bill to prevent the administration from firing the special counsel in the Russia investigation. After that, he cleaved to the president and appears to have survived a close reelection contest in North Carolina. Republican senators who chided the president, including Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, found it easier to leave the chamber than face brutal MAGA-fueled primaries. Members of Congress who took shots at Trump, such as Barbara Comstock of Virginia or Carlos Curbelo of Florida, lost their seats in 2018. When Trump’s name is on the top of the ballot, Republicans down the line do better. It feels strange to write that sentence since Trump himself might lose the presidency in this nail-biter of an election. But it remains true that both times he topped the ticket, Republicans down the ballot out-performed expectations. This year, they appear poised to gain seats in the House – an unwelcome surprise to the reigning Democrats – and to retain control of the Senate, which few expected. Compare that to 2018, when Trump was not running for office and Democrats gained an astounding 40 seats to take control of the House. And while the party of the incumbent president often sheds congressional seats in midterm elections, the numbers generally are less mind-boggling than they were two years ago. Throughout 2020, Democrats had hoped for a “blue wave” reminiscent of 2018, but this time with an even loftier goal: control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. They adhered to the belief that a big turnout, in and of itself, would be good for the people’s party. They also longed to flip some statehouses in time for this decade’s redistricting. That didn’t happen. Currently, Republicans control both chambers in 29 state legislatures, and Democrats control both chambers in 19. Minnesota is the only statehouse in which each party controls one chamber, and Nebraska’s legislature is nonpartisan. As of Wednesday afternoon, the National Conference of State Legislatures said few changes were in the offing, and none had been called. In fact, the conference reported, this year could see the smallest number of changes in legislative control since 1944, when four chambers switched hands. Further, partisan control will shift in only one governor’s mansion; Montana elected Republican Greg Gianforte to fill the position vacated by Democrat Steve Bullock, who lost his bid for the Senate. Gianforte may best be known nationally for slugging a reporter. So it remains conceivable that Trump will have led just about everyone in his party to win – except perhaps himself. But Trump did something else, too. He has kept the rage alive. His cult of personality has generated countless diehards who question nothing their leader says, no matter how divorced from reality. Conversely, Trump’s affronts to tradition, decorum, and, often, civility have enraged others who not only don’t understand his appeal but are revolted by it. The result is that the nation remains at least as divided in 2020 as it was in 2016. The too-close-to-call election has assured that win or lose, Trump will continue to stoke that division, to demand the spotlight, to foment and employ that rage. A few weeks ago, many political observers were asking if Trumpism would outlast Trump. That’s not the question anymore. Trump is going to be a behemoth on the national landscape, inside the White House or out. The ranks of his supporters, in this year of high turnout, have grown since 2016. They stuck with him through impeachment, the pandemic, the turned-down economy. They are the foot soldiers of Trumpism and are likely to remain so. Their MAGA hats will not suddenly vanish. As the ballot counters forged ahead Wednesday afternoon, former Vice President Joe Biden took to the microphones in Delaware and attempted to set a more calibrated tone for the nation he still expected to lead.“It’s time for us to do what we have always done as Americans – to put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us…To unite, to heal, to come together as a nation,” Biden said. Earlier Wednesday morning, Trump audaciously tried to declare victory, threatening to ask the Supreme Court to put a stop to vote counting. His false proclamation – “Frankly, we did win this election” – served only to further divide the nation. The rage had not subsided. Everything might change. And nothing.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0861690602166792,0.4706525573192239,1202,1,Washington Monthly

S. Viral images of border patrol agents on horseback pursuing Haitian illegal immigrants spurred liberal outrage when many observers—including the entire Democrat-Media Complex—mistook split reins for whips. The controversy began with the emergence of images showing agents on horseback blocking Haitian migrants from entering the U. S. in a Del Rio riverine, and in one case grabbing onto a migrant’s shirt. However, some media outlets and Democratic lawmakers misidentified the agents’ split reins, which they use to control the horse, as “whips” and accused the agents of whipping the migrants. Some outlets later qualified their description as “whip-like cords” but many Democrats forged ahead with the claim.

Other Border Patrol sources told Fox News that agents “will spin or twirl their reins in order to move the horse forward as a signal to the horse.”Another Border Patrol source told Townhall that agents on horseback move their reins for a lot of different reasons.“Primarily it’s used to steer the horse, but agents will also spin them sometimes to deter people from getting too close to the horse,” he explained. “If they get too close, the horse can step on them, breaking bones or causing other injuries. Agents also need to maintain control of their reins so they don’t lose control of the horse, which can cause injuries to immigrants, the agents, and the horses.”The source said, “we are not aware of anyone being struck with the reins.”Fox News reporter Bill Melugin explained how the reins flop around while agents are riding. The narrative that mounted Border Patrol agents were whipping migrants is false. They do not have whips. They have split reins to control the horse. They are long & have slack, & flop around while riding. They sometimes spin them like a propeller to signal horse to move forward.pic.twitter.com/oM9KzNZkKA— Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA)September 23, 2021No images have emerged showing Haitians being hit by the reins. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas initially supported the agents, but changed his stance amid the harsh condemnation from the White House and left-wing Democrats. It appears the administration recognized an opportunity to pander to a core constituency, so pander it did. Mayorkas told a House Committee that the agents had been taken off the frontlines amid an investigation that he expected to take days, rather than weeks.“I was horrified by what I saw,” Mayorkas told CNN. “I’m going to let the investigation run its course. But the pictures that I observed troubled me profoundly. That defies all of the values that we seek to instill in our people.”White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday harshly criticized the Border Patrol agents. alleging that they used “brutal tactics” against illegal Haitians. Kamala Harris jumped on the bandwagon on Tuesday, claiming to be “deeply troubled” by the images.“What I saw depicted about those individuals on horseback treating human beings the way they were, was horrible,” Harris told reporters. “And I fully support what is happening right now, which is a thorough investigation into exactly what is going on there. But human beings should never be treated that way. And I’m deeply troubled about it. And I’ll also be talking to Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas about it today.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer decried “images of inhumane treatment of Haitian migrants by Border Patrol—including the use of whips.”During Thursday’s press briefing, Psaki said that it was important to “convey” that the images are “horrible and horrific” and that an investigation is ongoing.“I can also convey to you that [DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas] also conveyed to civil rights leaders earlier this morning that we would no longer be using horses in Del Rio,” she said.👀 Based on a debunked, false narrative about mounted Border Patrol agents supposedly using whips on illegal aliens, Psaki says agents are now banned from using horses in#DelRio.

In fact, Van Duyne’s win was so huge that GOP strategists have even dubbed her seat as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s “most bitter loss.”Last month, Van Duyne was elected to represent Texas’ 24th District covering Dallas-Fort Worth, making her only the second Republican woman from Texas ever to be elected to the House of Representatives.“The results of this race proved the people of North Texas want a representative who will go to Washington to get things done, and that’s exactly what I’m going to do,” Van Duyne toldFox News. “As a single mother and a businesswoman, I’m ready to fight to empower working families, expand job opportunities, and deliver more options for people to have affordable, personalized health care.”Van Duyne beat her Democrat opponent, Candace Valenzuela, in a very tight race, winning with 166,363 votes – or 48.8% – to Valenzuela’s 163,326, or 47.5%. This seat had been held by GOP Rep. Kenny Marchant since 2005, and Pelosi and her fellow Democrats saw it as a prime opportunity to pick up an open seat with. his retirement.“Pelosi, Democrat leadership, and numerous liberal, attack organizations went all-in to assault Beth Van Duyne, spending over $14 million and making TX-24 the most expensive open seat race in the country,” said a Texas GOP strategist. “They completely believed they were going to win.”“Pelosi’s failure in this North Texas suburban district – that Joe Biden won – may well be her most bitter loss,” the strategist added. Pelosi, however, has tried to put on a brave face and refused to acknowledge her failings in this election cycle.“We lost a few seats,” Pelosi said after the election. “But as I said, we won those seats in Trump districts. He wasn’t on the ballot [in 2018], he is now. I do believe with Biden in the White House and a Democratic Congress and hopefully a Democratic Senate – we’ll see in January – we’ll be able to do great things for the American people.”Republican lawmakers are already expressing their excitement at having Van Duyne onboard.“Beth was an incredible mayor of Irving, Texas, who knows what it takes to grow our economy and keep our streets safe,” said House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). “Her victory in November means our Republican conference will be even stronger.”Who do you think would win the Presidency?“She’ll be an invaluable member of our team because she will always fight to restore our way of life, rebuild the greatest economy in history, and renew the American Dream,” he added.",2,Generally Reliable,0.2546092796092796,0.4622405372405371,652,0,LifeZette
295,Dems renew questions about FBI background check of Kavanaugh,-0.33,45.67,https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-acd4945bda57be8c1d1c9ac43398b5f7,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Democrats are raising new concerns about the thoroughness of the FBI’s background investigation ofSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaughafter the FBI revealed that it had received thousands of tips and had provided “all relevant” ones to the White House counsel’s office. The FBI, responding to longstanding questions from Democrats, disclosed in a letter late last month that it had received more than 4,500 tips as it investigated the nominee’s past following his 2018 nomination by President Donald Trump. The process was the first time that the FBI had set up a tip line for a nominee undergoing Senate confirmation, said an assistant FBI director, Jill Tyson, writing on behalf of Director Christopher Wray. A group of Democratic senators said in a letter to Wray dated Wednesday that his response “raises significant additional questions.” They called on him to explain, among other things, how many tips the FBI decided were relevant and what criteria agents used to make that determination and what policies and procedures were used to vet the tips. The senators also asked for more information about the tip line, including how it was staffed and how the tips were recorded or preserved.“Your letter confirms that the FBI’s tip line was a departure from past practice and that the FBI was politically constrained by the Trump White House,” the senators wrote. Kavanaughwas confirmed to the Supreme Court in October 2018after a rancorous process in which claims emerged that he had sexually assaulted women three decades ago. He emphatically denied the allegations. The FBI conducted a original background investigation into Kavanaugh that consisted of interviews with 49 people over the course of five days, Wray said. The bureau then did a supplemental background check after new information arose about a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that Kavanaugh had assaulted her when they were teens. As part of that process, Wray said, the FBI interviewed 10 people over six days. But, he stressed, the inquiry was limited in nature, without the “authorities, policies and procedures” that would be used for an FBI criminal investigation. Lawyers for Ford said in a statement that the FBI’s letter established that the investigation was a “sham and a major institutional failure” and chastised the bureau for not interviewing Ford or acting on the thousands of tips it received about Kavanaugh.“Instead, it handed the information over to the White House, allowing those who supported Kavanaugh to falsely claim that the FBI found no wrongdoing,” said the lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks.

But the president still supports raising corporate taxes to cover other parts of his agenda, the White House said. Biden's latest infrastructure counteroffer, proposed to Republican senators this week, would keep intactPresident Donald Trump's2017 tax cuts that they oppose unwinding, calling ita ""red line"" in their negotiations with the White House. The tweaked proposal would no longer raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, relying on other funding components of Biden's American Jobs Plan: beefing up tax enforcement on the country's wealthiest earners and ensuring the largest corporations – some of which have avoided paying any taxes because of loopholes – pay at least a minimum of 15%.""This should be completely acceptable to a number of Republicans who have said that their bottom line is they want to keep the 2017 tax law untouched,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday. Psaki made clear that Biden has not abandoned his push to increase the corporate tax rate to pay for proposalssuch as a $1.8 trillion families planthat includes subsidized child care and national prekindergarten.""What the president believes is that corporations can afford to pay a little bit more,"" Psaki said. ""And that's a way we can pay for a range of the bold proposals that he has put forward.""Biden, GOP at odds over 'social infrastructure' as White House signals it wants deal soonBiden's offer,first reported by The Washington Post, was made during a private one-on-one meeting Wednesday with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W. Va., the lead negotiator for a group of six Republicans seeking a deal on infrastructure with the White House. The conversation in the Oval Office lasted nearly an hour. Biden, who is visiting Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Thursday, and Capito said they plan to regroup Friday. Biden signaled he wants at least $1 trillion in spending on infrastructure in addition to $400 billion in baseline spending already approved for infrastructure needs. Capito's Senate office declined to comment on the president's offer. Biden reduced the cost of his American Jobs Plan to $1.7 trillion from $2.25 trillion last month to get closer to an amount Republicans could support. In their counterproposal last week, Republicans upped their offer to $928 billion from $568 billion. Their proposal contains $290 billion on top of baseline funds. Psaki did not say whether Biden is willing to go below $1 trillion. ""We're going to keep optionality on the table,and we'll see how the conversation goes tomorrow,"" she said.4 charts break down how far apart they areRepublicans proposed repurposing COVID-19 rescue funds already approved and user fees to pay for infrastructure – ideas the Biden administration immediately rejected. Republicans said they are willing to pay for only physical infrastructure such as repairs to roads, bridges and airports, as well as broadband expansion. In addition to traditional infrastructure, Biden has stayed committed to ""social infrastructure"" – opposed by Republicans – such as $400 billion proposed to overhaul caregiving for the elderly and people with disabilities. The White House also expressed concerns that the GOP counteroffer has little or no funding for fixing Veterans Affairs hospitals, rail and transit systems, replacing the nation's lead pipes and investing in clean energy jobs. Democrats grow restless with Biden's infrastructure talks as Republicans float next counterofferNext week, when Congress is to return after a weeklong recess, is emerging as a key moment in infrastructure negotiations between Biden and Republicans that have dragged on for weeks. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will begin drafting legislation Wednesday for surface roadway funding that could complement Biden's proposal. Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN on Sunday ""the negotiations can’t go on forever,"" and White House officials hope to produce a ""clear direction"" on a bipartisan package next week. Psaki called next week ""an important moment in the timeline,"" noting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y., have said they want to approve infrastructure legislation by the summer. Psaki stopped short of calling next week a deadline to reach a deal.""We're not here to set new deadlines,"" Psaki said. ""Certainly the president is not going to accept a deal that doesn't help create millions of jobs and make a historic investment in our nation's infrastructure.""",3,Reliable,0.0488707225314368,0.3148700010307153,1029,3,USA Today

C., a rumor spread on the internet about the role being played by the U. S. Marines. According to an article in far-right media outlet,Real Raw News,Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U. S. Marines, “rebuked” U. S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she “beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power,” and prevent a repeat of the mob attack on the Capitol Jan. 6. According to the article, he purportedly told her:Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country? [...] I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it [...] If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you. We reached out to the Marines press office, and its spokesperson, Capt. Joseph Butterfield, told us: “It is unequivocally inaccurate. The situation and conversation laid out in this article never took place and is entirely false.”In amemosent to all members of the armed forces, the joint chiefs of staff, including Berger, reminded all military personnel of their duty to uphold the Constitution and reaffirmed that Biden will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. They denounced the attack on the Capitol, saying:We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection. As Service Members, we must embody the values and ideals of the Nation. We support and defend the Constitution. Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law.

The mandate that doctors perform gender-transition surgeries upon the referral of a mental health professional—despite objections that the doctor may have to the procedure—dates back to the Obama administration. On Tuesday evening, Judge Peter Welte of the Eastern District of North Dakota granted Catholic groups that challenged the mandate permanent injunctive relief from having to provide or cover gender-transition procedures. Luke Goodrich, VP and senior counsel at Becket, which represented the plaintiffs,calledthe decision a “Major victory for #ReligiousFreedom.”A coalition of Catholic organizations representing hospitals, doctors, and clinics, joined in part by the state of North Dakota, had challenged the mandate in court. The Catholic groups alleged that the mandate required them to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender-transition surgeries and abortions, against their conscientious objections. Four Catholic groups under the Religious Sisters of Mercy, along with the Catholic Benefits Association and the state of North Dakota, brought the lawsuit. Members of the Catholic groups “joyfully serve ALL patients regardless of sex or gender identity. They routinely provide top-notch care to transgender patients for everything from cancer to the common cold,” Goodrich tweeted. “They also provide millions of dollars in free and low-cost care to the elderly, poor, and underserved rural areas.”While he granted the Catholic groups an injunction on the mandate’s requirement of gender-transition surgery and coverage, Judge Welte dismissed their abortion-related claims.“The Court DECLARES that HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 that requires the Catholic Plaintiffs to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures violates their sincerely held religious beliefs without satisfying strict scrutiny under the RFRA,” Welte wrote. The court is the second federal court to rule against the mandate. In Oct., 2019, Judge Reed O’Connor of the North District of Texas struck down the mandate after doctors had sued, alleging violations of conscience.“Today’s ruling protects patients, aligns with current medical research, and ensures doctors aren’t forced to violate their religious beliefs and medical judgment,” Goodrich stated. “This is a victory for common-sense, conscience, and sound medical judgment.”The mandate, issued in 2016, stemmed from the Obama administration’s interpretation of Sec. 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits discrimination in health care in a number of areas. The administration interpreted it to include protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and issued its requirement of doctors not to refuse gender-transition surgery referrals.",3,Reliable,0.0338643790849673,0.3165032679738562,579,2,National Catholic Register

In the end, a draft copy of the company’s report leaked Thursday concluded that the official vote count conducted by Maricopa County was correct. In fact, the so-called audit found that former President Donald Trump had lost by an even bigger margin than in the official count. Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based company with no prior experience conducting election recounts, have claimed that its six-month-long recount of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County was the “​​most comprehensive and complex election audit ever conducted.” Trump and his allies have long believed it would finally prove their claims that the 2020 election was stolen by Joe Biden. The GOP-led Maricopa County election board, who haveslammed the recount as a sham, received a copy of the draft report on Wednesday from an unknown source, and on Thursday tweeted: “The draft report from Cyber Ninjas confirms the county’s canvass of the 2020 General Election was accurate and the candidates certified as the winners did, in fact, win.”The authenticity of the draft, which was reviewed by VICE News, was also confirmed by audit spokesperson Randy Pullen.“It's not the final report, but it's close,” Pullen told local radio station KJZZ on Thursday evening, adding: “Was there massive fraud or anything?It doesn’t look like it.”The leak came 24 hours before the people conducting the vote review are scheduled to appear before the Arizona State Senate and present their findings. The 110-page draft report is made up of three volumes—Executive Summary & Recommendations, Methodology & Operation, and Results. The results section shows that the hand recount found President Joe Biden won the county, receiving 45,469 more votes than Trump. The official county results showed he won by 45,109. The Cyber Ninjas report draft shows that President Joe Biden won Maricopa County in Arizona by even more votes that the official figures show. Despite Biden’s clear victory, the report never explicitly says he won the election. Instead, it gives a long list of alleged discrepancies in voting-machine software and voter locations, and makes claims that people voted in multiple counties. These claims will likely be the focus among those who are hoping the Maricopa County audit will turn up some smoking gun to prove widespread vote rigging and fraud during the 2020 election.“The tabulation equipment counted the ballots as they were designed to do, and the results reflect the will of the voters,” Maricopa County Board Chairman Jack Sellers wrote in a statement published Thursday night. “That should be the end of the story. Everything else is just noise.”However, Pullen cautioned that some of the evidence that will be presented on Friday has not yet been leaked, and will highlight significant “anomalies” in voting records that could cast doubt on the final vote count. (Still, no evidence has been produced to show this, and all previous audits in the county don’t show any signs of widespread voter fraud.)On Friday morning, Trump called the findings in the report “huge” and claimed the media was trying to “call it” again for Biden “before actually looking at the facts—just like they did in November.”Trump also said the “audit has uncovered significant and undeniable evidence of fraud,” even though the draft report says virtually the opposite. Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, who authorized the recount and has been one of its biggest supporters, hit out at the media in a statement issued hours before the presentation.“It’s been a painstaking process with all the lawsuits filed, lack of cooperation from Maricopa County, and the constant biased ‘reporting’ from the liberal media and Democratic organizations,” Fann said. “We believe they have tried everything to stop this audit and mislead the public.”But Fann added that Friday’s report publication was not necessarily the end of the road for the bogus audit, hinting that more lawsuits and subpoenas could be filed down the road. “The Senate did not give up any of our rights to continue pursuing the truth or additional data needed in the future. We still hold the right to issue new subpoenas at any time.”Wendy Rogers, an Arizona senator who has also embraced wild conspiracy theories about the election, tweeted on Thursday night that the leaked report did not give the whole picture. The recount began in late March and quickly became ground zero for election fraud conspiracy theorists who were spreading the Big Lie that the election was somehow stolen from Trump. In fact Trump himself reportedly became obsessed with theaudit’s findingsbelieving it would trigger a process that somehow saw him return to the White House. The Arizona Senate awarded the audit contract to Cyber Ninjas, the company led by Logan, a man who had voiced election fraud conspiracies on social media and has close links to thosepushing the conspiracy that the 2020 election was rigged. Cyber Ninjas embraced wild conspiracy theories during the recount, including one claiming thatboxes stuffed with fake ballots were flown from Asiaon the night of the election and dumped in Phoenix.“This partisan effort in Arizona appears to be ending the same as it begun—highly biased, incompetent individuals running the process, delay after delay after delay, and very importantly, completely untransparent,” David Becker, founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told reporters during a call Thursday. The Arizona audit quickly became ground zero for the effort to undermine the results of the 2020 election as well as pass voter suppression legislation in states across the country. Dozens of Republican lawmakers toured the recount centerwith the explicit aim of conducting similar recounts in their states. But even as the audit comes slowly to an end, the damage it has done is palpable. Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania and Georgia are already pushing for forensic audits in their states, and on Thursday night, at the same time as the draft report was leaked, the Texas secretary of state’s office said it has begun a“full forensic audit” of the 2020 general electionin Collin, Dallas, Harris, and Tarrant counties. The agency did not explain what prompted the move, but it came just hours after Trump, who won the state in last year’s election,asked Gov. Greg Abbott to add an election audit billto the state legislature’s third special session agenda. But so far, just like Arizona, no evidence has been produced to show the 2020 election was rigged.“Every time Trump and his supporters have been given a forum to make their case, they have swung and missed,” Ben Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer and vocal critic of Trump, told reporters on Thursday. ”If Trump and his supporters can’t prove [election fraud in Arizona], then they can’t prove it anywhere.”",3,Reliable,0.058841246936485,0.4429985799033417,1472,3,Vice

Thatincluded Janet Hubert, who played the original Aunt Viv on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” whose response rounded out the other side of Black feelings on the matter: “Phylicia what are you thinking!!!""Unfortunately, Rashad’s thinking appears to mirror a swath of the African American community who think justice was done on Wednesday. Cosby’s sentence being overturned is atragedy for the women he allegedly sexually abused— but it is also in a sense tragic for the people who continue to support him blindly. Like her, their reputations suffer in their continued support of an alleged predator without remorse, clinging to the version of Black success Cosby marketed. In their mind, Cosby is a symbol of respectability politics in the African American community. For those who continue to support him because he oncetold listeners to pull their pants up, let me clue you in: He really doesn’t like us. We are a means to an end. We exist in his imaginary morality play of his life, there to joke about, abuse and deride. He looks to us to provide the support and cover that he, as a former convicted sexual abuser, should not receive. This may sound harsh, considering Cosby was amajor philanthropist to African American schools and causes. But I submit his continual gaslightingproclaiming his innocenceand hisinfamous ""Pound Cake"" speechsuggest otherwise. Cosby’s scam was drugging the African American community into thinking he was a paragon of respectability and moral behavior, all while allegedly drugging and sexually abusing women. Vilifying young Black men in the community seems to have been just one more cruel thrill for him. Respectability requires acquiescence to societal norms, many of which are carved out of racism and abuse. Cosby promoted those moral norms as a part of his persona, developed and honed during his time on “The Cosby Show.” Regarded as a moral force, his philanthropy and moral screeds were just an extension of the character of Cliff Huxtable. But as we all know, art does not necessarily imitate life. UntilHannibal Buress called outCosby in his comedy act, people whispered or spoke about his alleged abuse either by blaming it on women who went to his home or that they “knew what was going to happen to them.” It was an open secret. Cosby himselfsaid drugs and fame helped him seduce women. For the Black community, I hope it creates a discussion about how the norms of respectability can damage people. Respectability requires acquiescence to societal norms, many of which are carved out of racism and abuse. Cosby’s role as actor, comedian and philanthropist blinded many in our community to the fact that he was also allegedly abusing women. Because he became the paragon of a successful Black man, supporting his family both on and off screen, many looked to him as proof that Black people in America were worthy of respect and adoration. But fame alone didn’t make the community embrace Cosby despite his failings as a moral actor and human being. Racismplays a part in this as well. The history of white women’s roles infalsely accusing Black men of rapealso plays a role in this tale. For many African Americans, the white women who accused Cosby were lying; they remember thehistory of Black men being lynchedbecause of false accusations. When the New York magazine coverfeaturing 35 women who accused Cosby of rape or sexual assault came out, it was a revelation to many that Black women were included among them. Which brings me to my last, and important point: The Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturning Cosby's conviction is a blow to all sexual abuse survivors but especially for Black women. Black women are more likely to underreport, despite the fact that18 percent of Black women will undergo a sexual assaultin their lifetime. High-profile recent cases such asR. Kelly’s arrestafter the release of asix-part series on Lifetimeabout his decadeslong alleged abuse of women or allegations against Russell Simmons in the movie ""On the Record"" detail how Black women are sexually abused as well by rich and famous Black men. Yet there are some in our community who are still willing to let Black girls and women shoulder the blame for the transgressions of men. Disgusting. So while Phylicia Rashad and scores of other Black people arehappy that Cosby is out, I am not. There is no middle ground for rapists of any color, creed or sex. They are predators, they are anathema, they are unfit for praise. While the legal system may have freed Cosby, he is forever branded in my mind and the minds of millions of others. He is unfit for praise. He is unfit for polite or impolite company. And no one — no one — should ever consider him America’s Dad again.

Poll shows Texans’ skepticism over COVID vaccine, state economy",1.33,40.67,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2021/01/28/bleak-future-for-texas-poll-reveals-texans-skepticism-over-covid-vaccine-state-economy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-28,25,"AUSTIN — A new poll conducted by Texas Lyceum not only revealed Texans’ worst views on the state economy since the Great Recession, but also found that roughly half of Texas adults say they either won’t get vaccinated (26%) or have not decided (24%) if they will take the vaccine when it is made widely availableOf the other half of the respondents, 45% said they would take the vaccine and only 5% said they have already been vaccinated. Fifty-five percent (55%) of Hispanic respondents, 50% of white respondents and 46% of Black respondents said they were concerned about the COVID vaccine, and 39% of Hispanics, 29% of Black respondents and 26% of white respondents voiced their concern over vaccines in general. Nearly 80% of Texans said they know somebody who has tested positive for COVID and nearly half (47%) said they know somebody who has died from the virus. Joshua Blank, a research director for Texas Lyceum, highlighted that while 40% of respondents said they have “a lot” of confidence in healthcare providers’ ability to operate safely during the pandemic, that certainly wasn’t the case for other businesses. No other businesses, including grocery stores, churches, public schools, local merchants and airports, received “a lot” of confidence from more than a quarter of Texans. Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond. “This really is the challenge for not only government and public health officials, but for businesses too,” Blank said during a zoom presser. “... If after 10 months, knowing what we know now, people still don’t have a lot of confidence in the ability to patronize a business safely, well the only solution is a vaccine. And what we’re seeing is that half of Texas is not sure if they’re getting a vaccine and they’re concerned about the safety of it.”Blank added that this is something that every level of government, businesses and “really anyone who’s willing” needs to begin getting this message out if Texans want the state to have a strong recovery from the pandemic. Texas Lyceum is a nonprofit and nonpartisan Texas organization that conducts an annual poll in order to better understand public opinion. The survey polled 1,200 adults in the state from Jan. 8-17, 1,000 of which were contacted by live interviews over the phone. They also conducted an additional 200 online interviews of unregistered adults. Out of the 1,200 respondents, 835 self reported as registered voters. Immigration and border security were the state’s top concerns in 2020, but fell out of the top five in 2021 as the pandemic, political disruption, health care, the economy and unemployment rounded out the top five problems facing Texas, according to the survey. When it comes to both the national and state economy, the survey found that this is something Texans’ outlook is undoubtedly bleak on. Only 24% of respondents said they believe the state economy is better off than the national economy compared to 40% of Texans who said the national economy is in a better place than Texas’. Daron Shaw, the founder of the poll, pointed out that these numbers are a dramatic change from the poll’s findings in the midst of the Great Recession.“If you go back to 2009 at the height of the last great recession, 64% of respondents said that they felt the Texas economy was better off than the national economy,” Shaw said. “So for me, the standout result from this poll is that Josh and I refer to the bullishness that Texans have with respect to how Texas is handling things.”That bullishness is not quite as evident now in response to the pandemic and the economic consequences of the pandemic as it was back in 2009, Shaw said. Additionally, only 15% said their family’s economic standing has improved over the previous year and just 34% of Texans believe their children will be better off economically in the future than they are currently. When broken down by race, the poll showed that Hispanics (60%) were more likely to know somebody who has died from COVID than white (41%) and Black (40%) respondents. When it comes to confidence regarding job status, 57% of white Texans said they are very confident that they will be employed at the end of the year, though that number dropped to 42% for Hispanic Texans and 36% for Black Texans. Additional challenges for Texans with children under the age of 18 were also revealed in the survey. Aside from the increase in caregiving responsibilities, Texas caregivers also face the conundrum of whether or not to send children to school during the pandemic. Only 32% of adults with children at home said they feel safe sending their kids to school, 21% lower than parents who said they don’t feel safe doing so. White caregivers (44%) felt the safest in sending children to school, compared to 27% of Black caregivers and 23% of Hispanic caregivers. The overall margin of error on the survey is +/- 2.83 %",3,Reliable,0.1031820436507936,0.4393650793650792,1092,3,Dallas Morning News
306,Big Pharma: There’s No Easy Way Out of the Vaccine Crisis We Created,-21.33,33.33,https://newrepublic.com/article/162325/biden-vaccine-patents-wto-pfizer-stock,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"On Wednesday, after months of growing pressure from progressive activists and governments around the world, the Biden administration announced that it wouldsupportWorld Trade Organization–centered efforts to waive intellectual property protections on Covid-19 vaccines. This seemingly small bureaucraticgesturecarries an enormous potential impact, as it could help other countries manufacture their own stockpiles of Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccines. (What has been demanded is a TRIPS waiver, essentially a removal ofintellectual property rightson the underlying vaccine recipe. The exact terms of the waiver will take time to negotiate, leaving the contours of the final deal somewhat uncertain.)But what should have seemed like unvarnished good news—a tenuous triumph of people over intellectual property—in a time of ongoing global crisis has been spun by many talking heads and industry power players as somehow not in the public interest. (The market reacted by briefly cratering.) They warned: It’ll take too long, American companies will lose money, there will be a loss in innovation, the production process is too complicated for other countries to replicate, we’re giving away U. S. know-how and technology to our foreign adversaries—the criticisms are as plentiful as the undisclosed conflicts of interest from the people spouting them on TV.“This change in longstanding American policy will not save lives,” Stephen Ubl, the president and CEO of industry lobbying group PhRMA, toldBloomberg. “This decision does nothing to address the real challenges to getting more shots in arms, including last-mile distribution and limited availability of raw materials.”“We must pursue real public health solutions for the present,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as Food and Drug Commissioner under President Trump. A Pfizer board member (his pinned tweet is about the “game change” of Pfizer’s vaccine trials), Gottlieb took a nationalist-corporatist line,tweeting: “The Biden Administration is giving away American IP. China has long wanted to weaken TRIPs. But why isn’t the Biden Administration giving away more of the growing stockpile of U. S. vaccines? Over the next 18 months, U. S. companies will produce more than 12 billion doses.”The evasive whataboutism of Gottlieb’s argument ignores the obvious: This is an unmitigated Good Thing, one that happens to advance U. S. interests by protecting public health and getting global commerce and travel back in motion. It’s also one of a number of helpful, ethically informed actions the administration could take, including distributing the country’s stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines abroad. (For the true practitioners of realpolitik, America’s health care diplomacy might also represent a better form of soft power than our typically militarized foreign policy, and it would allow us to compete with China’s and Russia’s ownvaccine diplomacy.)Waiving patent protections on these essential vaccines isbeyond overdue—it’s easy to overlook that we’re more than 15 months into a pandemic that should have provoked immediate, emergency reforms in health care policy, from providing free government-provisioned care to making sure that new treatments and vaccines would be shared widely around the world. The pandemic has clarified the public’s understanding of our broken health care infrastructure and the system’s fundamental inequities, but our political leaders, captive to private interests and inherited ideologies about a for-profit health care system, have been reluctant to do what’s needed. That includes promoting human life above pharmaceutical company profits (whichremain ample, even in these straitened times). In other words, the warnings that there’s no quick fix to the global vaccine crisis are coming from the people who created the vaccine crisis. These are the same people, like self-appointed public health czarBill Gates, who have powerfully supported the prevailing corporate-friendly intellectual property regime, leading us far astray from the World Health Organization’s initial utopian-minded strategy of global cooperation and information-sharing. These thunderingly obvious insights have not stopped big pharma and its fellow travelers from criticizing the Biden administration’s move, which reportedlysurprisedprogressive members of Congress who had lobbied for it. A TRIPS waiver is a bad idea that “will not increase the number of doses we will have available within the next 12 months,” Dr. Ozlem Tureci, a co-founder of BioNTech, which helps produce Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, toldCNN. “It will probably act more toward increasing chaos in production.”With due respect to the impressive research achievements of Pfizer’s scientists, these criticisms are insufficient, and their market-based policy preferences should be none of our concern. An embrace of volatile market logic and corporate America’s self-serving priorities is a big reason why we’re still fighting the Covid-19 pandemic well into 2021. When the Biden administration announced its support for a waiver, the stock prices of Moderna, Pfizer, and some other pharma companiesplummetedbefore later rebounding. Markets aren’t moral entities, so perhaps it makes sense that shareholders can’t understand the imperative to waive patent protections and spread vaccines as widely as possible. That’s OK. There are some things markets can’t do. Solving the Covid crisis is one of them.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0904718775200703,0.3828051800943368,1207,2,New Republic

309,What Climate Scientists Are Saying About This Catastrophic Summer,-9.33,39.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/07/scientists-fast-climate-change-summer.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"Byallaccounts, the climate crisis is already here. Deadlyheat domesacross the Pacific Northwest, a petroleum pipeline leak in the middle of the ocean that set the Gulf of Mexicoon fire, and thedeadly floods in Germany and Belgiumin the past few weeks alone have proved that the world is changing in response to how we have changed it.*No one should be surprised by this. For decades, scientists have been ringing the alarm bell about anthropogenic climate change. Over 30 years ago, NASA scientist James Hansentoldthe U. S. Congress that the “greenhouse effect is here.” And long before then, in the 1800s, scientists like Svante Arrheniuscalculatedthat doubling the amount of CO2 that was in the atmosphere in 1895 would lead to global warming of 5 to 6 degrees Celsius in average global temperatures. “That wasn’t too far off,” said Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, speaking on his own behalf. It was just that Arrhenius’s timeframe for how quickly humans would emit those gasses was way off, Kalmus added: “It only took about 125 years for that increase in CO2 fraction that he thought would take 3000 years. He grossly underestimated the rate of emissions from burning fossil fuels that we actually did.”Arrhenius’s original prediction represents a lot of the current problems faced by climate change models. Understanding where we are on the climate change timeline requires multiple steps—we need to know how much greenhouse gas has been emitted, how much those greenhouse gases have increased the global temperature, and then finally, we need to take one last step that even Arrhenius never took—we need to understand how those changes in global temperature will affect the climate we experience. It’s this last bit that is trickiest—we know the current proportion of carbon in our atmosphere (currently around 420 parts per million), what we don’t know is how to accurately predict all the consequences of the temperature increase caused by that extra carbon.“The scientific community has done a really good job projecting when we would get to 1.2 degrees Celsius, which is about where we are now,” Kalmus said. “The community hasn’t done as good of a job projecting how bad climate impacts would be at 1.2 degrees Celsius.”Indeed, from heat domes to wildfires to rapidly melting ice sheets, a lot of the very real effects of the climate crisis that we are seeing seem far worse—or far from—what was predicted. So in this summer in which it feels impossible to look at the news without seeing a climate catastrophe of some kind, I asked several climate scientists how the constant onslaught of tragedy affects where they put us on the climate timeline. What they had to say was not particularly reassuring.“It’s already worse than what I imagined. I feel like the heat dome event in the Pacific Northwest moved up my sense of where we are at by about a decade, or even more,” said Kalmus. “I think a lot of my colleagues probably feel the same.”In many ways, the climate crisis has “moved now from an abstract concern to a very real one,” according to Lise Van Susteren, an expert on climate grief and mental health as it intersects with climate change. “It’s not a storm that lasts 36 hours. It’s not the aftermath of a flood. We’re being cooked to death.”According to Van Susteren, this magnification of the climate crisis—which is in turn amplified by the growing conversation around climate—has meant that more and more people are becoming concerned with the existential threat that the climate crisis poses. Indeed, the mental health effects of the climate crisis on the communities facing it are vast and varied: anxiety, grief, and “pre-traumatic stress disorder” (Van Susteren’s term), to name a few. And yet,real action still remains limited. Jennifer Atkinson, a professor of environmental humanities at the University of Washington, agrees. “It’s no longer a kind of vague concern about things happening in the future, it’s the realization that the world is unraveling around us right now. And the loss is piling up every day,” she said. “It’s also the despair and outrage that the suffering and loss didn’t have to happen.”The extreme uncertainty of the climate crisis—as proven by the fact that even the best predictions failed to account for the worst of the effects—has its own unsettling effect. “I think the fact that it’s kind of happening faster and in a different way than we anticipated just exaggerates that sense of kind of confusion and loss of kind of intellectual stability” that leads to things like climate grief, according to Susan Clayton, a professor of psychology and environmental studies at the College of Wooster. Part of the reason it’s been so hard to predict these effects in the first place is because they are “complicated, non-linear processes,” as Kalmus calls them. Scientists have to account for hundreds of variables, which means predictions are often far from perfect. Models for the melting of ice sheets in the Arctic, for example, are actually more optimistic than what’s currently happening in places like Greenland and Antarctica, because those models haven’t taken into account the other processes that could accelerate melting (water can creep in under the ice sheets, causing them to slip off into the ocean more quickly, for example). “The models, in this case, have proven overly conservative, not including some important real world processes,” Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist and the director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, said about the ice sheet predictions. In other words, even as we watch the effects already happening, we still have to contend with how they will multiple and exacerbate one another. “We have a lot to learn about specifics about how climate breakdown and how it’s going to affect civilization,” Kalmus added. “I think there’s still a lot we don’t know there.”Beyond what we can already see,anyway.

That reference has been removed because the cause of the collapse is still under investigation.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0816396103896103,0.4856087662337662,1344,2,Slate
310,When America’s Red States Were Red,-28.33,36.33,https://jacobinmag.com/2021/07/socialist-party-red-states-debs-ameringer-history-rural-socialism,https://adfontesmedia.com/jacobin-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,24,"This month marks 120 years since the founding of the Socialist Party of America. The party was especially strong in rural areas like Oklahoma — success that the socialist movement could actually replicate today. Eugene Debs in 1912. (Library of Congress)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Markwayne Mullin is an ultraconservative Republican congressperson from eastern Oklahoma. He hates socialism and isn’t afraid totell you about it.“Socialism is nothing but a disguised free democracy, meaning that they make you think you have a choice, but you really don’t,” he warned his constituents in 2019. The Green New Deal “has nothing to do with eliminating my cows from farting,” he insisted. “It has to do with that farm being deemed a hazard to the public health” so the federal government can claim “eminent domain and take over our farms.” And if the socialists and bureaucrats in New York and Washington, DC can use farting cows as an excuse to take over farms, what’s next?Donald Trump skillfully tapped into fears of “socialism” to run up huge margins in places like Mullin’s congressional district, which went for Trump in 2020 by the largest margin in the state (76 to 22 percent). But this largely rural area wasn’t always a hotbed of reaction. A century ago, socialist firebrands likeKate Richards O’Harefound receptive audiences in eastern Oklahoma, and the state boasted the largest per capita Socialist Party (SP) membership in the country. Five-time Socialist presidential candidateEugene Debsconsidered southwestern farmers “real Socialists . . . ready for action, and if the time comes when men are needed at the front to fight and die for the cause the farmers of Texas and Oklahoma will be found there.”Today, Debs’s words sound like a broadcast from another dimension. While socialists, radicals, and progressives are doing important work across the country, left politics are —at least for now— largely synonymous with the most urban and cosmopolitan precincts in the United States. The New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) claims roughly 10 percent of the organization’s entire membership. The crop of democratic socialists recently elected to Congress hail from places like the Bronx and Queens (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), New York’s northern suburbs (Jamaal Bowman), Detroit (Rashida Tlaib), and St Louis (Cori Bush). Electoral breakthroughs at the state legislative level have come so far only in New York, and all of those legislators represent districts in the Big Apple. Chicago boasts a socialist caucus on its city council, but no other town or city can say the same. This year marks the 120th anniversary of the SP’s founding. And during its heyday, many of the movement’s biggest strongholds were found in the country’s most rural areas. As James Weinstein observes in, until 1918 “the greatest relative voting strength of the movement lay west of the Mississippi River, in the states where mining, lumbering, and tenant farming prevailed.”In addition to Oklahoma, the states with the highest proportions of SP voters were Nevada, Montana, Washington, California, Idaho, Florida, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Butte, Montana — which elected a Socialist government led by Mayor Lewis Duncan in 1911 — features one of the last public remnants of the old SP:Socialist Hall. Even in states like New York, the party tended to do just as well in smaller upstate towns like Schenectady, where Socialist mayorGeorge Lunnwas elected to two terms in the 1910s, as it did in New York City. Big-city socialists today still havea lot of work to doin our neighborhoods and workplaces. But if we want to become a truly popular movement, we need to find ways to grow beyond our metropolitan footholds. Revisiting the SP’s record of building power in rural and small-town America — including a frank assessment of its failures and shortcomings — can give us a sense of how that legacy might be rebuilt today. The SP was far from the first organization to make a radical appeal to the nation’s hinterlands. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the Knights of Labor, the People’s (Populist) Party, and other organizations rallied workers and farmers against the growing power of bankers, railroad barons, and land speculators. But when the Socialist Party formed in 1901, it wasn’t simply as a reincarnation of Populism. As James Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism: Radical Movements in the Southwest, 1895–1943, while many of the early SP leaders were former Populists, the Socialists’ main areas of support in the region were outside the old Populist strongholds, among the growing ranks of tenant farmers and industrial workers in cotton farming and coal mining areas. In addition to former “Pops,” the movement drew on an experienced cadre of labor organizers like the old Knights of Labor militantMartin Irons, a grizzled Scotsman who had led a massive railroad strike in 1886 against the robber baron Jay Gould. Radicals and Socialists in the region drew much of their support from migrants who had fled their homes in search of land. Instead of a frontier idyll, these migrants found that many of the best lands had been claimed by railroads, speculators, and cattle ranchers, and the cost of setting up an independent farm was often prohibitive. Many nominally independent farmers became deeply dependent on creditors. By the turn of the century, most farmers in the region were tenants and sharecroppers, rather than the self-sufficient homesteaders of their dreams. Some of these tenants were Cherokees, Choctaws, and other indigenous people who had their tribal lands stolen. Some were black migrants looking to get out from under Jim Crow. Most were white. Nearly all were poor, ensnared in exploitative forms of agricultural finance like the crop-lien system. This set of property relations generated bitter class struggles between tenant farmers and their landlords, which allowed the Socialists to exploit fissures in the Democratic Party’s electoral base. In addition to tenant farmers, Socialist organizers were well received among the miners, timber workers, and railroad men of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, and the interior West. They were particularly successful in recruiting militant miners, who built strong United Mine Workers (UMW) and Western Federation of Mineworkers (WFM) locals across the region. The UMW was one of the main sources of black recruitment to southwestern Socialism, as it was one of the only organizations that sought to unite working people across racial lines. Local SP organizations, however, were not always willing to do the same. Many white SP members resisted cooperation with black and indigenous farmers, and segregated party locals could be found in Texas, Louisiana, and elsewhere. Still, a number of Socialist leaders fought racism and white supremacy in the movement. The rakish Southern radicalCovington Hallorganized dock workers across the color line in New Orleans and was a leading founder of the interracialBrotherhood of Timber Workers(BTW). Oscar Ameringer, one of the most underappreciated figures in the history of American Socialism, worked to unite the black and white brewery workers of New Orleans while on assignment from the Socialist-led Brewery Workers’ Union. When he moved to the Sooner State in 1907, he quickly began agitating for socialism among tenant farmers in Indian Country. Together with state party secretaryOtto Branstetter, another German social democrat with close ties to the Milwaukee Socialists, he sought to bring together black, white, and indigenous workers in a strong and well-organized SP affiliate. Official party organizations did not spring up overnight. In the first years of the twentieth century, the Southwest was covered by a vast web of journalistic and propaganda activity that drew masses of people into the Socialist movement — in many cases before under-resourced official party organizations could reach them. As Green recounts inGrass-Roots Socialism, radical journalists, intellectuals, and propagandists promoted “an unusual level of self-organization and self-education among the poor working people who joined the movement.”None was more important thanJulius Wayland, whose weekly paper, theAppeal to Reason,was central to Socialist education and organizing in places like Oklahoma and Texas. The paper’s “Appeal Army” of volunteer salespeople would fan out into the country like Methodist circuit riders, hawking subscriptions and pamphlets and seeding party organizations wherever they went. By 1912, Green writes, “over six thousand Appeal volunteers were walking, bicycling, and driving buggies through Oklahoma and Texas spreading the Socialist gospel.”Their efforts won the paper a national circulation of roughly 750,000 — the highest of any weekly publication in the country. TheAppeal, in Green’s words, “was literally the only contact with socialism experienced by many people in the first decade of the century, and it was particularly important in converting younger farmers and workers” who were not veterans of the Knights of Labor or the Populist movement. Other unofficial but Socialist-aligned papers like the National Rip-Saw(St Louis) and theRebel(Hallettsville, Texas) served a similar role, bringing Socialism to the people in an idiom that blended class struggle with American republicanism and evangelical Christianity. Socialist organizers also made excellent use of mass encampments, a familiar institution associated with both Populism and religious revivals. Socialists organized their first encampment in 1904 in the Grand Saline area of Texas, where a thousand farmers from across the region showed up to listen to speeches and lectures for hours. As one account in the Socialist press described it, “Go into the Grand Saline country and see erstwhile democrats . . . preaching Socialism as earnestly as did the Pentecostals preach the New Gospel and perhaps you will have a clearer conception of what the encampment accomplished.”These encampments brought thousands into the movement because “they drew upon the collective traditions of the frontier and added political significance to common experiences.” Preachers and teachers advanced Socialist ideas in biblical and populist language to justify the struggle against those who would deny workers of hand and brain the full product of their toil. Ameringer described the encampments’ effect in vivid terms:For these people radicalism was not an intellectual plaything. Pressure was upon them. Many of their homesteads were already under mortgage. Some had already been lost by foreclosure. They were looking for delivery from the eastern monster whose lair they saw in Wall Street. They took to socialism like a new religion. And they fought and sacrificed for the spreading of the new faith like the martyrs of other faiths. Attendees were thrilled by the oratory of renowned leaders like Mother Jones, but they also made minor celebrities of forgotten figures likeWalter Thomas Mills. Known as the “little professor,” this diminutive polymath established a “School of Social Economy for Socialists” and wrote a popular textbook calledThe Struggle for Existence, which offered readers an eclectic blend of Christian moralism and scientific socialism. If a good organizer is, in the words ofFred Ross, a “social arsonist who goes around setting people on fire,” the old Socialist movement had them in droves. And nobody in the movement set more people on fire than Eugene Debs, easily the most popular orator at the Southwestern encampments. Debs brought both prophetic and intellectual intensity to his speeches and exuded an unshakeable faith in the ability of the poorest and most despised people to change the world. Reflecting on the success of the encampments, Debs related how farmers and their families would head home “feeling that they had refreshed themselves at a fountain of enthusiasm,” ready and able to deliver “the glad tidings of the coming day” to their friends and neighbors. A lively press and effective organizing tactics like encampments were key to Socialists’ success in rural areas. But the movement would not have found such fertile soil if it did not directly appeal to people’s material interests — even if they diverged from orthodox Marxist prescriptions. The Texas and Oklahoma parties, for example, supported tenant farmers’ essentially Populist demands for private, small-scale ownership of farmland despite the opposition of party members from other sections of the country. Critics argued that small family farms were inefficient and obsolete, and that only demands for land collectivization were consistent with proper socialism. Other Socialists disagreed. In his influential 1902 studyThe American Farmer,Algie Simonsinsisted that not only were small farmers not disappearing, but that the growing power of corporate capital made them a potential audience for Socialists. Simons’s main argument was twofold. First, “the small farm owner is a permanent factor in the agricultural life in America, and that he forms the largest uniform division of the producing class,” and second, “any movement which seeks to work either with or for the producing class, must take cognizance of him.” Industrial workers could not, in his view, transform society without the masses of small farmers standing with them at the ballot box and on the field of class conflict. Simons’s arguments gained additional strength after the party’s disappointing results in the 1908 elections, when it offered no agrarian program beyond a vague call for collective ownership of all land. In 1912, the national party congress adopted an agrarian program that incorporated demands long raised by Simons and the Southwestern Socialists: state-supported cooperatives; public ownership of transportation, storage, and processing facilities; graduated land taxes; and expansion of cheap government-backed leases of land to family farmers. The new program marked an important moment in the movement’s development. As Simonswroteafter the 1912 convention, “Conditions in agriculture, in the party and in the views of the delegates have all changed with the years, and the Socialist party now goes forth with a clear statement of its position in regard to the farmer that should mean a tremendous growth in agricultural localities in the near future.”He was right. In 1912, Debs received a total of eighty thousand votes (about one-tenth of his national total) from Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. At its height in the middle of the decade, the Oklahoma party claimed about ten thousand members, the most members per capita of any state in the country. In 1914 and 1915, the year when the SP had its largest number of state legislators in office, states west of the Mississippi River accounted for nineteen of thirty-three legislators. Oklahoma alone accounted for six, second only to Wisconsin’s nine, and it elected a total of a hundred seventy-five Socialists to local and county offices. The party’s back-and-forth over how best to approach the rural masses resembled debates in other parties of the Second International. In hisreviewof Simons’s book, German theorist Karl Kautsky noted that the agrarian question was “one of the most difficult and disputed” issues in the German Social Democratic Party — pitting Bavarians and other southerners who wanted to appeal to poor and middle peasants against northerners who only wanted to recruit landless agricultural laborers on large estates. This question was also a major dividing line in Russian social democracy, where Lenin’s support for aligning with the Russian peasantry put him at odds with the Mensheviks, who focused primarily on the urban working classes and bourgeois liberals. The erosion of small farmers as a social class means that contemporary socialists don’t confront the same “agrarian question” as our predecessors. But the conundrum of “contradictory class locations” is very much on the agenda, as theoften-heated discourseover the “ PMC (professional managerial class) question” clearly shows. The challenge today is to reconcile two groups who are largely isolated from each other socially and politically: progressive, highly educated wage earners and the masses of lower paid, less-credentialed working people. In hishistory of the SP, Jack Ross observes that “the movement of the Old Southwest never fit neatly into the factional categories of the national party.” The left-wing Texas Socialists, for example, supported the essentially “revisionist” agrarian program. They were sympathetic to theChristian Socialistsand sought to recruit ministers to the movement — positions in keeping with many of the party’s more moderate elements. At the same time, they staunchly opposed the successful campaign to recall “Big Bill” Haywood from the party’s National Executive Committee in 1913 over his support for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and sabotage. Similar dynamics played out on organizational questions and white supremacy. Left-wingers dominated the Oklahoma party’s ranks, but for years its social democratic leaders like Branstetter and Ameringer sought to reproduce the more centralized methods of Victor Berger’s Milwaukee organization. Local radicals denounced this “German form of organization” and sought greater organizational decentralization wherever possible. The degree of commitment to interracial organizing did not tend to break down along neatly defined left-right lines either. In general, the Oklahoma Socialists took a firmer stand against white supremacy than their counterparts in Texas and elsewhere. Even the most radical elements of the movement could be weak on the question of racial equality. WhenRebeleditorTom Hickeyand other left-wing Texas Socialists formed a Land Renters’ Union in 1911 they barred blacks from joining the organization. The union eventually organized black and brown tenants, but into separate locals. As Green notes, many of the poor white tenant farmers of the region “pitted themselves against landlords and businessmen on one hand, and against black sharecroppers and brown migrants on the other.” Otherwise radical leaders like Hickey did not combat this racism. Some of them, likeRebelpublisherE. O. Meitzen, were blatant race-baiters and nativists. To their credit, leaders like Ameringer, Branstetter, andTenant Farmereditor Pat Nagle defended the rights of black and brown people and courted their support. In 1912, they and others successfully campaigned to add an explicitly anti-racist plank to the party’s platform through a membership referendum. Two years earlier, in 1910, Oklahoma party leaders campaigned against the Democrats’ successful referendum to disenfranchise black voters in the state. Some party members voted for it, but Green concludes that a majority of Oklahoma Socialists voted against it. In light of these struggles, Ameringer denounced “the bitter race hatred that has been a nightmare to every clear-seeing Socialist working man in the South.” Many rank-and-file Socialists agreed with him. There were some important examples of interracial organizing in the region, particularly among miners and timber workers oriented toward industrial unionism. The BTW, which organized black and white workers in the piney woods spanning west Louisiana and east Texas, was exemplary in this regard. It proved much harder, however, to convince white tenant farmers to unite with blacks in common organizations instead of fearing them as competitors. The movement as a whole was weaker than it should have been as a result. The SP maintained a fairly steady level of membership and electoral strength in the Southwest and interior West until the United States entered World War I in 1917. But the combination of repression and a severe cotton crisis triggered by the war arrested the movement’s growth and set the stage for its eventual defeat. The organized strength of Socialism stirred the region’s ruling classes to wage a reactionary countermovement. Timber workers, miners, and tenant farmers clashed with bosses and landlords in bitter strikes and confrontations. At the same time, left-wing “Reds” in the Oklahoma party took aim at social democratic “Yellows” like Ameringer and Branstetter, and ousted them from their positions in 1913. These dynamics inverted the story that was playing out elsewhere in the movement at the time. As Green observes, the heightening of Southwestern class conflict around 1913 boosted the fortunes of local left-wingers and direct-actionists at the same time the likes of Haywood were being ousted from national leadership positions. The Oklahoma Socialists made solid gains at the ballot box in 1914, when UMW militant Fred Holt stood as the party’s gubernatorial candidate. With the state’s cotton farming districts racked by drought and a collapse in prices, the party waged a robust campaign against the Democrats and Republicans. Holt won 21 percent of the statewide vote, polling more votes than Debs in his 1912 presidential campaign. His coattails, and those of other effective candidates like Nagle, swept a wave of Socialists into office at the state, county, and local levels throughout Oklahoma. While the party made big gains in Oklahoma and held ground in Texas, it did not fare as well elsewhere. In 1914, lumber barons smashed the BTW in Louisiana, which effectively defeated the Socialist movement in the state. At the same time, Democrat-sponsored suffrage restrictions and election “reforms,” combined with the devastating cotton crisis, pushed increasingly desperate tenant farmers to adopt guerrilla tactics. In 1915, an underground conspiratorial organization called theWorking Class Union(WCU) began dynamiting vats in protest of Oklahoma’s tick eradication law, which fell hardest on poor tenants. (The vats were used to dip cattle in arsenic to kill ticks, but only wealthier farmers and cattlemen could afford to comply with the rule.)These and other militant actions like night-riding were understandable, even predictable, responses to economic hardship and political repression. But as Green notes, the turn to social banditry brought repression “where the party had already suffered serious losses as a result of blacklisting campaigns organized by Democratic businessmen, landlords, and politicians.”To its lasting credit, the SP — unlike many of the other parties of the Second International — took a strong stand against entering World War I. Their reward was ruthless repression. The most damaging anti-Socialist measures came from the postmaster general, who removed party papers from the mail, impacting nearly every Socialist periodical of importance in the country. For the movement in rural areas — which relied heavily on the mail to organize, educate, and agitate — the postal crackdown was especially devastating. Oklahoma was the site of the most militant antiwar activity, including a failed armed uprising in 1917 called theGreen Corn Rebellion. The SP was officially against these tactics, but since many of its members were involved in armed resistance the state’s ruling Democrats attacked the Socialists in a fury of patriotic repression. By 1918, the once-mighty Oklahoma Socialist Party was crushed. The party organization dissolved itself out of fear of further repression, and many of its key leaders and militants fled the state. In 1918 alone, Weinstein notes, “some 1,500 of the more than 5,000 Socialist Party locals were destroyed, mostly in small communities” and disproportionately in areas west of the Mississippi. By the time of the 1918–19 split, which decimated the SP and birthed two fractious Communist parties, the movement in Oklahoma and the trans-Mississippi region in general was already crushed by vicious wartime repression. Rural socialism continued to find expression in theNonpartisan Leaguesand Farmer-Labor movements of the Midwest. But over the subsequent decades socialism became a predominantly urban phenomenon, particularly as the Communists and various Trotskyist groups focused much of their attention on workers in the mass production industries. Communists played an important role in the early years of the Southern Civil Rights Movement, as Robin Kelley documents inHammer and Hoe, and the Communist Party made some limited headway among Midwestern farmers, particularly in the Dakotas amid the farm protests of the 1930s. Socialists led the formation of the Southern Tenant Farmers’ Union (STFU), founded in 1934 to unite black and white tenants in the SP’s old Southwestern strongholds. The union recruited tens of thousands of members by the late 1930s, but it ultimately could not survive the combined pressures of New Deal farm relief, violent landowner repression, and the growing mechanization of agriculture, which radically reduced the scope of both agricultural wage-labor and farm tenancy. By the latter decades of the twentieth century, the social layers that formed the base of classical American Socialism were in severe decline. Thousands of family farms were permanently wiped out in the 1980s, bringing rural communities down with them. Deindustrialization and the attack on labor decimated the ranks of the UMW and other unions with a rural presence. The economic base of rural Americashiftedlargely from agriculture, mining, and manufacturing to the service sector, particularly healthcare and food services. In this sense at least, urban and rural areas have actually grown more alike — potentially making it easier to craft demands and programs that bridge seemingly insurmountable geographical divides. In any case, the dramatic transformation of the American “heartland” means that the contours of democratic-socialist politics in these regions will look very different today. Many rural areas are in a dire state. As Marc Edelman describes in hissobering survey of rural America, since the 1980s, “Mutual savings banks and credit unions, cooperatives, mom-and-pop businesses, local industries and newspapers, health and elder care facilities, schools, and libraries have all fallen victim to relentless austerity policies or private-equity raiders.” The disintegration of rural communities opened the door to reactionary demagogues like Donald Trump and Markwayne Mullin, who point the finger at everyone except those who really deserve the blame: the corporate interests who have plundered and abandoned Main Street, USA. The Left has a dual imperative to rebuild its base in small-town America. The severe distress and deprivation that prevails demands relief for its own sake. People are suffering, and the Left should do all it can to relieve that suffering. There’s a more practical reason, too: the United States’ system of political representation is structurally biased against urban and metropolitan areas. Organizations like DSA are growing in membership and building power in the nation’s most urbanized districts, but cities often lack the economic and political capacity to solve their own problems. They’ll need support from the states and the federal government, which likely won’t come if rural and small-town representatives aren’t willing to grant it. Consider, for example, the wave of preemption laws right-wing state governments have passed to stop municipalities from raising wages, implementing antidiscrimination ordinances, reining in police power, or building municipal broadband systems. The old Socialist movement made many of its first rural inroads by deftly using mass media, particularly newspapers. Today’s left should attempt to replicate this by developing media aimed specifically at rural and small-town audiences. The decline of local print media has allowed a vacuum for Fox News and right-wing radio hosts to fill, but the Left can reach people who want an alternative to this steady diet of reactionary demagogy. A wave of public school strikes swept GOP-dominated states likeOklahomain 2018–19, which briefly revived a dormant militant tradition and pointed to a potential political opening among educators and other public service workers. The disintegration of rural communities has had terrible social consequences. At the same time, it gives the Left a chance to create even small circles that give people a social outlet and focal point for community life. As Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism, “in many of the rural sections of the Southwest the party local served as a little Socialist community, a sort of surrogate for the declining ‘country community.’”The old Socialists also capitalized on people’s discontent with established Christian denominations that catered to their exploiters. The “prosperity gospel” that is so popular today demands a new social gospel that resonates where evangelical Christianity is a central aspect of daily life. We should link social and spiritual appeals to a program of material demands, including land reform. As Levi Van Santhas argued, a land reform program that challenges concentrated land ownership and ecologically destructive corporate agriculture could bridge geographical divides and underpin a multiracial, working-class alliance. Rural areas are commonly assumed to be monolithically white, but that perception is far from the reality. Immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere work onfarmsandmeatpacking plants, and substantial communities of Native Americans, blacks, and Latinos live throughout rural America. A strong, consistent message of racial equality must be an integral part of this agenda — not only to combat the racism and nativism of the Right but to appeal to core components of our potential base. In addition to the land question, a left-wing program would support funding for public schools and libraries, widening Medicare/Medicaid eligibility, mental health and substance abuse services, transportation investments that reduce auto dependence, high-speed broadband, and an expansion of the US Postal Service — including reestablishing postal banking to combat predatory check-cashing services and payday lenders. Marginalized urban communities share many of these same interests, which could make it easier to unite periphery and metropole around a common program than it initially appears. We can’t simply transpose what the Socialists did a hundred twenty years ago to our own time. But there is much to learn from this history, particularly when it comes to building a radical movement in apparently inhospitable territory. The legacy of Ameringer, Hall, and Debs can help us turn some of the most seemingly intractable corners of Republican America a deeper shade of red.

Lindsey Graham (R-S. C.) on Sunday said he would take whatever legal means necessary to stop Democrats from approving their massive $3.5 trillion infrastructure package, even if it means following in the steps of Texas Democrats who fled their state to block restrictive voting legislation—a likely far-fetched proposal for the U. S. Senate, where only a simple majority of lawmakers are needed to conduct business.""Hell yeah I would leave,"" Graham said. ""I would use everything lawfully in my toolbox.""Speaking to Fox News', Graham blasted Democrats' infrastructure proposal for its lofty $3.5 trillion pricetag and several provisions targeting non-physical infrastructure, saying he would ""use everything lawfully in [his] toolbox to prevent rapid inflation,"" referencing concerns that heightened fiscal spending could drive up demand and prices. Graham said he ""would leave town"" if Democrats manage to pass a reconciliation budget resolution and called on his Republican colleagues to ""learn something"" from Texas state Democrats wholast weekblocked a bill by fleeing to Washington. The U. S. Constitution requires a quorum of 51 senators to be present for the Senate to conduct business, Graham pointed out, meaning all 50 GOP senators would need to be absent for such a tactic to work—assuming all 50 Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris (who casts a tie-breaking vote) show up. The controversial move is also not without repercussions: The Senate's sergeant at arms can compel senators to go to the chamber under the threat of arrest—something that lastpanned outin 1988. Though many have voiced discontent at Democrats' infrastructure proposal, no other GOP Senators have thus far indicated they'd go to such measures to block a vote from happening.""Hell yea I would leave,"" Graham said Sunday. ""If we pass that bill, you're going to have inflation through the roof and if they put legalizing illegal immigrants in that bill you're going to have a complete run on the border... I'd do anything I could to stop that.""On Monday, 57 Democratic Texas House lawmakersleftthe state and traveled to Washington, D. C. to prevent the chamber from having the necessary quorum (of two-thirds of lawmakers) to pass a restrictive voting bill and other Republican-led legislation during a 30-day special session. The remaining members of the Texas House voted Tuesday to authorize the state sergeant at arms to call on all absentees under the threat of arrest, but the officer doesn't have jurisdiction outside of Texas. For now, the Texas Democrats are pushing for national voting rights legislation to help squash the state's GOP bill, but it's stillvery unclearhow long their efforts in Washington may last. Though President Joe Biden firstunveiledhis infrastructure proposal in March, Democratic party leaders have faced opposition to the plan from Republicans and Democrats alike, prompting them to pursue two different efforts in hopes one pans out. A bipartisan group of 22 senators has been working on amuch smaller$953 billion bipartisan plan since late June to quell concerns chief among Republicans—namely, that Biden's proposal is too big and takes on too much outside traditional infrastructure. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats on Wednesdayreleaseda $3.5 trillion infrastructure framework in case they can pass a budget resolution bill on their own later this summer. Using the Senate’s special reconciliation process, the budget resolution bill would allow Democrats to pass certain spending bills with just 51 votes instead of the usual 60, but it would still require all 50 Senate Democrats to sign on, including more moderate members like Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). The odds of that are still uncertain, though it's possible Democrats may trim the size of their package to help get members on board. Manchin, for one, told reporters on Wednesday he was still concerned the $3.5 trillion plan would cost too much and wanted more details on how it would be paid for. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said Sunday the bipartisan bill could be readied as soon as this week.

Schools could also use the funding to improve HVAC systems, reduce class size, implement social distancing, hire support staff, and address a wide variety of other needs and expenses to help schools reopen safely. The bill includes requirements intended to protect state and local spending on economically disadvantaged students. The$129 billion aid package for K-12was released Monday by Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va. Democrats plan to include relief for schools as part of a larger coronavirus aid deal through a process known as budget reconciliation. In total dollar amount, it essentially matchesthe $130 billion in relief for schoolsproposed by President Joe Biden shortly before his inauguration. However, the bill does leave out two proposals from Biden’s American Rescue Plan. Unlike Biden’s blueprint, the House bill doesn’t include a $5 billion fund for governors to help the schools “hardest hit” by the pandemic. Also absent are “equity challenge grants” that the Biden administration has pitched “to advance equity- and evidence-based policies to respond to COVID-related educational challenges.”The proposal isn’t final, and could change as it advances through Congress. The House education committee advanced the legislation early Wednesday by a 27-21 vote. Republicans proposed several amendments to the legislation, but none were adopted. The legislation now heads to the House budget committee, which is in charge of combining COVID-19 relief bills from different committees into a comprehensive aid package in the chamber. Among the amendments voted down by the committee was a proposal from Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, that would have barred the aid funding from being used for standardized tests required by the Every Student Succeeds Act, the main federal K-12 law; an amendment from Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., that would have prohibited districts from getting the aid unless they opened for in-person instruction, and instead directed the aid to education savings accounts for students to access directly to cover various K-12 expenses; and an amendment from Rep. Michelle Steel, R-Calif., that would have prohibited districts from getting the aid unless their teachers had first had an opportunity to receive the coronavirus vaccine. In several respects, the legislation resembles previous coronavirus relief funding; the reconciliation proposal from Scott states that, in general, the money can be used in the same way as previous coronavirus relief funding enacted by Congress last year. Schools have been able to use such relief on things ranging from cleaning schools to paying for education technology. Congress has provided roughly $67 billion to K-12 public schools in two previous COVID-19 relief bills. Separately, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will soon consider COVID-19 relief legislation that would provide $7.6 billion to help provide students internet access and internet-connected devices. Education groups called for such funding throughout the pandemic to help students learning remotely and close the “homework gap.”However, the bill’s requirement that a minimum amount (roughly 25 percent) go toward academic recovery efforts at the state and local level is significant, and a departure from past relief bills. The legislation states that at least that amount must pay for “implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as summer learning, extended day, or extended school year programs, and ensure such interventions respond to students’ academic, social, and emotional needs.”In addition, students who’ve been disproportionately affected by the pandemic would get top priority for this funding, according to the legislation. Scott has signaled for some time, such as in aDecember interview with Education Week, that his priority in future COVID-19 relief for schools would involve students’ academic needs. In that interview, he specifically highlighted his desire for children to receive beefed-up academic services over the summer. However,using summer schoolto overcome pandemic-driven academic needs isn’t a worry-free proposition; concerns about union buy-in and states’ ability to mandate summer learning are two potential issues. The Biden administration listed $29 billion needed for for learning recovery in itsjustification for a new K-12 relief proposal. However, that blueprint did not call for Congress to earmark any minimum amount for academic services like the House Democrats’ bill does. A bill from Scott and other Democrats released last month would set aside $75 billion over two years forpandemic-related academic serviceslike extended learning time. States receiving aid through the bill released Monday would have to agree not to cut their per-pupil spending for high-poverty districts more than any per-pupil reduction they make for districts overall, during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. (In this case, “high-poverty” district means one that serves a larger share of economically disadvantaged students than the median district in the state.) In addition, states could not cut their own aid to the 20 percent of districts with the highest share of economically disadvantaged students from fiscal 2019 funding levels. That requirement would also cover fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. There would be similar conditions for districts’ limits on how much they could cut aid to high-poverty schools. States would also have to agree to maintain certain levels of spending on K-12 schools in general in proportion to recent years’ spending levels, although they could apply for a waiver from that requirement. The share of district funding set aside for extended learning programs is subject to an equitable services requirement. This means that certain students who attend private schools and who have been deemed academically at risk are eligible for such services like tutoring paid for by relief funds set aside to address academic recovery. Aside from K-12, the bill would provide additional money for child care, including $39 billion to the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program. It would also direct $1 billion to Head Start, the federal early-childhood education program. Democrats who control both the House and Senate have indicated that they hope to approve a $1.9 trillion relief bill andsend it to Biden by March 14, when a federal supplement to unemployment insurance expires. The reconciliation process allows lawmakers, among other things, to enact relief legislation by a simple majority in the Senate, rather than negotiating the filibuster through which 41 senators can block a bill. Some Republican senators have expressed support for a much smaller COVID-19 relief dealto the tune of $600 billion, but the Biden administration and congressional Democrats have moved ahead without them.",3,Reliable,0.0600737338542216,0.363131313131313,1401,3,Education Week
315,Trump Is China and Russia’s Best Friend,-23.0,24.5,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/02/22/trump-is-china-and-russias-best-friend/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-02-22,25,"Nuclear tensions on the Korean Peninsula have diminished since last summer’s Singapore summit between President Trump and North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. In the run-up to this month’s Vietnam summit, Trump is acutely aware that a potential landmark deal on Kim’s complete, verifiable and permanent denuclearization would be a significant foreign policy win for him, the region and the world. Unfortunately, that potential deal is where Trump’s foreign policy successes both start and end. By any other measure, the president’s aggressive pursuit of nativist policies has weakened America’s global leverage, given its adversaries strategic openings and made the world a little less safe for democracy and human rights. In normal times, this would be seen as a failure of leadership and a threat to America’s fundamental values, global stature and international dominance. These are not, however, normal times. The Trump Doctrine is an “America First”agendathat plays well at home and sounds good on the stump. At best, it is a shortsighted and dangerous foreign policy play that ultimately creates a global leadership vacuum. It’s not surprising that America’s adversaries are dying to fill this vacuum. This is not partisan ideology talk. It’s dollars and cents. When America retreats and withdraws, its markets retrench, its buyers look for better deals and its partners start looking for the exits. Trump’s America is either up and leaving longstanding U. S. commitments or setting radically different and sometimes onerous terms on long-term partners for the delivery of the same—or even worse—goods and services. Those partners are open to new and different commercial, military and diplomatic relationships elsewhere. They are more open to Russian and Chinese overtures. Why buy American? Why rely exclusively on one Western supplier or questionable security guarantor? Why trust Trump?The simple answer is, they don’t. As a result, polls are showing that in certain disparaged NATO countries—Germany and France, for example— citizenstrustChina’s President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin more than POTUS. Let that sink in for a second. European allies can’t count on America to help in times of need, as German Chancellor Angela Merkelmade clearwhen she said Europe could no longer “rely on the superpower of the United States.”What does this mean in practical terms?In the short run, these nations recognize they are entirely dependent on America as a security supplier. Political scientists call this current hard reality apath dependenceon American military hardware and professional services, from interoperable weapons systems and aircraft to integrated communications infrastructure. They are locked in to American products and suppliers. But that can change over time. In fact, it already is. Suddenly, countries that would never consider buying Brand X from another,adversarialnation are opening their arms and their markets to Chinese technology and Russian weapons systems. If data is the lifeblood of the modern era, then 5G telecommunications infrastructure is the 21st century’s global circulatory system. Digital information courses through the world at a head-spinning pace. China’s Huawei has moved quickly to develop much of that data circulatory system. As a result, if America can’t compete and Beijing wins this race, free-flowing data will pump through a Beijing-based digital heart to feed China’s Artificial Intelligence-driven brain—giving it unparalleled insights and intelligence. The stakes are high as heated competition for next generation digital dominance is fully under way. America’s bullying reaction andresponseto Huawei’s global growth may not ultimately be as effective as China’s profligate financial underwriting for Sino-systems around the world. As they say in Trump’s New York, “Money talks and BS walks.”In the military realm, orders for America’s next-generation F-35 fighter jet and any number of other future American military systems are being eithercancelledor countered. One example? Russia’s advanced S-400 anti-aircraft missiles will findnew homesin India, Turkey, Egypt, Vietnam, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Russia is successfully courting allies, a deeply worrisome development that can be traced directly to Trump’s policies—or lack thereof. The list of new Russian and Chinese globallyunderwrittenprojects is growing, from critical port and road infrastructure to nuclearpower plants. The world does not wait for America to find its voice and provide global leadership. Two more years is a lifetime in geopolitics, and the rebalancing of power has been under way since Nov. 9, 2016, when a candidate unschooled and inexperienced in foreign policy and insensitive to its subtleties and systems won America’s presidential election. China saw its opening. Russia grabbed its opportunity. The United States now watches agog as, one-by-one, the global chess pieces get moved and America keeps losing its partners and its pawns. What Trump has not yet realized is that foreign-policy chest beating is not chess playing.",1,Questionable,0.0385004329004329,0.3160304112554113,1076,1,Washington Monthly

Y. -- The status of fall high school sports in New York inched along toward fruition Friday as state athletic officials reviewedguidelines issued by the Department of Health. The New York State Public High School Athletic Association gathered the executive directors from 11 sections to parse the regulations, which they received Thursday night. Next up, according to NYSPHAA spokesperson Chris Watson, is the formulation of return to sports parameters for the state. Watson said that document will hopefully be done within a week and that the Sept. 21 return of fall athletics remains on target.“The biggest thing to come out of it is we’ve got a lot of work to do,” Watson said of the meeting. “It was a very positive meeting. I think everybody had a lot of the same questions: where do we go from here and what is the next step?”Monday, the organization’scoronavirustask force will meet followed by a virtual gathering of state sports coordinators. The DOH guidelines are exhaustive but the problem from a sports perspective is that almost all of them are tailored to a return to school in general. Many of the recommendations -- such as social distancing requirements -- will have to be amended to realistically permit sports. The DOH repeatedGov. Andrew Cuomo’s ruling Mondaythat lower risk sports can start practice on Sept. 21 and then play but that higher risk sports, such as football, can practice but not yet start games. The guidelines also covered a few other sports-related points, including:In other news Friday, Section III’s Salt City Athletic Conference met to review as much as possible before the NYSPHAA’s return to play regulations come out. While Cuomo has said the return of sports willultimately rest with each district’s leadership,SCAC president Scott Sugar said his league is working toward the goal of providing scholastic sports for member schools.“It was pretty unified that we want to offer as much as we can to our student-athletes,” said Sugar, athletic director at Fayetteville-Manlius. “It was more all hypothetical than anything. There’s just so many variables that you can’t get anywhere until there’s more guidelines. One of the things every school district is trying to do well at is communicating with what’s going on.

317,Diabolical: Islam’s Past and Present Attacks on European Churches,25.0,24.25,https://pjmedia.com/faith/diabolical-islams-past-and-present-attacks-on-european-churches/,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"As explained in this recent article, all around Western Europe, churches are under attack. Along with arson attempts, typically—and rather with diabolical intent—altars are desecrated, crucifixes broken, statues mocked and/or beheaded, and the churches set aflame. Sometimes fecal matter is smeared on the churches. Last February in France, for instance, vandals plundered and used human excrement to draw a cross on the Notre-Dame des Enfants Church in Nimes; consecrated bread was found thrown outside among garbage. One week later, vandals desecrated and smashed crosses and statues at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur; they mangled the arms of a crucified Christ in a mocking manner and an altar cloth was burned. While European authorities and media usually obfuscate over the identity of the desecrators, demographics offer a clue: true to “Islam’s Rule of Numbers,” Western European nations that have large Muslim migrant populations tend to witness the most attacks. Thus in France, which has one of if not the largest Muslim populations in Western Europe, two churches are attacked every day. The same situation prevails in Germany, which also has an immense Muslim population. In Bavaria and the Alps alone, some 200 churches have been attacked and many crosses broken: “Police are currently dealing with church desecrations again and again,” reads one November 2017 report, before it says, “The perpetrators are often youthful rioters with a migration background.” Before Christmas 2016, in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany—where more than a million Muslims reside—some 50 public Christian statues (including of Jesus) were beheaded and crucifixes broken. In 2015, following the arrival of another million Muslim migrants to Dülmen, a local newspaper said “not a day goes by” without attacks on Christian statues. Numerical deductions aside, the fact is, the desecration of churches has for centuries been a Muslim trademark—a sort of “Islam was here.” As documented in my recent book, Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West, whenever Muslims invaded Christian nations, untold thousands of churches were ritually desecrated and despoiled, their crosses and other Christian symbols systematically broken. Think what ISIS does but on an exponential level—and not for a handful of years but for over a millennium. The patterns between past and present attacks are virtually identical. Reminiscent of the recent drawing of a cross in fecal matter on a French church, in 1147 in Portugal, Muslims displayed “with much derision the symbol of the cross. They spat upon it and wiped the feces from their posteriors with it.” Decades earlier in Jerusalem, Muslims “spat on them [crucifixes] and did not even refrain from urinating on them in the sight of all.” Even that supposedly “magnanimous” sultan, Saladin, commanded “whoever saw that the outside of a church was white, to cover it with black dirt,” and ordered “the removal of every cross from atop the dome of every church in the provinces of Egypt” (all quotes from primary sources documented in Sword and Scimitar, pp. 171, 145, 162). From the start, the intentional, widespread, and systematic targeting of churches and other Christian symbols prompted some to see Muslim invaders as motivated by a diabolical animus. For Anastasius of Sinai (630–701), the heroes of the seventh-century Arab conquests of the then Christian-majority Middle East were “perhaps even worse than the demons.” After all, “the demons are frequently much afraid of the mysteries of Christ, I mean his holy body [the Eucharist], the cross... and many other things. But these demons of flesh trample all that under their feet, mock it, set fire to it, destroy it” (Sword and Scimitar, p. 27). Interestingly, nowadays, whenever a church attacker is exposed as a migrant, authorities and media try to downplay the incident by saying he is suffering from mental health issues (modern-day parlance for what was once seen as demonization). Others still rely on the more antiquated interpretation. During the memorial service for Father Hamel—an 85-year-old priest slaughtered by “Allahu Akbar” shouting Muslims while holding mass in his own church in France—Archbishop Dominique Lebrun called on those “who are tormented by diabolical violence, you who are drawn to kill by a demonic, murderous madness, pray to God to free you from the devil’s grip.” Before his murderer carved his throat, Fr. Hamel himself had reportedly shouted, “Be gone, Satan!” Considering the descriptions of some Muslim assailants, such “otherworldly” accusations are not farfetched. In France, April 2015, a Muslim man dressed in traditional Islamic garb damaged and desecrated more than 200 Christian gravestones and crosses in a cemetery (just as ISIS and other Muslim “radicals” are known to do in Libya, Iraq, Iran, and elsewhere). After he was apprehended, authorities said, “The man repeats Muslim prayers over and over, he drools and cannot be communicated with: his condition has been declared incompatible with preliminary detention.” Similarly, around Christmas 2016 in Italy, another Muslim migrant who said he “wanted to destroy Christian symbols” set a church nativity scene aflame. Police fought hard to restrain the man, who was described as suffering from a “visible psycho-physical crisis.” In other words, not much has changed: past and present, Muslims—motivated by what has long been deemed a diabolical animus—attacked and desecrated churches, crosses, and other Christian symbols. The only difference is that, whereas Europeans used to prevent them entry, and thus safeguarded their sacred sites, today they welcome them in with open arms. Note: For a comprehensive and well-documented overview of what Muslims did to churches throughout history, see Ibrahim’s book, Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West",1,Questionable,0.0151640534262485,0.2926756678281068,1333,0,PJ Media

The context of the unrest is Armenia’s catastrophic defeat in a short war against Azerbaijan late last year over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Swathes of territory which had for three decades been governed as a de facto extension of Armenia were recaptured by Azerbaijani forces in a stunning advance. (Shortly after the end of the war, I visited Azerbaijan and some of its recently reconquered territories,reporting from the regionfor the.)The crushing defeat struck at Armenia’s sense of self. As Thomas de Waal, a fellow at Carnegie Europe, wrote in, his account of the conflict, for almost 30 years after the end of the Soviet Union, Armenia was no longer the “weeping nation” defined by the genocide of 1915. Rather, it had become a regional power, able to defeat its neighbour to claim land it considered rightfully its own. Until it wasn’t. It is no surprise that last year’s defeat has roiled the country’s politics. Pashinyan, who toppled former president Serzh Sargsyan in a peaceful revolution in 2018, is blamed by many in the country for the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev has repeatedlycitedPashinyan’s provocative statements, notably a fiery speech made in August 2019 saying that “Artsakh [the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh] is Armenia, full stop” – as a casus belli. Nor was the Armenian government honest with its populace during the war. Manybelievedthat Armenian forces were on the cusp of victory against Azerbaijan, right until the November night when Pashinyan appeared with Aliyev and Russian President Vladimir Putin to sign a ceasefire deal containing crushing concessions. As a result, the sudden news of Armenia’s surrender shook the country, leading to repercussions only now coming to the fore. The final straw was Pashinyan appearing toclaimin February that a Russian-made missile system used by Armenian forces had proven ineffective. As the ceasefire is underwritten by Russian peacekeepers, the unsubtle pronouncement went down badly with the military, wary of alienating Armenia’s patron, now more indispensable than ever. Yet even so, the apparent attempted coup appears remarkably half-hearted. It seems to have been limited to 40 or so army officerssigninga letter calling on Pashinyan to go. The military did not detain civilian officials or seize government buildings. The contrast between the ruthless efficiency ofthe military coup in Myanmar, carried out by the country’s experienced and pitiless junta two weeks earlier, is striking. Pashinyan has offered to call snap elections, confident that he will retain power. Unusually, the opposition have so far refused the offer unless the prime ministerconcedespower to a transitional authority, probably because most polls show him comfortably winning re-election, though his approval ratings have more thanhalvedto around 30 per cent since he came to power. Pashinyan claims figures from the ancien régime he swept away three years ago are behind attempts to destabilise his leadership. Former leaders – widely perceived as corrupt – attempting to make a comeback not through elections but through coercion “shows how deep Armenia has fallen into chaos and uncertainty, bordering on state collapse, following defeat in Karabakh,” says Hovhannes Nazaretyan, an Armenian journalist. Pashinyan’s coming to power in 2018 heralded remarkable liberalisation in Armenia, which, along with neighbouring Georgia, is now one of the only democracies in the region. The prime minister had harboured dreams of closer alignment with the West, shelved with the arrival of Russian peacekeepers. Most Armenians have no great fondness for Pashinyan but believe any plausible replacements would be worse. The outcome of this latest power struggle will determine the fate of Armenia’s fragile democracy for years to come. Related",3,Reliable,0.1046642246642246,0.5271489621489621,895,3,New Statesman

323,Hospitals eye permanent telehealth expansion with FCC funds,-0.67,48.0,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/08/18/hospitals-eye-permanent-telehealth-expansion-with-fcc-funds/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,23,"Hundreds of hospitals and health care centers from Washington state to Louisiana are expanding telehealth infrastructure thanks to $200 million that Congress appropriated for the Federal Communications Commission in emergency legislation. In some cases, hospitals are supplementing the federal funds from the $2 trillion coronavirus relief law enacted in March with their own money to expand health care delivery through remote devices, cameras and software with patients remaining at home during the pandemic. The combined government and private investment could make it incumbent upon Congress to permanently remove barriers to widespread use of telehealth even when the pandemic ends. Bipartisan legislation introduced in the House and the Senate already promises to do that and also provide more federal funding to boost infrastructure connecting patients and doctors. In March, the Department of Health and Human Services waived restrictions as an emergency measure so that Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries could consult with doctors remotely without having to travel to designated sites. Before that waiver, Medicare would pay for telehealth only when the person receiving the service was in a designated rural area and went to a designated location to get a telehealth consultation. The emergency actions taken by the federal government and almost all state governments to expand telehealth need to start becoming permanent features of the U. S. health care system, said Kyle Zebley, director of public policy at ATA, an industry group that advocates for expanding telehealth. Even after the pandemic emergency ends, “we think we should add certainty, we should add permanency to this growing industry to make sure that it continues to be there to provide care for the millions of Americans that have grown dependent upon it for good reason,” Zebley said. Physicians involved in implementing telehealth programs said although many hospitals and health care centers have handled patients remotely for years, the pandemic has shown not only the utility but also the effectiveness of telehealth. The federal government’s easing of restrictions has “been absolutely critical on two fronts,” said David Houghton, medical director for telehealth and digital medicine at Ochsner Health, a health care provider based outside New Orleans that serves patients throughout Louisiana and in neighboring Mississippi.[]“One, to practically be able to take care of patients in their greatest time of need,” Houghton said. “Secondly, it answered a lot of questions about quality and utilization and satisfaction” in using telehealth platforms. The increased dependence on telehealth since the pandemic struck, Houghton added, “has pushed us forward leaps and bounds over a course of just several months to really demonstrate that this is a viable and feasible, and in some circumstances even improved, method to be able to take care of patients in an efficient manner.”Ochsner Health is one of more than 500 hospitals, clinics and community health centers in 47 states plus the District of Columbia and Guam that would receive the $200 million from the FCC. Each facility would receive different levels based on need. Ochsner is one of 21 hospitals that would get $1 million each. Hospitals in New York would receive the most funding, totaling about $32.5 million, followed by $10.5 million for health care facilities in Ohio and $9.95 million for hospitals in California. The commission approved applications from health care facilities after reviewing detailed documentation that outlined how they intended to use the money to expand telehealth services, said Katie Gorscak, a spokeswoman for the FCC.“After the health care provider purchases the devices or services, they are required to provide invoices to the FCC in order to claim the reimbursement, showing the services or devices they purchased, at what price, when and where it was delivered and used,” Gorscak said. Ochsner plans to use the FCC funds to expand telehealth in three areas, said Houghton and April Radford, vice president of telehealth at Ochsner. About one-third of the money would go toward buying and distributing health monitoring devices made by TytoCare to patients, Radford said. TytoCare, a company based in New York and Israel, makes a handheld exam device for home use along with an app that can help a parent, for example, examine a child’s ears and throat, listen to the lungs and send information to a physician, or conduct the exam under the guidance of a doctor.[]Ochsner is placing such devices across its network of urgent care locations and community centers as well as places of worship where patients can access them to send information to doctors, Radford and Houghton said. The devices are being distributed to patients’ homes across Louisiana and Mississippi, especially in cases where there are multiple patients under one roof, they said. Another one-third of the money would go toward buying and distributing Bluetooth-connected blood pressure monitors and glucometers, which assess a patient’s blood sugar levels, they said. Ochsner plans to equip about 1,000 patients, particularly those dependent on Medicaid, “to allow them to have additional access for management of their chronic diseases,” Houghton said. The remainder of the funds would go toward a digital medicine platform called “connected mom,” to help pregnant women track their health without having to show up at clinics for routine monitoring, Houghton said. Data from such monitoring devices is combined with artificial intelligence-based programs that offer advice to women on how to better care for themselves, he said. Ochsner already had been investing on its own to expand telehealth, and the FCC funding would supplementthat investment, Houghton said. In some instances, health care facilities plan to use part of the FCC funding to build a software platform that combines telehealth tools and patients’ electronic health records, as in the case of Wright Center for Community Health in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Wright Center, which has been approved for nearly $630,000 from the FCC, had been building the platform on its own for the past year, but progress was slow because telehealth consultations were not being reimbursed by the federal government and private insurers as well as in-person visits, said Jignesh Sheth, the chief medical officer for Wright Center. In the absence of a single platform, doctors doing telehealth consultations had to “use two separate screens, one that has the video, one that has your chart, and the two systems don’t talk to each other, which brings up the scheduling nightmare,” Sheth said. Scheduling staff had to enter the same patient appointment on two different systems and make sure they were in sync, he said. Physicians also had to toggle between two systems while they had a patient on a video screen, causing more confusion and wasting doctors’ time, Sheth added. The goal of building an all-in-one software platform is it “allows you to have a combination of video and in-person visits, all on one schedule, all in one electronic software, and all in one scheduling software,” Sheth said. Wright would also use part of the FCC funds to pay for software that tracks chronic patients, Sheth said. Instead of seeing a diabetic patient once every few months, a group of nurses track about 1,000 patients on a regular basis to monitor their intake of medicine and food as well as their blood sugar levels, he said. A similar model is also being developed for tracking and monitoring patients undergoing behavioral health treatments or in managing their addictions, Sheth said. And a part of the FCC funds also would go toward blood pressure and sugar level monitors that would be distributed to patients, he said. The convenience and ease of access that patients have come to expect from telehealth can’t be taken away once the coronavirus crisis ends, Sheth said.“Going forward, the people are not going to give up the service, I think they’ll be asking for it,” Sheth said. Bringing back pre-COVID-19 restrictions on telehealth would be like giving “a kid a candy and then saying, I’m gonna take it back.'”",3,Reliable,0.1338486513486513,0.4051172758865067,1723,3,Roll Call
324,Barrett Will Be Confirmed Because GOP Shut Down Democrat Dirty Tricks,17.0,34.0,https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/22/amy-coney-barrett-will-be-confirmed-because-kavanaugh-battle-taught-gop-to-stop-getting-played-by-democrat-dirty-tricks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/federalist-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,25,"Amy Coney Barrett has not yet been confirmed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court by the U. S. Senate, but there is no question that her confirmation battle has gone much better than the one endured by Brett Kavanaugh and his supporters. The undervalued reason why is that Republicans and their voters are not wasting any time on dirty tricks from their opponents in the Senate and in the media. This confirmation was supposed to be apocalyptic. That’s what I predicted. One of the closing paragraphs of “Justice On Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,” the book I wrote with Carrie Severino:As ugly as Kavanaugh’s confirmation battle became, he is unlikely to shift the Court dramatically. Except on abortion and homosexuality, Justice Kennedy usually voted with the conservatives. If Justice Ginsburg were to retire while Trump was in the White House, the resulting appointment would probably be like the Thomas-for-Marshall trade. Compared with what might follow, the Kavanaugh confirmation might look like the good old days of civility. Clearly, we were wrong. There are many reasons for that, and it’s worth looking at them. For one thing, the Democrats’ campaign messages regarding the global Coronavirus pandemic make it impossible to repeat their action tactics from the Kavanaugh hearings. While riots and mass protests are encouraged in the streets, there was no way to import paid activists to the committee hearings or to roam Senate hallways in costume. When the Kavanaugh hearings began, they were fueled by outbursts from Senators and their invited guests who disrupted the hearings. Hundreds of activists were arrested and bailed out of jail by a coordinated campaign focused on a theme of disruption. The Coronavirus made similar tactics impossible. Contra the early media narrative, the timing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death didn’t help Democrats as much as they thought it would. If you remember, the main Democrat theme of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle was “delay, delay, delay.” They worked very hard to delay the opening of hearings by fighting to read the millions of papers that passed through Kavanaugh’s desk while he was staff secretary for President George W. Bush. Battles over paperwork dominated July and August, with hundreds of articles written about the process fights. Chuck Schumer and his allies did a photo op in front of a few empty boxes that were described as “missing records.” Schumer imposed a Democrat boycott of meetings with Kavanaugh, only relenting after weeks of trying to delay the opening of the confirmation hearings. If Democrats tried to delay the Kavanaugh hearings until past the mid-term elections, and came very close to succeeding, how much easier should it have been to delay Barrett’s confirmation vote until after the presidential election?One of the reasons the delay strategy failed for Democrats last time is because American voters started getting sick to death of what they were doing to the man. Whereas in 2018 Democrats had a huge wave election that turned over the House of Representatives to Democrat control, they actually lost Senate seats. They had to stop their anti-Kavanaugh efforts lest they lose more. Democrats were nervous about attacking Barrett in the way they’d tried to destroy Kavanaugh. Their energy and focus were on their own elections, too. Also, Barrett is a nominee of incredible quality. Like Kavanaugh, she has a ton of very loyal friends who love to sing her praises. Considered the brightest of her peers, she was a popular law professor and has had a good three years as a federal judge. But let’s not pretend that the left didn’t try to destroy Barrett. They did! They put the very same reporters who ran their anti-Kavanaugh hit pieces on the anti-Barrett beat. And they wrote many negative stories about her, her religion, and her family. Before she was nominated, Newsweekerroneously accused herreligious group of being the inspiration for “The Handmaid’s Tale.” A few days later, Politico ran an article arguing that her “religious beliefs aren’t off-limits” and saying they are problematic. Reuters also ran its own hit piece on the group People of Praise, headlined “Handmaid’s Tale? U. S. Supreme Court candidate’s religious community under scrutiny.”The Washington Post had the reporter who ran the Christine Blasey Ford portion of their massive anti-Kavanaugh operationwrite up a hit pieceon Barrett’s People of Praise group, headlined “Amy Coney Barrett served as a ‘handmaid’ in Christian group People of Praise.”A few days later, a couple of reporters ran an utterly bizarre article about how a couple of kids at a school the Barrett children attend had gotten COVID. There was no evidence that the children gave the other children COVID and the Barrettchildren had tested negative. Beth Reinhard, one of the reporters on the story, defiantly tweeted that the White House had shamed her for writing about the children, as if it didn’tmake her look bad. The Post has been areservoirofanti-Barretthitarticles. So has The New York Times. In addition to its hit on Barrett’s religious ties, the Times ran adeep and critical lookat the adoptions of two Barrett children. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of condemning the article. “The nominee introducing her family in a few sentences of prepared remarks does not give the New York Times license to start treating minor children like objects of public curiosity,”he wrote. Adoption advocates were troubled by theattack on the family. Just yesterday, the Associated Pressran a hiton a private religious school Barrett had been affiliated with. Rod Dreher wrote in response that the “Left Is Coming For Christian Schools.” And the left’s favorite academic and racist, Ibram X. Kendi, called Barrett and her husband “white colonizers” for having a multi-racial family. So again, let’s not pretend that the left didn’t work through its most prominent media outlets and academics to try to destroy Barrett. They did. The biggest difference is that Republicans simply weren’t playing with these attacks. Each and every one of these stories — and dozens of similar ones — was met with swift condemnation or yawns. Every single one. It took a few decades of the left playing the exact same games with most confirmation battles, but finally, the right figured out how to render those attacks worthless. It’s not just conservative Americans, but the senators themselves who are playing this differently. Rather than the Senate Judiciary Committee immediately responding to the Washington Post’s anti-Kavanaugh attack by bending to the will of the Democrats, this time they just didn’t care. As Democrats openly said on national television that they would do anything to stop Barrett’s confirmation, rather than act scared, the Republicans were not moved. They haven’t responded with outrage or drama, but just a steely resolve to get the nomination done. When Democrats said they would boycott the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting at which Barrett is to be voted on, the Republicans responded by saying it was fine. This way, she’ll be the unanimous vote of the committee. The legacy of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle is that Republicans finally figured out to stop playing along with the left’s games, in which nominees see their lives, family, and reputation on the chopping block. It took them a while, but better late than never.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0272028537805236,0.4102593199680578,1598,1,The Federalist

Good Morning Americaco-host Robin Roberts conducted the interview at Harris’s alma mater Howard University, asking her what it felt like to make history as the first female elected Vice President.""It started to really feel real,"" Harris said of Monday's Electoral College vote, which confirmed the election results from mid-November. ""I was watching it as the states were coming in with my husband [Doug Emhoff]. And we were watching it, and he looked at me, he said, ‘See? It’s happening. It’s really happening."" As for the millions of Americans who voted for Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers who refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, Harris remained committed to unity. ""You know, I can speak for Joe and me: We were elected to do a job. We were elected to do a job, and we intend to do that job,"" she told Roberts. ""And we intend to bring everybody along who wants to do the job with us.""Harris was also asked to weigh-in on Joseph Epstein's recent controversial op-ed for, which questions the legitimacy of Dr. Jill Biden's doctorate. “I was deeply disappointed that in 2020, that kind of approach would be given any legitimacy,” Harris explained. “Let’s be clear about it. She worked hard, She raised her kids. She went to night school. She got degrees. She earned everything she has. That is the American way, that is the American spirit.”Just as Harris will bemaking historyas the first female, first Black woman, and first Indian-American woman elected to her office, husband Emhoff will be the first second gentleman. “He has a sweatshirt that says ‘Girl Dad’ that is almost in tatters,” Harris said of Emhoff. “He is very proud to be the father of a daughter, and of course proud to be the father of a son. But he is aware that we still have so much work to do to remind our children of every gender that they should not be confined by the limited perception that some may have of who they are and what they can be.” Of course, Harrisis known as 'Momala'to her stepchildren. This was also Harris's first interview following major breakthroughs in the pandemic. The Vice President-elect says ""I don't understand the hesitation"" regarding a COVID-19 relief package, and that the government needs to start thinking ofAmericans: ""the people here in Washington, D. C., have got to stop living in a bubble."" She also addressed concerns both about thenewly-approved vaccinesandBiden's 100-day mask mandate.“Let's make sure that we make that clear, that we highlight all of the public health officials, and make sure that it is culturally competent, that people see the people they respect, who they trust, and that we highlight those stories,” Harris said about those who are skeptical about getting vaccinated, particularly those in the Black community. She said that she and Biden's previously announced 100-day mask policy would not be punitively enforced. ""There's no punishment, nobody—they don't have to,"" Harris said regarding mask-wearing. ""But he [Biden] is saying, as a leader, 'Please, everybody work with me here. For the first 100 days, let's everybody just wear a mask and see—and see the outcomes there. Because of course the scientists and the public health officials tell us there'll be really great outcomes if everyone does wear a mask when they're in public and outdoor.""As for where Harris's head will be during the January 20 inauguration, she told Roberts, “I will be thinking aboutmy mother.”",3,Reliable,0.1823423971861472,0.4093787578162578,844,2,Elle

Courtesy of Anat Sultan-DadonAs a group of Orthodox Jews walked home following Shabbat services last week in suburban Atlanta, two days after a ceasefire ended 11 days of conflict between Israel and Hamas, a man walking in another direction made the Nazi salute and yelled, “Hamas should have killed you all.”That same day, Rabbi Chaim Neiditch was walking home from synagogue with his wife and four young children when a motorist slowed down and yelled at them, “Free Palestine!”“I didn’t see him and I didn’t think anything of it, but my wife is vice president of the synagogue and she informed the security team there,” he said. Leslie Silverman, who also lives in the community, said her family has not been targeted but that she has told her 10 and 12-year-old daughters that from now on when they go out they must “walk with a friend — they cannot walk by themselves. I said they must be aware of their surroundings. If someone drives by, rolls down the window and says something, they should turn and run to the nearest house and tell a grownup right away. Most of my friends are having the same conversation with their children.”The number of antisemitic incidents in the United States has spiked since Hamas fired a barrage of long-range rockets at Jerusalem earlier this month, prompting Israel to respond with targeted attacks on the Gaza Strip. The Secure Community Network, which advises Jewish communities on security matters, recorded an 80 percent jump in incidents this month stemming from the Mideast conflict. Gavin Ellman, who heads the security committee at Congregation Beth Jacob in Atlanta, observed that when these incidents first started in this heavily Jewish community of Toco Hills, “people were surprised because it is not something we normally see. If you see a fire or someone being attacked, you call 911. But when you get yelled out, people’s first instinct is not to call 911.”The importance of parents speaking with their children about what is happening cannot be understated, according to Norman Blumenthal, a psychologist and the Zachter Family Chair in Trauma and Crisis Counseling at Ohel Children’s Home and Family Services in New York.“The first thing you have to do as a parent is to have a position yourself so you are clear where you stand,” he said. “It’s like when you are on an airplane and they tell you to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you do your child. So talk it over with your spouse first.… The kids are watching you, not just listening to your words. They are listening to the quiver in your voice. If you tell them there is no danger and you are shaking, they will think there is danger; you are not going to fool your children. They read us like books.”The challenge today is that although there is an increase in antisemitic assaults — both physical and verbal — most Jews are safe.“You have to have a nuanced message,” Blumenthal said. “You can’t say this is another Kristallnacht. On the other hand it is not as safe as it was a few weeks ago. We have to take precautions we haven’t in the past. On the other hand we don’t have to crawl into our basement with a gun.”Blumenthal, who on June 1 will speak at a free Zoom webinar at 8:30 p.m. about helping children cope in increasingly scary times (register at: Ohel Webinar), said parents should have different messages based on their child’s temperament. A child who has a tendency towards anxiety would be asked to calm down first before telling him what is going on. And a child who is a daredevil and who says he will fight back must be scared more. In addition, parents should have different messages depending on the age of the child. Rabbi Adam Starr, center, at a pro-Israel rally in Atlanta. Blumenthal said he found that the “venom against Israel and Jews is way disproportionate” on social media, which is “scary to young people who are reading it. It needs to be processed with their parents. Even if they are not physically threatened, they are threatened by the messages on the site.”Rabbi Neiditch, who is executive director of the Orthodox Union’s Jewish Student Union for Atlanta, said he works with about 4,000 teens in 128 public and private schools. He also said he is aware of the online antisemitic statements. Most memorable involved the Instagram feed of a Jewish teen who died last year and whose feed was hit with “thousands of antisemitic posts. It was horrific. I can’t imagine how sick these people are. They posted terrible messages.”Neiditch said that although he is only seeing antisemitic words, he is concerned it will lead to people who will feel justified in attacking Jewish people. I tell [the teens], ‘If you see something, say something. If something happens in school, report it.’ The schools I work with do a great job of dealing with it and have zero tolerance with this type of behavior.”Several Atlanta rabbis told the Forward that although they have increased security precautions, nothing has changed about their way of life.“I spoke about it from the pulpit at a rally we had for Israel last Sunday,” said Rabbi Adam Starr of Congregation Ohr HaTorah. “I told the men to continue to wear their kippah publicly and told the women that if they have a Jewish star, they should wear it with pride.”Stewart Ain, an award-winning veteran journalist, covers the Jewish community.

327,Biden Offers Major Concession in Infrastructure Talks,-1.67,46.67,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/newsletter/20210603-Biden-Offers-Major-Concession-Infrastructure-Talks,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"Biden Offers to Slash Infrastructure Plan, Adjust Corporate Tax Hike in Bid for GOP SupportIn his meeting Wednesday with the top Republican negotiator on infrastructure, President Joe Biden reportedly insisted that the GOP must accept about $1 trillion in new spending as part of any deal but indicated that he was open to shifting his corporate tax proposals in an attempt to win bipartisan support. Biden has proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Republicans have said that rolling back their 2017 tax cuts, which reduced the corporate rate from 35% to its current level, is a non-starter. In talks Wednesday with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Biden outlined a plan that would leave the corporate tax rate unchanged, at least for now, but would instead rely on a minimum corporate tax of 15%, aiming to ensure that profitable companies can’t avoid paying federal taxes, according to reports inThe Washington Postand other outlets.""Biden still wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, but that effort could now be pursued outside of the infrastructure negotiations,"" the Post’s Seung Min Kim and Tony Romm report. Biden reportedly also proposed increasing IRS enforcement on corporations and top earners who use loopholes to avoid taxes. Those two revenue-raising measures were already part of Biden’s tax plans, but the offer to set aside the corporate tax rate increase ""amounted to a major concession,"" Kim and Romm say — and represented ""an attempt by the White House to thread a delicate political needle"" by raising revenue while avoiding the GOP’s red line on the 2017 tax law. Republicans are still likely to oppose the revenue plans. Some have criticized Biden’s proposal to increase IRS funding by $80 billion over 10 years. And the 15% minimum corporate tax ""has been criticized by Republicans and some economists for being an inefficient way to increase taxes,"" Justin Sink and Laura Davison report atBloomberg News. ""Critics have said that imposing a minimum tax on profits would mean that companies would be less incentivized to spend money on things that Congress wants to promote, such as R&D or renewable energy, because they wouldn’t be able to claim those tax breaks.""Biden’s call for $1 trillion in new infrastructure spending is also about four times as high as the new spending included in Republicans’ latest offer. Republicans have said that Biden told them previously that existing spending plans could count toward the total, and their most recent $928 billion plan included about $257 billion in new outlays. The GOP plan calls for using unspent Covid relief funds and user fees for drivers to cover the costs of the infrastructure package. What’s next:""The GOP is considering another counteroffer that could come as soon as Friday, when Capito will be talking to Biden again, this time likely by phone. It’s unclear what that would look like — or even whether Republicans will make a new proposal,"" PoliticoreportedThursday morning, noting that some Republicans involved in the talks ""are starting to feel discouraged.""Number of the Day: 25 MillionThe Biden administration has announced that it plans to send at least 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine from U. S. stockpiles to other countries, and on Thursday the White Housereleased its planfor sharing the first 25 million doses. About 19 million doses will be shared through COVAX, the global vaccine initiative affiliated with the World Health Organization; 6 million will go to South and Central America, 7 million to Asia and 5 million to Africa. The other 6 million doses will be sent directly to what the White House referred to as ""regional priorities and partner recipients,"" a group that includes Mexico, Canada, the Republic of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Haiti, Egypt, Jordan, India, Iraq, and Yemen. Moving forward, the White House plans to share about 75% of its donated vaccines through COVAX, with the other 25% going toward ""immediate needs and to help with surges around the world.""More Progress in the Labor MarketInitial jobless claims hit another pandemic low last week, the Labor Department announced Thursday, with applications in state systems falling to 385,000. Another 76,000 people applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the temporary federal program that aids self-employed and gid workers, bringing the total to 461,000.""Claims are steadily coming down as the labor market strengthens,""saidHeidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute. ""Total initial claims are now around 40% what they were the first week of March, just shy of three months ago. This is a remarkable improvement.""Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at the consulting firm RSM,saidthe report is another sign that the U. S. economy is making a transition from recovery to growth, with full employment on the horizon. Still, initial claims are still more than twice what they were before the pandemic, and the labor market still shows signs of unusual distress. ""While the initial jobless claims report is encouraging,"" Brusuelas wrote, ""there are still 15.4 million people on some form of unemployment insurance, including 3.46 million on regular state benefits, 6.3 million on federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and 5.29 million on Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.""Government to Small Business Owners: No Relief for You, You’re Dead!The Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program, a federal effort created by Congress last year to provide $16 billion in aid to performance spaces that had to shut down during the Covid pandemic, has started to distribute funds, providing a lifeline to a subset of small business owners across the country. But the program took months to get off the ground and continues to be hounded by an odd problem: the federal government thinks some of its applicants are dead, even though they are very much alive. The New York Times’ Ben Sisario, Stacy Cowley and Julia Jacobs report:Bob Hansan, the managing partner of Bobby McKey’s, a piano bar near Washington, received a cryptic email Tuesday afternoon that began: ""Your name appears on the Do Not Pay list with the Match Source DMF.""A few minutes of frantic Googling revealed that was a reference to the government’s Death Master File, a record of more than 83 million people whose deaths have been reported to the Social Security Administration. Mr. Hansan immediately called Social Security’s headquarters, which referred him to his local office, which told Mr. Hansan that they could find no record of his name anywhere on the death list. The office agreed to send him a form affirming that he’s alive, but the document can only be sent by mail, he was told — a process he worries will be slow.""It’s this continual drip-drop of delays,"" he said. Another applicant, Michael Swier, the founder of the Bowery Ballroom and the Mercury Lounge in New York City, also was recently told that he is dead as far as the government is concerned, resulting in a denial of his grant application.""What do I do?

328,Investigation shows VA took nine months to dismiss physician who taunted suicidal patient,-2.33,48.67,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/07/29/investigation-shows-va-took-nine-months-to-dismiss-physician-who-taunted-suicidal-patient/,https://adfontesmedia.com/military-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,18,"Despite claims of increased accountability at the department in recent years, Veterans Affairs officials took nine months to sever ties with a physician who told a suicidal patient she did not care if he shot himself, according to a report released by the VA Inspector Generalthis week. The veteran died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound less than a week later. The episode — which took place at the Washington DC VA medical center, just a few miles away from the White House — stands in contrast to President Donald Trump’s frequent stump speech claims that “anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired” thanks tolegislation he signed into law in 2017. And it also calls into question the efficacy of VA officials’ recent efforts to emphasize all staffers’ role insuicide prevention, an issue that claims the lives of about 20 veterans and military members each day, even after years of intense focus on the issue. In a statement after the report release, DC Medical Center Director Mike Heimall said the conduct of the doctor involved in the case “is unacceptable and does not represent the dedication and compassion our employees exhibit daily.”The doctor was not named in the report. Investigators could not determine whether the veteran heard the comment by the physician — “(the patient) can go shoot (himself), I do not care” — during a medical discharge from the hospital in early 2019. The veteran, a patient in his 60s with a history of panic attacks and opioid withdrawal seizures, had been previously assessed as a moderate suicide risk. But when a team of physicians recommended his discharge with follow-up mental health consultation, the patient refused, prompting the physician to call campus police and shout the offensive comments. The patient died by suicide a few days later. Investigators could not say whether the patient ever heard the doctor’s comments, or whether they were a factor in the death. But the IG report says at least three other employees heard the comment and reported it to superiors. Despite that, the doctor continued to see and treat VA patients for another nine months, before her contract was terminated for additional abusive language towards other employees. DC hospital officials emphasized that “this person was never a VA employee, only worked on a contract basis and is no longer welcome at the facility.”However, investigators found reports of “verbal misconduct” by the contract physician dating back to fall 2018, including incidents involving the chief of the hospital’s emergency department and facility police. The report states that leadership at the facility opted not to cut ties with the problematic doctor earlier because they “believed that clinical reviews of the patient’s care were sufficient, and therefore did not pursue formal administrative reviews related to (the physician’s) pattern of verbal misconduct.”Heimall acknowledged that the incident “does not represent the quality health care tens of thousands of DC-area veterans have come to expect from our facilities” but also labeled it an “isolated” event. Officials at VA headquarters referred questions on the incident and the report to DC medical center staff and sidestepped questions about whether the event illustrates deeper problems within the department’s suicide prevention and accountability efforts. Critics have repeatedly sparred with the White House over the value of the 2017 Accountability Act, which Trump has insisted has helped reform the entire agency by jettisoning more than 9,000 problematic bureaucrats and medical staff since its passage.“People do a bad job for our vets, and they get fired,” Trump said in a July 19 online campaign speech to supporters. “It’s very simple … we had sadists in there, we had thieves in there, and you couldn’t do anything about it, whether it was for reasons of unions or civil service.”But union leaders have argued the measure has largely allowed supervisors to target lower-ranking employees for quicker dismissal, rather than removing toxic leaders more responsible for systemic issues. In the DC medical center case, contract issues appeared to supersede staff concerns. After the physician was finally removed, facility leaders pledged to report the problematic behavior to the National Practitioner Data Bank. The inspector general report comes about a month after the White House announced its new veterans suicide prevention roadmap, the culmination of 15 months of work designed to refocus local communities and all federal agencies on the issue. Among the initiatives emphasis is the idea that suicide is preventable if leaders and community members take the issue seriously and provide help to veterans. Heimall said his facility has implemented additional suicide prevention measures since the 2019 incident, to include “weekly randomized audits of 20 percent of all suicide-related patient emergency room” to ensure that staff are providing appropriate care and “a comprehensive education program regarding employee misconduct and patient abuse.”Veterans experiencing a mental health emergency can contact the Veteran Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255 and select option 1 for a VA staffer.

329,DHS Deputy Secretary reveals what's REALLY happening to 'kidnapped' protesters in Portland,24.33,21.67,https://www.glennbeck.com/federal-agents-kidnap-protesters-in-portland?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-beck-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-24,21,"Acting Deputy Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Ken Cuccinelli, joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Thursday. He came prepared to expose the leftist lies and detail the truth about what's really going on with federal agents in Portland, Oregon. Cuccinelli made it clear that claims of federal agents in unmarked cars ""kidnapping"" Portland protesters from the streets are patently false. Rather, agents are protecting federal buildings in a lawful, safe, and constitutional manner.""There are four federal agencies [in Portland] protecting the federal property. Three of them are from the Department of Homeland Security. The U. S. Marshals is the fourth, they guard the inside of the courthouse,"" explained Cuccinelli. He went on to explain that a little known division of the DHS, called the Federal Protective Service, protects thousands of federal properties across the country, and has been protecting the Mark O. Hatfield U. S. Courthouse in downtown Portland since it was built in 1997.""This is not a new mission. It's a 24/7, 365 mission. We've been there from the beginning of this courthouse being built, and the birth of the Department of Homeland Security,"" Cuccinelli said.""Our officers have bravely and resolutely done their duty and done their job to protect their facilities and people using them, and each other, of course,"" he continued. ""And with respect to the cars, we do use unmarked cars. I almost laughed when I heard [House Speaker]Nancy Pelosimaking this 'accusation.' Maybe she should check the San Francisco Police Department. You will find that every single law enforcement agency of any size in America uses unmarked vehicles, because they're safer for the officers and they're more effective for the mission. And we're not grabbing people off the street. The only people that we detain are people that match descriptions of offenders or who were just caught in the act.""Watch the video below for more details:To enjoy more of Glenn's masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos,subscribe to BlazeTV— the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution and live the American dream.",0,Problematic,0.2373701298701299,0.4490865800865801,480,0,Glenn Beck
330,Hurricane forecasters are monitoring two tropical waves far in the Atlantic for possible development,0.67,44.67,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/fl-ne-two-tropical-waves-20200827-mlxtwvbynzd35b3ut7htse5nfm-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/sun-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,21,"The fifth hurricane of the 2020 season is likely to form by Wednesday night as Tropical Storm Nana makes its approach toward Belize, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm’s forecast track projects that Nana will continue west across the Caribbean Sea, passing near but north of the coast of Honduras on Wednesday. It will likely approach the coast of Belize on Wednesday night and early Thursday, according to the NHC’s public advisory. Nana is expected to make landfall over Belize as a Category 1 hurricane, and wind shear is expected to limit its intensity, according to a forecast discussion. Nana, the season’s 14th tropical storm, formed Tuesday about 120 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. As of 8 a.m., Nana was about 150 miles northeast of Limon, Honduras, moving west at 18 mph with top winds of 60. A Category 1 hurricane forms when sustained winds are in the range of 74 to 95 mph. Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles from Nana’s center, the hurricane center said. Northern Honduras and coastal Guatemala are under a tropical storm watch, the southern Yucatan Peninsula is under a tropical storm warning, and the entire coast of Belize is under a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch. There have been four hurricanes so far in this busy Atlantic season: Hanna, Isais, Laura and Marco. Laura was the season’s first major hurricane, making landfall in Cameron, La., as a Category 4 on Aug. 27. Hanna, Isias and Marco were Category 1 hurricanes that made landfall in Padre Island, Texas; Ocean Isle Beach, N. C.; and at the mouth of the Mississippi River, respectively. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Omar is weakening over the open Atlantic. Omar, the season’s 15th tropical storm, formed about 225 miles east of Cape Hatteras, N. C., on Tuesday, about five hours after Nana, according to the NHC. Tropical Storm Omar was about 350 miles northwest of Bermuda, the NHC said Wednesday in its 5 a.m. advisory. It was moving east-northeast at 14 mph, with 40 mph winds and higher gusts. It is not expected to strengthen much and it is likely to significantly weaken throughout the day on Thursday, becoming a remnant low by Thursday night, the NHC said in its outlook. The system is expected to continue its curve away from land, moving in a northeast to eastward motion off the U. S. East Coast. An area of the Atlantic midway between the Windward Islands and the west coast of Africa is bustling with activity from two tropical waves. One is an area of low pressure with showers and thunderstorms that is slowly becoming better organized, the hurricane center said. The other is expected to move off the coast of Africa on Wednesday and merge with a disturbance a couple hundred miles southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands, the hurricane center said. If and when the disturbances merge, the system will develop and could become a tropical depression by the weekend as it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. This is the time of year when storms tend to form in the open Atlantic, particularly near the Cabo Verde Islands. Those storms, which grow in size and intensity as they make the long trek westward across the Atlantic Ocean, are historically the most powerful and destructive hurricanes. The remaining monikers for named storms this season in the Atlantic are: Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred. In August, the federal government issued an updated forecast for the season,predicting as many as 25 storms, which is more than the agency has ever forecast. The tropical weather experts at Colorado State University predicted that 2020 could possibly be thesecond-busiest season on record, behind only 2005, the year that produced Katrina and Wilma.",3,Reliable,0.064095744680851,0.476063829787234,782,3,Sun Sentinel
331,A Daring Left and a Cowed Center,16.67,30.67,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/08/a-daring-left-and-a-cowed-center/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"The first fact of sociopolitical life in America today is this: liberals in elite positions are frightened of the Left. A college president may direct an institution with a $900 million endowment, meet with legislators and business heads, and boast a 30-year record of academic honors, but the sight of eight African American undergrads marching toward his office with scowls on their faces alarms him like nothing else. A CEO may draw a $3 million salary and manage 1,300 workers, but the threat of a boycott coming from a few networked Millennials with ties to Sleeping Giant calls for immediate emergency action. They know what they’re up against. Leftists form digital mobs, shut down events, block access, cancel, and dox. They show up at people’s homes, harass employers, and ruin businesses. They’re ruthless, they’re irrational, but the tantrums they throw muck up the works and clog the pipes. That’s the advantage they press—they will tear the system down if the people in power don’t comply. A liberal in charge of an organization is particularly vulnerable. His job is to do precisely the opposite of clogging. He must maintain the flow, keep the wheels turning, and the money coming. His highest ideal is stability. He doesn’t believe very deeply in Truth, Honor, Integrity, and Fairness, but he’s not cynical. He doesfavorthose virtues, but he knows not to clasp them too closely. That road, he understands, leads to conflict. Conflict, however, is the Left’s primary method, not resolution. In the 1960s, when youth protests hit the campus and the streets, liberal leaders were baffled by the frequent absence of clear and distinct priorities laid out by the protesters. Oh, there were lots of specifics, but the crowds’ actions seemed to exceed the content of their stipulations. The concessions liberals made to demonstrators didn’t appear to satisfy them even though the concessions were exactly what the demonstrators asked for. There was an antic, anarchic character to the mass that didn’t fall sway to negotiation. Liberals in charge kept asking themselves, “What exactly do they want? What’s their agenda?” Protesters talked about “the system” and other hazy conditions that were too abstract and cosmic for high-level bureaucrats to address. It was very confusing for them,and that was the point: to keep officials uncertain and off-balance. If liberals never quite understood what these unpredictable characters would do next, if they saw that the protesters didn’t give a damn about the institution for which the liberals were responsible, the intimidation worked. This is where liberals in power are now. They aim for a peaceful, prosperous society wherein nobody pushes the strong beliefs—God, family, nation—too strongly. Let’s all get along. But the crowd to their left is volatile, and it senses a moment of opportunity. Not long ago, hard leftists were marginal figures in liberal institutions, from the New York Timesto Yale University to the Democratic Party. Now, they run a fair portion of the operations, including human resource departments in corporate America. Liberal leaders dislike the dynamic, but they can’t face down the Left. So they choose another tactic: to fabricate dangerous terrorism forming on the Right. When we compare the facts of right-wing violence against liberal anxieties over it, we have to judge those professed anxieties either as a cynical maneuver or a pathological defense mechanism. I favor the latter. I’ve heard too many liberals express their concerns with too much sincerity to think otherwise. The grave distress over a dangerous, anti-democratic Right looks like a way for liberals to appease or distract their leftist accusers, though liberals may not realize exactly what they’re doing. The ridiculous overreaction to a putative white nationalist threat doesn’t just foster liberal politics, for instance, turning Donald Trump into a demon that must go. It also serves a psychic need. By postulating a right-wing menace, liberals can work off the nervousness that leftists cause them by applying it to a substitute object. Their tension with the far Left is displaced onto tension with an imagined far-Right, one that does indeed allow them to speak out. College presidents can’t confront leftist protesters and punish them for violations of academic codes. Still, they can broadcast with fervor their abhorrence of the “haters” on the Right who have caused those protesters to suffer. Whatever actually happened at the Capitol on Wednesday, liberal leaders have expressed their alarm in such solemn and dismayed tones one can sense a profound relief behind their words. The discord liberals have felt in their relations with the radical Left now dissipates in the sober condemnation of the Trump hordes. For a moment, liberals may unite with the Left in a reassuring unity. The rioters have given them a fresh opening to tell their overheated comrades: “See?—If not for us, these right-wing crazies would seize the reins and victimize you all over again.”The liberal elite has a profound interest in maintaining this right-wing danger. The window-breakers at the Capitol have done them a great favor. While left-wing riots proceeded all summer, liberals had to keep their mouths shut. The hard Left had taught them to watch what they say, and it couldn’t have made the elite comfortable, not when they care so much about a status quo that keeps them in high places. Leftists are quite right to cast the status quo and “the system” as dubious things. This is where the liberal elite is most vulnerable. All too many conservatives and establishment Republicans fail to recognize this dynamic. They don’t see that when liberal elites sign on to “systemic racism” and other leftist concoctions that liberals are not endorsing an ideology. No,they are protecting themselves. The failure to discern liberal motives may be because establishment Republicans, too, have an investment in thestatus quo. It’s done well by them, and it’s made them just as scared of the fractious Left as liberal elites are. That was the big problem with Donald Trump. He wasn’t scared. The guilt trips, the accusations, #TheResistance . . . none of it fazed him. He didn’t worry about leftist students and activist groups and community organizers and digital mobs targeting him, occupying his office, running through 10 years of Facebook posts, or picketing outside his building. He could have worried about them, but he didn’t. It wasn’t in his character. That is why leftists and liberals hated him so, and why establishment Republicans wanted him gone. He wouldn’t play the game. Now that his presidency is over, it remains to be seen whether Republicans will go back to the old rules or not. It all depends on this: have enough conservative voters been awakened to the sham that if Republicans sustain it, they will be punished in 2022?",1,Questionable,0.0189971508083753,0.3978986659598904,1512,0,American Greatness

On July 12, dozens of Texas House Democrats walked out of a special legislative session and boarded flights to Washington, where they have remained since. The move left the Republicans without the quorum required to conduct legislative business. The Democrats used the move to thwart the passage of Republican-led election reform legislation. In Washington, they’re pushing for the passage of the Democrats’ federal level election reform bill, which would vastly expand federal control of elections and usher in nationwide vote-by-mail. The Democrats’ trip was funded by Powered By People, the election advocacy group run by former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas). The group had raised more than $500,000 as of last week. The Democrats have vowed to stay in Washington for the duration of the special session and possibly longer. According to their estimates, it’s costing $10,000 a day to be there. Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer (D-Texas) told CNN on July 10 before Democrats walked out of the Texas special session: “The message is very clear: America, we need to wake up, we need to preserve our democracy, we need a federal voting rights solution, and we need it now.“This is a now or never moment. We’re holding the line in Texas, and we’re going to fight with all our might. But even if we were to fix this problem in Texas, it doesn’t solve the problem for the rest of the nation.”Paxton said Democrats who return from Washington could be arrested as soon as they enter Texas as long as the special session is ongoing. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott can call another special session as soon as the current one expires in early August.“Ultimately I believe we'll vote on this issue, so all they’re doing is wreaking havoc on the lives of other legislators,” Abbott said.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1191614906832298,0.4578467908902692,510,0,Epoch Times
333,Return of season brings 'sense of normalcy' for cross country runners — even with new rules,-0.67,46.0,https://tucson.com/sports/high-school/return-of-season-brings-sense-of-normalcy-for-cross-country-runners-even-with-new-rules/article_3f0c306f-5730-5440-98aa-380a3ae5210f.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/arizona-daily-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-20,25,"With a late start, drastically shortened season and modified race protocols, high school cross country is both back and already almost over. And despite cross country being one of the safest sports to play during the COVID-19 pandemic, participation is down. Coaches cite a number of reasons, ranging from parents’ safety concerns to school district rules and transportation issues. Officials with the Arizona Interscholastic Association and its high schools have worked hard to make sure runners still have a season. And even though competition lasts a little over a month — it started in September and ends next Wednesday, — participants and their parents have been grateful, AIA cross country tournament coordinator David Shapiro said.“Our top priority has been to give our student-athletes some sort of competition and sense of normalcy. Our goal was to be able to target them to have a season of competition, more so than to put bodies in the bleachers,” Shapiro said. “I’ve had parents tell me, ‘We’re so grateful that our child is out there and has an outlet and a sense of, hey my life is still going on.’”Shapiro, who said he’s had “a lot of sleepless nights” since March, said the state is all over the place when it comes to individual high schools and their willingness to compete. Earlier this week, a high school that previously opted out of the cross country season informed Shapiro that it would be participating in sectionals. A few other schools have recently changed course in the other direction, saying they’d hold their own competitions instead. Regionals are set for the beginning of November.“We’re just trying to stay on top of everything and give member schools a chance to compete,” Shapiro said. When the AIA announced in September that there would be a cross country season, it implemented two pages’ worth of guidelines for practices and meets that coaches, athletes and parents must adhere to. The list went over wellness checks, social distancing, mask usage and the implementation of designated workers to tend to injured runners and distribute water. The initial challenge wasn’t in implementing the new rules, Shapiro said, but rather finding facilities to hold events. With different counties using different metrics to define their safety thresholds and phased reentries, finding locations has been tough. In a typical cross country season, there will be upwards of 75 invitationals held across the state, Shapiro said. This year, there have been roughly two dozen. The reduced number of meets is a result of a variety of factors, including school boards not allowing invitationals due to safety concerns and the lack of availability of parks due to coronavirus guidelines. In Pima County, for example, parks in Oro Valley and Marana reopened weeks before the city of Tucson’s parks. Delayed park openings meant that some schools weren’t able to hold cross country meets until earlier this month. Schools are also seeing far fewer competitors due to several mitigating factors. Kids who are learning from home have to get to school to practice, which has proven difficult for student-athletes with parents who work until 5 p.m., said Bridget Barber, the girls cross country coach at Tucson High, which had its first meet of the season on Oct. 7. Many districts also aren’t offering transportation to meets, which has proven a problem for runners with parents who don’t drive. Barber said she’s heard of Catalina High School runners who have been taking the city bus to meets, saying the task is “not easy.”“The kids at practice right now are the kids that have parents that can bring them at that time,” Barber said, adding that athletes that can’t make it to practice are finding other times to work with their coaches. “These kids that are coming out, they’re getting the work done.”Some districts took their time in deciding whether there would even be a cross country season. Those athletes who weren’t already training on their own had to get up to speed in a month. At Tucson High, there are typically 14 members on each the boys and girls teams. This year, that number is eight and seven. At other schools, the gap is larger. Rincon/University’s girls team dropped from 30 last year to just 11 this year. The AIA isn’t tracking overall participation, but Shapiro said “it’s way down,” and that he’s only heard of one team in the state that is larger this year than it was last year. Rio Rico High School senior Roshan Tinoco-Miranda approaches the finish line of Saturday’s John Gleeson Lancer Invitational cross country meet at Rolling Hills Golf Course. Miranda finished the race in first with a final time of 15:36.0, a new course record.“Cross country numbers have been declining for many years, especially at schools like Pueblo, Tucson and Cholla, but the races are also seeing limited participation this year because the organizers are capping the size of the race for reduced transmission of any virus that might be around,” Barber said. There are other, noncoronavirus-related reasons behind the decreased participation, Barber said, including a lack of physical education class in elementary schools and AIA recruiting rules that forbid high school coaches from talking to students before they graduate from eighth grade. If a potential runner hasn’t attended an open house and signed a letter of interest, the path to the cross country team isn’t exactly direct.“If they don’t have the knowledge to call a school or know how to sign up over the summer, then you are relying on a kid being self-propelling enough to find the athletic office and get the info,” Barber said. “It takes years to build a culture of running.”Tucson High sophomore Briana Levengood said the modified season and its impending end feels unusual, but is grateful to be competing at all.“I was just hoping we’d still have a season,” Levengood, 15, said. Also a spring track athlete, Levengood was two meets into the season when it was called off.“It’s definitely been weird. We used to meet at school and now we’re meeting at Reid Park,” Levengood said. “Coaches take our temperatures when we show up for practice and we have to wear a mask the whole time except for when we’re running.”Levengood said it took about a month for the Badgers to get used to the safety protocols. They’ve resigned themselves to the abridged season, but with several seniors on the girls team, some of her teammates are “kind of bummed out.”“It’s been hard to know exactly what’s going on, just because it changes so much,” Levengood said. It hasn’t been easy for anyone, but with a location for state championships finally nailed down, Shapiro is feeling a bit better. Tucson High sophomore Briana Levengood high-fives teammate Sofi Guerra after crossing the finish line Saturday. This year’s state meet will be held at Crossroads Park in Gilbert. The city recently increased its allowance to 100 people per field, making Crossroads Park — with its 10 fields — the only venue large enough to hold even a scaled-down version of the state meet. Two divisions will compete per day and only the top third of the state’s teams will be invited, as opposed to the typical top 50%. The AIA will use tracking chips and staggered start times to prevent crowding at the starting line, which will also help prevent jam-ups at the finish. Those two areas are the major points of concern when it comes to viral transmission. Shapiro called this year unusual, saying “the key word is flexibility.”During a year unlike any other, it’s important to be that way.“Sometimes I feel like I’m treading water in the ocean in a typhoon sometimes, just trying to keep my head above water and trying to help our coaches and athletes get through the season,” Shapiro said",3,Reliable,0.0597121272751524,0.4541706985824632,1668,3,Arizona Daily Star

Turnbull was scheduled to visit campus in March as part of CU Boulder’s Distinguished Speakers Board series, but the event was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.“We’re disappointed he can’t be on campus due to the ongoing public health challenges from COVID-19, but we’re still excited to have a conversation with him virtually. To have that kind of experience with a world leader is really exciting,” said CU Boulder senior Ally Roberts, chair of the Distinguished Speakers Board. Turnbull was Australia’s prime minister from 2015 to 2018, during which time Parliament legalized same-sex marriage. Turnbull has also been a vocal advocate for cutting greenhouse gases and ending the use of coal and other fossil fuels.“We’re really eager to hear his insight and perspective on the Australian bushfires and climate change, and how those inform the wildfires that have broken out in Colorado and the West Coast,” Roberts said. One advantage of the virtual event is that it will have a much larger capacity than previous talks, Roberts said — up to 3,000 people will be able to livestream Turnbull’s talk, his discussion with students and question-and-answer session with viewers. Students will moderate part of the discussion and ask Turnbull questions, which are curated by the board, Roberts said. Student questions will focus on climate change, the election, the United States’ relationship with Australia and Turnbull’s experiences as prime minister, said Distinguished Speakers Board Director of Public Relations Noah Hubbard, as well as advice for students who want to go into public affairs.“It will be really interesting to have a global perspective from someone who has been a world leader on climate change,” Hubbard said.

335,Congressman Roger Marshall defeats Kris Kobach in Kansas Republican Senate primary,0.67,46.33,https://www.kansascity.com/article244717957.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-04,17,"Congressman Roger Marshall defeated Kris Kobach in the Kansas Republican race for U. S. Senate Tuesday, a victory driven by a party establishment that considered the OB-GYN from Great Bend the best chance of continuing 81 years of uninterrupted GOP control of the state’s Senate seats. Marshall and Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state, fought bitterly in the primary, engaging in intense mudslinging over who was the true conservative and staunchest ally of President Donald Trump. The Associated Press called the race for Marshall shortly after 9 p.m. According to the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, Marshall had 39% of the vote to Kobach’s 26% with three-quarters of precincts reporting. Bob Hamilton, a Kansas City area businessman who spent millions of his own wealth to blanket the airwaves with ads, had 19%.“Keeping the Republican majority is at stake, that the Republican majority in this country may well go through Kansas and we are the backstop” Marshall told supporters Tuesday night. Marshall took a call from Trump in front of supporters, putting him on speakerphone. Trump, who declined to endorse during the primary, congratulated Marshall on an “incredible race.”Marshall, a second-term representative who represents the state’s vast 1st District, will face Democrat Barbara Bollier in the general election. Bollier, a former Republican and current state senator from the Johnson County community of Mission Hills, is poised to wage the most competitive Democratic challenge for Senate in Kansas in years.“It’s clear to me that we need change in Washington, and we need to end the era of hyper-partisanship and division. People just want our elected leaders to work together to get things done. That was obvious before this pandemic, and it’s even clearer now,” Bollier said in a statement. The election culminates a stunning fall for Kobach, an informal adviser to Trump who carved out a national reputation as an immigration hardliner. Kobach had staked his chances of electoral redemption on a primary victory after he lost the 2018 governor’s race to Democrat Laura Kelly. But groups with ties to national Republicans spent millions urging voters to reject Kobach for fear that he would again lose to a Democrat if nominated. The effort resulted in brutal TV ads highlighting how he hadn’t been chosen for a position in the Trump administration and his campaign had paid a volunteer who posted on white nationalist websites.“I voted for Marshall. I just like information that I had,” said John Bevan, an 85-year-old retired school administrator in Newton. “Kobach, I had questions about him … there’s a lot of publicity coming out saying that he couldn’t make Trump’s cabinet and other things, financial things, dealings that he had.”Money flowed into the race on all sides. In the final eight days before the election, outside groups booked $2.5 million in pro-Marshall and anti-Kobach TV ads, according to Medium Buying, which tracks ad purchases. A pro-Kobach group bought $419,000 in air time while a “meddling” group running ads likely to prop up Kobach purchased $2.3 million in air time.“Republican voters have chosen to put their best foot forward and given us the best chance to send a common sense conservative to the Senate,” said David Kensinger, a longtime Kansas Republican strategist. The Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law described the victory as the “first skirmish to stop Chuck Schumer’s brazen Senate power grab was fought tonight in Kansas” — a reference to TV ads run by a group linked to national Democrats designed to boost Kobach in the primary. The SLF spent $2.1 million supporting Marshall in the race. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Young said he was “more confident than ever” the Kansas seat would remain in Republican hands. Kobach, acknowledging defeat, immediately urged Republicans to back Marshall.“We will hold this seat and I will do everything I can to make sure that happens for the Republican party,” Kobach said during his concession speech. The general election will pit doctor against doctor as the coronavirus continues to grip Kansas and much of the nation. Both Marshall and Bollier feature their medical backgrounds prominently in their campaigns and are likely to lean on their credentials as they try to connect with voters this fall. Marshall has talked about how he’s delivered thousands of babies and even tried, unsuccessfully, to be listed as “Doc Roger Marshall” on the ballot. Bollier, a retired anesthesiologist, originally pitched her slogan as “Washington is sick, send a doctor” before the pandemic emerged.“Clearly, Dr. Marshall takes away the doctor card from Bollier, and she uses it all the time, on the (Kansas) Senate floor, the House floor, and in her commercials,” Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, said in a statement in July. Despite their shared profession, the two physicians have sharply split over their response to the coronavirus. Marshall has campaigned in-person throughout the state, shaking hands and often going maskless. Bollier has rarely left her home, instead hosting virtual campaign events over Zoom. Still, Bollier assembled an extraordinary fundraising machine that shattered previous records for Democrats in Kansas. Bollier left the Republican party in 2018 over frustrations with Trump and GOP hostility toward LGBTQ rights. As a candidate, she has mostly sidestepped Trump.“On the campaign trail, she has proven herself as a capable and compassionate leader who will always put Kansans first,” said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, a group that works to elect Democratic women. National Republican groups, which rallied to Marshall’s side during the primary, are likely to again come to his aid in the fall. Some Republicans also predict Marshall will muster a stronger, more competitive campaign against Bollier than Kobach would have.“It’s going to help Republicans up and down the ballot,” Kelly Arnold, a former Kansas Republican Party chairman, said. “I know Congressman Marshall will have the resources and invest those resources into our get out the vote campaign … to make sure not only Roger Marshall is elected but all of our candidates.”The Kansas City Star’s Bryan Lowry and The Wichita Eagle’s Michael Stavola contributed reporting",3,Reliable,0.1932361999526179,0.4974946695095947,1345,3,Kansas City Star

That McCarthy can’t simply acknowledge what happened gives you a good look at how he’s been twisted by his loyalty to a vulgar talking yam. But even worse was his campaign against Rep.

From:Unmentioned is the fact that Swalwell went to the FBI and was quite open about his connection to Fang, and that the FBI has cleared him of any possible security problems.

(There’s a move afoot now to have her expelled from the House entirely. This may cause McCarthy to combust spontaneously.)

Patrick Sviteck of the Texas Tribunereportedon Twitter, “Abbott tells TPPF he wants to make TX a “2A sanctuary state” this session “so that no gov’t official at any level can come & take your gun away from you despite those ppl who say, ‘Heck yes, we’re gonna take your gun.’ We’re gonna say, ‘Heck no, you cannot take ppl’s guns'” in TX.”Abbott’s quip about taking people’s guns was in response to Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke remarks during the 2019 Democrat presidential debates where he explicitly called for gun confiscation. Abbott tells TPPF he wants to make TX a ""2A sanctuary state"" this session ""so that no gov't official at any level can come & take your gun away from you despite those ppl who say, 'Heck yes, we're gonna take your gun.' We're gonna say, 'Heck no, you cannot take ppl's guns'"" in TX— Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek)January 14, 2021Abbott’s comment came after a number of Texas counties began to declare themselves as “Second Amendment sanctuaries” throughout 2020. Daniel Friend ofThe Texanreportedthat “By early 2020, commissioners inover 60 counties— often with the support of the county sheriff — had passed some sort of Second Amendment sanctuary resolution.”Two elected officials have filed different versions of the Texas Firearm Protection Act, which Greg Abbott pushed back in 2013 when he was Attorney General. The TFPA is a piece of legislation that would ban law enforcement from enforcing federal gun control schemes “that purports to regulate a firearm, a firearm accessory, or firearm ammunition if the statute, order, rule, or regulation imposes a prohibition, restriction, or other regulation, such as a capacity or size limitation, a registration requirement, or a background check, that does not exist under the laws of this state.”State Representative Steve Toth introducedHouse Bill (HB) 112and State Representative Ben Leman introducedHB 919— both of 2021’s version of the TFPA. At a Texas Public Policy Foundation event, Abbott emphasized his pro-Tenth Amendment credentials by stating that “I still hold a record that will never be broken by anybody. I hold the record for the most lawsuits filed against Barack Obama — 31 legal actions against him.”The Texas Governor added, “We had to because the actions he was taking trampled upon Texas’ liberties based upon the Tenth Amendment. We need to go back to the fundamentals of the Tenth Amendment and reassert that against any potential encroachments that we see under the Biden administration.”Thesanctuary movementis arguably one of the brightest spots for the right heading into the Biden era. Despite Democrat control at the federal level, there will be more paths for reform available at the state and local level. This should make Second Amendment operatives realize that not all politics is federal. Plus, gaining in power in D. C. necessitates having strong local political machines. Fighting Second Amendment battles at the state and local level is a good way to build a power base. As cliche as it may sound, all politics is still local.

338,Donald Trump Impeachment Proceedings Timeline 2021,-2.67,47.0,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a35179950/donald-trump-impeachment-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/harpers-bazaar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-16,16,"Former president Donald Trump was acquitted from charges of inciting an insurrection in his second impeachment trial, allowing him to run for and hold office in the future. Last month, the House of Representatives voted to impeach former president Donald Trump, making him the first president in U. S. history to be impeached twice. House Democrats formally introduced the article of impeachment againstTrumpin early January, charging him for abetting a mob of his supporters tostorm the U. S. Capitolthe week before. This move follows Republicans' rejecting a resolution that called on Vice President Mike Pence to strip Trump of his presidential powers by invoking the25th Amendment. Read on for a timeline of the impeachment proceedings and follow this story for updates. In a 57-to-43 vote, in which seven Republican senators joined Democrats, Donald Trump was acquitted in his second impeachment trial. Though the prosecution gained a majority of votes, they lacked the supermajority required to convict the former president. The GOP senators who crossed party lines in favor of conviction were Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania. Minutes after voting to acquit Trump, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted the former president for ""a disgraceful dereliction of duty.""""Fellow Americans beat and bloodied our own police. They stormed the Senate floor. They tried to hunt down the Speaker of the House. They built a gallows and chanted about murdering the Vice President,"" McConnell said, perCNN. ""They did this because they had been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth—because he was angry he'd lost an election. Former President Trump's actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty.""McConnell also held Trump personally accountable for the January 6 insurrection. ""There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day,"" he said, adding that Trump also ""did not act swiftly"" to restore order and denounce the actions of the Capitol mob. Despite this, McConnell reasoned his vote to acquit the former president as a question of constitutionality. ""If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge,"" he said. ""But in this case, that question is moot. Because former President Trump is constitutionally not eligible for conviction.""In early January, McConnell refused to call the Senate back into session to hold the impeachment trial for Trump, who was then still in office. Since Trump was ultimately found not guilty, he is not barred from running for office in the future. Trump's lawyers spent three hours presenting their defense of the former president to the Senate, earning praise from GOP allies in the chamber. As part of their prosecution, House impeachment managers showed parts of Trump's speech that preceded the insurrection, in which he says, “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”In an attempt to paint these words as figurative, Trump's lawyers presented a video montage showing Democratic politicians also using the wordin political speeches and rallies.""To claim that the president in any way wished, desired or encouraged lawless or violent behavior is a preposterous and monstrous lie,"" said lawyer Michael van der Veen, perBBC. ""In fact, the first two messages the president sent via Twitter once the incursion at the Capitol began were 'Stay Peaceful' and 'No violence because we are the party of law and order.'""After the defense was presented, senators then questioned both parties. On the third day of impeachment proceedings, House impeachment managers wrapped up their case to prosecute former president Trump, also urging Republican senators to convict lest an acquittal would set a dangerous precedent. The prosecution again invoked the explicitly violent security camera footage aired the day before, and also emphasized that Trump has still yet to apologize for the carnage incurred on that day, including five deaths and injuries among Capitol officers.“President Trump’s lack of remorse and refusal to take accountability during the attack shows his state of mind,” said Representative Ted Lieu, one of the impeachment managers, per.“It shows that he intended the events of Jan. 6 to happen. And when it did, he delighted in it.”House impeachment managers showed never-before-seen security footage from the day of the Capitol insurrection as part of their case against the former president. This footage ""will provide new insight into both the extreme violence that everyone saw, the risk and the threat that it could have led to further violence and death to many but for the brave actions of the officers and shows really the extent of what Donald Trump unleashed on our Capitol,"" aides told reporters, perNBC. In his opening remarks to the Senate, Representative Jamie Raskin said, perCNN, ""It will show that Donald Trump surrendered his role as commander in chief and became the inciter in chief of a dangerous insurrection, and this was as one of our colleagues put it so cogently on January 6 itself, the greatest betrayal of the presidential oath in the history of the United States.""The graphic 13-minute montage shows Trump supporters breaking windows of the Capitol building and surging toward Capitol police officers. Virgin Islands Delegate Stacey Plaskett presented the new evidence on the Senate floor. ""It was an attack to our republic, to our democratic process,"" she said of the mob. The trial formally began at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, starting with a four-hour debate on the constitutionality of impeaching a president who is no longer in office. Afterward, in a 56–44 vote, the Senate voted to proceed with Trump's second impeachment trial, rejecting his defense team's claims that impeaching a former president was unconstitutional. The vote, which saw six Republicans cross party lines to join the Democrats, may still indicate that Trump has enough GOP support to be acquitted. In order for Trump to be convicted, at least 17 Republican senators would need to join the 50 Democratic senators to reach the supermajority threshold. The Republicans who voted to proceed with the trial were Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania. During the trial, Democrats undercut Trump's claims of unconstitutionality by noting that legal scholar Brian Kalt, who the defense cited 15 times in their brief per,had publicly disputed their interpretation of his work. The day before the trial, Kalt tweeted, ""The article favored late impeachability, but it set out all the evidence I found on both sides--lots for them to use. But in several places, they misrepresent what I wrote quite badly. ... Again, my article presented all of the evidence I found on both sides, so there was lots for them to use fairly. They didn't have to be disingenuous and misleading like this. The House managers' brief cited my article a lot too and, to their credit, did so honestly.""As Colorado representative Joe Neguse said during the trial, per the,""Professor Kalt's position—which they had to have known because it is in the article that they cite in the brief—is that removal is 'not the sole end of impeachment.' Actually, in that same article he describes the view advocated by President Trump's lawyers as having deep flaws.""In thebrief, Trump's lawyers denied the House's allegations and denounced the impeachment proceedings as ""political theater."" His team also disputed the constitutionality of the Senate trying a former president. Hours later,House impeachment managers respondedin a memo, saying Trump's defense was ""wholly without merit.""House impeachment managers made a surprise request for the former president to testify under oath during his Senate trial, which his lawyers quickly rejected.""Two days ago, you filed an answer in which you denied many factual allegations set forth in the article of impeachment,"" wrote Maryland representative Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, in a letter addressed to Trump, per. Raskin referred to Trump's defense denying the allegations put forth in the House's 80-page trial brief, including attempts to overturn election results and inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol. ""You have thus attempted to put critical facts at issue notwithstanding the clear and overwhelming evidence of your constitutional offense.”Raskin noted that former presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton had both testified while in office, ""so there is no doubt that you can testify in these proceedings. Indeed, whereas a sitting President might raise concerns about distraction from their official duties, that concern is obviously implacable here.""Per the,Trump's lawyers dismissed the request as a ""public relations stunt.""In the brief, Democratic impeachment managers argue ""President Trump's singular responsibility for that tragedy.""""President Trump falsely asserted that he won the 2020 election and then sought to overturn its results,"" they wrote in the brief. ""He also tried to convince state and federal election officials and law enforcement personnel to attempt to reverse the election outcome. These attempts failed, too. The only honorable path at that point was for President Trump to accept the results and concede his electoral defeat. Instead, he summoned a mob to Washington, exhorted them into a frenzy, and aimed them like a loaded cannon down Pennsylvania Avenue.""Read thefull briefhere. In turn, Trump's defense team filed a 14-page response denying that he had any involvement in the Capitol insurrection.""It is denied that President Trump incited the crowd to engage in destructive behavior. It is denied that the phrase 'if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore' had anything to do with the action at the Capitol as it was clearly about the need to fight for election security in general, as evidenced by the recording of the speech,"" they wrote. Read Trump'sfull responsehere. David Schoen, a lawyer who previously represented Trump adviser Roger J. Stone, and Bruce Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, have joined Trump's legal defense team.“Notably, Schoen has already been working with the 45th president and other advisers to prepare for the upcoming trial, and both Schoen and Castor agree that this impeachment is unconstitutional—a fact 45 senators voted in agreement with last week,” the news release said, per. Schoen and Castor's arrival comes after the former president split with his lead lawyer, Butch Bowers, and four other members of the defense team. A source told thethat the departure marked a disagreement in strategy between Trump and the lawyers, with the former wanting the defense to focus on his baseless accusations of election fraud. The Senate struck down a motion by Republican senator Rand Paul that would have dismissed the impeachment proceedings of Donald Trump as unconstitutional since he is no longer in office. Though the motion was rejected, the vote count—55 to 45—indicated that Democrats may not have enough Republican senators to convict Trump at trial. At least 17 Republicans would have to join Democrats in order for the former president to be convicted, but only five members of his party—Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, and Patrick J. Toomey—voted to reject the GOP motion.“I think it’s pretty obvious from the vote today that it is extraordinarily unlikely that the president will be convicted,” said Collins, per.“Just do the math.”Though the math is currently against conviction, some members of the GOP may yet be swayed by the time the trial is expected to start on February 9. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has not yet committed to a stance. “The trial hasn’t started yet,” he toldCNN. “And I intend to participate in that and listen to the evidence.”The impeachment process against former president Donald Trump will advance Monday evening as the House of Representatives prepares to send its article of impeachment to the Senate. This ceremonial proceeding involves House impeachment managers walking the article across the U. S. Capitol to the Senate, where Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland will read the article on the chamber floor. The trial isexpected to beginthe week of February 8. Senate leaders agreed to delay the impeachment proceedings against former president Donald Trump by two weeks in order to give President Joe Biden an adequate amount of time to appoint members of his Cabinet and push forward his legislative agenda, reported.""We all want to put this awful chapter in our nation's history behind us,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, per the.""But healing and unity will only come if there is truth and accountability. And that is what this trial will provide.""The two-week delay—in which the Senate will spend confirming Cabinet members and working on another COVID-19 relief bill—is also intended to allow time for Trump's legal team and House impeachment managers to draft and exchange pre-trial briefs. Exactly one week since Trump incited a mob of his supporters to violently seize the U. S. Capitol, the House has formally voted to impeach the 45th president for the second time, charging him with ""incitement of insurrection."" In a 197-232 vote, 10 members of the Republican Party also joined House Democrats to impeach the president, marking a break from partisan lines that characterized his first impeachment in 2019 (at the time, Republicans unanimously voted against impeaching Trump). Now, Trump will face a trial by the Senate, in which the majority leader, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, has reportedly backed the House's decision, according to. Sources close to McConnell told the paper that the second impeachment will ""will make it easier to purge Mr. Trump from the party.""Though McConnell has not yet committed to convicting the president, several sources from the Republican party toldthat, with his support, Trump will almost certainly be convicted. ""If Mitch is a yes, he's done,"" one anonymous Senate GOP source told the outlet.""The President must be impeached, and, I believe, the President must be convicted by the Senate,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosisaid todayon the House floor, ""a constitutional remedy that will ensure that the republic will be safe from this man who is so resolutely determined to tear down the things that we hold dear and that hold us together.""With a 205-223 vote largely split between party lines, the House formally approved a resolution on Tuesday night calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment in order to strip Trump of his presidential powers. Before the vote, Pence sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing that he does not intend on invoking the 25th Amendment. ""Last week, I did not yield to pressure to exert power beyond my constitutional authority to determine the outcome of the election,"" Pence wrote, referring to Trump calling on him to show""extreme courage""by overturning November's election results. ""And I will not now yield to efforts in the House of Representatives to play political games at a time so serious in the life of our Nation.""Pence went on to say that the purpose of the 25th Amendment ""is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th Amendment in such a manner would set a terrible precedent.""With his decision, the House is now set to vote on impeachment. Thefour-page resolutioncites the 14th Amendment, which bars anyone who has ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" in the United States from holding public office, against Trump. The document indicates that the president has ""repeatedly issued false statements"" about a fraudulent election and ""willfully made statements that ... encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the Capitol,"" as well as notes ""his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the results of the 2020 Presidential election"" such as calling Georgia's secretary of state to ""find"" votes that would give him victory. The House will vote on the resolution later this week, perCNN. The article of impeachment follows House Republicans' rejection of aresolution calling on Vice President Mike Penceto activate the 25th Amendment and thereby strip Trump of his presidential powers.“The House Republicans rejected this legislation to protect America, enabling the President’s unhinged, unstable and deranged acts of sedition to continue,"" said Speaker Nancy Pelosi in astatementtoday. “We are further calling on the Vice President to respond within 24 hours after passage. As our next step, we will move forward with bringing impeachment legislation to the Floor. The President’s threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action.”reported that more than 210 House Democrats have signed on to the charge and that several Republicans are also considering voting for impeachment, though Republican Party leaders are opposed. As of Saturday,CNNreported that Pence had not yet ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment, which enables the vice president and other public authorities to strip a president of their powers in the case of inability or incapacitation to serve. A source told the outlet that Pence, who has not spoken to the president since Wednesday's insurrection, is considering the option in case Trump ""becomes more unstable.""ThoughBiden will be inauguratedon January 20, impeaching and convicting Trump now will prohibit him from ever running for office again.

French prosecutors are looking into accusations four fashion brands sourced goods made by forced labour from Uyghur Muslims in China. Uniqlo, Zara-owner Inditex and French textile firm SMCP deny the claims, while Skechers declined to comment. China strongly rejects claims of human rights abuses in the region. In March, the US, the European Union, UK and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials, citing abuses in Xinjiang. Beijing retaliated immediately with its own. French authorities opened the probe after complaints from the European Uyghur Institute and other pressure groups that the retailers were profiting from the use of forced labour. An Inditex spokesperson told the BBC: ""We strongly refute the claims in this complaint. Inditex conducts rigorous traceability controls and we intend to fully cooperate with the French authorities to confirm that the allegations are unfounded.""""At Inditex, we have zero tolerance for all forms of forced labour and have established policies and procedures to ensure this practice does not take place in our supply chain,"" the spokesperson added. Inditex said it ""fully complies"" with all existing legislation and recommendations regarding the protection of workers' rights. The company says it has implemented a human rights compliance framework ""based on the highest international standards.""Uniqlo's parent company, Tokyo-based Fast Retailing, said: ""If and when notified, we will co-operate fully with the investigation to reaffirm there is no forced labour in our supply chains.""The spokesperson added that the company was aware of the media reports about the investigation but had not been contacted by authorities. Uniqlo said it conducted audits to ensure no human rights violation in their supply chain and add that none of their production partners are located in Xinjiang. French textile firm SMCP also said that it conducts regular audits and does not have ""direct suppliers in the region mentioned in the press.""But Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that while international firms may conduct audits that do not find evidence of forced labour in supply chains, ""political repression in the Xinjiang region is so pervasive that labour inspectors cannot interview workers freely without fear of reprisals"". She said inspectors cannot visit facilities without advance warning, and they cannot compel regional authorities to provide essential information about hours, pay, or other key labour conditions. Rahima Mahmut, director of the UK World Uyghur Congress, agreed and said it is ""impossible"" to ""carry out this investigation independently in the region because of the regime"".""We need more collaboration across countries and welcome this move by France but want the whole of Europe to carry out such investigations.""Sandra Cossart, director of anti-corruption organisation Sherpa, one of the groups that filed the complaint, added that the investigation ""testifies to the potential involvement of economic actors in the commission of the most serious crimes in order to increase their profit margins"". The Xinjiang region produces 85% of China's cotton and accounts for about a fifth of global supplies. Retailers Nike, H&M and Burberry are also facing a backlash in China after they expressed concerns about the alleged use of Uyghur forced labour in cotton production earlier this year. Evidence shown to the BBC suggests that up to half a million Uyghur workers a year are being marshalled into seasonal cotton picking. Uyghurs have been detained at camps where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged.

Three questions.,0.0,47.33,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0811/Trump-s-executive-actions-Legal-Helpful-Three-questions,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-11,25,"Flourishing a pen, President Donald Trump attempted an end run around stalled congressional negotiations Saturday, signing a series of executive actions he said would “pretty much” take care of the nation’s coronavirus relief needs. Days later, U. S. states and companies are struggling to figure out how – or whether – to implement the president’s directives. As with many of Mr. Trump’s unilateral domestic moves, a close reading of the documents shows that the details don’t quite match the sweeping claims. The executive actions he approved appear to be, at best, less than meets the eye – and, at worst, unworkable. Some may also be illegal. The pandemic relief order and memos President Trump signed over the weekend may be narrow enough to avoid constitutional issues. But states and businesses worry they will simply create administrative burdens. The unemployment memorandum, for instance, requires that hard-pressed states kick in 25% of the extended $400 weekly per-person benefit. Some Democratic governors were scathing about the chance of that happening.“The concept of saying to states that you pay 25% of the unemployment insurance is just laughable,” said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. “The executive orders will not be a substitute for legislation.”Editor’s note: As a public service,all our coronavirus coverageis free. No paywall. It’s possible the document signings were as much a negotiating tactic as an end in themselves. On Monday Mr. Trump and senior administration officials pressed Democrats to return to the bargaining table. On his Twitter feed, the president claimed that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now “want to make a deal. Amazing how it all works, isn’t it.”But the two Democratic leaders said they had not contacted the White House, and, as of Tuesday, no further negotiations were scheduled – though both sides said they remained open to discussions. On the bottom-line cost, the two sides remained far apart. Democrats were seeking relief worth about $2 trillion, down from an initial $3.4 trillion target. Republicans have countered with a package worth $1 trillion. Here are three questions sparked by the president’s weekend moves:On Saturday at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club the president proclaimed that he was going to sign “bills” that would “take care of, pretty much, this entire situation” (meaning Congress’ failure to agree on a relief package). He announced he was postponing payroll taxes through the end of the year, extending extra federal unemployment benefits, helping people stay in their homes, and waiving payments on federal student loans. The documents the president signed weren’t bills, a term generally reserved for legislation passed by Congress. He signed one executive order on housing, and three presidential memorandums, which carry less legal weight. On housing, Mr. Trump’s order did not extend the federal ban on many evictions, which expired in late July. Instead, it called for top administration housing officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, to “consider” whether a new eviction ban is necessary. On unemployment benefits, Mr. Trump’s memorandum extended extra federal payments. But the amount was cut to $400 a week, from the previous level of $600 – and of that, states would have to supply $100. The memo’s wording holds that if a state can’t ante up that cash – and many will be hard-pressed to afford it – it won’t get the federal supplement. On payroll taxes, Mr. Trump’s memo instructs the Treasury to stop collection of the 6.2% paycheck levy from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31. But it’s a deferment, not a tax cut – meaning that at the end of the year, taxpayers (or their employers) would have to pay the full amount for that period of time. On federally held student loans, Mr. Trump’s memo waives all interest until the end of the year, and delays principal payments until Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, normal payment schedules are supposed to restart. Court challenges may delay implementation of some or all of these moves. But the main challenge may be that the executive actions are so narrow and complicated, particularly for the unemployment payments and payroll tax deferments, that many states and businesses will likely struggle to figure out what exactly to do. Take the extension of federal unemployment benefits, arguably the most important of all Mr. Trump’s actions. States are supposed to pay $100 a week per person of the cost, and administer the effort besides. If they can’t afford that, will they get nothing? The memo’s wording suggests that would be the case, but on Tuesday administration officials backed up a bit and clarified the situation. White House economic adviserLarry Kudlow saidstates would be able to credit $100 of their existing unemployment benefits toward the 25% cost-sharing requirement. States would still have to apply for the benefit, according to Mr. Kudlow. Plus, the unemployment memo draws on federal disaster funds as its source of money. At current levels of unemployment, the disaster money would be used up within weeks – certainly by October. Should a state go through the hassle of changing its data systems to accommodate the new payments, if it may not be able to do so before the money effectively runs out? Many states may not be able to implement this program,according to Georgetown University law professor David A. Super. Likewise, the tax deferment doesn’t make the obligation go away. Will companies adjust their payroll calculations to temporarily stop collecting a tax that they’ll just have to collect later, under current law? And if they do make those changes, and employee income temporarily increases, will that be subject to income tax?Mr. Trump has said that if reelected, he will forgive the deferred payroll tax. But he doesn’t have the power to do that – presidents can’t cut taxes on their own. Plus, it’s a ton of money, another trillion dollars or so, and it’s the primary funding mechanism for Social Security and Medicare, the government’s giant (and popular) senior support programs. Many businesses may just throw up their hands and leave payroll withholdings as they are. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska has slammed Mr. Trump’s signings as “unconstitutional slop.” Indeed, the Constitution explicitly assigns taxing and spending powers to Congress, and Mr. Trump is trying to take some measure of that power for his own. But the order and memos are so narrowly drawn that they may avoid constitutional issues. They draw on existing presidential powers as outlined in statutes such as the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, which allow chief executives to spend federal money on relief for disaster victims,according to University of Chicago law professor Daniel Hemel. They’re not illegal so much as ineffective, according to Mr. Hemel. President Barack Obama used an executive order in 2014 to order prosecutorial discretion in the case of the “Dreamers,” immigrants brought to America illegally as children. Republicans say that precedent is one of the things Mr. Trump is drawing on today. The Democratic response to Mr. Trump’s measures has generally been toportray them as insufficient, not as executive branch overreach. The implication: Under a President Joe Biden, executive orders and memorandums might continue to play a role in getting around congressional inaction.",3,Reliable,0.1120100161276631,0.4845369663016722,1577,3,Christian Science Monitor
343,How to Win Medicare for All Under President Biden,-16.0,36.33,https://inthesetimes.com/article/medicare-for-all-president-biden-healthcare-signle-payer,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-01-20,25,"The Democratic Party platform now states clearly that​“we fundamentally believe health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few.” And following the Senate races in Georgia, Democrats will now take control of both houses of Congress along with the presidency. So the question is, now that they will hold power, how will the party reform healthcare? In2009, Barack Obama assumed the presidency as Democrats held a supermajority in the Senate, with a majority in the House, yet the party failed to pass the full-fledged reform they sought, instead landing on a compromise bill, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded healthcare access but did not make coverage universal. Now, the Covid-19pandemic has fully revealed the structural flaws of the healthcare industry model: profit-driven, just-in-time staffing and supply chains have produced unsafe work environments, a lack of regular testing, and too little personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. The defunding of public health systems and long-standing health inequities can no longer be ignored. Instead, this crisis requires a fundamental systemic response, and a single-payer system is the only comprehensive, cost-saving option that eliminates barriers to care while addressing the multi-faceted Covid-19public health crisis. That solution is rooted in the savings, universality, comprehensive benefits, public health, and cost control generated by single-payer healthcare financing. Advocates for Medicare for All have won the policy debate — a recent study from the Congressional Budget Office shows again that single-payer saves money, controls costs, and covers everybody, including for long-term care. There istremendouspopular support for Medicare for All. But we lack the backing among enough elected officials to win politically, including from the newly inaugurated President Joe Biden. Our task is not to simply convince Biden to change his views on Medicare for All, but to change the political waters in which that view holds sway. Our task is to create the political will to topple the for-profit healthcare industry, which means building a popular movement that can vilify its business model, expose its corruption of policymaking and shine a light on its financial influence over elected officials, who should similarly be exposed and challenged electorally for protecting an inhumane system. Fixing the ACA is on the table, if it can be done in the Senate through a majority vote in the​“budget reconciliation” process, or if the Democrats eliminate the60-vote filibuster rule. As consumer advocate Wendell Potterwrites,​“Biden has proposed lowering the age of Medicare eligibility to60and establishing a public health insurance option to compete with private insurers. He also campaigned on improving the Affordable Care Act to make federal subsidies available to more people.”With an evenly divided Senate, there will likely be a push from mainstream Democrats to add a​“public option” to the health plan. But even a genuinely public program with no out of pocket costs that provides comprehensive benefits, like the​“public option” proposed by the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force, doesn’t contain costs system-wide, leaves10million people uninsured, burdens taxpayers with a bailout of insurers to keep their product​“affordable,” and adds further complexity to a costly insurance plan-based payer system. When a federal ACA fix bill moves through committee, there will be a strategic opportunity to demand a​“mark-up” of the single-payer bill and the inclusion of key policy priorities — such as lowering prescription drug prices and eliminating out of pocket expenses — in whatever bill emerges. This process could bring media and political attention to the policy advantages of Medicare for All. But the task is larger than working to improve the ACA. We must organize to solve the healthcare crisis, not just to​“fix” the bill. There’s a set ofadministrativeactionsthe Biden administration could take to immediately expand healthcare coverage, including enrolling everybody in Medicare for the duration of the pandemic, as incoming Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders has proposed. Passing additional pandemic-related healthcare legislation will be essential, so pressing for that package to include coverage of all out-of-pocket costs for everybody while covering the uninsured is both good politics and good policy. Many advocates believe the political road to a national healthcare program is through a successful state model. Biden’s Health and Human Services Department, under the leadership of Medicare for All supporter and California Attorney General Xavier Beccera, can administrativelygrant state innovation waiversto establish single payer in states such as California, where support is strong. Gov. Gavin Newsom campaigned in favor of single payer. Initiating a waiver would change the argument from whether to implement a single-payer system to how. And it’s arguably the fastest way to move the issue politically while demonstrating the policy advantages of such a model. Other states could also follow course. Still, there is no shortcut to winning guaranteed healthcare for all residents of the United States. Doing so will require a mass movement allied with, and incorporating the demands of, broader social movements for justice. We must continue to loudly protest and challenge the inequities highlighted by the pandemic, the public health crisis of racial injustice, anti-immigrant attacks, and state-sanctioned violence — which includes the denial of healthcare itself — propelled by economic inequality. At the heart of overcoming these injustices, Medicare for All stands as a policy solution that would intimately affect and improve our lives. Fighting for a universal, guaranteed healthcare system embodies solidarity — the acts of kindness and caregiving that show we are all in this together, taking care of each other.

344,Intelligence Contractors Vying for Slimmer Spy Budget in FY 2021,0.0,44.4,https://about.bgov.com/news/intelligence-contractors-vying-for-slimmer-spy-budget-in-fy-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-23,17,"The Department of Defense and theOffice of the Director of National Intelligence(ODNI) released their intelligence budget requests for fiscal 2021 totaling $85 billion earlier this year. DODandODNIreleased enacted 2020 figures Oct. 21, allowing for comparisons and revealing a slight decrease from $85.8 billion total in the fiscal 2021 request. A large portion of the intelligence community’s budget goes to contracting which indicates companies are likely to be competing for fewer dollars in the future. Most contracting by the intelligence agencies is not transparent. Historically, the share of budgets devoted to contracting has been reported at about70%. The U. S. intelligence community’s budget is comprised of two primary categories, the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The MIP is overseen by the Pentagon and includes spending for the intelligence components of the military services as well as some of the funding for intelligence agencies that fall under DOD such as theDefense Intelligence Agency(DIA) or the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency(NGA). The NIP pays for other intelligence agencies such as theCentral Intelligence Agency, portions of theFBI, and the State Department’sBureau of Intelligence and Research(INR), as well as some portion of the DOD-controlled agencies. For fiscal 2021, DOD announced its MIP request would be$23.1 billion, the same as was appropriated for fiscal 2020, and ODNI requested $61.9 billion, a decrease from $62.7 billion in fiscal 2020. DOD and ODNI do not release detailed budget figures for the various agencies for security reasons. In fiscal 2012, the combined MIP and NIP budget was $75.4 billion making the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through the 2021 request about 1% and thus not keeping pace withinflation. About70%of the intelligence budget is spent on contracts based on the latest figures available, meaning that the approximately $59.5 billion to be spent on contracts for the intelligence community in fiscal 2021 is smaller in real terms than it was a decade ago. Determining what exactly the intelligence community spends its contracting dollars on is difficult because the intelligence community isexemptfrom reporting contract spending to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). A search in Bloomberg Government’s Contracts Intelligence tool shows a total of only$3 billionfor the National Security Agency, DIA and NGA since fiscal 2017 and no data for the CIA. The billions that the community spends that are not disclosed are spent on a broad range of goods and services. Some of these contracts are directly related to personnel that perform intelligence collection and analysis, or the building of intelligence satellites, while others may pay for more mundane things, such as janitorial services in intelligence community facilities, office supplies, or construction and repair of buildings. However, even in the cases where the work is not directly intelligence-related, contractors often require security clearances because of the sensitivity of the work being performed around them, the individual identities of those performing the intelligence work, or even the location where the work is being done. Competition for intelligence community work is challenging because of the limited number of contractors that have cleared personnel authorizations. It’s also difficult to identify available opportunities because solicitations are often released with a prerequisite for organizations to have certain security clearances. The intelligence community’s primary platform for releasing opportunities,Acquisition Research Center, has both unclassified and classified components and does release a portion of the acquisition documents at the unclassified level that are accessible with registration and login-in credentials. For contractors seeking to participate in the intelligence market, partnering with companies already in the market, or hiring personnel with experience are often the best ways to break in. If the budgets continue declining slowly, as they have for fiscal 2021, the market is only likely to become more competitive in the immediate future.

345,Democrats to lift ban on earmarks.,1.67,46.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/democrats-lift-ban-on-earmarks,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-16,16,"Congressional pork is back on the menu. Hello to everyone, except all my readers in Texas who apparently still don’t have any power. Today we’re talking about the return of earmarks. Plus, a reader question about what political stances will be deemed unacceptable 20 years from now. Earmarks. Also called member-directed spending, pork, pork-barrelling, bacon, fat, or fluff. Generally speaking,earmarksare funding or projects that get inserted into legislation at the request of a senator or representative, usually in an effort to earn that member of Congress’s vote. Typically, they are not spending commitments added onto a bill, so much as changes in “how the pie is cut.”Earmarks often come in the form of special projects or funding that members of Congress direct back to their home districts. Hypothetically, if Democrats were one vote short of passing an immigration bill, and they wanted to get Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on board but she was hesitant, they might offer to include $20 million in an immigration bill for a hospital in the Bronx — that way she could go back to her district and say, “look what I got for us.”For decades, earmarks were a critical part of pushing through major legislation. But in the early 2000s, the public soured on earmarks, beginning to view them as open bribes and wasteful spending after they became closely tied to several scandals. Perhaps most infamous was the “Bridge to Nowhere,” a$223 million earmarkthat was drafted in 2005 to connect the Alaskan town of Ketchikan to its nearby island airport. The earmark was lifted and the bridge never happened. There was also Jack Abramoff, the infamous lobbyist who went to prison on fraud charges tied to earmarks being used as bribes. In 2007, Democrats tried to tamp down public criticism of earmarks by instituting reforms around them that required public disclosure of earmark requests. Then in 2011, when Republicans took over the House of Representatives, earmarks were banned. This had a big impact on legislating. As you can imagine, a potent tool to win over votes with what some call a “legislative bribe” is quite effective — and the result of not being able to use it was equally significant. In 2018, former President Trump actually suggested to membersthey reinstate earmarksas a way to clear the path for immigration reform. Now, though, Democrats are the ones who look poised to bring them back. With control of Congress, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) are the respective chairs of the House and Senate Appropriations panels, which oversee rules like this. And in the coming weeks, they’re reportedly planning to reinstate earmarks. Leahy and DeLauro say the new earmarks will be transparent, with disclosures about who requested them and what entity is getting the money. They also say members will not be able to request them for entities that they have financial ties to, or for for-profit institutions,according to Punchbowl News. They will be limited to state and local governments and nonprofits. The left is supportive of bringing earmarks back with tighter regulation and oversight. In The Atlantic,Annie Lowrey argued that earmarks were exactly what Democrats needto win over moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin, asking “Why shouldn’t Democrats curry his favor with a few sky bridges and concert halls?”“At its peak, pork-barrel spending made up a tiny sliver of thegovernment budget,” she wrote. “Earmarks were never that wasteful either. Most of the money went to reasonable projects — bridges, community centers, worker-training programs, schools. Those are the kinds of things the government exists to finance. Voters like them, communities need them, and members of Congress, with their intimate knowledge of their district, are often pretty good at knowing where to put them.“Since the demise of the earmark, both Republicans and Democrats have voiced their quiet lamentations about the lost opportunities to secure money for needed projects and to win over their colleagues’ votes,” she said. “Even former Speaker of the House John Boehner—who, as a matter of principle, never sought or got an earmark for his Ohio district—has bemoaned the loss, saying that a little pork would help ‘herd the cats’ on the Hill.”In a 2018 piece,then Vox reporter Jonathan Allen wrote that earmarks should come back with reforms that limit the amount of money and create more transparency, similar to what Democrats are proposing.“The problem wasn't in the earmarks, it was in the process that doled them out,” he said. “Until the very end — when Congress tried to save the system — the sponsors of earmarks weren't publicly named. The money was distributed based on political calculation — to increase the power of a particular appropriator or help vulnerable party members win re-election — rather than being spread equitably or based on the merits of the projects competing for cash. There was no vetting to safeguard against lawmakers exchanging earmarks for campaign money.”The right is mostly opposed to earmarks. While some concede the practice could grease the wheels of Congress, there is a general belief that it’s been proven to be ineffective and to breed corruption. In Roll Call,Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) wrote that“Pork was taken off the menu (temporarily, I guess) a decade ago after years of politicians literally pigging out on taxpayer dollars, earmarking millions for special interests and their own pet projects, like that infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska. Some even went to jail for exchanging bribes over congressional pork. But now Congress wants to bring the bacon back to the legislative process.“Defense earmarks are especially harmful because they take away critical research and development funds and direct them to things that havevalue to the military or will actively harm our troops,” she wrote. “The Navy was forced to buy luxury speedboats they didn’t need, so they turned around and gave them to a local college. Second, the Marines were forced to buy ‘combat’ T-shirts that would have burned their bodies if they were caught in a fire in Iraq or Afghanistan. You can’t make this stuff up. Instead of putting taxpayer money to good, important use — like researching and developing new technologies and weaponry — the largest government agency blew it.”In 2019,The Wall Street Journal editorial boardtried to nip talk of reinstating earmarks in the bud.“Some Republicans have been nostalgic for better times that never existed,” the board said. “President Trump waxed last year about the ‘great friendliness’ when earmarks ruled. The claim is that earmarks make it easier to pass legislation, and this might be a worthwhile conservative trade if it meant Congress could pull together majorities for, say, something big like entitlement reform. Slices of pork would supposedly be the grease for difficult but essential reform that would shrink the burden of government. In our observation, the opposite is closer to the truth: Earmarks grease the skids for bigger government.“None of today’s gridlock would be overcome by earmarks,” the board wrote. “Democrats aren’t going to give President Trump a political victory in return for a local courthouse. A bike path in Portland wouldn’t have won the vote of Maine Senator Susan Collins to repeal ObamaCare.”The best argument for restoring earmarks is that Congress has been slowly abdicating its responsibility to the presidency. Consolidated, unchecked executive power is a great concern of mine — and it should be one of yours, too. From Bush to Obama to Trump and now Biden, presidential power is running more unchecked every term. Starting wars, spending tax dollars and signing executive orders in the place of legislating is the new norm on both sides. And, as has been well argued, earmarks could be a way to get Congress moving again. Members should have a vested interest in every spending bill, but the cold truth is they don’t, and earmarks could bring that interest back. Still, color me skeptical. Last time we had earmarks, some members of Congress were trading those dollars for campaign contributions, lobbyists were begging for earmarked cash in exchange for campaign support, and entire firms were created to help facilitate these transactions. Worse yet, there’s a good argument they didn’t do much to help underserved districts:numerous reportsshow that more influential members of Congress received the bulk of earmarked money while lesser-known members failed to “bring home the bacon.”As Linda Stamato noted in her NJ.com piece,which is worth reading, a practice openly described as “organized bribery” by the people advocating for it (as The New York Times editorial boarddid) is not exactly the way to reinstate public trust in a broken institution. She also pointed out that a Congressional Research Service report showed even the seemingly good ones, like money for hospitals, “didn’t reflect an analysis of hospital needs for states as a whole and they didn’t originate from requests from the Department of Health and Human Services. Other hospitals, having greater need, but lacking political heft, gained nothing at all.”It’s also true that just as earmarks can grease the wheels of Congress, they can also bring it to a screeching halt. As it turns out, earmarks aren’t just used by a Congressional majority or leadership to sweeten the pot for a dissenting member — they’re also used by dissenting members to hold the Congressional majority or leadership hostage. Take the example at the beginning of this newsletter and turn it on its head: what if AOC refused to support a billshe got that hospital? How is that greasing the wheels?Finally, I’m skeptical of the efforts for reform. They sometimes seem in good faith on both sides, but we’re ultimately relying on Congress to regulate itself. Even an all-out ban on earmarks actuallyproduced different workaroundsfor porked-up spending — loopholes that should be closed too, rather than used as proof that you can’t stop members from finding ways to spend on pet projects. Even if the requests are public, the root of those requests — the true reasons — will remain behind closed doors and out of public view, and by the time we get answers the bills and earmarks will be out the door. Congress had its chance to earmark responsibly and blew it — that they can’t legislate now is no reason to reward them for the crimes of the past. I love this question, and imagine I could write a whole newsletter on it (I just might). For the sake of brevity, I’ll give three big ones that come to mind:Fighting for non-renewable energy jobs. Obviously, the progressive left has already moved past this, but something like fracking is still such a hot-button issue that Joe Biden wouldn’t take an oppositional stance on it while campaigning in Pennsylvania. The next generation is very, very left on climate change. And whether you think humans are a primary cause or not (I thinkwe are), the fact that our environment is sick is more apparent every day. Even worse for the people fighting “climate-friendly” initiatives: none of this is going to change anytime soon. Even if the leftmost climate activists fighting to stop all emissions got what they wanted, the experts tell us it would take decades of focused action to undo much of the damage already done, meaning in 20 years, our progress still wouldn’t be obvious. But when water shortages start regularly popping up in America, along with things like the increasing frequency of extreme wildfires, droughts and floods, the political lexicon is going to shift even further. I also think acquiescence to China will be a political death knell. I’m cautious not to sound like a fear-monger in China and aware I’ve written a lot about this recently; but plenty of trends point to their economic and global dominance asworld superpower (a position the U. S. currently occupies) in the next 20-30 years. I’m imagining a world where China’s influence on trade and its military strength give it a more powerful position than the U. S. on the global stage, even amongst our European allies, and Democrats who have spent the last decade becoming intertwined in corporate and Chinese interests will look very, very bad in retrospect. Finally, the moderate position on crime and criminal justice today will look as bad as Biden’s positions in the 1990s do now. I think moderate Democrats and many Republicans will seem unthinkably draconian in 20 years, while progressives, Libertarians and a big chunk of the anti-establishment “Trump base” will seem forward-thinking. My belief is the next great civil rights movement will be the rights of incarcerated people in the U. S. I actually think we’re already at the beginning stages of it. To the next generation of voters, a criminal justice system that seeks to punish someone rather than rehabilitate them will look absurd. The reality of more than two million people currently languishing in cages will be far more embedded in the public consciousness than it is now. The reality of someone being stuck in prison because they can’t pay for bail at a time of egregious income inequality will become reprehensible. Trump’s embrace of some criminal justice reforms planted the seeds of this on the right, while civil Libertarians and progressives were already there. In 20 years, I think it’ll be a sliver of a minority position to support being “tough on crime,” and a lot of the people supporting that position now will not be looked on favorably in 20 years. The winter weather that tore through Texas this week has left nearly five million people without power. It’s also set off a robust debate about how the largest energy producing state in the U. S. can fail to make it through a week of below-freezing temperatures without rolling blackouts. The Wall Street Journal editorial board wasquick to blamethe outages on a move away from coal and nuclear power and an over-reliance on wind and solar. At the same time, articles like one in The Washington Post framed the unprecedented weather as aproduct of climate change. The diametrically opposed reactions illustrate the challenges clean energy will face in this political climate, and could be a look into the future as states across the U. S. modernize their energy grids with renewables.

346,Iowa State rejects journalism professor’s demand to ban College Republicans,6.67,41.67,https://www.thecollegefix.com/iowa-state-rejects-journalism-professors-demand-to-ban-college-republicans/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-20,23,"Last week, Iowa State Universitybacked down from its plan to investigate and possibly punish the College Republicans chapter for a tweet that encouraged gun purchasing in anticipation of Joe Biden’s election and possible gun control measures.“Everyone, you must arm up, expect these people to attempt to destroy your life, the elites want revenge on us,” the College Republicans tweeted on November 7. Ryan Hurley, Iowa State College Republican president toldthat the tweet did not intend to promote violence. Now, university officials have written a response to an “open letter” that called for disciplinary action against the conservative student group. The open letter, created by journalism Professor Kelly Winfrey (), called for “removal of recognition as an official student organization” until every “remaining current student member from the roster has graduated from the University.”Another journalism professor, Novotny Lawrence, and an academic adviser for the journalism school, Kelsi Poe, signed onto the demand to restrict free speech. In total, over 500 people signed the letter, primarily a mixture of professors, students and alumni. The letter said:We are appalled that the Iowa State University administration has decided it will not invoke disciplinary action on a student organization, the Iowa State University College Republicans (@IStateCRs), for a tweet that, having nothing to do with the political nature of the organization, incites violence and creates a campus climate that feels threatening to and isolates students, faculty, and staff of marginalized and historically oppressed populations. Privileging the free speech of those causing harm over the safety of the historically marginalized members of our community furthers the damage and sends the message that the Iowa State University community does not value their presence, despite numerous condemnations in recent months of this exact kind of behavior. It is clear that the administration’s statements during a summer that served as a referendum on racism in this country, were merely symbolic and they now serve as further evidence of its history of denouncing some harmful behaviors, only to abdicate themselves of responsibility when given the opportunity to show their commitment through action. The signers also want an updated student conduct code to address responses “to speech by students and student organizations that promote hate, directly or indirectly threaten the physical safety and free movement of members of the campus community,” or could “potentially incite violence, or violates the Principles of Community.”Finally, it wants “the Provost to begin working with academic units on campus to increase the University-wide U. S. diversity requirement and review the approved courses to ensure the course content is centered on diversity issues.”However, the university administrators were not going to cave to the demands.“At the core of this demand [derecognition of the College Republicans] is a disconnect between the law and First Amendment freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution,” the administrators said. They explained how the First Amendment worked and concluded, “this demand asks that the university proactively violate the law, and we will not do so.”It corrected Winfrey for falsely claiming that student group tweets were not “protected speech if they violate university policy.”The administration explained to the journalism professor:The tweets that are the focus of this demand are protected speech, and standing alone,they do not violate university policy. The university cannot, and will not, punish students or student organizations for their constitutionally protected expression. University officials also explained again to Winfrey that First Amendment jurisprudence forbids the speech codes she seeks:Student codes of conduct at other universities that have attempted to punish students forspeech deemed “hateful,” “derogatory,” “threatening,” “insensitive” or described withother such terms have consistently been struck down as unconstitutional. Moreover, theuniversity cannot establish its own thresholds for threatening or hateful speech that arebroader than the limited exceptions currently allowed in federal lawFinally, it responded to her demand for a diversity audit, pointing out to her that the faculty senate is already working on a curriculum review.“The Working Group has prepared a report which includes new, contemporary learning outcomes, and a draft process for the review and approval of courses that will meet the diversity course requirement,” the administration said.andread the full university response",3,Reliable,0.0448059310304208,0.4359123303000853,895,2,The College Fix

It’s been more than two years since the FBI arrested 50 parents, athletic coaches and others in a scheme targeting elite universities across the country. One of the biggest parts of the prosecution’s case were the words of the alleged admissions consultant at the center of the scheme — William “Rick “Singer. His words were secretly recorded by the FBI and played in court Wednesday. “To be honest, it feels a little weird,” said Gordon Caplan, the former co-chairman of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who admitted to paying a bribe to doctor up his daughter’s ACT score. Singer replied: “I know it does. I know it does. But when she gets the score and we have choices, you’re going to be saying, “OK — I’ll take all my kids.” One of the voices played came from one of Singer’s well-known clients, former Staples and Gap Inc. executive John Wilson, who now heads a Massachusetts private equity firm. Wilson is charged with paying $220,000 to have his son designated as a USC water polo recruit and an additional $1 million to buy his twin daughters’ ways into Harvard and Stanford. Wilson’s lawyers said he was tricked by Singer and he believed he was making legitimate donations. Prosecutors say the parents were well aware their payments were designed to get their kids into school as athletic recruits with fake or embellished credentials as part of Singer’s so-called, side-door scheme. So far, 33 parents have pleaded guilty in the college admissions scandal, including actors Felicity Huffman, who served 11 days in prison, and Lori Loughlin, who served two months. A new Netflix documentary called, “Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal,” is based on the same FBI recordings from Singer. Prosecutors say the tapes remove any doubt about what Singer was up to. In one recording, Singer said, “I can send him your $500,000.00 that you wired to my account to secure a spot for one of your girls.” Wilson laughed, then added, “So, Stanford actually got to have some sailors, huh?” Singer replied, “Yeah, so that Stanford doesn’t catch on to what he’s doing.” At least 47 people have either pleaded guilty in the college admissions scandal or agreed to do so. An additional six trials are scheduled for later this year and they are expected to continue into 2022.",3,Reliable,0.0018097643097643,0.4421436588103254,550,3,NewsNation Now

The Republican-controlled Senate is auditing the election results in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state and one won by Joe Biden, in spite of its long history of voting for Republican candidates. As part of the process, officials contracted a conspiracy-prone firm called Cyber Ninjas, which started work to “statistically identify voter registrations that did not make sense, and then knock on doors to confirm if valid voters actually lived at the stated address.”But in a letter to Senate President Karen Fann, the DOJ said the process could target minority communities and have “significant intimidating effect” on voters. If the canvassing continued, the DOJ warned it might violate several civil rights laws against voter intimidation, and the DOJ might sue. Fann wrote back on Friday, noting the Senate would “indefinitely defer” that part of the program.",3,Reliable,0.0964285714285714,0.3892857142857143,239,2,Daily Beast
350,Megan Thee Stallion on Fashion Nova Collection and Making Fashion Accessible,0.0,40.0,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/megan-thee-stallion-fashion-nova-collection-interview,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,25,"Megan Thee Stallion grew up struggling to find clothes for her body so now she's making her own. Afterlaunching a small merch collection with Crunchy Roll earlier this year, the hot girl is back on the designer chair with Fashion Nova for her first, big fashion collaboration. Launching today, November 18, Meg's new collection circumvents all the shopping issues Megan dealt with while growing up. Megan tellsthat shopping was “always so limited,” as a child and teenager. “Whether it was because the leg length was too short or the booty area was too tight, there would always be clothes or styles I’d [want to] wear, but just couldn’t find that would fit a tall girl with shape,” she recounted. Now, the hot girls who also deal with these problems have their very own hottie collection to shop from. This collection is Meg's approach to accessible fashion. Meg wanted to create something that was not only affordable but inclusive for women of all heights, shapes, and sizes. She can remember being a teenager and having pants from popular brands that looked like capris on her. “When everything hugs the right places and complements your natural figure you can’t help but feel good. That’s what this whole collection is about,” the rapper tells us. Megan wants consumers to feel confident and sexy in these pieces. Her own confidence oozes through her music, style, and entire aura. Now, her fans can have a little piece of that in their wardrobes. Long gone are the days of clothes being made to only fit one type of body, it’s unrealistic and it’s a great issue that a lot of people deal with. With her admirable curves and height, Megan is the first representation of such a natural body being praised in the mainstream. With that in mind, Megan tapped into her own experience to deliver and design the pieces. “I really wanted to pay attention to length and stretch across the collection so everything looks tailored but is super comfortable,” she said. While she’s worked with major fashion brands, like Coach, forcampaignsand has sat front row at New York Fashion Week, Megan knows the hustle. She knows how hard balancing work, college life, and just making sure the bills get paid whileto find clothes that are tailored to natural bodies. (Emphasis on trying because if you have been there, you know it's a full-time job on its own). This is precisely why she felt Fashion Nova was the brand to collaborate with. “I want all the hotties to be able to wear this collection, so working with Fashion Nova who have all the hottest looks at affordable prices just felt organic in that sense,” Meg told us. The 106-piece capsule includes detailed denim, corset tops, curve-hugging dresses and even matching pet wear (because we know Megan lovesher dogs.) Ranging from junior sizes to plus sizes, the bold collection also features styles that speak to Megan’s personal style like bold animal prints from zebra to python, denim adorned with fringes, and sultry co-ord sets. Jora FrantzisFor Megan, style is all about how she’s feeling; and the most important feeling is staying true to herself and being comfortable in her own skin no matter the occasion. “When you feel that way on the insideyou‘re wearing clothes that accentuate that, you will just radiate confidence. That’s real hot girl sh*t!” she tellsTeen Vogue. In true hot girl fashion, the collection comes on the eve of Megan’s debut album,which is releasing on November 20. It’s a big week for hotties around the world! The statement capsule boasting Meg’s “signature look” is now available for all hot girls to shop onFashionNova.comso get those wallets ready.

At an arbitration hearing this weekend, Broward County Public Schools brought forward evidence—including pictures posted to public social media accounts—that teachers who were granted permission to work from home because of the coronavirus pandemic had attended parties and other crowded events last fall. One teacher flew to a wedding in Jamaica,accordingto the, and another took a selfie at an October rally for then-candidate Joe Biden. The hearing resolved a Broward Teachers Union lawsuit that claimed the district improperly canceled work-from-home exemptions for 1,100 teachers. As a result of the hearing, the district can now force teachers to educate students in-person. One teacher, Tracy Merlin, attended a rally for Biden, according to her publicly available profile picture. Months prior, the second-grade teacher appeared on Chris Cuomo'sand said she feared that in-person learning could put her daughter's health at risk.""I'm also a mom. I don't want my daughter to come home with any of that,"" Merlin said in June. ""I've been home since March because that's what we were told to, to go home, to stay safe.""Merlin opposes reopening schools for face-to-face instruction and was one of about 1,700 teachers who received permission to work from home last fall as the district reopened its schools inOctober. Those exemptions were set to expire on Jan. 8. The teachers' unionsued, however, after the district asked students to return to school in-person on Jan. 11. The following day, Broward County Schools announced it had extended exemptions for 600 teachers, who are allowed to continue working from home this semester. As a result of the arbitration agreement, Broward Teachers Union president Anna Fusco agreed to the district's requirement for teachers to return to the classroom, and the district said it would turn over information to the union on the process it used to select the 600 teachers who were approved to continue teaching from the home. Broward Public Schools superintendent Robert Runcie called the agreement a ""win for our students"" in astatement.""We recognize the health concerns of our teachers,"" Runcie said, ""and will continue to balance their needs with the needs of students who are struggling and must be back in a safe and healthy school for face-to-face learning.""Teachers' unions across the United States have thwarted their school districts' efforts to return to the classroom for in-person learning, claiming without evidence that schools are unsafe environments for students and teachers during the coronavirus pandemic. An American Academy of Pediatricsstudythis month found that the transmission of coronavirus in schools is ""extremely rare,"" as thereported. And an Annenberg Institutestudyfrom October found that school districts with strong teachers' unions are less likely to return to in-person learning.

Figures released Thursday by the Labor Department show that applications for the week ended May 1 fell to 498,000 from a revised 590,000 a week earlier. While the number of unemployed workers applying for benefits is down sharply from the peak of almost 7 million that was reached when stay-at-home orders were first issued a year ago, it's still more than double the typical pre-crisis level. Most economists expect the downward trend to continue in coming months as more Americans are vaccinated and venture out to travel, shop and eat. Continuing claims, or the number of Americans who are consecutively receiving unemployment aid, fell to 3.96 million, an increase of 37,000 from the previous week. The report shows that roughly 16.16 million Americans were collecting jobless benefits for the week ending April 17, a decline of 404,509 from the previous week.""A bigger-than-expected decline in new jobless claims is a most pleasant surprise,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. ""Not only did the headline number of claims fall to a new pandemic low, but it slipped slightly below the 500,000 level. Still, more than 16 million Americans continued to receive some form of jobless assistance as of the latest count. That’s not normal, not by far.""The decline news comes just one day before the Labor Department's more closely watched jobs report, which is expected to show that payrolls rose by 978,000 and the unemployment rate inched down slightly to 5.8% in April.

354,Kenya and Nigeria are leading Africa’s push to start taxing Silicon Valley’s global tech giants,-1.8,48.0,https://qz.com/africa/1881964/kenya-nigeria-pass-new-laws-to-tax-global-tech-giants/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,25,"Internet use across Africa skyrocketed from 2.1% in 2005 to 24% by 2018—thehighest growth rate globally. That growth has seen global tech companies from Facebook and Google to Uber and Netflix expand their digital services across the continent, not just to capture the still small current market but also to strategicallyposition themselvesbearing in mind Africa’s young population andexpected population boom. But, like elsewhere, African governments are increasingly looking to develop a framework that allows them to generate tax revenue from these very popular digital services when used within their territories. The upside is obvious: collecting “digital taxes” will help African countries on their quest to grow their local tax bases which are typically undercut by large and un-captured informal sectors. Then there’s the benefit of diversifying income sources—a boon especially for some large African economies dependent on the export of raw commodities. And while it’d be important at any time, it’s especially important now given the looming economic challenges of Covid-19 with the Sub-Saharan Africa region set forits first recession in 25 years. There’s just one problem. Without provisions in existing legislation and international tax treaties, there’s currently no global standard for setting up and implementing taxes on multinational technology companies. “The law is now just trying to catch up,” says Wole Obayomi, head of tax, regulatory and people services at KPMG Nigeria. For its part however, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working on creating a new global tax framework for multinational technology companies that countries can adopt. But that slow-moving process is not guaranteed to be successful, especially after the United Statespulled out of talkslast month. Without a global, or even continental standard in place, African countries have typically levied digital operations indirectly through a range of taxes on mobile financial transactions and value-added taxes on communications services including calls and mobile data. As local internet use has grown among Africa’s middle-class, tech multinationals—from ride-hailing giants like Uber and Bolt, and social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook to e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon and Alibaba, and entertainment streaming platformslike Netflixand Spotify—have increasingly provided their services to African users. Even though Africa still accounts for a tiny slice of these companies’ global revenues, their rising prominence and influence in local markets means African governments eye as them as taxable targets regardless of the fact several do not have a physical presence in their countries. And so Nigeria and Kenya—two of Africa’s largest internet markets and most developed tech ecosystems—have stepped up plans to tax multinational tech companies. After extending the scope of Kenya’s finance laws to allow it to collect taxes on “income earned through digital marketplaces” last year in a move that appears focused on e-commerce, a new law signed by the president at the start of the month will see a digital services tax of 1.5% of gross transaction value imposed on digital marketplaces and platforms that derive income from Kenya. The tax will take effect from January 2021. Kenya’s tax on gross transactions rather than profits is key and likely targets tech giants like Uber which remains“famously unprofitable.”In Nigeria, a newly passed ministerial order (SEP order) allows Africa’s largest economy to tax companies that havea “significant economic presence”and are involved in digital transactions or providing services locally even without physical offices or subsidiaries. The order deems companies to have significant economic presence in Nigeria if they derive gross income of over 25 million naira ($64,000) from digital services, use a Nigerian web domain or register a web address in Nigeria, target Nigerian users in advertising and marketing or reflect online payments in Nigeria’s currency. There’s the obvious question of how these provisions could affect local startups or even Africa-focused startups operating across different countries. Take Jumia, the pan-African e-commerce giant that’s set up shop in 12 African countries. But while Jumia is incorporated in Germany, all of its operations in individual African markets “are fully registered as local entities” and “pay all the local taxes already,” a Jumia spokesperson explains. It’s a similar reality for startups that are wholly registered locally in the countries they operate in and are already subject to existing tax laws, unlike tech giants like Netflix. But local startups also face the real risk of double taxation, particularly in Kenya where the framing of the digital services tax encompasses all digital marketplaces in the country—and not just those based in Silicon Valley or Europe. As such, locally registered and homegrown e-commerce companies which already face relevant taxes may yet face an additional digital services tax.“I think the government of Kenya should be igniting the digital economy not seeking to suffocate it in its crib,” says Aly-Khan Satchu, a Nairobi-based financial and investment analyst. “Whatever nickel and dime income the government collects at this juncture will be at the expense of future growth,” he tells Quartz Africa. Invariably, these efforts to introduce these taxes will likely win support from locally competitive players, as past evidence, and long-running sentiments, suggests. In the wake of Netflix going live across Africa, MultiChoice, the largest pay TV player across Africa, has been vocal about the need for the companyto be regulated, bemoaning its operations as an over-the-top service without paying taxes, setting up a local presence or putting down infrastructure. Telecoms companies across the continent have also pushed for messaging platforms including Facebook’spopular WhatsAppto be regulatedbecause, they say, it undercuts their voice call and SMS revenue. And like in other parts of the world, Uber’s Africa operations have long faced push-back from local taxi groups whodecry its modelas anathema to their survival. While proposing these laws and regulations is one thing, implementing and enforcing them is quite another. Without a widely agreed upon standard for taxing tech multinationals, there’s significant potential for unilateral laws to be subject to dispute as recent examples show. France’s attempts to implement a tax on tech giants, including American companies, left iton the brink of a trade warwith the United States last year while India’s digital tax plans, in form of an “equalization levy,” havefaced pushbackfrom US tech giants. In the unlikely scenario that tech multinationals voluntarily accept being taxed in African markets without similar resistance, it will only solve just one variable of a more complex equation. As Mustapha Ndajiwo, founder of the African Center for Tax and Governance, notes ina working paperpublished last month, “the main problem is not taxable nexus, but attribution of profits.”Essentially, without a global framework in place, countries seeking to collect taxes on digital services first have to ascertain how much profits the companies offering those services have earned within their territories. With subsidiaries of global tech companies often providing administrative and marketing support, mothership companies can potentially allocate costs to their operations in a manner that leaves countries with little or nothing to tax.“The uncertainties regarding the profits earned from and taxable in Nigeria is a notable issue the SEP order failed to address,”writesAmaka Samuel-Onyeani, senior manager at the Nigerian arm of global tax consulting firm, Andersen Tax. That gap amplifies the need for international consensus especially as one of the OECD’s key objectives in creating a global digital tax framework will be providing an acceptable formula for profit attribution and taxing. In the meantime however, without clarity on earnings within their jurisdictions, African countries looking to press on will have little choice but to “rely on the integrity” of tech multinationals, Obayomi says.

The phrase has cropped up in the past but is being increasingly used by provincial authorities to decry property developers’ attempts to slash home prices. Some developers, desperate to bring in revenue, are offering discounts of as much as 30%. Officials, fearing that the price cuts might frustrate recent homebuyers and lead to protests and distortions in the property market, regard the discounts as undermining social stability and have banned them. In the central city of Yueyang the government has told developers to stop increasing prices but also to refrain from reducing them by more than 15%. In such cases both regulators and developers are walking a tightrope, teetering between sky-high prices and a damaging downturn. The property market is probably the single largest driver of the country’s economy. Urban Chinese have flocked to it as a haven. House prices have soared over the past 15 years, often by more than 10% a year in large cities. Yet developers have borrowed huge amounts in the process. The industry’s total debt is about 18.4trn yuan ($2.8trn, equivalent to 18% ofGDP), according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. Housing costs, relative to incomes, now make large Chinese cities some of the least affordable places in the world.

356,I Write About Viral Moments. Then I Became One,-5.33,37.0,https://www.glamour.com/story/michael-bloomberg-billionaire-viral-tweet-essay,https://adfontesmedia.com/glamour-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-10,18,"Maybe you’ve already seen the tweet. It’s the one in which I attempted to critique former Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s failed presidential campaign with some embarrassingly bad math. It’s the one that somehow made it onto network television without a basic fact check (but more on that in a bit). It’s the one I composed—as I have thousands of times before—late at night and shared with my modest 1,944 followers. Maybe it would get a dozen likes and retweets. It didn’t exactly turn out that way. Viral fame found me as it typically finds everyone it anoints: suddenly and without warning. I was picking up lunch with two colleagues last Wednesday when I began to get a flurry of Instagram notifications. My tweet from the night before was circulating—fast. The only problem? I had deleted the tweet after a few people pointed out that my math was wrong. If Bloomberg had used his $500 million ad budget to write $1 million checks instead—the premise of my entire tweet—he’d help 500 individuals,the entire U. S. population as I had suggested. Of course, it was embarrassing to get called out. Initially, I had left the tweet up—glaring miscalculation and all—out of pride. Yes, I’d made a dumb mistake. But don’t we all? I typed up an addendum to the original tweet, which said something along the lines of: Yes, okay, my math is off. But the point is he—and any other multibillionaire, for that matter—could give a lot of money to a lot of people and never notice. My argument didn’t stand a chance. I decided to clear the slate. After less than half an hour (which, to be fair, is an eternity in internet time), I deleted the tweet. At that point it had only a handful of likes and retweets, so I figured it hadn’t gotten around much anyway. Plus, I wasn’t interested in hearing more people tell me how bad I am at math. I messed up, it was beyond cringeworthy, and I wanted to be done with it. I went to bed with a slightly bruised ego, naively assuming the worst was behind me. The internet—as we all know—never forgets. There I was, navigating the lunchtime crowd at Trader Joe’s, nervously scrolling through a sea ofnotifications from complete strangers. Screenshots of my tweet had made their way to Instagram meme accounts, like Baller Alert (5.2 million followers) and Barstool News (191,000 followers). I could feel the beads of sweat begin to pool on my forehead. The trolls were swarming, tagging me in posts and sending me DMs on Twitter and Instagram. I immediately went into crisis-management mode, essentially acting as my own public relations and social media manager. I went private on both platforms. One stranger angrily emailed me: “Unlock your tweets or relinquish your blue checkmark you hack!” I was called a “dumb bitch” and a “stupid gook.” I reported posts that fell into cyberbullying territory. I soon discovered Instagram was better at rule enforcing than Twitter. Not even an hour had passed before the trolls got creative. They requested money through Venmo; one person charged me $10,000, saying I should “be able to cover this no problem.” Another charged me a (much more reasonable) $60 for a “math tutor.” They sent me taunting messages via my professional website, which I have since taken offline. Everyone I spoke to said it would blow over. These things fizzle out sooner rather than later, usually within 24 hours given the state of the nonstop news cycle. I earnestly believed them, especially because as a writer in the digital age, covering viral moments is a key aspect of my work. I know how swiftly the conversation shifts, how furiously fast people move from one headline to the next. Itdie down by tomorrow, I thought. Sure enough, the backlash to my math flub started to stabilize. I was still receiving hateful messages, but the trolls seemed to be moving on as anticipated. By that night I was in a better headspace. After watching MSNBC for about an hour, I told my husband we should watch thereunion. We’d devoured the series, and I was eager to see the final installment of that so-called social experiment. Just as the reunion episode was wrapping up, my phone began buzzing. I was getting a string of notifications from Twitter. Although I had protected my tweets, I could still be tagged in random posts. In one, someone had shared a picture of their TV screen, which featured talking heads and a tweet. I squinted, trying to decipher what it read.“Oh my God,” I said. “This can’t be happening.”“What?” my husband asked, confused about why I had suddenly pressed pause. I was about to enter a new, far less entertaining “social experiment.” I switched back to MSNBC. Brian Williams’s show,was still on air. I began to rewind through the last 40 minutes of programming. I wanted to throw up, faint, or both.“This can’t be happening, this can’t be happening…,” I continued to mutter under my breath as my husband stared at me. I found the spot in the show where my tweet was featured. I pressed play. And—in a mixture of pure mortification and utter disbelief—I watched as Williams not only mentioned my tweet but proceeded toas though my math were correct. (Well, I watched some of the segment before burying my face into the couch in horror.)“It’s an incredible way of putting it,” Williams said after reading a screenshot of my tweet to his guest pundit, Mara Gay, a member of the editorial board. “It’s an incredible way of putting it,” Gay responded. “It’s true, it’s disturbing.”“No, no, no, no,” I kept repeating. I turned to my husband. “This can’t be real. Is this a nightmare? Can you pinch me?” He’s not a man who shocks easily these days, but he looked about as speechless as I’d ever seen him. Needless to say, it didn’t blow over. It blew up. Several major news outlets, including The Associated Pressand the, covered the story. I wasa punchlineon the most recent episode of John Oliver’sLast Week Tonight. At its height, my tweet had permeated enough of the social discourse to enter Twitter’s top trending topics. After the MSNBC segment, my mind was spinning. Williams ultimately read a correction on air near the end of his show, but the damage had been done. I don’t know why the anger and vitriol I received surprised me. I’ve read many stories about people—mostly women—who deal with misogyny and online harassment, often on a regular basis. But as with all lived experiences, it’s just not something you fully understand until you go through it yourself. When you go viral, all perceived boundaries between you and the rest of the world disappear. As an introvert with anxiety and depression, this is an extremely uncomfortable reality to face. I am very protective of my space and energy. I need boundaries to feel safe. Despite doing my best to put up some barriers to drown out the noise, people still found disturbing ways to break through. They tried hacking into my email, website, and social media accounts. One man, who claimed to be an alum of my alma mater, found my wedding registry site and sent $1.52 to my husband and me.“I am contributing to your honeymoon fund on behalf of Michael Bloomberg,” he wrote. “Thank you for embarrassing the rest of us UNL School of Journalism grads.”I know I messed up. That’s why I deleted the tweet: to prevent the spread of my miscalculation. It wasn’t just that it was personally humiliating—it was also plain wrong. I acknowledged it, and I tried to mitigate it. But the internet is not a place where you can have a brain freeze, make a dumb math mistake, andYou must be shamed for daring to display your humanity. And if you’re a woman—especially a woman of color—that shame will arrive in the form of attacks on your identity and intelligence. I lost count of the number of messages I received telling me to “go back to school,” as if one public math error negates my entire educational history and two college degrees. Many called into question my journalistic ability. “Look who she writes for,” one person remarked, aghast that I could have a successful careerhave the audacity to be imperfect at the same time. While the rest of the world may be shuffling onto the next viral moment, I am not afforded the opportunity to carry on as quickly. In this day and age—filled with an endless supply of memes and TikToks—we often fail to realize that the viral moment doesn’t end when we’re no longer entertained by it. Those whomust move forward in the real world, even if their viral persona remains forever frozen in time in the digital world. After going viral, there is debris to pick up and clear. I still haven’t resurfaced on Twitter or unprotected my tweets, though that may change by the time this story is published. I have thousands of follower requests to sort through (I suspect many are trolls and/or bots). Eventually, I’ll need to put my website back up. Every now and then I’m hit with a paralyzing fear: Will Ilive this down? I worry this one tweet will now come to define my legacy, that my tombstone is now fated to say, “Here rests Mekita. She could string words together, but boy, was she bad at math.”I know that’s letting the negativity and noise get to me. And although this experience illustrated how terrible people can be, it also revealed how unbelievably kind they can be too. Occasionally, as I waded through all those antagonistic messages, I’d come across rays of sunshine. “Hang in there,” several people remarked. Another said: “I wanted to reach out to let you know two things: One, you’re not alone, and two, this will pass.” I nearly burst into tears. Becoming a cultural talking point is bizarre. So much of it is out of your control. Once it happens, there’s no reset button. I thought deleting a tweet would prevent this whole debacle, but I was also severely underestimating my own reach. I will bemore deliberative about what I share and post online in the future. But chief among all the lessons I’ve learned is this: There will always be people who think they know everything about you, probably based on little to no information. But the only person who knows you best is you. And no amount of viral notoriety can change that.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0418432577523486,0.4859343453749048,2427,2,Glamour
357,Border Patrol Seize Record Amount of Fentanyl in June,8.33,41.67,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/border-patrol-seize-record-amount-of-fentanyl-in-june/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"Federal agents seized a record 1,060 pounds of fentanyl in June, U. S. Customs and Border Protection announced Friday. More fentanyl was seized in June 2021 than in the last three Junes combined, the Daily Caller first reported. CBP reported 109 seizures in June with an average of 9.7 pounds per seizure. That number was down from 132 seizures in May. CDC data reveals that more than 93,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year, marking a 30 percent uptick from 2019, with 69,000 of those overdose fatalities being opioid-related. The surge in drug-related deaths has primarily been attributed to opioid overdoses, especially from opioids laced with fentanyl, according to the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. As little as two milligrams of fentanyl can constitute a lethal dose, according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. In May, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott said that the Biden administration’s relaxed immigration policies are to blame for the massive influx of fentanyl infiltrating the Texas interior. He subsequently deployed 1,000 Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and National Guard members to combat the drug trafficking. He also announced he will sign legislation to codify the manufacturing or delivery of fentanyl as a criminal offense, beginning as a third-degree felony.“Biden’s deadly border policies are being felt in communities throughout TX & the country. DPS & @TexasGuard are working to get these drugs off the streets,” Abbott tweeted in May. Abbott and Governor Ron DeSantis participated in a joint briefing Saturday to discuss the two states’ efforts on border security.“What’s happening here at the border may be happening here today but it may be happening in these other states tomorrow, next week or next month,” Abbott said. He emphasized that the flow of fentanyl across the border necessitates bolstered law enforcement.“We appreciate you stepping up where the federal government won’t and we understand how important this is to not just Texas, but other states,” DeSantis added. CBP accounted for 188,829 encounters on the southern border in June, the greatest level since March 2000, according to agency data released Friday.",3,Reliable,0.0579594017094017,0.3489316239316239,496,2,National Review
358,Repairing the World,-9.0,42.33,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-11-09/repairing-world,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,17,"A successful candidate for president of the United States has plenty of choices to make. He can select his vice president, the members of his cabinet, and the text of his inaugural address. (I say “he” only because Americans have yet to elect a woman to the position.) He can also decide which executive orders to issue, where to make his first trip abroad, and whom to invite to the United States. One thing that an incoming president cannot choose, however, is the inbox that awaits him. When he first enters the Oval Office, President-elect Joe Biden will be greeted by an inbox that can only be described as daunting. There will be a seemingly unlimited number of domestic and international challenges that call out for his attention. The question of what to do and in what sequence is inescapable, since presidents have only so much time and so many resources at their disposal. They must set clear priorities that reflect their assessment of urgency, opportunity, and reality. The Jewish concept ofmeans “repairing the world.” For individuals, it is a code to live by—the responsibility of each and every one of us to mend the broken world we live in and try to make it a better place, to work to improve the welfare of others rather than just our own. Buttikkun olamalso offers a code to govern by. This world is in dire need of repair, a process that will take time and inevitably meet with uneven success. But it is essential to keep in mind that repair is distinct from building. Repair means taking what exists but is broken and making it work; building is about creating something new, be it to better achieve existing goals or in some cases to accomplish new ones. Repair should define the opening initial six to nine months of a Biden administration’s foreign policy, and only after that will there come the opportunity, and in some areas the necessity, to build. The domestic context could hardly be worse. By inauguration day, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have claimed 300,000 American lives; each day between now and then is nearly certain to bring more than 100,000 new cases and more than 1,000 deaths. Unemployment is expected to be in the range of six to seven percent. Millions of Americans will be unable to make their rent or mortgage payments. The internal challenges facing this country go well beyond its physical and economic health. The United States is a country divided. More than 70 million Americans voted for Donald Trump, and many of them will buy into his destructive narrative that the election was stolen and believe that Biden is an illegitimate president. American society will be split on matters of wealth inequality, race, and education. The two parties (neither of which is monolithic) embrace radically opposed positions on matters of policy ranging from taxes to police reform and health care. Government may be divided as well, since the Republicans have a good chance of maintaining control of the Senate and the Democrats’ margin of control in the House of Representatives will be reduced. Although domestic challenges will rightly absorb a large percentage of Biden’s time and resources, the outside world will not patiently wait while his administration sorts things out at home. To the contrary, the international inbox is no less daunting. To blame his predecessor for all or even most of the international challenges that will await Biden would be to misread history. That can be partly attributed to Trump’s policies. There are areas in which the Trump administration got things right: in calling out China for its trade practices, in supplying lethal arms to Ukraine, in striking an updated trade deal with Canada and Mexico, in brokering normalization between Israel and several Arab states. But there are many more in which the administration got things wrong: in undermining the alliances that had been the bedrock of international stability for 75 years (in turn raising questions about U. S. reliability among friends and foes alike), in withdrawing from international agreements and institutions without putting anything better in their place, in cozying up to authoritarian leaders in China, North Korea, Russia, and Turkey to little or no real end. Trump’s frequent violation of democratic norms and policies such as separating migrant children from their parents and banning travelers from many Muslim-majority countries also did much to undermine America’s appeal around the world. But to blame his predecessor for all or even most of the international challenges that will await Biden would be to misread history. Many were in play long before Trump and will persist long after he exits the Oval Office: a rising and more assertive China, a Russia willing to use military force and cyber-capabilities to advance its goals, a North Korea with growing nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, an Iran committed to carrying out an imperial strategy in a turbulent Middle East, advancing climate change, weak and ineffective governments in much of the developing world, an ongoing refugee crisis. Simply reversing what Trump did or did not do, however welcome in many instances, would not solve the problem. The first task of repair comes in a realm not always thought of as a matter of national security: public health. The administration must begin by getting COVID-19 contained at home. The arrival of therapeutics and vaccines will obviously help, but their timing and effectiveness are largely beyond the government’s control. What the administration can do, however, is make the development of a quick, accurate, easy-to-administer, and inexpensive point-of-care test a national priority. A Biden administration can also do much more to encourage responsible behaviors, above all mask wearing. Progress in containing the pandemic is essential to reviving the economy, to restoring the United States’ reputation for competence, and to giving the new administration bandwidth to tackle other problems, both domestic and international. To extend the medical imagery, stabilizing the patient—that is, ourselves—is essential for anything and everything we might choose to do. The administration must begin by getting COVID-19 contained at home. A Biden administration could and should rejoin the World Health Organization (as it is reportedly planning to do soon after inauguration), not because the organization is not flawed but because it is. An empowered WHO is needed to end the pandemic and to prepare for inevitable future outbreaks, as well as to tackle noncommunicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease (still the greatest cause of illness and death worldwide). It will take the United States working with like-minded partners within the WHO to reform it, so that during future outbreaks no country can stifle investigations or pressure the organization to alter its recommendations, as China did in the early weeks of this pandemic. Much of this work, however, will fall under building; the first step is to rejoin the WHO and help it do all it can to contend with the current pandemic. The United States should also join international efforts to develop, manufacture, fund, allocate, and distribute vaccines. Such participation would help ensure that the United States can benefit from vaccines that emerge elsewhere first. And for those vaccines developed in the United States, making a portion available to others would go a long way to restoring U. S. standing in the world, as well as speeding the economic and physical recovery of others—which would in turn be good for both U. S. recovery and global stability. Doing this would literally help to fix the world. A second priority for repair should be alliances—the great structural advantage of U. S. foreign policy. Alliances and partnerships provide for a pooling of resources to meet both local security threats and global challenges. Yet in recent years, most U. S. allies have lost confidence in the United States, the result of its unwillingness to stand up to adversaries and reticence to stand by friends (along with the country’s own domestic shortcomings). Setting out immediately to demonstrate a new, more consultative and committed approach to alliances would signal that there is a new and very different sheriff in town, one willing to work with allies on the full range of international issues. Repaired alliances would provide a stronger basis for all else the United States would want to do in the world. Beyond convening genuine consultations, the Biden administration can make tangible moves that demonstrate its commitment to allies early in its term. It can immediately stop the ill-advised withdrawal of troops from Germany and resolve differences with South Korea over financial support for U. S. troops based there. It should revisit the agreement with the Taliban to withdraw U. S. troops from Afghanistan; future troop drawdowns should be tied to Taliban behavior and capabilities and coupled with long-term commitments of economic and military aid to the government. The new administration can also coordinate with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to forge a new approach to Iran—for example, pledging to rejoin the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the condition that Iran roll back anything done beyond the deal’s limits and that U. S. allies work with Washington in the coming months and years to develop a new framework that will last longer than the current deal (some of the nuclear provisions will begin to sunset within the next five years). And in Asia, the Biden administration can immediately begin consultations with South Korea and Japan on the best approach to North Korea, one that predicates any relaxation of sanctions on specified areas of North Korean restraint. Setting out immediately to demonstrate a new, more consultative and committed approach to alliances would signal that there is a new and very different sheriff in townThe administration can underscore that multilateralism is back by rejoining international agreements and institutions—not as a favor to others but because it is in the U. S. interest. In addition to the WHO, an obvious place to begin would be the Paris climate accord (which Biden is also reportedly planning to rejoin early in his administration). That would have the right symbolic impact even as the real work, given that the voluntary commitments under Paris would not come close to addressing the climate challenge, will come over time via a successor agreement and other aspects of a comprehensive and ambitious climate policy. Similarly, the administration can move quickly to nail down an extension of the soon-to-expire New START arms control accord with Moscow, even as it will take much longer to develop a comprehensive approach to Russia that addresses its interference in U. S. politics, use of force in the Middle East and Europe, and domestic abuses, such as attacks on opposition figures including Alexei Navalny. With China, too, it will take time to craft a comprehensive policy—one that addresses everything from trade and technology to human rights to strategic concerns related to the South China Sea, Taiwan, and China’s growing assertiveness with its neighbors. More immediately, however, the new administration can take two important steps. It can make clear that this new policy will be developed in close coordination with allies in Asia and Europe, which will make it more widely supported and thus much more likely to succeed. And it can indicate a willingness to convene a serious, strategic dialogue with Beijing, in order to determine areas of potential cooperation (for example, on North Korea and climate change) and to limit areas of unavoidable disagreement (or more realistically, perhaps, to limit the possibility that such disagreements escalate into confrontation). The same sequence—first a time for repair, then a time to build—will hold for many of the other issues filling the new administration’s inbox. Several months will be needed to get a new national security team in place, to reestablish a disciplined policy process, and to complete initial interagency policy reviews. Time will be needed to hold discussions with members of Congress from both parties in an effort to find common ground; during both the current and previous administrations, too much U. S. foreign policy has been made by the executive branch alone, making it all too easy to reverse and thus undercutting U. S. reliability. There may be consensus, for example, on how best to counter China and Russia, and even on such decisions as whether, and on what terms, to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has the potential to advance U. S. strategic, economic, and climate goals all at the same time. One could imagine initiatives to overhaul the World Trade Organization, rebuild and modernize the Foreign Service, set international ground rules for cyberspace, promote change in Venezuela and Syria, compete with China’s Belt and Road Initiative and offer alternatives to Chinese 5G, strengthen NATO, promote diplomatic progress between Israel and the Palestinians, and much more. The argument is not that these and other new efforts might not be promising but that they will all require time to develop and during that time the emphasis must be on repairing what is broken. Both the United States and the world are damaged, the result of the pandemic and four years of a U. S. foreign policy committed to profound disruption. While disruption is not inherently good or bad, under the Trump administration it deeply damaged the United States’ reputation and a valuable set of relationships and institutions that had been painstakingly built over three-quarters of a century. The presidential campaign indicated that the American people are not especially preoccupied with global problems, which will both introduce constraints and create opportunities for the new administration, especially when it comes to diplomacy. But to realize opportunities to build, the administration will first have to complete the urgent task of repair, at home and in the rest of the world.",3,Reliable,0.1308408979664486,0.3884035763551183,2823,3,Foreign Affairs
359,"After 2020 surge, Colorado gun sales continue at record pace in 2021",-1.67,44.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/10/colorado-gun-sales-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Coloradans since last year have bought guns at such a rapid pace that gun store owners struggled to keep their shelves stocked. Bristlecone Shooting, Training and Retail Center in Lakewood generally carries several hundred guns at any time, but during the pandemic, the shop’s stock sometimes dropped to as few as 10, co-owner Jacquelyn Clark said. The store’s supply of guns has improved, but it’s still limiting how much ammunition people can buy.“There’s been a massive increase in demand at every level,” Clark said. More Coloradans than ever before bought guns last year and data from the first five months of 2021 show the record pace of purchases continues. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation approved 487,097 gun sales in 2020 — a 45% increase over 2019 and the highest number ever recorded in the state,data collected by the agency shows. More gun sales were approved in 2020 than were recorded in 2000, 2001 and 2002 combined.“The manufacturers could not keep up with the demand,” said Chuck Lawson, a customer service representative at Centennial Gun Club. “It was a number of factors that really changed everything. When COVID hit, people rushed out and bought toilet paper and guns. Then the riots hit, and people bought guns. Then there was the election, which are always good for gun sales.”In the first five months of 2021, CBI approved 205,918 gun sales. If that rate continues, this year’s sales will exceed those recorded in 2020. The pre-purchase background checks conducted by CBI and other law enforcement agencies do not necessarily equate to a gun sale, but academics and the firearms industry use the number of checks as a way to keep track of demand and firearm sales trends since there is no centralized database of gun sales and ownership. Monthly data shows background checks spiked 59% month-over-month in March 2020 — the same month Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic. The checks dropped slightly in the following months, but remained higher than pre-pandemic averages. Gun sales bumped up and down, but remained largely elevated, during the months following massive racial justice protests in many Colorado communities during the summer of 2020, data shows. Sales ticked back up near their early-pandemic level in January 2021, the month President Joe Biden took office following the riot at the U. S. Capitol that interrupted the certification of the election results. Many of the customers who came to Bristlecone Shooting in the last year were people who never owned a gun before and were looking to purchase something for self-defense, Clark said. People were searching for a way to feel safe as COVID-19 spread across the U. S. and upended normal life, she said.“We had people coming in every day saying, ‘I’ve never held a gun in my life,'” Lawson said. According to CBI data, about 57% of guns sold in Colorado last year were handguns, which are often peoples’ preferred type of firearm for self-defense. Wait times for CBI to complete the necessary background checks also skyrocketed during the pandemic. In 2019, the average wait time never exceeded 11 minutes, CBI data shows. In 2020, the maximum average wait time was 3 days and 23 hours. Demand for the classes required to obtain a concealed carry permit also skyrocketed, Clark said. Between March and December 2020, sign-ups for the safety classes at Bristlecone Shooting were up about 300% compared to the year prior. That’s a good thing, she said, because people are seeking training on how to use guns as safely as possible.“You need to know how to safely operate it and you need to know how to safely store it,” Clark said. The surge in gun purchases in Colorado is part of a national trend, federal data shows. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 2020processed 39.7 million firearm purchase background checks — the highest annual number ever recorded and a 40% increase from 2019. Like in Colorado, sales started to spike in March 2020. Phillip Levine, a statistics and economics professor at Wellesley College, pointed to an analysis published by the Brookings Institute that found3 million more guns were sold between March and July of 2020than would be expected if previous years’ trends held.“The primary driver of gun sales is uncertainty,” Levine said. “When Americans are uncertain about aspects of their lives, they turn to firearms.”Those uncertainties can take many forms. Gun sales often shoot up if there is talk of enacting new gun regulations and sometimes after mass shootings — but generally only when those tragedies spur calls for more gun control and there seems to be the political will to enact it, he said. Political uncertainty and the election of Democrats also fuel sales. Levine found that the rate of sales in states did not correlate with COVID-19 death rates or increases in unemployment. It’s also impossible that 2020’s nationwide surge in firearm purchases was fueled by people in cities where large racial justice protests took place after the murder of George Floyd, he said.“It’s not really localized, these responses. People are responding to the national mood,” Levine said. Clark and Lawson both said that sales have started to slow in the last month or two, just as supply chains are improving. The staff at Centennial Gun Club no longer has to spread out merchandise on the shelves to keep them from looking bare. But gun sales remain high. Two decades of CBI data show that Coloradans continue to buy guns at a higher rate than they did at the beginning of the millennium. Colorado’s population grew from 4.1 million in 2000 to 5.8 million in 2020 and the per capita rate of gun sales has more than doubled in that time. In 2000, CBI approved 3.3 gun sales per 100 residents. In 2020, that number rose to 8.7 sales per 100 people.",3,Reliable,0.1124783011350175,0.4054563761280179,1263,3,Denver Post

As a result, some makeup wearers may be absorbing and ingesting these chemicals, called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, the researchers said. AdvertisementSeveral of the products tested, including multiple brands of waterproof mascara, liquid lipstick and foundations, had high fluorine levels -- a sign of the ""probable presence of PFAS,"" which are also known as ""forever chemicals.""Products with the highest fluorine levels that underwent further analysis were found to contain at least four PFAS of concern, with the majority not listed on the label.

Advertisement""But unlike food, chemicals in lipstick and other makeup and personal care products are almost entirely unregulated,"" said Peaslee, a professor of physics at the University ofNotre Damein South Bend, Ind. In addition to potentially ingesting PFAS from lip products, cosmetic wearers may be absorbing the chemicals through their skin and tear ducts so that they enter the bloodstream, the researchers said. PFAS, which have also been found in drinking water, soil and in food packaging, can accumulate in the human body and persist in the environment -- hence their nickname ""forever chemicals.""Some studies have linked them with fertility problems, birth defects, obesity, diabetes and cancer, according to the Washington, D. C.-basedEnvironmental Working Group. The chemicals are often intentionally added to personal care products such as dental floss, lotion, cleanser, foundation, lipstick, eyeliner, eyeshadow, water-proof mascara, nail polish and shaving cream to improve their durability, texture and water resistance. The Environmental Working Group has been pushing federal lawmakers to more strongly regulate PFAS, including labeling some of these chemicals as carcinogens, designating them as hazardous to human health.""The public shouldn't have to worry that they're putting their own health at risk by doing something as routine and mundane as applying personal care products,"" Scott Faber, the group's senior vice president for government affairs, said in a press release.

Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., are expected to introduce legislation this week that would ban toxic PFAS in cosmetics. For the new study, Peaslee and his colleagues screened 231 cosmetic products purchased in the United States and Canada for fluorine, a sign of the presence of PFAS, using particle-induced gamma-ray emission spectroscopy. More than three-quarters of waterproof mascara, nearly two-thirds of foundations and liquid lipsticks and more than half of eye and lip products had high fluorine concentrations, they said. All 29 products selected for targeted analysis contained detectable levels of at least four specific PFAS, including those known to break down into other forever chemicals that are highly toxic and environmentally harmful. Nearly all of the 29 products in the separate analysis did not have any PFAS listed on their ingredient labels. Many of the products containing PFAS were advertised as ""wear-resistant"" or ""long-lasting."" In many cases, PFAS listed on product labels often include ""fluoro"" in the ingredient name, the researchers said.

361,How The Guardian Betrayed Corbyn and the Vestiges of British Democracy,-11.67,35.0,https://consortiumnews.com/2020/08/11/how-the-guardian-betrayed-corbyn-and-the-vestiges-of-british-democracy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2020-08-11,23,"t is simply astonishing that the first attempt by– the only major British newspaper styling itself as on the liberal-left – to properlyexaminethe contents of a devastating internal Labour party report leaked in April is taking place nearly four monthsafterthe 860-page report first came to light. If you are a Labour party member,is the only “serious”, big-circulation paper claiming to represent your values and concerns. One might therefore have assumed that anything that touches deeply on Labour party affairs – on issues of transparency and probity, on the subversion of the party’s democratic structures, on abuses or fraud by its officials – would be of endless interest to the paper. One might have assumed it would wish both to dedicate significant resources to investigating such matters for itself and to air all sides of the ensuing debate to weigh their respective merits. My latest: Labour's explosive leaked report, showing how party officials plotted to destroy Corbyn, including by weaponising antisemitism, is being quietly swept under the carpet by the media and Labour's new leader Keir Starmer— Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook)April 16, 2020That very much fits a pattern of coverage of the Corbyn years by the paper, as I have tried todocument. It echoes the paper’s treatment of an earlier scandal, back in early 2017, when an undercoverreporter filmed pro-Israel Labour activists working with the Israeli embassy to damage Corbyn from within. A series of shocking reports byAl-Jazeeramerited minimal coverage from The Guardianat the time they were aired and then immediately sank without trace, as though they were of no relevance to later developments – most especially, of course, the claims by these same groups of a supposed “antisemitism crisis” in Labour. Sadly, the latest reports byon the leaked report –presented as an “exclusive” – do not fundamentally change its long-running approach. In fact, what the paper means by an “exclusive” is that it has seen documents responding to the leaked report that were submitted by Corbyn and his team to the Forde inquiry – Labour’s official investigation into that report and the circumstances of its leaking. The deadline for submissions to Martin Forde QC arrived last week. Setting up the Forde inquiry was the method by which Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer, hoped to kick the leaked report into the long grass till next year. Doubtless Starmer believes that by then the report will be stale news and that he will have had time to purge from the party, or at least intimidate into silence, the most outspoken remnants of Corbyn’s supporters. Corbyn’s submission on the leaked report is an “exclusive” foronly because no one in the corporate media bothered till now to cover the debates raging in Labour since the leak four months ago. The arguments made by Corbyn and his supporters, so prominent on social media, have been entirely absent from the so-called “mainstream”. When Corbyn finally got a chance to air the issues raised by the leaked report in a series of articles on thewebsite, itscoveragewent viral, underscoring how much interest there is in this matter among Labour members. Nonetheless, despite desperately needing clicks and revenue in this especially difficult time for the corporate media,is still spurning revelatory accounts of Corbyn’s time in office by his former team. One published last week – disclosing that, after winning the leadership election, Corbyn arrived to find the leader’s offices gutted, that Labour HQ staff refused to approve the hiring of even basic staff for him, and that disinformation was constantly leaked to the media – was relegated to thewebsite. That Joe Ryle, a Corbyn team insider, either could not find a home for his insights inor didn’t even try says it all – because much of the disinformation he laments being peddled to the media ended up inThe Guardian, which was only too happy to amplify it as long as it was harming Corbyn. Meanwhile, everything in’s latest “exclusive” confirms what has long been in the public realm, via the leaked report. Through its extensive documentation of WhatsApp messages and emails, the report shows conclusively that senior Labour officials who had dominated the party machine since the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown eras – and were still loyal to the party’s centre-right incarnation as New Labour – worked at every turn to oust Corbyn from the leadership. They even tried to invent ways to bar him from standing in a rerun leadership election a year later, in 2016, after Owen Smith, the Labour right’s preferred candidate, challenged him. Corbyn and his supporters were viewed as dangerous “Trots” – to use a derisive term that dominates those exchanges. The messages show these same officials did their level best to sabotage Labour’s 2017 general election campaign – an election that Corbyn was less than 3,000 votes from winning. Party officials starved marginal seats Corbyn hoped to win of money and instead focused resources on MPs hostile to Corbyn. It seems they preferred a Tory win if it gave momentum to their efforts to rid the party of Corbyn. Or, as the submissionnotes: “It’s not impossible that Jeremy Corbyn might now be in his third year as a Labour prime minister were it not for the unauthorised, unilateral action taken by a handful of senior party officials.”The exchanges in the report also show that these officials on the party’s right privately gave voice tohorrifying racismtowards other party members, especially black members of the party loyal to Corbyn. And the leaked report confirms the long-running claims of Corbyn and his team that the impression of “institutional antisemitism” in Labour – a narrative promoted in the corporate media without any actualevidencebeyond the anecdotal – had been stoked by the party’s rightwing, Blairite officials. They appear to have delayed and obstructed the handling of the small number of antisemitism complaints – usually found by trawling through old social media posts – to embarrass Corbyn and make the “antisemitism crisis” narrative appear more credible. Corbyn’s team have pointed out that these officials – whose salaries were paid by the membership, which elected Corbyn as party leader – cheated those members of their dues and their rights, as well as, of course, subverting the entire democratic process. The submission rightly asks the inquiry to consider whether the money spent by Labour officials to undermine Corbyn “constituted fraudulent activity”. One might go even further and argue that what they did amounted to a political coup. Corbyn's team arrived to find the leadership's offices gutted, Labour HQ refused to approve the hiring of even basic staff, and disinformation was constantly leaked to the media. An insider recounts how the Blairites waged war on Corbyn from day one— Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook)August 7, 2020Even now, asreports on Corbyn’s submission to the Forde inquiry, it has downplayed the evidence underpinning his case, especially on the antisemitism issue – whichThe Guardianplayed such a key role in weaponising in the first place. The paper’s latest coverage treats the Corbyn “claims” sceptically, as though the leaked report exists in a political vacuum and there are no other yardsticks by which the truth of its evidence or the plausibility of its claims can be measured. Let’s start with one illustrative matter., as with the rest of the corporate media, even now avoids drawing the most obvious conclusion from the leaked report. Racism was endemic in the language and behaviours of Labour’s senior, rightwing officials, as shown time and again in the WhatsApp messages and emails. And yet it is these very same officials – those who oversaw the complaints procedure as well as the organisation of party headquarters – who, according to the corporate media narrative, were so troubled by one specific kind of racism, antisemitism, that they turned it into the biggest, most enduring crisis facing Corbyn during his five-year tenure as leader. To accept the corporate media narrative on this supposed “antisemitism crisis”, we must ignore several things:And yet in its latest reporting, as with its earlier coverage,simply ignores all this confirmatory evidence. There are several reasons for this, as I have documented before, but one very obvious one is this:, like the rest of the British media, had worked hard topresentformer officials on the right of the party as brave “whistleblowers” long before they were exposed by the leaked report. Like the BBC’smuch-criticisedPanorama “investigation” last year into Labour’s alleged “antisemitism crisis”,took the claims of these former staff – of their supposed selfless sacrifice to save the party from anti-Jewish bigots – at face value. In fact, it was likely even worse than that.and BBC weren’t just passive, neutral recipients of the disinformation offered by these supposed “whistleblowers”. They shared the Labour right’s deep antipathy to Corbyn and everything he stood for, and as a result almost certainly served as willing, even enthusiastic channels for that disinformation.hardly bothers to conceal where its sympathies lie. It continues to laud Blair from beyond the political grave and, while Corbyn was leader, gave him slots in its pages to regularlylambastCorbyn and scaremonger about Labour’s “takeover” by the supposedly “extreme” and “hard” left. The paper did so despite the fact that Blair had grown ever more discredited as evidence amassed that his actions in invading Iraq in 2003 were crimes against humanity. Wereto now question the narrative it promoted about Corbyn – a narrative demolished by the leaked report – the paper would have to admit several uncomfortable things:To now question the narrative it invested so much energy in crafting would riskreaders drawing the most plausible conclusion for their paper’s consistent reporting failures: thatThe Guardianwas profoundly opposed to Corbyn becoming prime minister and allowed itself, along with the rest of the corporate media, to be used as channel for the Labour right’s disinformation. None of that has changed in the latest coverage of Corbyn’s submission to Forde concerning the leaked report.could not realistically ignore that submission by the party’s former leader and his team. But the paper could – and does – strip out the context on which the submission was based so as not to undermine or discredit its previous reporting against Corbyn. Its main article on the Corbyn team’s submission becomes a claim and counter-claim story, with an emphasis on an unnamed former official arguing that criticism of him and other former staff at Labour HQ is nothing more than a “mythical ‘stab in the back’ conspiracy theory”. The problem is that there are acres of evidence in the leaked report that these officialsstab Corbyn and his team in the back – and, helpfully for the rest of us, recorded some of their subversive, anti-democratic activities in private internal correspondence between themselves. Anyone examining those message chains would find it hard not to conclude that these officials were actively plotting against Corbyn. To discredit the Corbyn team’s submission, the Labour right would need to show that these messages were invented. They don’t try to do that because those messages are very obviously only too real. Instead they have tried two different, inconsistent strategies. First, they have argued that their messages were presented in a way that was misleading or misrepresented what they said. This claim does not hold water, given that the leaked report includes very lengthy, back-and-forth exchanges between senior staff. The context of those exchanges is included – context the officials themselves provided in their messages to each other. Second, the self-styled “whistleblowers” now claim that publication of their messages – documenting efforts to undermine Corbyn – violates their right to privacy and breaches data protection laws. They can apparently see no public interest in publishing information that exposes their attempts to subvert the party’s internal democratic processes. It seems that these “whistleblowers” are more committed to data concealment than exposure –despite the title they have bestowed on themselves. This is a strange breed of whistleblower indeed, one that seeks to prevent transparency and accountability. In a telling move, despite claiming that their messages have been misrepresented, these former officials want the Forde inquiry to be shut down rather than given the chance to investigate their claims and, assuming they are right, exonerate them. Further, they are trying to intimidate the party into abandoning the investigation bythreatening to bankruptit through legal actions for breaching their privacy. The last thing they appear to want is openness and a proper accounting of the Corbyn era. In its latest reporting,frames the leaked report as “clearly intended to present a pro-Corbyn narrative for posterity” – as though the antisemitism narrativeThe Guardianand the rest of the corporate media spent nearly five years crafting and promoting was not clearly intended to do the precise opposite: to present an anti-Corbyn narrative for posterity. Peter Walker, the paper’s political correspondent,describesthe messages of former, rightwing Labour officials as “straying” into “apparent” racism and misogyny, as though the relentless efforts revealed in these exchanges to damage and undermine prominent black MPs like Diane Abbott are open to a different interpretation. Officials at the very top of@UKLaboursaid stuff like “Abbott is truly repulsive” “Abbott literally makes me sick” and conspired with media against me. Now claiming remarks taken out of context. So let’s have full publication of all communications#LabourLeaks— Diane Abbott MP (@HackneyAbbott)August 7, 2020According to Walker, the report’s evidence of election-scuppering in 2017 is “circumstantial” and “there is seemingly no proof of active obstruction”. Even assuming that were true, such a deficiency could easily be remedied had, with all its staff and resources, made even the most cursory effort to investigate the leaked report’s claims since April – or in the years before, when the Corbyn team were trying to counter the disinformation spread by the Labour right.largely shrugs its shoulders, repeatedly insinuating that all this constitutes little more than Labour playground bickering. Starmer is presented as school principal – the one responsible adult in the party – who, we are told, is “no stranger to managing Labour factions”.ignores the enormous stakes in play both for Labour members who expected to be able to shape the party’s future using its supposedly democratic processes and for the very functioning of British democracy itself. Because if the leaked report is right, the British political system looks deeply rigged: there to ensure that only the establishment-loving right and centre-right ever get to hold power.’s approach suggests that the paper has abdicated all responsibility for either doing real journalism on its Westminster doorstep or for acting as a watchdog on the British political system. Typifying the hypocrisy ofand its continuing efforts to present itself a hapless bystander rather thanactiveparticipant in efforts to disrupt the Labour party’s internal democratic processes and sabotage the 2017 and 2019 elections is its lead columnist Jonathan Freedland. Outside of’s editorials, Freedland’s columns represent the closest we have to a window on the ideological soul of the paper. He is a barometer of the political mood there. Freedland was among the loudest and most hostile opponents of Corbyn throughout his time as leader. Freedland was also one of the chief purveyors and justifiers of thefabled antisemitism narrativeagainst Corbyn. He, and the rightwinghe also writes for, gave these claims an official Jewish seal of approval. They trumpeted the narrow, self-serving perspective of Jewish organisations like the Board of Deputies, whose leaders are nowadays closely allied with the Conservative party. They amplified the bogus claims of the Jewish Labour Movement, a tiny, pro-Israel organisation inside Labour that wasexposed– though, of course, never mentions it – as effectively an entryist group, and one working closely with the Israeli embassy, in that detailed undercover investigation filmed byAl-Jazeera. My latest: With last night's Panorama programme on supposed 'institutional anti-semitism' in Labour, the BBC demonstrated that it has become a media attack dog in the hands of the ruling Conservative party— Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook)July 11, 2019Freedland and theendlesslyderidedJewish groups that supported Corbyn, such as Jewish Voice for Labour, Just Jews and Jewdas, with antisemitic insinuations that they were the “wrong kind of Jews”. Freedlandarguedthat strenuous criticism of Israel was antisemiticby definitionbecause Israel lay at the heart of any proper Jew’s identity. It did not therefore matter whether critics could show that Israel was constitutionally racist – a state similar to apartheid South Africa – as many scholars have done. Freedland argued that Jews and Israel were all but indistinguishable, and to call Israel racist was to malign Jews who identified with it. (Apparently unaware of the Pandora’s box such a conflation opened up, he rightly – if inconsistently – claimed that it was antisemitic for anyone to make the same argument in reverse: blaming Jews for Israel’s actions.)Freedlandpushed hardfor Labour to be forced to adopt that new, troubling definition of antisemitism, produced by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, that shifted the focus away from hatred of Jews to criticism of Israel. Under this new definition, claims that Israel was “a racist endeavour” – a viewsharedby some prominent Israeli scholars – was treated as definitive proof of antisemitism. If anyone gave the weaponisation of antisemitism against Corbyn an air of bipartisan respectability it was Freedland and his newspaper,. They made sure Corbyn was hounded by the antisemitism claims while he was Labour leader, overshadowing everything else he did. That confected narrative neutralised his lifelong activism as an anti-racist, it polluted his claims to be a principled politician fighting for the underdog. Freedland andnot only helped to breathe life into the antisemitism allegations but they made them sound credible to large sections of the Labour membership too. The rightwing media presented the Corbyn project as a traitorous, hard-left move, in cahoots with Putin’s Russia, to undermine Britain. Meanwhile, Freedland anddestroyed Corbyn from his liberal-left flank by portraying him and his supporters as a mob of leftwing Nazis-in-waiting. Corbynism, in Freedland’s telling, became a “sect”, a cult of dangerous leftists divorced from political realities. And then, with astonishing chutzpah, Freedland blamed Corbyn’s failure at the ballot box – a failure Freedland andhad helped to engineer – as a betrayal of the poor and the vulnerable. Remember, Corbyn lost by less than 3,000 votes in a handful of Labour marginals in 2017. Despite all this, Freedland andnow pretend that they played no role in destroying Corbyn, they behave as if their hands are clean. But Freedland’s actions, like those of his newspaper, had one inevitable outcome. They ushered in the only alternative to Corbyn: a government of the hard right led by Boris Johnson. Freedland’sto assist Johnson by undermining Corbyn – and, worse, to do so on the basis of a disinformation campaign – makes him culpable, as it doesThe Guardian, in everything that flowed from his decision. But Freedland, likeThe Guardian, still pontificates on the horrors of the Johnson government, as if they share no blame for helping Johnson win power. In his latest column, Freedlandwrites: “The guiding principle [of the Johnson government] seems to be brazen cronyism, coupled with the arrogance of those who believe they are untouchable and that rules are for little people.”Why should the Tories under Johnson be so “arrogant”, so sure they are “untouchable”, that “rules are for little people”, and that there is no political price to be paid for “cronyism”?Might it not have much to do with seeing Freedland andassist so willingly in the corporate media’s efforts to destroy the only political alternative to “rule by the rich” Toryism? Might the Johnson government have grown more confident knowing that the ostensibly liberal-left media were just as determined as the rightwing media to undermine the only politician on offer who stood for precisely the opposite political values they did?Might it not reflect an understanding by Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, that Freedland andhave played a hugely significant part in ensuring that Britain effectively has a one-party state – and that when it returns to being a formal two-party state, as it seems to be doing once again now that Starmer is running the Labour party, both those parties will offer the same establishment-worshipping agenda, even if in two mildly different flavours?, like the rest of the corporate media, has derided and vilified as “populism” the emergence of any real political alternative. The leaked report offered a brief peek behind the curtain at how politics in Britain – and elsewhere – really works. It showed that, during Corbyn’s time as leader, the political battle lines became intensely real. They were no longer the charade of a phony fight between left and right, between Labour and Conservative. Instead, the battle shifted to where it mattered, to where it might finally make change possible: for control of the Labour party so that it might really represent the poor and vulnerable against rule by the rich. Labour became the battleground, andmade all too clear where its true loyalties lie. Jonathan Cook.net.

362,How China's Response to the COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory Means It Will Rumble On and On,-2.33,44.67,https://time.com/6052346/china-wuhan-covid-19-lab-leak/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-28,25,"Zhao Lijian isn’t one for pulling punches. So when asked Thursday about U. S. President Joe Biden’s decision to reinvestigate whether the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory, China’s hawkish Foreign Ministry spokesmancame out swinging: “What secrets are hidden in the suspicion-shrouded Fort Detrick and the over 200 U. S. bio-labs all over the world?”The lab leak hypothesis has returned to front pages across the world and Zhao’s baseless rekindling of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 came from the U. S. Army base in Maryland shows how the origin of the pandemic that has so far claimed 3.5 million lives globally is once again a central fissure in the already-tense U. S.-China relationship. It also spotlights the difficulty in finding any firm answers in an authoritarian state shrouded in secrecy, consumed by victimhood and determined to avoid any culpability that would undermine its pitch that liberal democracy is inferior to one-party autocracy—a contention that Biden hasvowed to fight at every turn. The fact remains, of course, that Biden’s decision to order intelligence agencies to report in 90 days on the lab leak theory isn’t based on any new evidence but the re-examination of existing claims. Key among them is that U. S. intelligence agencies reportedly believe three staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were treated in hospital in November 2019 with coronavirus-like symptoms—a claim that has circulated for months, but was first reported in detailin the. The U. S. intelligence community is itself split over the issue. “Either it emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals or it was a laboratory accident,” a statement from the U. S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Thursday. “Two elements of the [intelligence community] lean toward the former scenario and one leans more toward the latter.”Of course, China’s insistence of flinging mud instead of facilitating a thorough investigation means that not only will the cloud of suspicion remain, but we may never know the true cause behind the pandemic. Despite Zhao’s protestations of “China’s openness and transparency,” the facts tell a different story. Chinaarrested whistle-blower doctorsduring the first stages of the pandemic. It publiclydenied human-to-human transmissiondespite overwhelming evidence. Itsanctioned the virologistwho courageously published the first SARS-Cov2 genome without permission. Its National Health Commission forbade the publishing of any information regarding the Wuhan outbreak and ordered labs to destroy or transfer all viral samples to designated testing institutions, according to a Jan. 3orderseen by Beijing-based finance magazine. Universities have been instructed not to publish any report that indicates the virus originated in China, according to directives seen by TIME. Even journalists who have attempted toaccess bat caves in southwestern China—including TIME—have been met with harassment and intimidation. This web of obfuscation means that what was previously dismissed as a wild conspiracy theory—not least since it wasvociferously promotedby former President Donald Trumpalongside suggestions to inject bleach—is slowly gaining credence among some in the scientific community. On May 14, 18 prominent scientists—including Ralph Baric, a virologist who has worked with Wuhan Institute of Virology chief scientist Shi Zhengli—published a letterin the journalthat called for a new investigation because “theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable.” Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the U. S. National Institutes of Health, told senators May 26 that while it is most likely the virus arose naturally “we cannot exclude the possibility of some kind of a lab accident.” What undeniably feeds the conjecture is China’s unwillingness to conduct open investigations even into scenarios that could render the lab leak theory less compelling. Even when China belatedly allowed aWHO investigation to visit—over a year after the outbreak, when normal protocol would be to begin immediately—team members complained of insufficient access and data. Prominent scientists from around the world have pennedopen lettersto the WHO to demand a “full and unrestricted” new probe due to “structural limitations” that made realizing the original investigation’s goal “all but impossible.” In ajoint statement, the U. S. and 13 other governments expressed concerns over the study’s limited access to “complete, original data and samples.”The Chinese public, meanwhile, is split between nationalism and distrust of a government that few doubt has a strained relationship with the truth. “Whether it is the United States or China, no matter which institution is involved, we should find out the source of the virus to avoid another tragic disaster and ensure the lives of the people!” one user posted on social media platform Weibo. Another wrote: “It is necessary to find out the source of the coronavirus … any organization or person who obstructs the investigation is guilty of crimes against humanity and should be punished.”The fact remains that a lab leak is possible, though many still believe it is less likely than a natural zoonotic jump. Mistakes, of course, can happen anywhere. The last known case ofsmall-pox leaked from a U. K. laboratoryin 1978. SARS hasleaked from Chinese laboratorieson at least two occasions. U. S. scientists, meanwhile, have beenresponsible for mishandling many pathogens, including Ebola. According to Maureen Miller, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University who has worked with Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Shi in the past, Shi conducted research with a SARS-like coronavirus distantly related to SARS-Cov2 using only moderate biohazard protections—Biosafety Level (BSL) 2, by the international standard. “That is a BSL far too low for work with an agent of pandemic potential,” Miller tells TIME. In fact, since SARS-like coronaviruses had been responsible for two previous epidemics—SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012—”it probably should have been in BSL4 conditions—the highest biosafety level,” says Miller. Still, Miller adds, “While I agree that a thorough investigation of WIV to rule out a potential lab leak was never conducted, I still believe that remains the least likely hypothesis.” (Shi did not respond to TIME’s requests for comment.)Gallingly, there is forensic work that could help negate the lab leak theory. After all, two thirds of human viruses originated in animals. Simple antibody surveillance on blood samples stored in blood banks or hospitals across southern China—where bats carrying the most closely related SARS-like coronavirus are commonly found—could provide serious insights as to the true origins of SARS-CoV-2. Yet there appears a lack of will in China to truly get to the bottom of things. According to documentsobtained by Associated Press, scientists investigating bat caves have been ordered not to publish any data or research without the approval of top officials. Adds Miller: “I worry that the intense focus on the lab leak theory may distract from international pressure to investigate the much more likely hypothesis that the virus is a natural phenomenon.”Write toCharlie Campbell / Shanghaiatcharlie.campbell@time.com",3,Reliable,0.0284591738049184,0.4809074790457767,1605,3,Time Magazine
363,Texas Senate Passes Anti-Critical Race Theory in Schools Bill That Waters American History Down With White Tears,-21.17,26.5,https://www.theroot.com/texas-senate-passes-anti-critical-race-theory-in-school-1846948068,https://adfontesmedia.com/root-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-22,24,"America is a racist country, and the people working the hardest to prove that it isn’t are the same ones actively demonstrating that it is. At this point, it couldn’t be more apparent that the Republican war against Critical Race Theoryisn’t actually about CRT—because they don’t have the first clue what CRT even is. The popular narrative among GOPropagandists is that CRT teaches that white people are inherently racist and that some races are superior to others. Of course, anyone who has actually studied it knows that CRT—which is essentially a way of studying law and other political and social structures through the lens of race (because said structures have been around since racism was undeniably sanctioned through law)—doesn’t teach either of those things. So Republicans are prioritizing their feeling over facts and those feelings are becoming the basis for the bills they are pushing and signing into law. Texas’ state Senate passed a bill Saturday that not only bans CRT from being taught in public schools and open-enrollment charter schools, it essentially limits how Black history can be taught to what doesn’t hurt the feelings of fragile white people. From theTexas Tribune:Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, introduced a reworked version ofHouse Bill 3979that also requires the State Board of Education to develop new state standards for civics education with a corresponding teacher training program to start in the 2022-23 school year. The Senate approved the bill in an 18-13 vote over opposition from educators, school advocacy groups and senators of color who worry it limits necessary conversation about the roles race and racism play in U. S. history. The Senate-approved version revives specific essential curriculum standards that students are required to understand, including the Declaration of Independence and the Federalist Papers. But it stripped more than two dozen requirements to study the writings or stories of multiple women and people of color that were also previously approved by the House, despite attempts by Democratic senators to reinstate some of those materials in the bill. The Senate did vote to include the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, the 13th 14th and 19th amendments to the U. S. Constitution and the complexity of the relationship between Texas and Mexico to the list of required instruction. Yet the most controversial aspects of the bill remain, including that teachers must explore current events from multiple positions without giving “deference to any one perspective.” It also bars students from getting course credit for civic engagement efforts, including lobbying for legislation or other types of political activism. So basically, we’re looking at the status quo—the teaching of American history through the lens of white comfort. How exactly does one teach an honest and thorough lesson about the Civil Rights Act without teaching about the systemic white racism that made it necessary? How do you teach about the institution of American slavery without offering a “deference to any one perspective?” What other truthful and acceptable perspective is there other than “the shit was evil and white America allowed it to continue for roughly 250 years?”And then there’s this part: “It also bars students from getting course credit for civic engagement efforts, including lobbying for legislation or other types of political activism.”Open hypocrisy is pretty much on-brand for the Republican party, but the hypocrisy of conservative politicians lobbying for conservative legislation that promotes conservative political activism but also bars students from doing the same for their own ideological purposes is, well, like I said...on-brand. Sen. Brandon Creighton(R-Conroe) who sponsored the Senate version of the bill, told the Tribune that Texas schools should only promote “traditional history, focusing on the ideas that make our country great and the story of how our country has risen to meet those ideals.” I mean, I’m sure anyone would rather tell the version of their life story that edits out all of the evil and highlights the accomplishments made through saidevil, but that’s not a biography; that’s a love letter sent to one’s self out of denial of truthand delusions of greatness. Republicans don’t want a lesson on American history; they want an ode to American exceptionalism. They want historical accuracy through omission of everything that they feel makes their beloved country look bad, and that just isn’t how it works.“There were documents that were chosen, not by Hispanics, not by African Americans in this body, but by Anglos,” Sen. Royce West (D-Dallas) said on the Senate floor in raising concerns that white senators are making all of the rules. “No input from us in terms of what founding documents should in fact be considered by all children in this state.”This brings us back to CRT and how Republicans don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about when addressing it.“They have no idea what Critical Race Theory is, what it does, who the founders are. They’ve never read a book, much less a paragraph on it,” said Georgina Perez, who serves on the Texas State Board of Education. “I understand that maybe some white people are uncomfortable. Well, dammit, when Black people were being lynched, they sure as hell weren’t comfortable. Native Americans being removed from their land and Mexican Americans being shot to death in the middle of the night, that shit wasn’t comfortable either.”And people of color who are having our histories and struggles watered down to protect white feelings are also uncomfortable. We’re uncomfortable with lawmakers who are declaring that systemic racism in America isn’t a thing while blatantly displaying systemic racism. Anyway, according to the Tribune: “The bill now heads back to the Texas House, which can either accept the Senate’s changes or call for a conference committee made up of members from both chambers to iron out their differences.”",1,Questionable,0.0327103452103452,0.4273851148851147,1220,1,The Root
364,India Must Abandon Nehru’s Failed Non-Aligned Policy to Confront China,2.33,36.67,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/central_south_asia/k-sreedhar-rao-india-china-border-dispute-war-indian-foreign-policy-world-news-india-68374/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,21,"Troops fromIndiaandChinahave clashed this year in Ladakh and North Sikkim at the border between the two countries. Although there are immediate reasons for the clash, the deeper causes ofIndia’s border disputes with bothChinaand Pakistan are its post-independence historic blunders. Indiahas catastrophically failed to establish, delineate and demarcate its boundaries when it was in a position to do so. JawaharlalNehru, the firstIndian prime ministerafter independence in 1947, was a man of the leftist mold and so were many of his confidantes. They ignored reports ofChineseatrocities and progressive occupation of Tibet sent bySumal Sinha, the Indian consul general in Lhasa, andApa Pant, the dewan, the de facto prime minister, of the Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim, which at that time was a protectorate and is now a state ofIndiaTwo influential Indians emerge with much discredit. One is V. K. Krishna Menon,India’s defense minister from 1957 to 1962, who resolutely maintained thatIndiahad nothing to fear from China. The other isK. M. Panikkar,India’s ambassador to China from 1950 to 1952, whose advice “proved to be unwise.” Panikkar persuadedNehruto recognize China’s sovereignty over Tibet whenMao Zedong’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) took over this de facto independent buffer state in October 1950. The historianT. R. Ghodbolerecords that Panikkar “advisedNehrunot to raise the border issue” with China as the price for accepting the conquest of Tibet. One Indian leader shines in contrast. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,India’s first home minister andNehru’s deputy, was prescient about the Chinese threat. He wrote a now well-knownletter, to the prime minister, calling Chinese action “little short of perfidy.” Patel, a Gandhian from the right of the Indian National Congress party, argued that Chinese irredentism and communist imperialism were “ten times more dangerous” than Western expansionism or imperialism because it wore “a cloak of ideology.” The wise home minister died soon after writing this letter. Now, Indian policy was firmly in the hands of leftist ideologues who failed to take any of the steps he advocated to safeguard the country’s security interests. Nehrusoon embarked on his misconceived policy of non-alignment. He wanted to be the moral leader of the Third World who pioneered a policy of peace in contrast to the militaristic policies of imperial powers. As a result,Indiafailed to build up its own capabilities to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Nehruforgot to heed the Roman doctrine that if “you want peace, be prepared for war; therefore, let him who desires peace get ready for war.” He also forgot the ancientIndianstrategist Chanakya who postulated that “every neighbor is a potential enemy and an enemy’s enemy is a friend.”It was this complete absence of strategic thinking that led to the debacle in Tibet in 1950. Even asChinawas building up its strength and repudiating so-called unequal treaties imposed by imperial powers,Nehruwas content to swan around on the world stage as a moral, peaceful beacon for the world. It was this naive thinking that led the country to take the issue of Kashmir to the United Nations and fail to press home its military advantage in 1948. Back then,Indiawas in a position to claim the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir, including the parts thatChinanow controls. Indiafailed to understandChina’s worldview. Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state under President Richard Nixon, had his finger on the Chinese pulse in his book, “World Order. He observes thatChinahas considered itself as “the sole sovereign government of the world’ since its unification in 221 BC. It did not consider other monarchs as equal. They were mere “pupils in the art of governance, striving towards civilization.” The Chinese emperor commanded “all under heaven,”tianxiain Chinese parlance. Chinaforms the central, civilized part, “the Middle Kingdom” oftianxia. It is supposed to inspire and uplift the rest of humanity. Chinese PresidentXi Jinping is the son of an ardent Maoist. LikeMao, he has emerged as a modern-day Chinese emperor. Xi has reintroduced this idea of. His first act when he became the leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 2012 was to visit the Museum of Revolution. There he declared thatChinawas ready to be a world leader “because of its 5,000-year-old history, the CCP’s 95-year historical struggle and the 38-year development miracle of reform.” This is the danger that Patel foresaw butNehrudid not. In 1950,Indiacould have prevented the Chinese takeover of Tibet. It could have strengthened its garrison in Lhasa instead of withdrawing its troops, used its air force and supported the poorly equipped Tibetan forces. Chinawas isolated internationally in the 1950s. The Western powers were anti-communist and did not likeChineseinterference in Vietnam. China’s relations with the Soviet Union spiraled downward after 1955. Indiafailed to build a coalition againstChinaeven when the West had shown interest in supporting the TibetansIndeed, as Atul Singh, Glenn Carle and Vikram Sood record in a detailed article onFair Observer,Indiainexplicably turned down a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council. OnceChinaconquered Tibet, it was at India’s doorstep. In the 1950s, it stealthily took over 37,244 square kilometers of Aksai Chin and built a road connecting southern Tibet to Xinjiang. It also started claiming large chunks of Indian territory such as Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Ladakh. Indeed, theChineseclaim line extends right up to the plains of Assam. Singh, Carle and Sood have examined in some detail the various boundaries the British drew as their boundary with the Qing. Chinawas in turmoil after its revolution of 1911-12 and Tibet was de facto independent. It was a buffer state where the British had many strategic assets, whichIndiainherited but soon gave up toChina. Released files of the Central Intelligence Agencyrevealthe extent ofNehru’s capitulation toMao. Indiasigned a treaty with China and inexplicably agreed to withdraw troops from Tibetan towns of Yatung and Gyantse, which were mainly trading posts, and also wind up the garrison in Lhasa. It handed over control of postal, telegraph and telephone facilities to theChinese. None of these concessions satisfied theChinese. Instead, these missteps whetted the appetite of a resurgent Middle Kingdom. China did not accept any of the lines the British had drawn on the map and kept claiming more and more ofIndianterritory. Finally, war ensued. In 1962, China handed India a devastating defeat that continues to haunt the country to this day. The two countries severed diplomatic relations after the war. They restored them only in 1984. Since then, they have conducted several rounds of negotiations and signed several agreements but never been able to agree to define and demarcate the line of actual control (LAC), the de facto line dividing Indian and Chinese territory, or agree upon an international boundary. Despite India’s repeated efforts to get the LAC demarcated, the Chinese have been intransigent. It is far too convenient for them to have an undefined LAC, which allows them to alter it for strategic advantage whenever they have an opportune moment. Chinese intransigence is the key reason why the two countries have been unable to come to an agreement. In 1960, Zhou Enlai, the Chinese premier, proposed formalizing the status quo. He suggested India keep what is now called Arunachal Pradesh while China would retain Aksai Chin. Later, Deng Xiaoping reiterated Zhou’s position. In 1962, Chinese troops largely withdrew from Indian territory and even vacated the strategic town of Tawanga great center of Buddhist learning and pilgrimage. As per these actions, one could infer the Chinese took what they want. Sadly, this is not true. The Chinese have been consistently and persistently moving the goalposts. China now refuses to accept the McMahon Line in Arunachal Pradesh as the international boundary and is claiming Tawang again on the ground that the sixth Dalai Lama was born here. It is important to remember that the border alignment agreed by China with Myanmar follows roughly this very line. China has been constantly upgrading its military and building up its border infrastructure. It has also been breaching all the agreements that it signed with India. The only exception is the exchange of maps relating to the middle sector bordering the Indian state of Uttarakhand in2005. This year, China has displayed unusual belligerence far exceeding past practices. It has exerted pressure in both North Sikkim and Ladakh. The proximate reason lies in India belatedly boosting its border infrastructure. It has built the world’s highest airfield at Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO). An all-weather road now goes east from Leh, the capital of Ladakh, to Durbuk and then further east to the Shyok river, from where it turns north and runs all along the LAC right up to DBO. This airfield sits at the base of a historic pass through the Karakoram and gives India access to Central Asia. It is also close to the strategic Siachen Glacier where India controls the commanding heights and dominates Pakistan. For decades, India neglected its border infrastructure. Defeat to China in 1962 scarred the country. Its policymakers went into a defeatist mindset. They thought good roads would be used by the Chinese to speed into Indian territory while rugged undeveloped terrain would slow down Chinese advance. Domestic organizations and foreign private companies have now dramatically altered the ground situation, especially in the western sector. This has made China nervous. It feels the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) — a trade route that is important for Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and its geopolitical strategy in South Asia — might be under threat. Indian troops could block off its access to Gilgit-Baltistan. Possibly as a reaction, Chinese troops have been pressing at strategic points on the Ladakh border such as Gogra Hot Springs, Depsang Bulge, Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso Lake. They want to make sure that the road India has built to its airfield at DBO comes within range of Chinese gunsights. Nibbling Indian territory has been the general strategy for a long time. The Chinese are infamous for following “salami tactics” not only with India but also with other neighbors like Vietnam or Japan. Increasingly, China appears to be unnerved by India’s strategic direction. In 2017, New Delhi was firm in defending Bhutan’s territory in Doklam Plateau, which China lays claim to. India has strengthened ties with Australia, the European Union and the US. The specter of the Quad, an alliance of India, Japan, Australia and the US, blocking the Straits of Malacca — an international waterway — haunts China. In particular, China fears that the US is backing India to be a counterweight to China in Asia. Under President Xi, China has been increasingly aggressive on its borders. It has also been repressive internally. China has tightened the screws on Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang. TheBelt and Road Initiativeis another example of Chinese expansionism. China’s recent belligerence might come from a deep sense of insecurity due to several recent developments. The US has unleashed atrade warthat has hit China’s export-oriented economy hard. Furthermore, capital and manufacturing have been moving to Indonesia and Vietnam. India has now made a play for that capital as well. In addition, Western countries havecriticizedChina for its domestic as well as external actions. The COVID-19 pandemic has blotted its record and lowered its global image. India has supported the US in calling out China on its suppression of information about the pandemic and in instituting an inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 disease. India has long borne the brunt of Chinese aggression. It has never raised the issue of an independent Tibet in the international arena. It was the first non-socialist country to recognize China. Yet China has consistently acted against India’s interests. It has used Pakistan as a proxy against India. Beijing has even provided nuclear technology and fissile material to Islamabad. It blocks India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, an organization of nuclear-supplier countries. It has built a port in Sri Lanka and instigated the communist government in Nepal to act against India’s interests. The time has come for India to stand up to China’s bullying. The nation cannot allow China to keep gobbling up Indian territory. India has to keep modernizing its military, building up its border infrastructure and developing closer ties with other nations threatened by China. Most importantly, India has to recognize that China is its principal strategic enemy, both in the short and the long term. Therefore, India has no option but to cast off its failed non-aligned policy and ally with the US against China. Only a full-fledged military alliance between the world’s two largest democracies will deter the world’s biggest tyrannical regime.

365,Biden comment hints at boosting travel between US and Europe,0.0,44.0,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-joe-biden-europe-travel-coronavirus-pandemic-bebb0ef12f26d981334359557f66388c,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"A comment by President Joe Biden is encouraging airlines to hope that travel between the United States and Europe could be expanded in time for last-minute, late-summer vacation trips. At a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Biden was asked about ending restrictions that bar most European visitors from entering the United States. Biden said Thursday that a team that is advising him on the pandemic “brought that subject up. It’s in the process of (considering) how soon we can lift the ban ... and I will be able to answer that question to you within the next several days.”An official with the U. S. Travel Association, a trade group for the broader tourism industry, praised Biden’s comments.“The science says we can safely reopen international travel now, particularly for countries that have made considerable progress toward vaccinating their citizens,” said Tori Emerson Barnes, the travel group’s executive vice president of policy, citing studies that concluded there is a low risk of transmitting the virus during flights. “Each day that outdated restrictions on travel exist wreaks economic damage on our nation.”Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U. S. carriers, said “the time for action is now” to reopen to international visitors. The group noted that the U. S. allows travel to and from Mexico, where less than one-third of the population is vaccinated, while severely restricting travel from Canada and the United Kingdom, two countries with relatively high vaccination rates. The rise and prevalence of COVID-19 variants in Europe, especially the delta mutation that is also spreading throughout the U. S., has caused the Biden administration to tread slowly about increasing transatlantic travel. Last month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the administration was anxious to restore travel “as fully and quickly as possible,” but said he couldn’t put a date on reopening the country. “We have to be guided by the science, by medical expertise.”Most of continental Europe has relaxed restrictions on Americans who are fully vaccinated, although the United Kingdom still requires quarantines for most visitors arriving from the U. S. Airlines say, however, that the lack of two-way travel is limiting the number of flights they can offer and seats they can sell. In recent months, U. S. airlines have started new service to European countries that are open to American visitors. Delta launched new or resumed service to Greece, Iceland and Croatia, which opened early to vaccinated foreigners. In some cases, Americans who tested negative for the virus were able to skip quarantine requirements that were in place for other visitors. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said this week that bookings by Americans surged when those countries reopened and others followed.“The problem is, there are only Americans that we are carrying in (to Europe) and carrying out,” Bastian told The Associated Press. With most Europeans unable to enter the U. S., Delta has been forced to keep its transatlantic capacity at around half the level it was before the pandemic, he said.

366,Immigrants Detained by ICE Say They Were Thrown in Solitary for Requesting Covid-19 Tests,-11.33,46.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/ice-detention-center-covid-19-outbreak,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2020-12-02,25,"Long-time U. S. resident Shemoi Edwards looks on after release from immigration jail. Edwards, like many others, was locked in solitary confinement because of Covid-19. Photo by Cydni ElledgeThe InterceptInside his cell at the Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Ala., Karim Golding began feeling sick one day in June2020. He had a fever, a pounding headache, cold sweats, an​“onion burning sensation” behind his eyes and he was sleeping for days on end. When he finally felt well enough to emerge,​“the entire unit” was sick, Golding recalls.​“Everybody have some symptom or the other.”Three months earlier, as reportedin April,Golding, who has asthma, was a lead organizer of a protest inside the jail, pushing for stronger precautions to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Now, as Golding looked around, he realized their worst fears had come true. Etowah contracts with the federal government to hold people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). To prevent becoming a Covid-19hotspot, Etowah claims (in court documents) it follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including quarantining new arrivals, implementing social distancing measures and providing cleaning supplies. But Golding and more than a dozen other people detained by ICE say the measures taken were more than just inadequate — they led to a massive Covid-19outbreak. Seven of them say people were given a single disposable mask to last for three weeks. One shares a photo of what he says were the only​“cleaning supplies” he received — a toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and combo shampoo/​body wash — which came inside a gift bag emblazoned with the words​“Merry Christmas” from the Salvation Army. Immigrants detained inside Etowah also say many new arrivals were housed in quarantine for only five days or eight days — rather than the recommended two weeks — potentially allowing the virus to spread inside the jail. According to a partial Etowah roster obtained byandIn These Times, ICE transferred at least24people into the facility in June. By the second half of July, the agency reported that21people — nearly a quarter of those housed in Etowah’s ICE unit — were sick. When Golding finally emerged from his cell, the organizer part of his brain clicked back on.​“I’m looking at people that’s literally looking pale in the face,” he says.​“And medical is doing nothing for them.” So, Golding told everyone in the unit to request a test for Covid-19.“So you have Africans, you have Jamaicans, you have El Salvadorans — you have different groups,” Golding explains.​“What I did was say,​‘Hey, listen, you talk to your peoples, you tell them this.’ ”Many people were apprehensive about asking for a test, as guards had already placed the few who were presumed positive into solitary confinement, a fate considered by the United Nations to be torture. In solitary, detainees say they were locked in cells without air conditioning for around23hours a day. The average high temperature in July in Gadsden is91degrees. Nevertheless, by July4, everyone in the unit — more than80people — had put in requests for a Covid-19test, according to interviews with Golding and another immigrant detained by ICE, as well as the affidavits of nine detainees included in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus Golding filed on his own behalf in the Northern District of Alabama in September. Two days later, according to those11, Etowah County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Mike O’Bryant called a lockdown of the unit. O’Bryant then read the names of the10most vocal detainees calling for mass testing, including Golding. These10, O’Bryant said, were going to solitary. At the time of their transfer, none had tested positive for Covid-19. All11sources say they felt this was punishment and retaliation for requesting the coronavirus tests.“I noticed that all of us who were randomly picked were the ones who were vocal, outspoken and shown desire to be tested,” Stanley Walden wrote in an affidavit dated August7.“He handpicked cells and made an example, in front of everyone, that he really meant to throw anyone who get tested into a dungeon,” Sebastian Abalo Cunna wrote in an affidavit dated July28.​“It feels like punishment for standing up for our right to health and safety.”After locking down the unit, O’Bryant and other staff members went from cell to cell asking whether anyone still wanted a Covid-19test, according to Golding and the affidavits of nine others. Most declined and signed waivers saying as much. In a recorded conversation involving two Etowah employees obtained byandIn These Times, one employee described the events of July6as an attempt to​“bully” people into not getting tested. Afterward, both employees said in the recording, immigrants inside Etowah appeared too scared to seek even basic medical care. Four of those who went to solitary say they were unable to communicate with family for days. Some of their concerned family members called the facility. The relatives of one detainee say jail staff assured them that their family member was fine. At the time, he was in solitary confinement having developed symptoms of Covid-19. Golding’s mother says she was told there was no evidence of the virus at the facility, even as Covid-19at Etowah was listed on the ICE website. According to the family members interviewed for this story, neither ICE nor Etowah ever reached out to tell them their loved ones were sick. The Etowah County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to detailed questions fromandIn These Times about the jail’s Covid-19precautions, the detainees’ allegations of retaliation and whether detainees had authorized the release of their medical information to family members.“The health, safety, and welfare of those in our care remain a top priority and concern for the agency,” a spokesperson for ICE wrote in an emailed statement.​“Since the outbreak of Covid-19, ICE has taken extensive steps to safeguard all detainees, staff and contractors, including: reducing the number of detainees in custody by placing individuals on alternatives to detention programs, suspending social visitation, incorporating social distancing practices with staggered meals and recreation times, and through the use of cohorting and medical isolation.”ICE’s own guidance on how its detention centers shouldrespond to the Covid-19pandemicsays​“facilities must ensure that medical isolation is operationally distinct from administrative or disciplinary segregation, or any punitive form of housing.” And yet a previous investigation by found that a number of ICE detention centers have failed to adhere to this requirement. According to immigrants detained at Etowah, solitaryconfinementwas used not only as leverage to discourage requests for testing, but to isolate people with Covid-19.andIn These Timesspoke with five men who tested positive for Covid-19while detained at Etowah. Each says he spent weeks in solitary. Shemoi Edwards developed Covid-19symptoms just days before Golding. At first, Edwards hoped to quietly sweat out whatever illness he had picked up, but he soon hobbled over to an officer and said he felt like he’d been hit by a truck. With a history of bronchitis and a recent diagnosis of sickle-cell trait, Edwards was too scared to ride out the illness on his own. Not long afterward, Edwards says, he was transferred to solitary. The men universally describe conditions in the solitary confinement unit as squalid. In their affidavits, many expressed distress that they no longer had access to mental health professionals, the law library, sunlight or fresh air.​“Civil detention have turned into torture,” Falaye Kourouma wrote. Bakhodir Madjitov, who was deported in September, wrote that there were cockroaches and flies in the unit. Golding wrote that he was fed uncooked frozen food and didn’t have access to drinking water because the sink in his cell didn’t flow properly.“No one wants to be treated how I am currently being treated,” Dawa Sherpa wrote in his affidavit.​“I fear that I may die here at Etowah County Detention Center.”One man says he spent21days in isolation. Another counted35days, a third54. Edwards says he was put in isolation June29and released July28—29days. Golding says he was in solitary confinement from July6to August28—53days.“We was getting the same treatment as [when] you get in trouble,” Edwards says.​“Even though it’s probably a different word — it’s​‘isolation’ — it’s still a form of punishment that they’re putting us in.”Edwards received the results from his coronavirus test July8, after he had been in solitary for more than a week; he was infected. One day later, Golding received the same bad news. In isolation, the men say, their phone access was limited. They could make calls only during a brief daily free period (no more than75minutes), which occurred on an irregular schedule. Sometimes, they say, it popped up in the middle of the night. Before he got sick, Edwards would speak with his mother and brother — Nickoy Edwards, a police officer in Flint, Mich. — a few times each week. Nickoy, after not hearing from his brother the first week of July, decided to call Etowah. After finally getting someone to talk to him, Nickoy says,​“that person answered and told me that they looked in the computer and they told me,​‘Shemoi is OK. He’s on the floor. And nothing is wrong with him.’”Nickoy believed the facility — at first. Then, weeks later, his brother finally called, telling Nickoy he was in solitary confinement and had the coronavirus. Nickoy called Etowah again.​“And they told me the same thing:​‘He’s OK.’“I felt like they weren’t telling the truth,” Nickoy says.​“I was a little upset, you know, and concerned because, you know, I want him to be OK.”Their mother, Tyson Mills, also began to worry. When she was finally able to get through to Etowah, Mills explained who she was and asked about her son.​“Ma’am, he’s OK,” Mills says she was told.​“He’s alright. Nothing to worry about.” She says it was suggested her son didn’t have enough money on his commissary account to call.​“It wasn’t nice,” Mills says.​“I was like breaking down in tears.”Golding’s mother, Mervine Duhaney-Metzgar, says she called Etowah six times after not hearing from her son. At first, her calls were transferred around.​“And it happened that I called again, and they told me that everything is OK, and there’s no evidence of any illness being there. And I know that wasn’t true,” she says.​“It was very disturbing as a mother.”Nicholas Phillips, Edwards’s attorney, is not surprised by the lack of communication experienced by the families of these detained men.​“ICE is essentially kind of a closed book to us,” Phillips says.​“Etowah adds another level of complexity to it because Etowah is a county jail. And so it’s not really run by ICE. It’s run by the Etowah County sheriff’s department.”According to a2015agreement, Etowah is responsible for medical care inside the facility. But ICE’s36-page guidance on how detention facilities should handle the pandemic does not mention how (or whether) facilities should notify family members of immigrants who get sick. Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney at the Adelante Alabama Worker Center, has represented immigrants seeking release from Etowah because of medical conditions that put them at risk during the pandemic.​“Because the jail is a healthcare provider, HIPAA applies to them,” Vosburgh says of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.​“They have to respect patient privacy, which means not disclosing someone’s medical information without their consent.”“When I need to get someone’s medical records from Etowah, I need their signed consent and then [the jail] can share it with me. And I think it would work similarly for a family member,” Vosburgh says.​“I don’t think there’s anything in HIPAA that would require or allow people to lie or provide false information about someone’s health. That’s different than not disclosing, right? If there’s something they can’t disclose, they just have to say,​‘I can’t disclose.’ ”​“Even if someone is being imprisoned, they have the right to proper health, to proper medical attention,” Golding’s mother, Duhaney-Metzgar, says. Even before Golding got sick, she had put in a complaint to the office of her congressperson, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N. Y.), asking for an investigation into how her son had been treated in ICE custody and requesting that he be transferred to a facility closer to home.“My office has repeatedly reached out to follow up on the case for Mrs. Metzgar’s son Karim, and it has been months since their last reply,” Meeks says of ICE.​“ICE’s response time is simply unacceptable, especially now during a pandemic when it’s a matter of health and safety.”“I am so hurt deep down with what’s going on,” Duhaney-Metzgar says.​“Behind it, I strongly know that it’s an act of racism.”Phillips agrees. “[The Trump] administration, in my view, does not give a shit about detainees, immigration detainees,” he says.​“So how does it fit into the kind of larger discussion about racial justice and Black Lives Matter? I think it’s an integral aspect of that. I mean, immigration detention is, in many ways, simply an extension of the kind of mass incarceration crisis that America has gone through.”The criminal justice system and the immigration system are deeply entangled, with harsh consequences for Black immigrants in particular. One out of every five peoplefacing deportation because of a criminal conviction is Black. As of July2020, about half of the people detained by ICE at Etowah were Black, including Golding, Edwards and many of the other men interviewed for this story. Several are lawful permanent residents, but have lost their green cards and became​“deportable” after criminal convictions. Rather than accept deportation, many immigrants remain at Etowah for years as they fight their cases, often because they have nothing to go back to. Golding and Edwards were both born in Jamaica and came to the United States as children. Edwards, now30, arrived at15on a green card; most of his family now also lives in the United States. Golding, now36, arrived at9to reunite with his mother, who had fled an abusive relationship; he has never since been back to Jamaica. Before being incarcerated by ICE, Golding served a10-year sentence in federal prison. He and his family say they didn’t know there would be immigration consequences for his criminal conviction and that he has served his time.“I just want my son to get to come home,” Golding’s mother says.​“Every one of us has the right to be forgiven.”Edwards was just shy of hitting one month in isolation when his third Covid-19test came back positive. Medical staff at Etowah had informed everyone that they would need two consecutive negative tests to leave solitary and return to the general population — so when a guard later woke Edwards up and told him to pack his things, Edwards was confused.​“I thought I was going back to my original unit,” he says. But a sergeant appeared and told him he was being released.“And I’m like, OK!” Edwards says.​“So I just got to packing, you know, packed all my legal work, and I gave all my commissary away to everybody.”Phillips, Edwards’s attorney, had won a case just two weeks earlier (on July16,2020) on behalf of Jervis Glenroy Jack, a lawful permanent resident. The federal government had sought to deport Jack because of a conviction on unlawful gun possession in New York state. The judge Jack saw in the2ndU. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ruled the state-level gun conviction did not qualify as a deportable offense. Edwards’s case was nearly identical to Jack’s: Edwards, a longtime permanent resident, served two and a half years in prison on a similar conviction in New York. When Edwards was out on parole, immigration authorities took him into custody. Doing his own legal research, Edwards came across the Jack case in2019, then reached out to Phillips, who agreed to represent him. After Phillips won the Jack case, he assumed the reversal would also help Edwards — but no one from ICE contacted Phillips, until moments before Edwards was released. Outside the immigration jail, Edwards asked the ICE officer for his ID and a Greyhound bus ticket.​“I’m basically explaining to him, like, I’m from New York. How are you going to bring me all the way down here and then just tell me that you just gonna release me with no ID, no bus ticket, plane ticket, no nothing to get back to my family?” Edwards says.​“He was saying that because the way I won my case, he’s not entitled to give me anything.”But the ICE officer did give Edwards something — directions to a Greyhound bus station a mile away. After that, Edwards was on his own. It was87degrees as Edwards started his walk down a four-lane highway, schlepping a heavy black garbage bag full of legal paperwork. He had about $100and a dead cellphone on him. He stopped at the first gas station he saw to buy a mask; the one he had at release, he says, was weeks old and filthy. When Edwards finally made it to the bus station, he asked about the next trip to New York. Two days, the person at the counter said. And Flint? A week. His best bet would be to keep walking up to Walmart, where he could buy a phone or a charger. At Walmart, Edwards started making calls: to Phillips, to his brother and to Shut Down Etowah, an organization that helps immigrants after release from ICE custody.​“I basically explained my situation, and they said,​‘We’re gonna have somebody come and pick you up. Just stay at the Walmart.’ ”Shut Down Etowah booked Edwards on a flight to Detroit (out of Birmingham, Ala.) that same evening, and a volunteer accompanied Edwards to the airport. The airport was eerily empty, and Edwards was nervous, he says. He didn’t have any identification and worried he would be sent back to jail.“My main mindset was that I do not want to go through this in a different jail,” Edwards says.​“Even if it’s for two, three hours, or even a day. I do not want to do that.”The representative from Shut Down Etowah did most of the talking, pulling different legal documents out of Edwards’s bag to explain who he was. Somehow, he got on the plane.“I guess the [airport security] guy must have felt sorry for me,” Edwards says. Arriving in Michigan felt surreal to Edwards. Everyone he knew had grown up in the years he’d been away.​“They literally was babies when I left,” Edwards says. Edwards’s mom calls every day to hear his voice, but he hasn’t been able to see her. She lives in Massachusetts; Edwards still hasn’t been able to get a driver’s license. Edwards now works long hours at a factory and has decided to stay in Flint. He’s started working with Shut Down Etowah and speaks with college students and other groups about his experience in immigration detention and the criminal justice system. After almost a decade behind bars, he doesn’t believe anyone should be incarcerated, especially not for immigration violations.“You saying we incarcerate somebody for rehabilitation? I don’t see it. They don’t rehabilitate you. They just put you in there till your time up and be like,​‘Go.’ That’s it,” Edwards says.​“I don’t feel like we have the right to do that.”Edwards, Golding, and the other men interviewed for this story who contracted the virus while at Etowah say they’re experiencing possible long-term symptoms of Covid-19: trouble breathing, exhaustion, gastrointestinal problems, and more. While Edwards is at home with family, Golding remains alone and in custody.​“ICE detention has been far more degrading than any prison confinement I have experienced,” Golding said.​“As far as rights go, you basically have no rights.”The Intercept,which pro­vid­ed fact-check­ing by Meerabelle Jesuthasan.

367,First They Came for the NRA …,25.33,24.33,https://stream.org/first-they-came-for-the-nra/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,24,"ByJohn ZmirakPublished onAugust 6, 2020•Do you remember when state attorneys general learned about Planned Parenthood selling baby parts for profit, in violation of multiple laws? So a coordinated group of big-state AGs filed suit to dissolve the organization?Or that time when the FBI, learning of various mosques’ links to the terror-funding Muslim Brotherhood, sought to close those mosques?Or when the U. S. Attorney General responded to bishops shuffling pedophile priests by suing to dissolve the Catholic Church in America?No, of course not. Because such things never happened. Nor should they. It’s not normal for prosecutors to react that way. If the state finds legal irregularities on the part of a private organization’s leaders, its job is clear. It’s supposed to protect the organization’s members, just as the SEC protects stockholders from CEOs who steal from the company. Imagine that your Methodist or Southern Baptist pastor got accused of using your tithe money for trips to Nevada brothels. Would you expect your district attorney to try to dissolve your church? Is that a fair response?No, but he might try to do it, if your church opposed his politics. And if he had the legal ethics of a drug cartel’s in-house attorney. On a grand scale, that’s what happening now to the National Rifle Association. Using some (unproven) charges of sleazy insider dealing among a few NRA executives, the Attorneys General of New York State, and the District of Columbia are suing the NRA. They’re not seeking to remove its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre. Nor to force reforms. No, they’reseeking to dissolve the organization, nationally. Less than three months before a historic election. Does this sound like crass political gamesmanship with the rule of law to you? The NY AG won her last election in part on a promise to “take on” the NRA. And that gun rights organization is fighting hard to preserve our constitutional rights in 2020. As a keen observer on Twitter noted:This was published 15 minutes before Letitia James’ press conference.bwa. ha. ha. HA HA BWAAAHAHAHAAHAHAAA 😂🤣😂🤣😂😂— Eric Garland (@ericgarland)August 6, 2020So the NRA is using its money to defend its members’ rights. And Democrat prosecutors are trying to shut it down. The Democrats are nothing if not consistent in their worldview. They want to take away our right to defend ourselves. Yes, our guns, but not just our guns. They want to abuse the law to take away even our means to fight politically, in defense of God-given rights literally guaranteed by one of the Bill of Rights. They want to disarm us, silence us, prohibit us from associating freely. These people have problems with more amendments than the Second. And that’s no surprise. As Jason Jones and I showed in our in-depth, scholarly article, “God, Guns, & the Government,” these rights stand or fall together. Morally, because the Christian vision of the human person includes his right of self-defense. Practically, because without an armed citizenry, a nation’s people are always at the mercy of those in power, who wield a “monopoly of violence.” As I never tire of pointing out, the modern state used that monopoly tomurder 170 million civiliansin 90 years. Not just in “remote” places like the Gulag, but in cities like Paris, Brussels, Munich and Venice. What insane, God-mocking hubris would Americans have to indulge in to imagine that such things can’t happen here?Indeed, they’re already starting to happen here. The tragic explosion in Beirut seems likely the fault of Hezbollah, an extremist militia group that has allied with (and hijacked) mainstream political parties in Lebanon. Right here in the U. S., Antifa and Black Lives Matter are serving as the street-fighting wing of the Democratic party. They’re burning bibles in the streets, and terrorizing citizens. They’re even attacking homes. I want you to watch the video below. But please sit down first. It was taken by an onlooker whom Antifa didn’t catch recording its thuggish behavior. (The group habitually beats down such citizen journalists and steals their phones.) This isn’t footage from Lebanon or Afghanistan, but Seattle, Washington. An Antifa mob attacks the home of a political enemy, trying to blind her with lasers. After#antifawere dispersed by police following the attack on the East Precinct, they tried to blind a woman at her home with lasers and attacked her. Antifa have gone into residential parts of the city after moving on from attacking federal courthouse.pic.twitter.com/mKcrgHixmC— Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo)August 6, 2020Should any American citizen have to put up with such treatment? Shouldn’t any of us, inside our homes, have the means to defend himself against a gang of political thugs?At this point, some helpful soul in the Comments will chime in, “She was a Nazi!” And indeed, it appears that the misguided woman under assault here had taunted the (openly Communist) Antifa members by sporting a swastika. That’s crass, provocative and wrong. But not illegal, and certainly no reason for a political gang to appoint itself judge, jury and executioner. Would we approve of a gang in Miami that invaded the home of a Fidel Castro supporter? The difference of course: Castro’s dictatorship is still in place, killing and torturing. Since Antifa burns bibles — here emulating the Nazis — it clearly thinks faithful Christians are little better than fascists. Mobs have already torn down statues of Catholic saints, and vandalized churches nationwide. If America endorsed this reign of terror by voting for Zombie Biden and the secret committee which will actually govern instead of him, why wouldn’t they come for us next? I mean literally come for us, in churches and in our homes. If the Democrats have their way, we’ll be as helpless as lambs at the slaughter. The Democrats won’t denounce this kind of violence. In fact, they’re trying to strip you and me of any protection against it. They want to dissolve or disband the police, and confiscate our weapons of self-defense. Then who will have the monopoly of violence in America? Thugs like the ones in this video. As I observed earlier on Twitter:Antifa is preparing to become the American Hezbollah, and the Democrats are quietly cheering it on. Lebanon was once a lot like the U. S. Soon we might be a lot more like Lebanon. God bless Lebanon. God help us.— John Zmirak (@JZmirak)August 6, 2020Vote carefully, my friends.

368,Huge Oregon blaze grows as wildfires burn across western U.S.,0.0,48.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/us-wildfires/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"BLY, Oregon — The largest wildfire in the U. S. torched more dry forest landscape in Oregon on Sunday, one of dozens of major blazes burning across the West as critically dangerous fire weather loomed in the coming days. The destructive Bootleg Fire just north of the California border grew to more than 476 square miles (1,210 square kilometers), an area about the size of Los Angeles. Erratic winds fed the blaze, creating dangerous conditions for firefighters, said Sarah Gracey, a spokeswoman for the firefighting operation.“We’re still facing a lot of weather issues,” she said Sunday. “The winds have been … hampering our efforts most of the time.”Authorities expanded evacuations that now affect some 2,000 residents of a largely rural area of lakes and wildlife refuges. The blaze, which is 22% contained, has burned at least 67 homes and 100 outbuildings while threatening thousands more. At the other end of the state, a fire in the mountains of northeast Oregon grew to more than 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) by Saturday night. The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, remote communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. In California, a growing wildfire south of Lake Tahoe jumped a highway, prompting more evacuation orders and the cancellation of an extreme bike ride through the Sierra Nevada on Saturday. The Tamarack Fire, which was sparked by lightning on July 4, had charred nearly 29 square miles (74 square kilometers) of dry brush and timber as of Sunday morning. The blaze was threatening Markleeville, a small town close to the California-Nevada state line. It has destroyed at least two structures, authorities said. A notice posted on the 103-mile (165-kilometer) Death Ride’s website said several communities in the area had been evacuated and ordered all riders to clear the area. The fire left thousands of bikers and spectators stranded in the small town and racing to get out. Kelli Pennington and her family were camping near the town Friday so her husband could participate in his ninth ride when they were told to leave. They had been watching smoke develop over the course of the day, but were caught off guard by the fire’s quick spread.“It happened so fast,” Pennington said. “We left our tents, hammock and some foods, but we got most of our things, shoved our two kids in the car and left.”Meteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather with lightning possible through at least Monday in both California and southern Oregon.“With the very dry fuels, any thunderstorm has the potential to ignite new fire starts,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California, said on Twitter. Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have swept the region, making wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Firefighters said in July they were facing conditions more typical of late summer or fall. California’s Dixie Fire, near the 2018 site of the deadliest U. S. blaze in recent memory, was 15% contained and covered 39 square miles Sunday. The fire was in the Feather River Canyon, northeast of the town of Paradise, California, and survivors of that horrific fire that killed 85 people watched warily as the new blaze burned. Officials in Montana identified a firefighter who was seriously burned when flames overtook a crew fighting a small blaze there. Dan Steffensen was flown to a Salt Lake City hospital after the winds shifted suddenly on Friday, engulfing his fire engine near the Wyoming border. A second firefighter escaped without injury and called for help. There were about 70 active large fires and complexes of multiple blazes that have burned nearly 1,659 square miles (4,297 square kilometers) in the U. S., the National Interagency Fire Center said. The U. S. Forest Service said at least 16 major fires were burning in the Pacific Northwest alone.",3,Reliable,-0.0342807668521954,0.4520380333951762,868,3,Denver Post
369,Branson flight signals confidence in commercial spaceflight,0.0,41.0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/branson-flight-signals-confidence-in-commercial-spaceflight/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-11,25,"Virgin Galactic-founder Richard Branson and five company crewmates have made final preparations for abarnstorming ride to space Sunday, a bold show of confidence in his company's readiness to start carrying adventurous passengers on brief trips out of the atmosphere. Beating rival Jeff Bezos to space by nine days, Branson and company expect to zoom higher than 50 miles in Virgin's sleek spaceplane, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness and out-of-this-world views before gliding back to landing at Spaceport America near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. It will be the fourth piloted spaceflight for Virgin's VSS Unity spaceplane and its 22nd overall. But it will be the first with a crew of six on board and the first with Branson, a high-stakes demonstration of his long-standing commitment to launching wealthy space tourists, researchers and even astronauts into space on a for-profit basis. It also demonstrates the high-stakes nature of the competition to be first in the emerging space tourism marketplace with Virgin Galactic competing head to head with Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for space tourism dollars. After 15 unpiloted test flights, Bezos announced last month that he planned to fly aboard his company's New Shepard spacecraft July 20 when it takes off on its first piloted flight to sub-orbital space. A few days later, Branson upstaged the Amazon founder, announcing he planned to take off nine days earlier.""Yeah, there's a little bit of competition in the who's going first or when things are happening,"" Virgin President Mike Moses, a former space shuttle manager at NASA, told CBS News. ""But it's really not a race. It's not a competition. I know that sounds maybe a little shallow or disingenuous, but it's not.""It's a small community. I know dozens of people who work at Blue Origin, I know dozens and dozens of people at SpaceX, and we all used to work together at NASA. And I wish every single one of them the best. ... Because all of us together is what's going to get humans into space and our culture to recognize that space travel is the foundation for the future for everyone.""With typical Branson fanfare, Sunday's flight will bebroadcast liveacross Virgin Galactic's social media platforms, featuring appearances by Stephen Colbert and retired Canadian space station astronaut Chris Hadfield, along with the performance of a new song by singer-songwriter Khalid. Even SpaceX founder Elon Musk plans to be watching.""Will see you there to wish you the best,"" he tweeted Saturday. Will see you there to wish you the bestVSS Unity, mounted beneath the wing of Virgin's twin-fuselage carrier jet VMS Eve, is scheduled for takeoff from Spaceport America shortly after 10:30 a.m. ET, slightly later than originally planned due to overnight weather. Joining Branson will be company pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, both veterans of earlier test flights to space, along with company astronaut trainer Beth Moses, also a flight veteran and Mike Moses' wife; operations engineer Colin Bennett; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research.""This has been a long journey for him,"" Mike Moses said of Branson. ""He's like a kid in a candy store here in training this week. He's bouncing around, he's happy, excited. ... But that excitement is really infectious. And so the whole crew is feeling it.""Asked if the team felt any pressure because of Branson's presence on board, not to mention his wife's, Moses said he would not hesitate to call off the flight if the weather or a technical issue raises a safety concern.""I've scrubbed while Richard was watching before, and if I have to scrub while he's on board, we will,"" Moses said. ""It's a human flown, piloted aircraft. And so we take that safety very, very seriously. And we don't treat any one crew member as any more or less important than any other.""Assuming all goes well, VMS Eve will climb to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. At that point, after a final round of safety checks, carrier pilots Rick Sturckow and Kelly Latimer will release Unity to fly on its own. Seconds after dropping away, Mackay and Masucci will ignite Unity's hybrid rocket motor, kicking off a high-speed near-vertical climb out of the lower atmosphere, pushing the crew back in their seats with up to three times the normal force of gravity. During crew training, Mackay told Branson and his crewmates the spaceplane will propel them ""nice and smoothly to zero G.""""It feels wonderful, and you will want to get out of your seat automatically, I think, to unstrap yourself and experience this thing,"" he said in a company video shot during training. ""To me, it's all about the view, and it's absolutely amazing. It's spectacular.""After the rocket motor shuts down, the spaceplane will continue climbing on a ballistic trajectory, reaching a high point of more than 50 miles, the ""boundary"" of space recognized by NASA and the FAA, before arcing over and beginning the plunge back to Earth. Along the way, the four passengers will experience about three minutes of weightlessness, allowing them to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin behind the two pilots, taking in spectacular views of Earth and space through 12 windows. For re-entry, the spaceplane utilizes an innovation pioneered by legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan -- wing-like tailbooms that rotate upward with respect to the fuselage after the vehicle leaves the lower atmosphere. In the so-called ""feathered"" orientation, aerodynamic drag is sharply increased, causing the spacecraft to naturally orient itself like a badminton shuttlecock for a relatively low-speed, low-temperature re-entry with minimal piloting. Once back in the lower atmosphere, the tailbooms will rotate back parallel with the fuselage and the pilots will guide Unity to a landing on Spaceport America's 12,000-foot-long runway. If all goes well, Virgin is expected to carry out two more test flights before beginning commercial operations with paying customers on board. Ticket prices have not been announced, but a seat is expected to cost in the neighborhood of $250,000. More than 600 enthusiasts have reserved seats.""I think we're seeing the tip of the iceberg with the folks that have stepped forward already,"" Moses said. ""There's going to be a huge interest.""",3,Reliable,0.1534693645929601,0.4271832692900107,1429,3,CBS News

Since the start of the pandemic, music students have been using the garages as practice spaces. Northwestern students Selin Ozcelik and Blaine Dodson use a campus parking garage as practice space on July 5, 2021. Somewhere above an Evanston parking garage, the re’s the steadybzzzzzzof a drone. Below, on the basement level, a car rattles with every Bad Bunny bass blast. An old Jeep splashes through standing water and creaks its way into a space. The hollowthump-thumpof its doors. In bushes outside, birds squawkch-cH-CH. Construction trucks rumbleDAA-DAA-DAA-DAA. Joggersslap slaps lapon past. Until, after a few minutes of overture, at last, silence. The parking garage goes still. A moment later, the sound of trombone fills the space. Followed by tuba. Together, they reverberate, leisurely, deep, lumbering, like Godzilla emerging out of the nearby lake. Timothy Maines on tenor trumpet. Alec Rich on tuba. They stand beside their cars in the basement of the parking garage, their music carrying out of the structure, across the jogging trail circling the campus, across the sailing center, across an inlet of water, onto the beaches. Heads lift off blankets. Necks crane. Is thatbrass?A jogger stops outside the garage and crouches down to peek into the dim basement level. He spots the small horn section and yelps: “You sound great!”“Thanks!” shouts Maines. Rich puts his tuba down on the towel that he spread on the garage floor and swigs at his water bottle. Maines cradles his trombone and flips the sheet music on the stand before him. They play down here from time to time, sometimes solo, sometimes in duos or trios. You know, Rich says to Maines, nodding at the sheet music, the guy who wrote this, in the 1970s, he wrote music for a lot of porn films. “You would always see his name in the credits.”I’m sitting nearby on a curb and I can’t let this pass without comment. “Who watches the credits of old porn films?” I ask.“Tuba players,” Rich says.“OK, now a medium bounce?” Maines asks, eager to continue.“OK,” Rich says, and they begin again. A stone’s throw away, the imposing building for the Northwestern Bienen School of Music stands cold and jutting, like a glass-windowed cruise ship taking up too much space in a quaint harbor. It holds studios, practice rooms, concert halls. And yet, since the pandemic, for many of the music students here, the real place to practice has been outside, in the nearby parking garages on campus. The first time I heard music from a garage was just after lockdown, March 2020. I was walking in early morning and heard the moan of a bow on strings. It was coming from the South Garage. For much of last year, its gates were up. You could drive in and out freely, so I drove in and wound up, and up, and up, and somewhere around the third level, in the otherwise empty garage, I saw the source: a student on a stool beside her car, playing a cello. I continued upward, and on the next floor, a trumpet player. They were playing on different floors to avoiding stepping on each other’s to es. Once I heard them coming from the garages, it seemed I heard it every day. As weather got colder, their scales, flourishes, strings and sudden blasts of French horn came less frequently. And yet it also never quite ended. On and off, if you hit it right, practices continued, coming out of the parking garage beside the visitor’s center and the basement garage alongside the journalism school. It was far from unique, of course: Last year, across the country, as concert halls and indoor spaces closed, school choirs and garage bands and city symphonies met inside parking garages. (Not to mention, musicians have never needed a pandemic as an excuse to play outdoors.)Still, finding yourself an impromptu audience to an impromptu concert is a little like seeing a buck standing beside the road: It’s not remarkable, but you can’t help but slow down and admire. Here, indeed, is one of the lovelier byproducts of the pandemic. Even better, even as the health crisis in this country winds down, even with universities on break, garage practicing is a modest gift that keeps giving. Jemma Goddard, a Northwestern graduate student in music education, uses Northwestern garages to practice euphonium (a kind of cross between a French horn and a tuba). “Being a brass player, it’s fun to play in a space that covers up mistakes. I’m also someone who gets nervous performing and here I would have people walking up to me while I play. I’ve had people pull their cars up alongside me and just sit and listen a while. And the more I realized people were listening, the better I play. It seems like everyone practices in here. So many that when I first heard people playing here I was kind of intimidated because they sounded so good. But we had a teacher who encouraged us to go outside — to think of the person just walking their dog as your audience for that afternoon.”The weirdest thing about practicing in a garage, she said, is your show biz instincts still kick in. Just playing casually or practicing the same tune again and again, you become aware of how you present yourself. You find yourself hoping you don’t bore the joggers, dog walkers and construction workers. Selin Ozcelik, who recently finished a master’s program in musical education, still uses the garage to practice her French horn. She meets with friends there to jam. “When the pandemic started, you couldn’t get into anywhere (to practice). Big halls were booked. You had to share the practice rooms or couldn’t use a room that wasn’t designated your own. Ensembles were not allowed to meet. It got restrictive. But outside, in a garage, it was safer, there was the distance, there was air, and a lot of us just realized that the sound here w asway better than in university practice rooms, which can be dry.”Depending when you listen, the garage band selections are eclectic. “Fly Me To the Moon,” “Ride of the Valkyries,” William Tell Overture, Bruckner’s Symphony No. 4. Perhaps the Beatles. One early Sunday morning in June, I drove into the basement garage and found Maines playing from memory, running the same melody over and over, tweaking slightly each time. Sun came through the garage skylight and framed him in a natural spotlight. “The acoustics are great here,” he said. “The intonation alone is a perfect way to train yourself to hear yourself. You hear your feedback just after a sound is produced. You play a chord and know if it’s in tune. It’s also relaxing — just sort of beautiful.”Later this summer, he’s moving to Austin, Texas, to find work; at the moment, post-graduation, he pays rent through proceeds from the clicks on his YouTube channel (“Trombone Timo”), which has produced unlikely trombone-centered viral smashes. In the meantime, an Evanston apartment building is also not the ideal place to practice your trombone on Sunday morning. He’s tried playing on the local beaches, but it often means playing louder to hear yourself. That said, the basement garage level in particular has become so popular, he was once kicked out by a double bass player. Duets help. A week later, he’s alongside Rich, a current grad student at Northwestern. Their voices echo in the empty garage. “What are we playing?” Rich asks Maines, who points to the sheet music and scats out a roadmap: “Bum bum ba da da de tc ha tc ha …”Then Maines counts down and they blast off. A pair of skateboarders sail past, brothers Zach and Christophe Smith. Zach stops, kicks his board into his hand and listens a monument. “This music, it’s nice. You might say, it completes the ambience. It feels like Evanston should, like a crossroads of all sorts of walks of life. I play violin. I get it. Share the music. Share the talent. These guys down here, that’s freedom. You’re reminded music is not just a job when you see them here.” The Smiths leave and a gaggle of teenagers — shirtless, backpacks, fresh off the beach — stroll past, singing along loudly. BUM! BUM! BUM! BUM!“I like a good tuba,” one says blankly, like the comic relief in a John Hughes flick. Rich smiles weakly. Twenty minutes later, they wrap for the day. An older jogger was listening shouts: “Garage band!” It’s a dad joke. Maines and Rich laugh with the appropriate politeness, as if they haven’t heard it often, the n Rich turns to Maines and talks shop: “Sorry I’ve been giving you a workout on the lower ends.”“It’s all good,” Maines says. Rich loads his tuba into his Subaru and drives away, the n Maines climbs into his own car, and though windows are closed, his radio is loud in the now-silent garage: “Ride of the Valkyries,” bombastic, galloping and yet, unlike the live version they played a moment earlier, it doesn’t carry to the beach.cborrelli@chicagotribune.com",3,Reliable,0.142991457359044,0.4208608504228942,2377,3,Chicago Tribune

The most prevalent of the latter seems to be the idea that the Trumps don't really have the new coronavirus and the president's announcement is some sort of cynical election ploy. It would be a strange one, considering the negative toll that any perception of illness can have on a candidate.

Others call Trump's announcement a ploy to portray the president as strong and healthy when he shakes the disease. The timing seems off for such antics, however, as a lot of Americans arecasting their ballots.

372,The Faded Irony About UK Imperialism,-7.67,36.67,https://consortiumnews.com/2020/09/02/the-faded-irony-about-uk-imperialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2020-09-02,23,"came across this excellent heat map representation of a largeopinion pollon support for the monarchy, sampling 22,000 people all across the U. K., taken in 2018 by focaldata. Red tones indicate net disapproval of the monarchy and green tones indicate net approval. It is worth noting the quite astonishing, and detailed, degree of correlation with this heat map of the Brexit referendum. Annoyingly I cannot find the actual datasets for the focaldata survey. Among other things, that rather puts to bed the notion of a significant left-wing Brexit vote. Brexit voters are indeed mostly highly traditional British Nationalists who love the Queen. All of which underlines the obvious point that Scotland has a very different political culture to England. It also ought to cast some doubt on the triangulation methodology so favored by gradualists. I find that speaking to Scottish National Party (SNP) branches is no different from speaking to any other Yes group, in that abolition of the monarchy is overwhelmingly popular, and virtually nobody at meetings is a monarchist. I have never detected any generational difference in this. Scottish Republicanism tends to link in with views on much more radical land reform, which is so desperately needed. A campaign for a Scottish Republic would have majority support. Yet we are told that openly to advocate a Scottish Republic would alienate voters. No, it would not, most people would support, and you are not going to convert a great many diehard monarchists to independence anyway. I strongly suspect that this extends to other areas, particularly foreign policy. I simply do not believe there is a large well of support in Scotland for U. K. neo-con foreign policy, nor that it is necessary to support U. K. foreign policy to maximize support for independence. Neither Russia nor China is the enemy of the Scottish people. The problem is, that those with the finances to commission opinion polls have every interest in keeping support for such opinions hidden. I have always found the argument that people will only vote for independence if they think nothing will change rather amusing; if nothing will change, why vote for it?Anyway, while on the subject of British nationalism, I have a unifying solution to the culture wars question of singing “Land of Hope and Glory” and “Rule Britannia” atthe Proms. A Promenade concert in the Royal Albert Hall, 2004.(MykReeve, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons)“Rule Britannia” has no musical virtues and in my view should never be sung or played anywhere; it is a horrible bit of doggerel laced with ugly baroque frills. “Land of Hope and Glory” however is sung to a genuinely great piece of music. The answer is perhaps something like this:The truly wonderful Patrick Fyffe is no longer with us, but George Logan is and for £20 I’ll slip on a frock and do it myself. In childhood we always watched the Last Night of the Proms with my mother, and enjoyed it greatly. In those days there was no doubt at all that the patriotic singing was taken with a huge dose of irony. Britain had decolonized almost entirely in a remarkably swift quarter century, and there was a presumption the process would be completed. The state was properly social democratic; all utilities were in public ownership as were all the largest industries. All public provision really was provided by the state, not through profit making private agencies. You could not only go to university for nothing, you were paid to go. Post Suez Crisis, the idea the U. K. would ever invade anywhere else again seemed wildly improbable, and more importantly, nobody wanted to invade anywhere. There were still American dictated blights, like theChagos Islands, but very few were conscious of it. Public discourse was left wing. TV had A J P Taylor, not David Starkey, and Bertrand Russell popped up regularly. The BBC showed Ken Loach and the play “The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil.”In these circumstances, some singing of “Wider still and wider Shall thy bounds be set” seemed harmless, given that the exact opposite had plainly been in full train. The promenaders were determinedly silly. One year there was a large banner saying “Eat prunes they make you go,” which we children thought hilarious and became a joke in our house. HMS Cardiff anchored outside Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, at the end of hostilities in 1982.(Griffiths911, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons)I suppose that it was former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Falklands War that changed all that, and made British nationalism start to be sinister again, even though most of the promenaders themselves remained the same knowing skeptics. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair then took it to another level, with his promotion of “liberal interventionism,” the doctrine that bombing BAME people (black, Asian and minority ethnic) is good for them. That was and is a direct and unreconstructed revival of “liberal imperialism” of a kind that composer Edward Elgar would recognize and support. Suddenly the Last Night of the Proms went down another notch in the irony scale and up another notch on the jingoism scale, as Blair started to invade countries left, right and center. Now with Brexit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Nigel Faragethere seems to be a point of no return where British nationalism is too toxic to be adopted ironically. I am not sure the Last Night of the Proms will survive Scottish independence. Would they still mark the imperial nostalgia with the old butcher’s apron from imperial days? I think it is probably time, absent Patrick Fyffe, or me in a frock, to put this grand old lady to rest.

This result is a win for communities in the Global South who face devastating climate impacts now.”The first-of-its-kind ruling—which Shelltoldtheit expects to appeal—came from the district court in the Hague and is the result of legal actionbroughtby Friends of the Earth Netherlands, or Milieudefensie, along with over 17,000 individuals and six other organizations. The individual co-plaintiffs and groups—which included ActionAid, Both ENDS, Fossielvrij NL, Greenpeace Netherlands, Jongeren Milieu Actief, and the Waddenvereniging—demanded that Shell’s emissions reduction goals align with the Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit global heating to 1.5°C by 2100.“The court orders Royal Dutch Shell … to reduce its CO2 output and those of its suppliers and buyers by the end of 2030 by a net of 45% based on 2019 levels,” the court said,according to. “Royal Dutch Shell has to implement this decision at once.”Wow, Wow, Wow–Dutch court orders Shell to cut the absolute level of its carbon emissions almost in half by 2030. This could be game-changing is an unexpectedly massive victory for the claimants. Earth-shattering. I'm stunned.

The judge has left no room for doubt: Shell is causing dangerous climate change and must stop its destructive behavior now.”noted that the Netherlands is particularly threatened by the climate emergency because a third of the country is below sea level. The Dutch government, which has alsofacedclimate litigation demanding bolder commitments, has pledged to cut carbon emissions 49% over the next decade. Shell had previously pledged to cut CO2 emissions 30% by 2035 and 65% by 2050—but in February, the company announced new targets: 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035, and 100% by 2050, compared with 2016 levels. Pointing to the company’s investments in biofuels, electric-vehicle charging, and renewables, a Shell spokesperson told theon Wednesday that “we want to grow demand for these products and scale up our new energy businesses even more quickly.”It is genuinely hard to overstate quite how big a deal this ruling is for Shell, and the oil industry.

Coal, oil, and gas need to stay in the ground,” Palmen added. “People around the world are demanding climate justice. Today the court confirmed that the fossil fuel industry cannot continue their climate pollution. We can hold multinational corporations worldwide accountable for the climate crisis.”As Roger Cox, a lawyer for Milieudefensie, put it: “This is a turning point in history.”“This case is unique because it is the first time a judge has ordered a large polluting corporation to comply with the Paris climate agreement,” Cox explained. “This ruling may also have major consequences for other big polluters.”""I think the world looks a bit brighter today"" – lawyer Roger Cox on the verdict:pic.twitter.com/NUQRWhmZozPols concurred, saying that “this verdict is an enormous step forward for the international climate movement.”“One of the world’s biggest polluters has finally been held responsible,” he continued. “I am filled with hope for the future, as we know that the climate crisis does not wait and does not stop at our borders. That is why it is so important that the judge is now forcing Shell to take responsibility for its actions. This is also a clear signal to the other big polluters must stop wrecking the climate.”In the United States, Friends of the Earth’s Kate DeAngelispromisedthat “the day of reckoning is coming for U.

Thank “prestige hierarchy.”Four minutesfor. Five minutesforAline. Nine minutesforThe French Dispatch. The Cannes Film Festival, which concludes today, has long held an unusual reputation for its lengthy standing ovations. The tradition—which perhaps reached an apotheosis whenreceived 22 minutes of applause in 2006—has at times attractedmockery. Although standing ovations are common responses to great art, a prolonged ceremony can get awkward—just watch theOnce Upon a Time in Hollywoodteamgrimaceits way through seven minutes of clapping in 2019. Other times they turn performative: This year, Adam Driver lita cigaretteas the camera panned over to him duringAnnette’s five minutes of acclaim. The practice doesn’t merely infuse the Croisette, the scenic boulevard where Cannes takes place, with extra pomp and glamour. Audiences might genuinely share appreciation for a film. For the industry, the length of applause serves as a proxy for how potentially buzzy a title might be. And every year—butparticularly this one—the cheers are a reminder of the pleasures of slowing down and appreciating art. Yet, as in the world oftheater, the standing ovation can come to feel like an obligation. When such effusive displays greet every film, what is the audience truly expressing? Kellie Lail, a critic and Cannes attendee who caughtthe five-minute ovationfor, voiced a common criticism: “The fact that it is not such a given at other festivals makes me wonder if the standing ovations received in other places are more honest audience reactions.”When I spoke with Cristina Bicchieri, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies social norms, over the phone—for 15 minutes, the amount of time a Cannes audience applaudedin 2018—she told me the gesture can be traced to an ancientRomancelebration, “a sign of respect” for generals returning from campaigns. At a film festival, and at theold-fashionedCannes specifically, a similar reverence is at play. Read: A brief history of applause, the ‘big data’ of the ancient worldIn fact, Cannes’ remarkably long ovations offer excellent models for the way humans subconsciously influence one another. They illustrate how we initiate group actions, signal approval, and either reciprocate those signals or reject them. “It’s fun to kind of watch them as a sociological exercise,” Scott Page, a professor at the University of Michigan who has studied standing ovations as a model of social behavior, told me. During our chat—of 20 minutes, roughly the amount oftimea Cannes audience applaudedin2004—Page suggested that the audience inside a theater at the film festival is a microcosm of a social network. “There is a real asymmetry to who has influence,” he explained. At the head of the social hierarchy are the film’s cast and crew, who are likely to be high-profile names, seated in a position that is visible (perhapson-screen) to the rest of the audience. That audience is usually made up of movie buffs inclined to show respect, even if they found the film lacking. Because ovations typically begin at the front of the audience, those who could afford the best seats—perhaps friends of the film’s team, or the wealthiest attendees—prompt the rest of the audience to leap to their feet. Those with no such clout are helpless to follow. Even if they decide not to engage, they’re in no position to influence anyone else. The pageantry of Cannes, then, has a specific effect: Because it emphasizes the status difference among attendees, the audience members in the back rows are more likely to follow the crowd’s opinion. “If people are really secure in their own evaluations, then they’re not going to stand,” Page said. “But if you’re not sure, and you think the other people [around you] are smarter than you, then yougoing to stand … I imagine Cannes to be a place [where if I ask myself,] ‘How confident am I, sitting near movie stars and directors?’ The answer is ‘Not very.’”Nicholas Christakis, the director of the Human Nature Lab at Yale University, explained in our conversation—which lasted 12 minutes, about the amount of time a Cannes audience applaudedin 2011—that Cannes demonstrated “prestige hierarchy,” a distinctly human phenomenon in which we seek connection more than we seek survival. In a social setting such as a film festival, where auteurs and A-listers sit among the audience, attendees have the chance to imagine—or even make—a social connection with celebrities. “It’s about coming closer to animals that can confer a benefit,” he said. “This is an extreme illustration of our unavoidable desire to be social animals.” Anna Smith, the host of the podcastGirls on Film, who went to Cannes this year, told me: “If you’re standing near the cast and crew, and you loved the film, it can be exhilarating.”So if you find yourself facing a wall of apparently uninterruptible applause, how can you, well, interrupt it without ostracizing yourself and losing all social status? Cannes attendees told me it’s possible to stray from the tribe and stop clapping, or to slip away before the end of the screening. Often, though, the filmmakers have to take the mic and signal for the applause to end so they can deliver a speech. This, Bicchieri explained, is the best way for such lengthy plaudits to conclude anyway, because most audiences will take cues from the most important figures in the room. “They seek permission to stop, and then little by little you can have a bandwagon effect,” she said. It’s simply human to seek approval—even when it comes to methods of expressing approval. “The fact is,” Bicchieri said, “you don’t want to be the one who stops.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.1224569640062597,0.4690532081377153,1313,2,The Atlantic
375,Defense aerospace primes are raking in money for classified programs,2.83,45.5,https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2020/11/03/defense-aerospace-primes-are-raking-in-money-for-classified-programs/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-03,24,"WASHINGTON — Two months afterdisclosing the existence of a next-generation fighter jet demonstrator, the U. S. Air Force is staying mum on which company may have built it. But one thing is for sure: Classified aviation programs are on the rise, andopportunities aboundfor the three major American defense aerospace primes — Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing. During an Oct. 20 earnings call with investors, Lockheed Martin Chief Financial Officer Ken Possenriede revealed the company’s Aeronautics division recently won a classified contract that would necessitate the construction of a new building in Palmdale, California, where the company’s Skunk Works development arm tests and creates prototypes of secret aircraft. Sales for the division were up 8 percent in this year’s third quarter compared to the same period in 2019, with about $130 million of the $502 million boost attributed to classified work. But Possenriede alluded to even more growth on the horizon.“For Aeronautics, we do anticipate seeing strong, double-digit growth at our Skunk Works, our classified advanced development programs. We continue to execute on those recent awards,” he said, adding that there were a “multitude of opportunities” still out there. Classified work also increased at Northrop Grumman’s Aeronautics Systems unit, with “restricted activities” in the autonomous systems and manned aircraft portfolios helping bolster sales by 5 percent for the quarter and 4 percent year-to-date when compared to 2019, Chief Financial Officer Dave Keffer told investors Oct. 22. It’s tempting to draw a line from these contract awards to the recent flight of a demonstrator for the Next Generation Air Dominance program — the Air Force’s effortto field a suite of air superiority technologiesthat could include drones, high-tech weapons and what some have termed as a sixth-gen fighter, although service officials have said any warplane in the mixmight not resemble a traditional fighter. Even though the Air Force announced in September that at least one NGAD demonstrator exists, it’s unclear which companies are involved. Still, there are plenty of other longstanding and emerging Air Force requirements that could be the source of this classified work, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst for the Teal Group.“It’s pretty clear that there’s more prototyping activity going on out there than was generally known. I had assumed that most of the work related to NGAD was happening at the systems level. It’s clearly happening at the airframe level too,"" he said. ""And then of course there are a lot of potential drone developments that are certainly worth watching,” fromthe MQ-9 Reaper replacementto strategic reconnaissance requirements, “which is fundamentally a very expensive activity.”The wild card in this situation is Boeing. Because of investors' focuson the commercial side of the business— including plans for the return of the Boeing 737 Max to flight, as well as the continued downward spiral of sales caused by the global pandemic and its chilling effect on air travel — executives did not speak about Boeing Defense, Space and Security’s classified activities during the company’s Oct. 28 earnings call.“Overall, the defense and space market remains significant and relatively stable, and we continue to see solid global demand for our key programs,” a Boeing spokesman said in response to questions about the company’s classified business. “We project a $2.6 trillion market opportunity for defense and space during the next decade, which includes important classified work.”After years of lost competitions, there are signs that the company’s combat aircraft production facilities in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as its advanced projects division, Phantom Works, are returning to health. Over the past two years, the company has banked major awards, including theNavy’s MQ-25 tanker droneand theT-7A trainer jet, both of which were developed by Phantom Works. Boeing’s work on the T-7 received praise from Air Force acquisition executive Will Roper for its use of digital engineering, which involves simulating the design, production and life cycle of a product in order to drive down costs. The company has also started selling the advanced F-15EX fighter jet to the Air Force, breathing a second life into that aircraft with this latest variant. But Aboulafia worried that pressure on Boeing’s commercial business — combined with its strategy of leveraging the work of other aircraft makers on projects like the T-7, where Swedish manufacturer Saab had a heavy influence in shaping the design — may have led to a loss of resources and engineering talent at Phantom Works.“Either they’re sitting it out now because their focus is elsewhere, or they don’t have the capabilities and the commitment that the others do, or we’re just not hearing about it now,” he said. Boeing is not the only company investing in digital engineering and advanced manufacturing processes. Northrop CEO Kathy Warden pointed to her company’s use of digital engineering in the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program,which the company won in Septemberto build the Air Force’s next-generation intercontinental ballistic missiles.“The work that we have done with the customer already, even under the tech maturation and risk reduction phase of the program, was done in a digital environment,” she said. “We delivered artifacts for review in a fully digital environment where they were actually looking at things in a model, not documents produced. This is the first time on a program of this size where that’s been the case.”“Those investments that we’re making for GBSD are being utilized across our entire portfolio,” she added. “So as we think about Next Generation Air Dominance and the programs that are part of that overall campaign … they too will benefit from a full digital engineering thread as being required by our customers.”Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

Below the text, two electoral maps of the US show that a vote count update appeared to grant the former Vice President 138,339 votes and not a single one to his rival President Donald Trump. The tweet wasdeletedwith an apology, but the same maps were shared tens of thousands of times onTwitter,Instagram,Facebookand inan articlethat pointed to a discrepancy of 138,339 votes in Michigan. Most posts denounced the numbers as proof of fraud by Democrats in the Midwestern state. However, the maps actually show a 138,339 drop in Biden votes after a correction due to human error. Caroline Wilson, county clerk for the central Michigan county of Shiawassee, told AFP by phone, “I added an extra zero accidentally,” thereby reporting 153,710 votes for Biden instead of 15,371.“The minute it was discovered, it was corrected, probably within 20 minutes, so I’m amazed how fast this spread,” Wilson added. She said the state of Michigan alerted her office of the mistake “because we don’t even have that many voters.”The central Michigan county only has55,612 registered voters. When Biden’s 153,710 votes were lowered to 15,371 votes in a correction, 138,339 votes were removed from the Democrat’s total tally without any changes to Trump’s numbers.“The information contained in the graphic is entirely false,” Michigan Department of State spokeswoman Tracy Wimmer told AFP in an email about the map on Twitter. The image in the tweet showed two screenshots of the interactive vote results map from election data analystDecision Desk HQ(DDHQ). The two screenshots were taken at different times in the early hours of November 4. At 4:59 am, DDHQ reported results for Michigan that indicated 153,710 votes for Biden in Shiawassee county, promptingTwitteruser @ENGOLD to point out a mistake. DDHQacknowledgedthe mistake later on November 4, calling it a “clerical error” from the Shiawassee County data, and updated results on its website to reflect the changes, giving Trump a victory in the county with 23,154 votes. AFP Fact Check also found otherclaims of voter fraudthat turned out to be genuine mistakes, such as residents receiving mail-in ballots for deceased parents or previous tenants. With an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots cast, the presidential race remains too close to call.

Here in March, an EMT worker cleans a gurney after transporting a suspected COVID-19 patient. A New York City pilot program that dispatches mental health specialists and paramedics instead of police for certain nonviolent emergency calls has resulted in more people accepting assistance and fewer people sent to the hospital,early data shows. It's one ofa number of programs underway around the countrytrying to address police violence and systemic racismfollowing George Floyd's murderby providing alternatives to sending law enforcement to respond to emergency calls involving issues such as mental health or drug and alcohol crises. In June, New York City started its Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division, or B-HEARD, to provide more targeted care for those struggling with mental health issues and emergencies such as suicide attempts, substance misuse and serious mental illness. During the first month of the pilot program, B-HEARD teams — consisting of fire department paramedics and social workers — responded to calls in northern Manhattan, which includes parts of Harlem and receives the city's highest number of mental health emergency calls. From June 6 to July 7, B-HEARD received roughly 16 mental health calls each day in this zone. In 95% of cases, people accepted care from the B-HEARD team, data from the city shows. That's compared with 82% for traditional 911 response teams, which include police. Additionally, 50% of people treated by B-HEARD were transported to the hospital for more care, a far lower number than the 82% who are transported to the hospital with traditional 911 response. The city said that 911 operators routed 138 mental health emergency calls — 25% of the number of calls during the pilot period — to B-HEARD and expect that number to grow to 50% in the coming months.""This is great news. A smarter approach to public health and public safety. A smarter use of resources. And the evidence — from Denver to New York — shows that responding with care works,"" U. S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N. Y.,tweeted. New York's program is modeled after a successful, decades-old program in Eugene, Ore., known as Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets, orCAHOOTS. Other similar programs have launched in California, Colorado, Georgia and Montana. In Minneapolis, where police killed Floyd last summer, the city will start sending outcivil crisis response teamsinstead of police to certain mental health calls next month. Mental health-related calls accounted for22% of casesin which on-duty police used lethal force and killed someone, according to data from 2009 to 2012 from 17 states where data was available.",3,Reliable,0.1019858048927816,0.3804011879593274,680,3,NPR

Three trays of mail werefound in a ditchin Greenville last week, and the Outagamie County Sheriff's Office said at the time it included several absentee ballots. Meagan Wolfe, director of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said during a virtual news conference Thursday that no Wisconsin absentee ballots were found. She said she did not know if there were ballots from other states.""There was mail found outside of Appleton and that mail did not include any Wisconsin ballots,"" Wolfe said. When news broke about mail in a ditch, the White Houseseized on the situationto rail against mail voting as ""a system that’s subject to fraud.""""In fact, in the last 24 hours, police in Greenville, Wisconsin, found mail in a ditch, and it included absentee ballots,"" said Kayleigh McEnany, President Donald Trump's press secretary. In Tuesday's debate with Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trumpcontended ballots had been found in creeks, in what may have been a reference to Wisconsin. The Republican president has repeatedly raised doubts about mail voting, but election experts have said the mail provides a safe and reliable way to cast ballots. The U. S. Postal Service has said it is investigating what happened in Greenville. The Postal Service has been under fire in recent weeks for mail slowdowns ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential race. Absentee voting in Wisconsin is expected to hit a record this fall because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 1.2 million Wisconsin voters have requested absentee ballots so far. Wolfe said Wisconsin election officials have ways to track down ballots when they go missing but emphasized the importance of returning absentee ballots as soon as possible. It's easier to fix problems that might arise when clerks have more time to respond to them, she said. Also Thursday, Wolfe said Wisconsin's ban on ""electioneering"" at polling sites applies to campaigning for candidates and issues. It doesn't apply to general pushes to encourage people to vote, she said. The issue has surfaced because the state Republican Party has warned Milwaukee officials that it believes athletes, the Bucks mascot Bango and the Brewers' Racing Sausagescannot be present at Fiserv Forum and Miller Parkwhen they are used as voting sites. The presence of athletes and mascots would amount to a form of electioneering because it would encourage people to come out to vote, argued the party's chairman, Andrew Hitt.

The group did not have a permit to protest, leading to police warnings that “enforcement actions may be taken for crimes committed.”Videos from the scene showed the Proud Boys clashing with riot police when members of the hate group refused to step back and disassemble. One video from the scene showed a protester dressed in clothes emblazoned with the Proud Boys logo being arrested while another showed Proud Boys members being shot at with non-lethal munition and flash bangs.“I’m fucking moving,” one protester said. “You don’t have to shoot me, you c***sucker.”Police push into the Proud Boys as they try to move their group away from Antifa, firing off pepper balls after they challenged the move#Salem#Oregon#ProudBoys#Antifapic.twitter.com/0JcrpUoxGT— Brendan Gutenschwager (@BGOnTheScene)January 2, 2021The subsequent arrests led to chants of “fuck the blue,” which is a significant pivot away from the Proud Boys’ longstanding support for law enforcement, whom they viewed as allies in their ongoing battle against anti-fascist activists.

One post claimed that police officers in Ireland were racist while another video claimed to show police officers in Gatineau Quebec forcing entry into a home that was breaking mandatory lockdown regulations. Each post ended with the words “f*** the blue.”The Proud Boys were also trending on Twitter this past weekend as people posted videos of the Salem, Oregon melee and mocked the far-right male-only group for its change of heart regarding the police.“Cops being aggressive with the Proud Boys might be my new kink, just sayin,”wroteop-ed Guardian columnist Holly Figueroa O’Reilly",3,Reliable,0.1584971334971334,0.5234438984438985,616,1,Right Wing Watch
380,'Truth embargo': UFOs are suddenly all the talk in Washington,-3.0,44.67,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/truth-embargo-ufos-are-suddenly-all-talk-washington-n1270560,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-13,25,"WASHINGTON —Stephen BassettandMick Westdon’t agree on much. Bassett has devoted much of his adult life to provingUFOsare helmed by aliens, and West has devoted much of his to proving they are not. But they both agree on one thing: It’s good that, after nearly 75 years of taboo and ridicule going back toRoswell, New Mexico, serious people are finallytalking seriouslyabout the unidentified flying objects people see in the skies.“If you look at the level of public interest, then I think it becomes important to actually look into these things,” said West, a former video game programmer turned UFO debunker. “Right now, there is a lot of suspicion that the government is hiding evidence of UFOs, which is quite understandable because there's this wall of secrecy. It leads to suspicion and distrust of the government, which, as we’ve seen, can be quite dangerous.”Later this month, the Pentagon is expected todeliver a report to Congressfrom a task force it established last year to collect information about what officials now call ""unexplained aerial phenomena,"" or UAPs, from across the government after pilots came forward with captivating videos that appear to show objects moving in ways that defy known laws of physics. While those who dabble in the unknowns of outer space are hoping for alien evidence, many others in government hope the report will settle whether the objects might be spy operations from neighbors on Earth, like the Chinese or Russians. The highly anticipated report is expected to settle little, finding no evidence of extraterrestrial activity while not ruling it out either,according to officials, but it will jumpstart a long-suppressed conversation and open new possibilities for research and discovery and perhaps defense contracts.“If you step back and look at the larger context of how we've learned stuff about the larger nature of reality, some of it does come from studying things that might seem ridiculous or unbelievable,” Caleb Scharf, an astronomer who runs the Astrobiology Center at Columbia University. Suddenly,senatorsandscientists, thePentagonandpresidents, former CIA directors and NASA officials,Wall Street executivesandSilicon Valley investorsare starting to talk openly about an issue that would previously be discussed only in whispers, if at all.“What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are,""former President Barack Obama told late-night TV host James Corden. The omertà has been broken thanks to a new generation of more professional activists with more compelling evidence, a few key allies in government and the lack of compelling national security justification for maintaining the official silence, which has failed to tamp down interest in UFOs. In a deeply polarized country whereconspiracytheorieshaverippedapartAmerican politics, belief in a UFO coverup seems relatively quaint and apolitical. Interest in UFOs waxes and wanes in American culture, but millions have questions and about one-third of Americans think we have been visited by alien spacecraft, according toGallup. But those questions have been met with silence or laughter from authorities and the academy, leaving a vacuum that has been filled by conspiracy theorists, hoaxsters and amateur investigators. West, the skeptic, thinks the recent videos that kicked off the latest UFO craze, including three published by the New York Times and CBS’ “60 Minutes,” can be explained by optical camera effects. But he would like to see the U. S. government thoroughly investigate and explain UFOs. The government has examined UFOs in the past but often in secret or narrow ways, and the current Pentagon task force is thought to be relatively limited in its mission and resources. West pointed to models from other countries likeArgentina, where an official government agency investigates sightings and publishes its findings, the overwhelming majority of which are traced to unusual weather, human objects like planes or optical effects.“This is something that we could do here,” West said. “But right now we're left with people like me, who are just enthusiasts.”John Podesta, a Democratic poobah who has held top jobs in several White Houses, has called on President Joe Biden’s White House to establish a new dedicated office in the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, which would help get the issue out of the shadows of the military and intelligence community. Podesta, who has harbored an interest in UFOs since at least his days as Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, recentlytold Politico, “It was kind of career-ending to basically talk about this subject. That has clearly switched, and that's a good thing.”Believers are unsurprisingly thrilled by the culture shift.“The ‘truth embargo’ is coming to an end now,” said Bassett, the executive director of Paradigm Research Group and the only registered lobbyist in Washington dedicated to UFO disclosure. “I am elated to finally see this movement achieving its moment.”Bassett is convinced the government is covering up proof of extraterrestrial life and that everything happening now is elaborate political theater to make that information public in the least disruptive way possible — a view, of course, not supported by evidence or most experts.“This is the most profound event in human history that's about to be taking place,” he said. But you don’t have to be a believer to believe that poorly understood things should be investigated, not ignored.""We don't know if it's extraterrestrial. We don't know if it's an enemy. We don't know if it's an optical phenomenon,"" said new NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, a former astronaut and Florida senator, in a recentCNN interview. “And so the bottom line is, we want to know.""Two former CIA directors —John Brennan, who served under Obama, andJames Woolsey, who served under Clinton — recently said in separate podcast interviews that they’ve seen evidence of aerial phenomena they can’t explain. John Ratcliffe, who was the director of national intelligence under then-President Donald Trump, told Fox News in March there were “a lot more sightings than have been made public.”Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, pushed the government to conduct the UFO report. For him, it’s a question of national security and understanding whether rivals like China or Russia have developed advanced technology we don’t know about.“I want us to take it seriously and have a process to take it seriously,”Rubio told “60 Minutes.”For others, like Ravi Kopparapu, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, and Jacob Haqq-Misra, a research scientist with the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, it’s about discovery.""For too long, the scientific study of unidentified flying objects and aerial phenomena — UFOs and UAPs, in the shorthand — has been taboo,"" they wrote in aWashington Post op-ed. ""If we want to understand what UAP are, then we need to engage the mainstream scientific community in a concerted effort to study them.""Scharf looks for life on other planets and is a bit tired of people asking him if alien life has visited us on ours, but he said looking more at the skies could yield information about how our own world works.“Stuff like this has a scientific interest not because we're necessarily thinking we're going to find aliens, but maybe there's an unknown phenomenon or a collection of phenomena that are giving rise to some of these sightings,” he said. “There's never been a systematic effort to categorize and catalog stuff that people see, and from the past, we know that some of this stuff sometimes turns out to be interesting.”The history of science is filled with accidental discoveries and incidents where the hubris of religious or scientific authorities dismissed something as ridiculous that later proved true. Scientists didn’t believe meteoritesreally came from space until the early 1800s, for instance. Government secrecy can lead to confusion and misunderstanding that might be cleared up with the help of a wider circle of experts and investigators. Sweden spent years futilely chasing what it thought were Russian submarines off its coast. But when the navy let civilian researchers listen to a recording of the alleged submarine, they figured out it was actually the sound ofschools of fish farting. Important people have had an interest in UFOs for a long time; they just didn’t really talk about it. Former President Jimmy Carter claimed to have seen a UFO while he was governor of Georgia and evenfiled two formal reportsof his observations. Former President Ronald Reagan allegedly told people he saw one too while riding in a small plane, according to the pilot, who wasquoted in a bookby John Alexander, the former Army colonel whose paranormal investigations were featured in the book and movie “The Men Who Stare at Goats.”As the Cold War intensified in the 1950s, U. S. officials worried the Soviet Union would use a UFO hoax to drum up fear in the American public. Civilians started seeing what they believed were UFOs but were actually secret spy planes, like the U-2, so the government settled on apolicy of silence and denial.''Over half of all U. F. O. reports from the late 1950s through the 1960s were accounted for by manned reconnaissance flights,” according to a secret CIA study that was declassified in the late 1990s,The New York Times reportedthen. ''This led the Air Force to make misleading and deceptive statements to the public in order to allay public fears and to protect an extraordinarily sensitive national security project.''The very real government stonewalling fed bogus conspiracy theories, which came to dominate the study of UFOs and made the topic even more off-putting to serious scholars. In recent years, though, a newer generation of activists has been at center of recent high-profile disclosures thanks to a more professional, careful and credible approach. They include people with serious national security credentials like Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, and Luis Elizondo, the former Army counterintelligence special agent who led an earlier Pentagon team to investigate UFOs. The budget for Elizondo’s team — a modest $22 million in the scheme of defense spending — was secured by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, a powerful ally who has helped drive the resurgence of interest in UFOs. The newer activists have worked with mainstream news outlets to deliver evidence and eye witnesses that meet their high editorial standards and are careful when speaking to general audiences to avoid talking about aliens — though Mellon and Elizondo have appeared on controversial podcaster Joe Rogan’s show as well as ""Coast to Coast A.

381,Franklin Graham asks Christians to pray for peace during inauguration,0.0,45.67,https://www.christianpost.com/us/franklin-graham-asks-christians-to-pray-for-peace-at-inauguration.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-christian-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,17,"Franklin Graham, president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, has urged Christians to pray for “peace and calm” during the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday.“Today as our country inaugurates a new president, there are concerns that there could be violence in Washington, DC, and in state capitals across the nation. I encourage Christians to make this a day of prayer—for peace and calm, and praying for our new leaders, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris,” Graham, who also leads Samaritan’s Purse, said in a statement on Facebook. Graham’s call for calm comes in the wake of theJan. 6 attackon the Capitol building by pro-Trump supporters and others in Washington, D. C., that left five people dead. The protesters sought to prevent the confirmation of Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election by Congress. CitingGraham's previous remarksin support of Trump's argument that the election was stolen, progressive Christian group Faithful America launched apetitionlast Friday, accusing Graham of sedition and calling on directors of Samaritan's Purse and BGEA to fire him.“As long as Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association stand by Franklin Graham, it must be said that these once-vaunted organizations have forgotten their original Christian missions, abandoned the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and are complicit in the spread of dishonest, discredited election conspiracy theories and the deadly, unpatriotic, white-nationalist terrorism at the U. S. Capitol incited by those lies,” said a message, which Faithful America said was sent to board members of the two Christian organizations led by Graham.“Our faith in Jesus Christ demands that we do better than this. Your fellow Christians from across the country call on you to fire Franklin Graham, or to resign from the Board in individual protest.”The petition has garnered more than 20,000 signatures as of Wednesday morning. Faithful America, which was founded in 2004, describes itself as “the largest online community of Christians putting faith into action for social justice.”“Our members are sick of sitting by quietly while Jesus' message of good news is hijacked by the religious right to serve a hateful political agenda. We're organizing the faithful to challenge such extremism and renew the church's prophetic role in building a more free and just society,” the groupexplains on its website. The group is led by Rev. Nathan Empsall, an Episcopal priest and veteran digital organizer, and has organized numerous petitions, including ones against former President Donald Trump, World Vision and Family Research Council. Trump left the White House for the last time Wednesday morning to make way for the Biden administration.“You are amazing people. This is a great, great country. It is my greatest honor and privilege to have been your president,” Trumptold his supporters. He further wished the incoming administration ""great luck,"" before ending: ""Have a good life, we will see you soon.""",3,Reliable,0.1775772676935468,0.4101228229135206,662,2,The Christian Post
382,New York Regulations Allow Cops Stripped of Training Credentials to Be Rehired,-5.0,41.0,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/08/new-york-police-decertification/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,25,"Dominic Caprario layhandcuffed on the asphalt as the punches came down. The first officer hit him repeatedly in the back of the head, Caprario recalled, leading him to shield his face against the rubber tire of the squad car. A second officer walked over and stomped Caprario’s face with the heel of a steel-toed Timberland boot. According to interviews with Caprario, along with medical records and documents from a subsequent civil rights lawsuit, the 2011 incident began when two Staten Island police officers pulled Caprario from his double-parked car and accused him of buying drugs. It was Officer Anthony J. Egan who initiated the violence, Caprario recalled, attempting to shut the trunk on Caprario’s fingers, throwing him against the hood of his car, and punching the 24-year-old as he lay restrained. “Egan went nuts,” Caprario said. Egan denied the allegations in court and did not respond to requests for comment. Across a 10-year career at the New York Police Department, Egan cost New York City over $437,000 in seven separate civil rights lawsuits, including the one filed by Caprario, accusing the officer of excessive force, false arrests, and false testimony. In 2018, Egan was decertified under a New York regulation designed to strip police training credentials from officers who have been fired for cause or resign while under a disciplinary investigation. But within months, Egan was working again — first for a high-end private security company and then for the City University of New York’s Hunter College, where he worked as a campus peace officer authorized to make arrests. Today, he is employed as a correctional officer at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal jail in Brooklyn. Documents obtained by The Intercept and New York Focus under New York’s Freedom of Information Law show that Egan is one of 27 former law enforcement officers to be decertified by state regulators and then rehired by another police department or public safety agency. In some instances, new employers were unaware that the officer they were hiring had previously been decertified. These rehires point to the lack of oversight of so-called wandering officers and the limitations of the current decertification system in New York.“It fits into a broader pattern that we’ve seen in police getting away with misconduct,” saidMichael Sisitzky, who leads the New York Civil Liberties Union police accountability campaign. “The fact that they may not have violated any laws or rules by going through this process is another example of police departments not taking rules violations by officers on the job — that led to the loss of their jobs and loss of certification — all that seriously.”In 2016, two years after the police killing of Eric Garner, administrators at New York’s Division of Criminal Justice Services enacted regulations to revoke the training certificates of problematic police officers. Under the regulation, officers who are fired for cause by police departments or resign during disciplinary processes must be reported to the DCJS, which theninvalidatesthose officers’ training certificates. But the law does not prevent decertified officers from being rehired; officers can undergo retraining by new employers and become recertified to resume police work. Because New York does not decertify officers permanently, and because regulators don’t track police decertifications as closely or transparently as they do for doctors or lawyers, experts call the state’s current system a half-measure.“It’s better than nothing. But it’s still inadequate,” said Roger Goldman, a professor emeritus at Saint Louis University School of Law and a leading expert on police licensing. Forty-five other states have adopted statutes that allow officers to be decertified. Many of those statutes are far stricter than New York’s, Goldman said, and make it more difficult for an officer with a problematic record to be rehired. In Arizona and Connecticut, for example, regulators publish the names and offenses of decertified officers publicly. In Kansas, officers are required to petition a state board to be reinstated, allowing regulators rather than police departments to decide whether a cop returns to work. In Oregon, police decertifications are final. But in New York, DCJS regulators function largely as record keepers. They cannot investigate or fire officers themselves; instead, they decertify officers whose names police departments give them, leaving most regulatory responsibilities in the hands of local police chiefs. Police chiefs can set their own thresholds for what constitutes a fireable offense and rehire officers fired for misconduct if the officer retrains. NYPD officers stand guard as protesters gather in front of the 120th Precinct on the sixth anniversary of Eric Garner’s death in Staten Island, New York, on July 17, 2020. In January 2018, the NYPD fired James D. Secreto, a 22-year veteran lieutenant who failed to answer questions after being accused of stealing from the 9th Precinct in Lower Manhattan. Secreto had a disciplinary history, including a record of making false entries as well as fighting with a fellow officer, according toNYPD trial documents. Secreto was decertified. But shortly afterward, he retrained as an officer for the Saugerties Police Department in upstate New York. He then moved to the nearby Ellenville Village Police Department. In an interview, the Ellenville police chief, Philip Mattracion, said he hadn’t seen Secreto’s disciplinary trial documents before hiring him. Mattracion said he thought Secreto had retired from the NYPD and had hired him based on “sterling” recommendations from a police chief at Saugerties.“It’s a shame they don’t make that kind of stuff public,” Mattracion said, referring to internal NYPD disciplinary documents. “It’s a whole other world down there, they don’t cooperate with you.”In April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law policing reforms tucked into the state’s 2021-2022 budget that will confer investigatory powers to the DCJS, allow for permanent certificate revocations, and mandate that police chiefs report disciplinary investigations up the chain. In a statement, a spokesperson for the DCJS said that the new laws provide clearer guidelines than New York’s original regulatory process, which “relied solely on local decisions.”The reforms will come into effect in October. But they still leave wiggle room for officers looking to get rehired. They do not ban recertification, and they do not shed light on the decertification process by requiring the release of officers’ names and transgressions. In June, after completing The Intercept and New York Focus’s FOIL request, DCJS quietly published a copy of the same document on itswebsite, which includes the names of decertified officers but not the reasons for their decertification. Some say Cuomo’s legislation is far from enough.“There is nothing in here that compels any police chief or any agency to permanently decertify an officer,” said Sisitzky, the NYCLU lawyer. “There’s a lot of permissive language.”State Sen. Brian Benjamin, whose district includes Harlem, East Harlem, and the Upper West Side, also criticized the reforms. “It doesn’t make decertifications a requirement, it makes them a possibility,” Benjamin told The Intercept and New York Focus. “That to me is not acceptable.”Benjamin recently introduced his own police oversight bill, theWandering Officers Act, which would make it illegal for police departments to hire officers who were fired for cause or resigned while under investigation. The bill is carried in the state Assembly by Member Phil Ramos, a former police officer. The legislation did not make it to a vote in this year’s session. Egan, the NYPD officer who allegedly assaulted Caprario on Staten Island, resigned under investigation, triggering the revocation of his training certificate. But just a month later, he was licensed as a security guard by New York’s Division of Licensing Services, which certifies the nearly 170,000 private security workers in the state. A spokesperson for the Department of State, which oversees licensing, said former police officers require a letter of good standing from a prior employer as well as a criminal background check to become licensed guards. The spokesperson, Mercedes Padilla, declined to say whether the department considered misconduct records but said the licensing division’s role was to provide jobs rather than to regulate the private security industry. “We call it the department of opportunity,” Padilla said. The U. S. Bureau of Prisons, which runs the Metropolitan Detention Center, where Egan now works, told The Intercept and New York Focus that it conducts background investigations into all new staff hires. The bureau would not comment on Egan’s case beyond confirming his employment. The Intercept and New York Focus have not found evidence of recertified officers committing wrongdoing at their new jobs. But in 2020, astudyof thousands of Florida police officers found that officers who were fired for misconduct or resigned while under investigation were three times more likely to be fired for misconduct at their next job within three years. Roughly 3 percent of Florida’s working police force were wandering cops, the study found.“Those officers in Florida had not been decertified, they’ve been terminated, which is different,” Goldman said. “But it points to what my work has illustrated over the past, which is that these officers who are decertified and resurface again are more likely to reoffend.”Since 2016, the DCJS has decertified over 1,000 police officers, correctional officers, and security guards. But these decertificationsoccuronly when an officer is fired or quits, allowing officers with patterns of misconduct to evade state regulators. New York has an unusually high standard for decertifications, Goldman said. “What you really need in New York is what most other states have, which is [to] decertify not just because you’ve been fired for cause, but because you’ve committed serious misconduct.”The Intercept and New York Focus identified 21 former NYPD officers who moved to new police, public safety, or private security positions after being accused of wrongdoing substantiated by New York City’s Civilian Complaint Review Board, and 50 more who moved to new positions after being named in lawsuits alleging excessive use of force, false testimony, or false arrest. Forty-eight moved to other police departments, 16 to public security roles, and seven to private security. To conduct the analysis, The Intercept and New York Focus reviewed data on CCRB complaints substantiated by investigators, as well as adatabaseof more than 1,000 federal civil rights lawsuits filed against NYPD officers between 2015 and 2018, which was compiled by the Legal Aid Society. These lists were compared with state and city payroll data and other public records. The New York State Police has hired at least six former NYPD officers accused of misconduct, including Richard Caster, one of the officers named in the $4 million settlement for Thabo Sefolosha, an NBA player who wasassaulted and injuredby NYPD officers outside a Manhattan nightclub in 2015. In a statement, a State Police spokesperson described the agency’s hiring process as one of the most selective and thorough in the country. But the department said it has only recently begun to review CCRB records and internal NYPD disciplinary records, which were made partially public in March. The New York City Administration for Children’s Services has hired at least 10 former NYPD officers accused of misconduct to investigate sensitive cases of child abuse. An ACS spokesperson declined to say whether the agency considered misconduct records when hiring former NYPD officers. The agency does send a verification form to the NYPD, the spokesperson said, on which the “NYPD will report whether a candidate was disciplined during their employment.”In 2018, ACS briefly employed Dwayne Chandler, a former NYPD officer with two substantiated CCRB complaints, including a 2003 incident in which Chandler pistol-whipped a suspect on the back of the head. Chandler was also one of two NYPD officers whose stray bullet firekilleda Yemeni deli worker in 1994. Police supervisors deemed the shooting justified, according to a report by the Daily News. In the summer of 2020, Chandler, now a licensed security guard, was arrested on assault charges for firing a pistol into the back of a fellow diner during a restaurant brawl in Howard Beach. His case is still pending. The ACS also hired Dennis Carmody, a former officer who was suspended by the NYPD in 1987 forpulling his gunon a doctor at Harlem Hospital who had been objecting to Carmody’s treatment of a concussed suspect. Carmody was hired at the ACS in 2018 and works there today, according to payroll records. Private employers also face difficulty backgrounding former NYPD officers. The private security companyG4Ssaid they get little information about job candidates when they check with the NYPD. “They don’t give us very much,” a company representative said. The company has hired at least two former NYPD officers with substantiated misconduct records, including one Brooklyn cop named in over 100 civilian complaint allegations in the 1980s and 1990s, two of which were substantiated by investigators. A G4S representative attributed the high number of civilian complaints about the officer to an era in which Brooklyn “was fraught with murders, homicides, robberies, and drugs.”Jennvine Wong, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society’sCop Accountability Project, said she was not surprised that officers accused of misconduct could move into private security industries.“These are mostly industries that are going to be highly deferential to the police,” she said. “How much credit are they going to give to something that they’ve just viewed as part of the job?”Over a five-year period, the Nassau County Police Department hired 17 former NYPD officers who were the subject of substantiated CCRB complaints or named as defendants in federal civil rights lawsuits. Among them was Matthew Castellano, a Staten Island NYPD officer who joined the force in 2011. In 2015, Castellano was one of two officers to stop Sheena Stewart, a Black social worker who was seven months pregnant, on her commute to work. Castellano pulled her from the driver’s seat, threw her to the ground, and called her a “fat bastard,” according to a lawsuit filed by Stewart, who sued the officers and the department for abusive policing and racial discrimination. Stewart was suspended from her job at a residential rehabilitation center after being charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and obstructing governmental administration; the charges against her were later dropped.“[This was] a decent person who was hurt in a very bad way,” said Brett Klein, Stewart’s lawyer. Castellano missed a court appearance for the lawsuit. City payroll records show that he resigned in 2015, while the lawsuit was ongoing. Stewart settled her case with the city for $75,000, agreeing to a common clause in police settlements in which the plaintiff agrees that the settlement does not indicate the guilt of the defending officer. Two years later, Castellano was hired by the Nassau County Police Department, where he works today for a higher salary than he had with the NYPD. The Nassau County Police Department did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the hiring of Castellano or the 16 other former NYPD officers accused of misconduct.“That’s classic. Making more money,” Klein said about Castellano’s rehiring. “It interfered with her job, but it didn’t seem to have any impact on this guy.”",3,Reliable,0.0404792000510232,0.3707390798274775,3373,3,The Intercept
383,"Trump, Twitter and the Digital Town Hall",-6.67,33.33,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/trump-twitter-and-the-digital-town-hall/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,25,"The merits are hard to stomach for partisans long jaundiced by presumption and dislike, but the cheer at the deplatforming of Donald Trump by a range of social media platforms said as much about the nature of any sentiment about democracy as it did about those claiming to defend it. For one, it shut off a valve of fantastic, instant recognition to a figure whose thoughts are best aired rather than cellared in underground vats. But cellaring, hiding, suppressing unsavoury viewpoints are the very things social media platforms are getting more enthusiastic about, much of it pushed on the censorious lobby that claims to have a monopoly on veracity and good behaviour. In the name of misinformation, offence and incitement, users will be either suspended, barred or subjected to digital excommunication in the name of safety. Which brings us to the fascinating nature of Trump’s latest legal action against Twitter. In January, the former US presidentwas bannedfrom the platform following the January 6thriot at the Capitol building inspired by supporters riled by claims that the election had been stolen. It began as a temporary ban of 12 hours for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy”. Two days later, the ban was made permanent. “In the context of the horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would permanently result in this very course of action,” Twitterclaimed in its January 8 statement. “The company’s “public interest framework” existed to permit “the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly.” But this role did not exist “above our rules entirely” and could not be used “to incite violence, among other things.”The reasoning behind the ban was illuminating of a social media giant sitting in shallow judgment. Two of Trump’s tweetswere singled out: one claiming that 75 million “great American patriots who voted for me” would “not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”; the second stating that he would “not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” Assuming the imperious role of civics guardian, the company strained to identify these mutterings as violating “our Glorification of Violence policy”. At the time German Chancellor Angela Merkelcalledthe decision “problematic” while Jens Zimmermann, Social Democrat member of the Bundestag, wondered what it meant “for the future actions of social media platforms”. In July, Trump began his legal battle to seek reinstatement across a range of platforms, filing a class action lawsuit against Google, Twitter and Facebook. “We are demanding an end to the show-banning, a stop to the silencing, and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing, and cancelling that you know so well,”he statedat the time. On October 1, Trump filed amore specific complaintin the Southern District of Florida claiming that Twitter “coerced by members of the United States Congress” was censoring him. The social media platform, the complaint argues, “exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate”. With 88 million followers, Trump argued that his account had become “an important source of news and information about government affairs and was a digital town hall.”The filing also made a pointed remark to Twitter’s somewhat varied approaches to users. Why permit the Taliban, “a known terrorist organization”, room to tweet about their military victories across Afghanistan yet claim that his own efforts had been accused of “glorifying violence”. Resort was also made to Florida’s social media legislation, the Stop Social Media Censorship Act, whichwas signed into lawby Governor Ron DeSantis in May to spite “the Silicon Valley elites” only to be blocked two months later by a bemused judge. One of the plaintiffs, Steve DelBianco of the industry group NetChoice,expressed delightat the absurd proposition that the court ruling “ensured that social media can remain family-friendly”. But equally absurd was the law’s idiosyncratic drafting, which included an exemption for companies operating theme parks in Florida. It is likely to perish at the hands of the Federal Appeals Court. Leaving aside the twaddle put forth by DelBianco, the difficulties of targeting social media platforms are almost insurmountable. Content moderation remains a pillar of using such fora, one guaranteed by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which gives the digital giants platform rather than publisher status. And the sacred First Amendment is assumed to apply to government actions rather than corporate mischief. The efforts by Trump to place his legal arguments against Big Tech on the hook of the First Amendment has received little support. One mighty voice in the field of jurisprudence thinking Trump has a case is Alan Dershowitz,who has arguedthat the case “pits freedom of speech on the one hand against the First Amendment on the other.” Such reasoning can well justify why lawyers deserve a bad name, but Dershowitz sees it as the high-tech behemoths quashing free speech. “They are censoring but they’re claiming the right to do so under the First Amendment”. Withering scorn has been levelled at that view. “Unlike delusional Dershowitz,” Democratic Rep. Ted Lieuinsistedwith smug confidence, “I read the First Amendment and it does not apply to private sector companies.” Laurence Tribe, formerly Carl M. Loeb Professor at Harvard Law School,took a dim viewof his former colleague. “How low can a former law professor sink? To call a bogus lawsuit on a fake version of the First Amendment an important case, much less ‘the most important’ of the century? Has he no shame?”Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff, conforming to the fashion of the times,suggesteda retributive remedy: the cancellation of Dershowitz’s status as emeritus professor. Harvard Law School had “a professional and ethical responsibility to its community – past, present and future – to associate with faculty who are ethical and have a high regard for the law.”For all such righteous splutters, Dershowitz and Trump have a point in pointing out a symptom of the US body politic that has become cripplingly apparent: business and the interests of capitalism have come to control speech, its circulation, its distribution. For decades, they had already come to guide politicians and political parties, exercising influence through campaign donations. Why run for elected office when you can buy it?In 2010, the US Supreme Court decision offoundthat limits upon “independent political spending” from corporations and private interest groups violated the First Amendment. Those with deep purses could only deem this the natural order of things: if you have cash, spend it to influence opinion in the name of free speech. Put rather simply, such speech was a shield big capitalism could well employ if it needed to. (Rep. Lieu, take note.)Gore Vidal used to remark that anyone seeking the keys to the White House could only do so with the approval of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Had he lived to see the Trump cancellation saga, he may well have added those Big Tech titans to the sterile committee of electoral approval.

In a piece titled, “Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M. D.,” Epstein started out by dismissively addressing Biden as “Madame First Lady—Mrs. Biden—Jill—kiddo,” and then cut to the heart of his questionable argument: “Any chance you might drop the ‘Dr.’ before your name? ‘Dr. Jill Biden’ sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic.”The 83-year-old Epstein, an emeritus lecturer of English at Northwestern University, briefly acknowledged that Biden had every right to usebefore her name by virtue of the doctorate in education she had obtained at the University of Delaware. But then he added she should not do so. “A wise man once said that no one should call himself ‘Dr.’ unless he has delivered a child,” he wrote. “Think about it, Dr. Jill, and forthwith drop the doc.” (Besides her doctorate, Biden also has a bachelor of arts in English from the University of Delaware and master’s degrees from both West Chester and Villanova universities.)Almost within minutes, the column sparked outrage on social media—that demeaning term, used to address a 69-year-old woman,really set some people off—with critics not only calling Epstein sexist and out of touch but also dredging up some questionable and offensive positions he had taken in the past. “BTW this is the same Joseph Epstein who wrote a 11-page manifesto for @Harpers in 1970 explaining why he ‘would wish homosexuality off the face of this earth,‘”tweetedthe journalist Frank Rich. “No wonder he’s at @WSJopinion.”And a former first lady succinctly weighed in:This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Biden’s recently appointed communications director,Elizabeth Alexander, called the piece “sexist and shameful” on Twitter, while Michael LaRosa, a spokesman for Biden, called out theop-ed editor James Taranto on Twitter, saying the paper “should be embarrassed to print the disgusting and sexist attack” on Biden.

Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and soon to be the nation’s first second gentleman, also expressed his outrage:This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Though Epstein has so far declined comment and thehas yet to address the controversy, the Northwestern University academic community was quick to distance itself from the author. “The department is aware that a former adjunct professor who has not taught here in nearly 20 years has published an opinion piece that casts unmerited aspersion on Dr. Jill Biden’s rightful public claiming of her doctoral credentials and expertise,” the university’s English department said in a statement issued this weekend. “The department rejects this opinion as well as the diminishment of anyone’s duly-earned degrees in any field, from any university.” And in aseparate statement, the university said, “Northwestern is firmly committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion, and strongly disagrees with Mr. Epstein’s misogynistic views.” (It also appears that Epstein’s profilehad been removedfrom the university’s website.)Here are some of the other reactions to Epstein’s column:This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.

First, the significance of Georgia specifically. I’ll spare you some of the boilerplate about the more obvious implications, but having a Senate majority is a big deal. It means that Democrats should be able to confirm Supreme Court justices and President-elect Joe Biden’s Cabinet. They’ll likely be able to pass additional COVID-19 stimulus legislation at the very least, along with other budgetary policies through reconciliation. Other policy changes would require eliminating the filibuster —unlikely— or getting cooperation from enough Republicans. But at least Democrats will have the chance to bring to the floorelection-reform bills like H. R. 1andpolicies like Puerto Rico statehood, giving them a fighting chance instead of having Majority Leader Mitch McConnell squash them from the start. And symbolically? Well,it’sGeorgia. With the possible exception of Texas, no other state has been as much of a symbol of an emerging Democratic coalition of college-educated white voters and high turnout among Black voters and other minority groups. Both Warnock and Ossoff are breakthrough candidates, not the moderate, whiteBlue Dogsthat Democrats have traditionally nominated in Georgia. Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, will become the first Black senator from Georgia and thefirst Black Democrat everto serve in the U. S. Senate from the South. Ossoff will become theyoungest senator elected since Biden, in 1973, and thefirst Jewish senatorelected to the U. S. Senate from the South since the 1880s. Then there’s the fact that the runoffs came during a lame-duck period in which — in a predicate to Wednesday’s violence — Trump and other Republicanstried to overturn and subvert the results of the election and undermine faith in the democratic process. If Republicans get the message that anti-democratic actions have negative electoral consequences, they may be less inclined to push democracy to the brink in the future. Republicans may not take away that lesson, though. One school of thought is that because Warnock’s and Ossoff’s wins were narrow — once all votes are counted, Warnock should win by around 2 percentage points and Ossoff by about 1 point — we shouldn’t make too much of them. I don’t find this convincing. The way political actors react to elections is usually based on who wins and loses, not on their margins of victory. For example, nobody thought that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were brilliant politicians because they only narrowly lost in key Electoral College states. But it’s also not clear that these races really had any business being close to begin with. Consider the following:Indeed, after Georgia, Republicans’ track record in the three general elections (2016, 2018, 2020) plus the various runoffs and special elections that took place under Trump now starts to look mediocre:So, it hasn’t been aterribletime to be a Republican running for office, but it hasn’t been a good one, either. Typically, a party would be looking to move beyond a one-term president who had cost his party control of both houses of Congress. Actually, that’s being kind: Typically, a party wants nothing to do with a losing presidential candidate. When it comes to Trump, though, that calculation isn’t necessarily so simple because of his tendency to punish his intraparty adversaries: Republicans who tried to cross him, such as former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, weresometimes forced to retirerather than face the president’s wrath in a primary. Yet the GOP has done especially poorly in Trump-era electionswithoutTrump on the ballot, too. Republicanslost the popular vote for the U. S. House by 8.6 points in 2018without the president on the ticket. And while some Republicans areblaming Trump for their losses in Georgia, the fact is that Perdue won the plurality of votes in November with Trump on the ballot but lost to Ossoff without him. Tuesday’s loss cameprimarily because of lower turnout, especially in red, rural counties where Trump can bring voters to the polls. To step back a bit, the success of an electoral strategy basically comes down to four dimensions:In Trump-era elections, Republicans have tended to do well along two of these dimensions and poorly along the other two. Namely, Trump gets very high turnout from his base. What’s just as important, rural white voters who are the core of that base havefar more power in the Electoral College and U. S. Senatethan their raw numbers would imply, making their coalition electorally efficient. Hence, their strategy has performed well along dimensions No. 1 and No. 4. Conversely, Trump isextremelymotivatingin turning out many parts of the Democratic base (dimension No. 2). And he’s a big turn-off to swing voters, or at least he’s proven to be after four years in office (dimension No. 3). After narrowly beating Clinton amongindependent voters in 2016, Trump lost them to Biden by13 points in November. Swing voters also haven’t been very happy with the GOP with or without Trump on the ballot: They backed Democratic candidates for the U. S. House by12 points in 2018. Republicans have had especially big problems withsuburban swing voters, including in places that were once GOP strongholds. We’ll have to wait and see, but the violence at the Capitol last week may only exacerbate the GOP’s problems on dimensions No. 2 and No. 3. In thefewpollsconducted since, solid majorities of Americans overall, including almost all Democrats and a majority of independents, said the storming of the Capitol represented a threat to democracy. Similar shares of Democrats and independents said Trump and congressional Republicans bore at least some blame. Republicans are in a fairly precarious position. At best, they are often fighting to a draw, and one that would often be a losing strategy without the structural advantages built into the system for rural voters. And if Republicans don’t getspectacularturnout from their base, everything else potentially starts to crumble. Even amodest decline in turnoutfrom people who are pro-#MAGA butnot necessarily part of the traditional Republican basecan leave the GOP in a losing position. Nor do Republicans have any sort of obvious role model for how to achieve consistent electoral success. The previous Republican president, George W. Bush, saw his second term in office end with landslides against Republicans in 2006 and 2008. A series of recent presidential nominees associated with the party establishment (Mitt Romney, John McCain, Bob Dole) all lost their elections, meanwhile. You really have to go back to Ronald Reagan for an example of an unambiguously broad and successful Republican electoral coalition, and that was a generation ago. Republicans who cast their first votes for Reagan at age 18 in 1984 will be 58 years old in 2024. This doesn’t mean Republicans are helpless, by any means. Under McConnell and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, their congressional agenda has also beenlargely unpopular. If you’reconsistently pushing positions that a majority of the public opposes, you’re liable to pay a price for it. Republicans’ structural advantages (especially in the Senate), and Trump’s ability to drive turnout in the places where those structural advantages matter, served as cover for aminoritarian agenda. For all that said, the tendency of the opposition party to regain ground at the midterms is very strong. One would not want to bet that much against the GOP winning back one or both houses of Congress in 2022. (The House, where Republicans shouldpick up some seats from redistricting, might actually be the better bet than the Senate, whereDemocrats have a relatively favorable map.)After last week, though, I’m not sure I’d want to place a lot of money on the GOP in 2022, either. If the Georgia runoffs served as a quasi-midterm, they might suggest that the GOP can’t count on the sort of gains that a party typically wins in midterms. As in theprimaries leading up to 2010, the GOP is likely to have some vicious intraparty fights, possibly leading it to nominate suboptimal candidates in some races. And with the violence last week and Republican efforts to contest the Electoral College outcome in Congress, Democrats may be very motivated again in 2022, feeling — not unreasonably — as though democracy itself may be on the line.",3,Reliable,0.0472198508218916,0.4418926598722517,2039,3,FiveThirtyEight
387,There Is No “Birth Rate Crisis” <U+2767> Current Affairs,-12.33,30.0,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/06/there-is-no-birth-rate-crisis,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"For medical reasons, a close friend of mine is unable, or at least very unlikely, to become pregnant. “I feel like I’ve failed,” she says to me regularly.“How do you feel you’ve failed?” I usually respond. She sighs, and confesses: “It just makes me feel so inadequate as a woman that I can’t.”This notion—that a cis woman is only “complete” if she gives birth with her own body—is common, and easy to internalize. It runs deeper than mere personal inadequacy: it’s held to be something of a social failure, too. “Women are supposed to perpetuate the species,” my friend tells me, reaching for something that sounds like science. In the last year or so, a spate of headlines have bemoaned the global “baby bust”—women are inadequate failures all over, it seems. The average number of births has dropped worldwide, partly due to COVID, but partly due to other, more long-term factors. According to agloomy reportin the: “by the latter half of the century or possibly earlier, the global population will enter a sustained decline for the first time.” The language in the article’s subhead is dire: “Fewer babies’ cries. More abandoned homes. Toward the middle of this century, as deaths start to exceed births, changes will come that are hard to fathom.” A separateTimesop-ed by philosopher Tom Whyman evokes the specter ofChildren of Men, a dystopian novel and its popular movie adaptation about a world without hope in which human beings have become completely infertile. The “Global Baby Drought of Covid-19 Crisis Risks Population Crunch,” warnsBloomberg, and “Spare a Thought for the Billions of People Who Will Never Exist,” weepsBusinessweek. More locally,manyterrified headlinesinform usthat the U. S. birth rate has fallen dangerously low. According to a recentreportby the National Center for Health Statistics, the fertility rate is the lowest since 1979, with a 4 percent drop in the number of births since 2019. Last year, far fewer teenagers became pregnant—an 8 percent drop since 2019—and births among women in their early 20s also dropped off by 6 percent. “‘The birthrate is the lowest it’s ever been,’” says demographer Kenneth Johnson, quoted in yet anotherarticle ominously titled “The U. S. Birthrate has Dropped Again. The Pandemic May Be Accelerating the Decline.” “‘At some point the question is going to be: The women who delayed having babies, are they ever going to have them? If they don’t, that’s a permanent notch in the American births structure.’”Oh no! A permanent notch in the American births structure! That’s bad! Is that bad? “That the rate has gone down is not necessarily bad,” says sociologist Caroline Sten Hartnett, quoted in the samearticle as Johnson but much further down. Ok, whew. But nonetheless, the birth rate—both globally and locally—remains a matter of publicinterest, something that must be noted and tracked by demographers and sociologists, its consequences reported on, over and over, in the paper of record and business publications. (TheNew York Timesin particularsimplycan’tshutupabout thebirth rate.)So why do these outlets care so much? What exactly are “birth rates” in the first place, and why are they considered an issue of national and global importance? Why is everybodyfreaking out?There are many reasons, of course, why people might choose not to have children these days. In the U. S., the lingering specter of Covid, plus a teetering economy, plus the medical expense of childbirth in a for-profit system and lack of social support for parents and children—plus, maybe, a tentative mainstreaming of the belief that child-free living isn’t tragic—all of this helps explain why many Americans are choosing to delay parenthood, have fewer children, or opt out entirely. Of course, if women—and others—want to have children, and they can’t for financial reasons, that’s a problem, in the way that not being able to achievedream due to financial hardship is a problem. But is there such public interest in the declining birth rate solely because we want everybody to have the right and the financial comfort to have children if they so choose, or is it for some other reason?“It is, after all, the right,” Elizabeth Bruenignotesin the“that frets most vocally about the nation’s declining birthrates.”Now, why would that be?Birth rate concerns often arise from a specific demographic terror: that ifbirths are too low, thenothersmay be too high. The far right states this out loud in the form of the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory: that white people will be replaced, socially and demographically, by people of color (who conversely are held responsible, particularly in India and in sub-Saharan Africa, for globaloverpopulation). This clearly racist formulation may not be the way some liberals and leftists think about birth rate, or at least not the way theythey think about birth rate. In a practical sense, a low number of births, especially compared to the rate of deaths (aka “below replacement”;the U. S. has been below replacement since 2007), can spell economic trouble in the future: a country may not have enough people to fill the employment ranks, and the economy will shrink. But this is predicated on the assumption that a healthy economy is one that continues to grow forever, even as our planet loudly demonstrates the limits of this kind ofpermanent growth. There is no reason whatsoever that our economy should be forever based on the principle ofline go up, other than the fact that capitalist economies have simply been structured this way. We could just as easily move toward adegrowthmodel, which unpegs economic progress from the GDP “while at the same time,” economic anthropologist Jason Hickelexplains, “maintaining and even improving people’s standards of living” through shorter work hours and increased social services. To the extent that having fewer people does present an economic problem for the United States, there is of course an easy solution: let in more of the immigrants who are queuing up in multitudes to get in. There is no difference between babies born here and babies born elsewhere, so if babies boost the economy, then so do immigrants. The economic concerns over birth rates tend to presume that more immigration won’t happen, but that’s a policy choice. The reluctance to treat “letting more people in” as a solution to “we have too few people” shows why concerns about birth rates seem to be less driven by true economic concern than ethno-nationalism. (On the right, this is made much more explicit.) But even more liberal conceptions of immigration as the solution to population decline aren’t about the free movement of people—again, choice isn’t really the goal here—but instead the same kind of exploitation of low-wage workers that currently defines the U. S. economy. Immigrants are viewed in this context as a labor solution for unharvested crops and overstuffed nursing homes, not as human beings who have decided to live in one place rather than another. Any way you look at it, generalized “concern” about the birth rate is inseparable from racist replacement anxiety and an obsession with maintaining a certain kind of economic progress forever. These underlying racist prerogatives are also evident when we consider the matter of “selfishness.” Yes, the economy is bad and healthcare is a joke, but aren’t millennial women just too selfish to have a baby? Aren’t they too focused on their careers, their Instagram accounts, their avocado toasts? As often happens with the term “millennial” itself, the discourse here doesn’t refer to the actual generation as much as a specific subset of it: the white, upper-middle class, college-educated portion. When poor women or teenage girls have babies—especially if they’re Black or brown—it’s presumed to be an actselfishness, or at least carelessness. Race, age, and class markers all signify whether women and their babies are automatically presumed to be potential burdens on the state (the result of a selfish “lack of control”); or, conversely, whether their babies are expected, even insisted upon, and their withholding is considered selfish. It’s almost impossible to talk about having a baby versus not having a baby without raising the specter of selfishness in one direction or another. In one of these tediousarticles, a woman who was delaying parenthood confessed, “I’m feeling a little bit selfish.” She went on: “Everybody in my friend group is saying, ‘When is the right time to let go of that selfishness?’” she said. ‘We are all putting it off.’” It’s simply taken as a given—for some women—that refusal to have children is an act of selfishness, rather than a valid and allowable choice. Experiences differ, I’m sure, but I’ve found that as an educated white millennial who’s been married for a while, people tend to assume I must want babies, and they’re frequently bothered that I don’t have them. Not long after my wedding, at age 24, a coworker scrutinized me in the bathroom mirror. “you pregnant?” she asked, doubtful, surprised, confused. I wasn’t; I’d just eaten a big burrito. But whether it was a burrito or a baby, my belly washerbusiness. Babies—and the uteruses that produce them—have long been considered public domain, open to judgment, commentary, and national concern. People with uteruses are so accustomed to their reproductive capability being a matter of social and state interest that we rarely spend much time wonderingthat might be. There’s a very long history here, but one of the best studies of it might be Silvia Federici’s classicCaliban and the Witch. According to Federici, the transition to capitalism required “the subjugation of women to the reproduction of the work-force.” By this she means the literal acts of conceiving, carrying to term, and giving birth, but also caring for children, feeding them, cleaning up after them, and generally ensuring that the next generation of workers will be ready to be fed into the meat grinder of capitalism. This work, which had once simply been part of ordinary social life, became “unwaged labor” next to the waged labor of men; even when women take part in the workforce, it’s still generally presumed that they will perform this unwaged labor alongside it. More proof can be found in the gendered (and cis-heteronormative) nature of this brand of “selfishness.” Why do we ask if it’s selfish for millennial women (again meaning upper middle class cis white millennial women) to opt out of having children, but not if it’s selfish forto do so? Because despite feminist gains, reproductive labor is still considered to be a woman’s job. Failure to do so—whether it’s to have children, or to perform other forms of care work such as looking after sick parents, or looking after other people’s children or sick parents in a low-waged capacity—is a perceived failure to be a woman. In the most essential (and essentialist) sense, being a womaniscaring about other people. In herop-ed about the baby bust and parenting, Bruenig writes movingly about the sacrificial quality of motherhood, and says that for her:There’s nothing wrong at all with finding great personal meaning in losing yourself in the care of someone else, but the entire passage reminds me of a panel discussion I once attended featuring the great (and greatly underappreciated) novelistKate Elliott. She said—I’m paraphrasing, I didn’t write it down—that she had to teach herself how to take time away from her husband and children in order to write. “You had to learn to be selfish?” prompted one of the other panelists. “No,” replied Elliott. “I had to learn that.”Women desert themselves for other people all the time: we’re supposed to, we’reto, whether it’s for children or lovers or family or friends. And this can be wonderful, as love always is. But itisn’t selfishto make other choices: to carve out your own time, for yourself, away from the people you love. Nobody would say that of a male novelist of course, and this isn’t a demand for women to be just as selfish as male novelists (society would really collapse then!) Similarly, we need to recognize that the choice to not have children—or tohavechildren that are considered inconvenient under capitalism—isn’t selfish either, because you do not owe the world those choices, because your adequacy or inadequacy as a woman—as a person—has nothing whatsoever to do with childbearing. And what we see in societies where women have a much fuller ability to make those choices—say, for example, Finland, which already had excellent parental leave policies, but just extended them to seven months per parent, or 14 months for a single parent—birth rates arelow, and likely to remain low. It turns out that if people can actually choose freely whether to have children or not, they often won’t. Amid the fear-mongering about the “jaw-dropping’ global crash” in birth rates, the BBC notes that the reduction is “driven by more women in education and work, as well as greater access to contraception, leading to women choosing to have fewer children. In many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.” Even thegrudgingly acknowledges that “many women are having fewer children because that’s what they want. Smaller populations could lead to higher wages, more equal societies, lower carbon emissions and a higher quality of life for the smaller numbers of children who are born.”We are so accustomed to the engine of capitalism—the sleepless roar, the bodies churned beneath it, the silent unwaged labor of women that feeds and keeps it chugging along—that we don’t know quite what to do when it starts to slow down, and fall silent. “[M]ost of the world is transitioning into natural population decline,” says researcher Christopher Murray, quoted by the BBC. “I think it’s incredibly hard to think this through and recognise how big a thing this is; it’s extraordinary, we’ll have to reorganise societies.” It is extraordinary! It’s an enormous experiment in lessening the harm we’ve caused; figuring out how we can provide for everyone who wants children but stop pressuring them to do so (or shaming themdoing so) just to keep an outdated system of white supremacist capitalism intact. My friend who can’t have children returns again and again to the question of her “inadequacy,” I think, because she can’t stop feeling she’s done something. She regrets not being able to have children in part because she did want them, but the obsession driving our continuous conversation seems to be that feeling of social disappointment: she has let the world down. Rather than fussing over birth rates, or insisting upon the joys of parenting, I wonder if we need to reconstruct “selfishness” and “selflessness” themselves. It would be nice if women no longer felt that caring about their own art was selfish; it would be nice if what it meant to be a “woman” was no longer constructed around care labor at all (and that “man” no longer meant “one who doesnotdo care labor.”) Individual “selfishness” is a peculiar concept anyway when a particular system of economic exploitation—one which enriches a few at the expense of countless others—has selfishly wrecked this planet. The solution in any case is not, I think, to encourage personal acts of sacrifice but to ensure that everyone has the freedom to actually pursue what they want; so that no one feels inadequate, so that it really is a choice.",1,Questionable,0.0544489608152398,0.4320014245014245,3553,2,Current Affairs
388,Zoom memorials highlight the ironic cruelty of trying to mourn together during the pandemic,-1.33,36.33,https://www.upworthy.com/cruel-irony-of-pandemic-mourning,https://adfontesmedia.com/upworthy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,16,"Earlier this month, I attended my first Zoom wedding. A week after that, I attended a Zoom baby shower. Tomorrow, I'll attend a Zoom gathering to mourn the loss of a family friend. His name was Peter. He died of COVID-19 last week. This gathering isn't technically a funeral or memorial service, but rather a virtual devotional taking place on Zoom at the same time as Peter's physical burial. A few close friends and family will gather at the gravesite—masked and distanced—while the rest of us share readings and prayers over Zoom to honor his interment. It's weird. There's no other way to say it. With the wedding and baby shower, we all sort of laughed our way through the weirdness. We acknowledged the bummer of not being able to get together, but at this point we're all accustomed to having to meet virtually. Zoom celebrations are better than no celebrations at all. But mourning this way feels...different. We can't laugh away the awkwardness of it when the Zoom meeting itself is a reminder of the tragic cause of our friend's death. Celebratory gatherings are fun, but not necessary. Gathering when someone dies feels necessary in a way, and the inability to do that adds an extra layer of loss to the grief we're already experiencing. Normally, our whole community would gather together to honor Peter's life tomorrow. We'd put on appropriate funeral attire, stand side by side at his grave, hold hands or hug one another as we mark the momentousness of his passing. We'd all bring food and break bread together as we share stories of his life. We'd pass around tissues, crying and laughing and sharing in the oh-so-human experience of bringing together the lives he had touched. But we can't do any of that. If we did, we'd run the risk of having to do it all over again for another friend or loved one taken too soon by this stupid virus. So we do what we can do and deal with the strange questions—What does one wear to a Zoom mourning? How long it will be before we can actually gather for a real memorial service? Will it feel like it's too late then? Will we want to do that in the midst of celebrating a return to non-distanced life? This pandemic has taken so much, and each thing stings in its own way. The death toll itself is overwhelming, especially here in the U. S. where we have already lost more than 330,000 lives. A hundred 9/11s and counting. Five Vietnams in less than a year. It's unreal. In the beginning, we were told that all of us would likely end up knowing someone who died of COVID-19, and some people have now lost multiple family members. More will follow as we head into the deadliest month of the pandemic. That's not doom and gloom forecasting—that's the reality of the current moment. But the loss of in-person mourning as millions are losing loved ones before they expected to is a tragedy in and of itself. There's a cruel irony in it, that we can't gather in person to mourn if we want to stop the thing that's making it so we can't gather in person to mourn. When we need the comfort of coming together the most, we can't, as indulging in that comfort could lead to even more suffering. Of all of the sacrifices we've had to make, the loss of communal mourning is one of the hardest. And so we open our computers and enter our virtual meeting rooms and try to comfort one another through our grief amid the inevitable unmute reminders. It's weird. It all feels wrong. But it's necessary. We need to mourn our losses together. We also need to be able to mourn the fact that we're not able to do that the way we want to. There is gratitude to be found in all of this, of course. It's pretty incredible that we live in a time when we have the technology to at least see one another's faces and hear people's voices as we share our losses at a distance. If this pandemic had hit in my childhood, we'd have had no community ability to mourn at all. A Zoom gathering to mourn is better than no gathering at all—but it's still all of the weird, wrong, sad things at once. And what's extra painful about it is that it didn't have to be this way. Next time we have a pandemic, let's all agree to just follow New Zealand's lead, shall we? Hundreds of thousands of Zoom funerals really ought to be enough to get us all on the same page.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0200757575757575,0.5253246753246752,1036,2,Upworthy

The debate over the document exposed deep fissures among the bishops on whether it should go after politicians when two-thirds of Catholics don’t have an issue with the president, who rarely misses Sunday mass and has often spoken of his faith. Bishop Robert McElroy of San Diego said the statement could unleash “weaponization of the Eucharist,” the Associated Press reported.

390,Providers Sue to Block Law That Would Eliminate Nearly All Abortions in Texas,-11.33,41.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/15/texas-abortion-lawsuit-sb8/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"Amy Hagstrom Milleris furious. “It’s a righteous kind of fury that I’m feeling,” she told reporters on a July 13 press call. “That we have to go back into the courts to plead with them to protect the people of Texas from extremists who hijacked the state Legislature.”At issue isSenate Bill 8, which seeks to ban all abortion in Texas after six weeks of pregnancy, well before many people know they’re pregnant. Roughly 90 percent of people who obtain abortion care in Texas are at least six weeks into pregnancy. While similar bans enacted in 11 states have been blocked by federal courts for contravening nearly 50 years of precedent upholding the right to abortion before fetal viability — roughly four months beyond the six-week mark — the Texas law is designed to circumvent constitutional protections. Instead of making the ban enforceable by a state actor — say, the head of the state health department or the attorney general — S. B. 8 allows literally anyone to bring a private civil suit against an abortion provider they believe may have violated the ban or a person they believe has aided or abetted a patient seeking an abortion after six weeks. That could include a friend who lends a patient money or drives them to a clinic. The point of all this is to try to prohibit providers and patients from going to federal court to block the law from taking effect, what’s known as a pre-enforcement challenge. If there’s no obvious state official to sue, the thinking goes, the efforts of providers and their allies will be stymied. S. B. 8 is slated to take effect on September 1. But this week, a coalition of providers — including Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman’s Health Alliance — nonethelessfiled suitin federal district court in Austin in an attempt to block the law. The providers were joined in the suit by other supporters of abortion access, including six abortion funds, which provide assistance to those seeking abortion; two abortion doctors; and two religious leaders who regularly counsel abortion patients.“We’ve beaten back these attacks before,” Hagstrom Miller, who runs four clinics in Texas, said of the plethora of abortion restrictions state lawmakers have enacted over the years. “We can and will do it again.”Back in March, John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion group,toldthe Senate’sState Affairs Committeethat S. B. 8 was “crafted to lead to judicial victories” and “succeed where 11 other states have failed.”In response, the coalition behind the lawsuit — which includes the Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Lawyering Project, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, among others — hasn’t just gone after the attorney general and state health department. Also named as defendants are state judges with jurisdiction over civil court cases and the county clerks tasked with accepting civil lawsuits under S. B. 8. The argument is that these state actors have been conscripted into lawmakers’ attempts to violate constitutional rights and thus are the appropriate individuals to sue.“Texas has essentially roped judges and clerks into the enforcement of this, so they’re the proper defendants in this lawsuit because of the way the Texas Legislature has structured this law,” said Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights and the lead attorney in the case. “I do note that if this is not blocked, if this is successful, it would set a truly dangerous precedent because states could eviscerate their own citizens’ federal constitutional rights by creating a private lawsuit to do what their own officials couldn’t do.”The law deputizes anyone, from anywhere in the country, to bring a suit based on mere speculation that S. B. 8 has been violated. It does so by flouting how civil litigation usually works, which is that the person suing must have been harmed in some way. The law also incentivizes people to bring these suits by awarding at least $10,000 in damages, if their suit is successful, per abortion performed in violation of the law.“In effect, SB 8 places a bounty on people who provide or aid abortions, inviting random strangers to sue them,” the lawsuit reads. In attempting to prove an allegedly illegal abortion took place, the lawsuits allowed under SB 8 also pose a threat to individuals’ right to privacy in health care. The harassment has already begun, the suit notes, with two anti-abortion activists trespassing onto the Whole Woman’s Health Alliance property in Austin to distribute a letter telling staff that they could be sued for violating the law and encouraging them to rat each other out. Hagstrom Miller said that her staff and physicians “are terrified. The teams are on edge; they’re very worried. They’re under so much stress. I mean, they’re already under surveillance and uncertainty.” The sonographer who works in the Austin clinic recently told her that 80 percent of the patients she’s served over the last month are asking “while they’re in the clinic, on the day of their abortion, if it’s legal,” Hagstrom Miller said. “Can you imagine what that feels like as a patient and as a staff person on the ground in Texas already? And this law hasn’t even gone into effect yet.”Texas Sen. Bryan Hughes speaks during a Senate Committee on State Affairs hearing at the Capitol in Austin on July 10, 2021. There’s reason to believe that lawsuits under S. B. 8 will materialize as the abortion providers, advocates, and lawyers fear. Named as an individual defendant in their suit is a man named Mark Lee Dickson, the director of Right to Life East Texas. A veteran abortion clinic protester, Dickson has spearheaded attempts to get cities across Texas to adopt ordinances that would ban abortion within their boundaries, an effort hecallsthe “Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn Movement.”His first success was in tiny Waskom, Texas, which has anaging populationof fewer than 2,000 people. The city council there eagerly passed Dickson’s ordinance, catching a lot of attention thanks to a photo that ran in the Marshall News Messenger, whichdepictedthe all-white, all-male council as they unanimously approved the new law. Since then, a handful of little towns across Texas have adopted Dickson’s proposed ordinance, which wascrafted with the assistanceof state Sen. Bryan Hughes, who represents Longview, where Dickson lives. Hughes was also the author of S. B. 8. So far, the largest city in Texas to dub itself a sanctuary city for the unborn is Lubbock, in the state’s Panhandle and home to Texas Tech University. After debate, the city council declined to adopt the ban, noting that it was unconstitutional, and tossed the decision to voters. In a special May election where there was practically nothing else on the ballot, voters adopted the measure, which took effect June 1. Like S. B. 8, the city ordinance gives residents the right to bring civil lawsuits to enforce the ban. The measure is deeply troubling to Angela Martinez, health center manager at the Lubbock Planned Parenthood. She really didn’t think it would pass. “It was silly of me to be surprised,” she said. The clinic had only recently reopened. It was shuttered back in 2013 after lawmakers restructured how family planning money was allocated — money that provides preventive services and birth control to low-income and uninsured people — as a way to deny funding to Planned Parenthood, the single largest provider of such services. That year the clinic was also hamstrung by the unending string of draconian,and unnecessary, restrictions on abortion that led to the closure of half of the state’s abortion clinics. With the clinic closed, the nearest in-state abortion provider was some 300 miles away,in Fort Worth. Lubbock is a health care desert, so the fact that the clinic was able to reopen in 2020 was a big deal. At the time the ordinance passed, the clinic was only providingmedication abortion, which is available early in pregnancy, but had plans to start providing procedural abortions as well. They’re still providing family planning services but have stopped providing abortion services because of the city’s new law. “The schedule filled up so quickly that you knew you were doing something right,” she said. “You were fulfilling a need. These people aren’t having to travel. We’re able to assist them closer to home.” Now, many patients will again have to travel for services. This appears to have pleased Dickson, whoposted a videoto Facebook on June 1 to herald Lubbock’s new ordinance — and to stage a call to the clinic to see if they would accept an abortion client. In the video, Dickson is wearing a backwards baseball cap and a dark blue suit jacket over a turquoise plaid pearl-snap shirt. He smiles smugly after a woman answering the phone at the clinic says she can’t book an abortion appointment. But he also looks a tad bewildered, as if surprised by his success, kind of like a high school freshman who won the race for class president and can’t quite believe it. In the wake of the ordinance’s passage, Planned Parenthood sued the city in federal court to block it from taking effect, but a federal judge dismissed the suit, saying he lacked jurisdiction to stop it. Planned Parenthood has since asked the judge to reconsider his ruling. Since S. B. 8 passed, Dickson has posted messages to Facebook lauding the new law. In March, before the bill was even signed, he was encouraging folks to file lawsuits. “You will be able to bring many lawsuits later this year,” he wrote. “Let me know if you are looking for an attorney to represent you if you choose to do so. Will be glad to recommend some.”On Tuesday, Dickson posted several times about the lawsuit filed by providers and advocates, adding the hashtag #unbornlivesmatter. “Today several who desire to end the lives of precious babies with heartbeats sued myself and others,” he wrote. “The only thing more ridiculous than this lawsuit is the fact that we have people, right here in Texas, who are fighting to end the lives of innocent unborn children.”There was plenty of outrage to go around as plaintiffs and their attorneys addressed reporters during the call to announce the lawsuit.“I’ve never felt more outraged or angry than I did when this egregious and inhumane law was passed,” said Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who provides abortions at Houston’s Planned Parenthood clinic. “I have helped thousands of people safely end their pregnancies with the dignity, respect, and compassion they deserve. What I have learned from my years of training is that abortion care is extremely safe and very common. I’ve also seen firsthand how many people don’t expect they will need abortion care until they do.”Kumar and others noted that the ban on abortion would disparately impact low-income people and people of color who already struggle to secure reproductive health services and face high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality when carrying pregnancies to term. “Racial and ethnic disparities in health care are especially prevalent in Texas and are exacerbated by policies that restrict access to the full range of reproductive health services,” said Adriana Piñon, policy counsel and senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas. The state, she said, “has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation. If this law takes effect, people struggling to make ends meet will not be able to travel out of state to obtain abortion care and will be forced to continue their pregnancies against their will. And the consequences may be horrific.”Rev. Daniel Kanter, senior minister of First Unitarian Church in Dallas, provides counseling and spiritual support to pregnant people considering abortion. He worries that S. B. 8 will set a dangerous and unconstitutional precedent that would chill free speech. “My question to Texans today is whether you want … the courts in the room when your ministers or clergy counsel you. The law threatens to interfere with what we as faith leaders can and cannot talk about,” he said. “And we might all ask this question: What’s the next thing we won’t be allowed to talk about in the privacy of our counseling sessions? The idea that the state gets to decide what we can discuss in the protected confessionals and faith-based conversations … is frankly un-American and unethical.”Because of the way S. B. 8 is written, he said, any discussion a faith leader has about abortion could be subject to a civil lawsuit. Indeed, the lawsuit filed by reproductive rights advocates challenges S. B. 8 on First Amendment grounds. The law, the attorneys argue, must be found to run afoul of the Constitution. “Otherwise, states and localities across the country would have free rein to target federal rights they disfavor,” the suit reads. “Today it is abortion providers and those who assist them; tomorrow it might be gun buyers who face liability for every purchase. Churches could be hauled into far-flung courts to defend their religious practices because someone somewhere disagrees with them.”Hagstrom Miller said the state is facing a “stark choice between a nightmarish future in which extremist politicians succeed in banning abortion and turning Texans against each other. Or a much brighter one in which people facing unplanned pregnancies can get the advice, support, and care they need.”",3,Reliable,0.0825688562645084,0.4760747766726025,2900,3,The Intercept

Tarantino announced that he bought the 97-year-old theater while on the July 5 episode of theArmchair Expert podcast, hosted by actor Dax Shepard.“We’ll show new movies that come out, where they give us a film print,” Tarantino said. “The Vista is like a crown jewel kind of thing. So it’ll be like the best prints. We’ll show older films, but they will be like older films that can hold a four-night engagement.”The two-time Academy Award winner also owns the 101-year-old New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and fans speculated that Tarantino maypurchase the Cinerama Domeon Sunset Boulevard, as it was featured in his “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,” film, and the theater often screened the 35 millimetre versions of his films. The Cinerama, as well as other theaters owned by Pacific Theaters announced permanent closure in early April, 2021. The Vista was twice robbed during the pandemic,the most recent incident occurringthis July 4 weekend, as the windows were shattered and cash register tossed to the floor, although LAPD confirmed there was no money to be taken.

392,New quarantine rules for teachers could keep Nebraska schools open,2.33,48.0,https://omaha.com/news/local/education/new-quarantine-rules-for-teachers-could-keep-nebraska-schools-open/article_71e3db57-bde1-5b5d-9744-5bede5cbafd9.html#tracking-source=home-trending,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,22,"Parents and students spoke out against a decision from Omaha Public Schools to cancel fall sports. A new Nebraska directed health measure could keep teachers on the job — and schools open — after staff members have a close contact with COVID-19. The new language could be a “game changer” for schools as they attempt to keep their doors open during thepandemic, said Gretna Superintendent Rich Beran. But the state’s teachers union says the change to quarantining protocols, which took effect this week, could put teachers at risk. The change allows a teacher to stay in the classroom after a close COVID-19 contact instead of quarantining, as long as the teacher takes certain precautions. A close contact means coming within 6 feet — for at least 10 minutes — of a person who tested positive for COVID-19, had a fever of 100.4 degrees or above, or had sudden onset of a cough or sudden onset of shortness of breath, according to the document. Under the measure, the teacher could remain on the job as long as they have no symptoms, wear a face covering or mask for 14 days, practice social distancing and self-monitor twice daily for fever and other symptoms. The new protocol took effect Tuesday. The guidelines also apply to paraprofessionals and other staffers at schools and educational service units. The prospect of running out of teachers and substitutes remains a concern for school officials. As of last week, for example, the Millard Public Schools reported 216 students and staff members quarantining. Millard Superintendent Jim Sutfin said he’s reviewing the implications of the measure for his district.“Specifically, we are working to identify situations and circumstances where this new directive may be of benefit to our staff, students and community while also keeping safety as our primary goal,” he said. Nebraska State Education Association executive director Maddie Fennell said union officials are reviewing the document and intend to come up with guidance to protect the safety of their members and students. Teachers are already overwhelmed teaching during the pandemic, she said.“Now they’re basically being told to teach until you become severely ill or you drop,” she said. “We’re basically being called essential workers without saying that. But essential workers need to have the appropriate PPE and everything in place.”Not every district has the personal protective equipment on hand, and social distancing practices vary from school to school, she said. She said many teachers have been buying their own protective equipment. Nebraska Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt said the intent is to provide more flexibility to local health departments when deciding to quarantine teachers.“We have a lot of people get quarantined and never come down with anything,” Blomstedt said. He said the change should not force a person to teach if they feel they’ve been exposed to the disease.“If someone thinks they’ve really been exposed, and they want to quarantine, it still gives them the flexibility to be able to do that,” Blomstedt said. “But I think we have folks who go, ‘Hey, look, I don’t think I was really exposed. I’m showing no symptoms. Can I monitor and come back?’ I would hope it would empower the individual as well.”Mass quarantines are a concern because they could cause a school to shut down, despite having no significant spread, he said. Blomstedt said he agrees with union leaders that teachers who teach in person should have protective equipment, such as better quality masks, to ensure their safety. He said he doesn’t know how many of the people who are quarantined for contact eventually get the disease.“I only have anecdotally, where we’ve been told quite a few times that people are being quarantined out of an abundance of caution, and then not coming down with anything, and returning after the quarantine time, which creates a kind of mistrust in the quarantine process, too,” he said.

ByMichael Crowley,Michael D. ShearandEric SchmittWASHINGTON — Haiti’s request for U. S. troops to help stabilize the country following the assassination of its president presents a difficult choice forPresident Biden: send forces to aid a neighbor even as he is trying to pare down America’s military footprint overseas, or refrain and risk allowing the chaos unfolding there to escalate into a refugee crisis. Thus far, administration officials have expressed caution about any deployment to Haiti, reflecting the fast pace of events since attackers killed President Jovenel Moïse in his home on Wednesday, but also a broader shift in American attitudes toward military interventions as the 20-year war in Afghanistan winds down. Biden administration officials, while sympathetic to the humanitarian misery unfolding some 700 miles south of Florida, and mindful of a potential mass exodus of Haitian refugees like one that occurred in the 1990s, nevertheless show no immediate enthusiasm for sending even a limited American force into the midst of politically-based civil strife and disorder. The administration has said it will send officials from the F. B. I. and the Department of Homeland Security to Port-au-Prince to assess how they might help assist the government’s investigation into the murky circumstances of Mr. Moïse’s killing. But Pentagon officials were taken off guard by the Haitian request late Friday. While they said it would be dutifully reviewed, there is little appetite among senior military leaders to dispatch U. S. troops.“We are aware of the request and are analyzing it,” John F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in a telephone interview on Saturday, noting that the request was broad and did not specify numbers or types of forces needed.

394,Longtime Las Vegas exotic pets dealer Ken Foose dies,0.67,44.33,https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/longtime-las-vegas-exotic-pets-dealer-ken-foose-dies-2110586/?itm_source=parsely-api,https://adfontesmedia.com/las-vegas-review-journal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,24,"For more than two decades, Ken Foose provided snakes, lizards, frogs, spiders, turtles and other beasties to Southern Nevadans and others around the world seeking companion animals that didn’t bark, chirp or meow. Foose, who opened Exotic Pets, 2410 N. Decatur Blvd., No. 160, in 1991, died Monday. He was 61. His daughter, Ashley Foose, said the cause of death was a heart attack. David Syzdek, an environmental biologist with the Southern Nevada Water Authority who was friends with Foose for about 25 years, said Foose was “very ethical” in selling exotic animals and wouldn’t sell an animal to a prospective buyer who wasn’t ready to care for it. Foose also was “a brilliant source of knowledge, both with wild and captive animals” and “a great resource for the hobbyist,” Syzdek said.“His store was like visiting the best zoo in the country’s reptile house. There was an incredible variety of animals in the store, just incredible animals from all over the world.“He was a good friend and a real resource in the community. He’ll be missed,” Syzdek said. According to a 2012 profile of Foose on the National Reptile and Amphibian Advisory Council’s webpage, Foose held a master’s degree in zoology from the University of Kansas and served as zookeeper at several zoological parks, as well as, in 1984, a private zoo called Reptiles of the West, before opening his store in Las Vegas. Foose told the Review-Journal in 2016 that he initially wanted to be a cetacean biologist, but he joked that the difficulty of fitting a whale into a 10-gallon aquarium steered him toward herpetology. Foose said that he always has been fascinated with snakes but noted that, as he grew older, he was becoming “more of a turtle and tortoise guy. There’s something very pacifying about a tortoise.”Even after a lifetime of keeping and studying reptiles and amphibians, he still understood the appeal of amateur herpetology. “A 12-year-old kid with a frog in a jar is a herpetologist,” he said. “He’s caring for the animal, he’s feeding the animal, he’s studying the animal. He’s as much of a herpetologist as someone with a college degree.”In 2019, Foose spoke before Nevada lawmakers who were considering a bill to ban private persons from possessing “wild animals,” including “big cats, bears, wolves and primates.” Foose told lawmakers a law was not necessary because “there are very few people keeping these large animals and they keep them safely.”“Horses and livestock kill more people in the world than any other animals combined,” he said. “No one is banning cattle or horses.”But, Foose said, “exotic animals are soft targets and elicit fear … ”In a 2017 story in The New Yorker about reptile trafficking, Foose was cited as a “virtuous” herper (slang for people who search for reptiles) speaking out against the illegal trade of reptiles. The story also called him “a minor celebrity among herpers,” which Foose put into perspective.“If you take your finger and your thumb and you put them about an inch apart, that’s the field I’m a rock star in,” he said. Survivors include Foose’s daughter, Ashley Foose, and son, Isaac Foose. AGoFundMe pagehas been created to raise money for Ken Foose’s memorial and funeral expenses (gofundme.com/f/ken-foose-memorial-and-funeral-expenses). A private memorial service is scheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday. Ashley Foose said persons wishing to attend should call her at 774-823-2622. Contact John Przybys atjprzybys@reviewjournal.com.

395,"As Utah’s coronavirus hospitalizations rise, health officials debate guidance for Thanksgiving",-0.67,49.67,https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/11/18/utah-coronavirus-cases-up/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,25,"Editor’s note:The Salt Lake Tribune is providing free access to critical stories about the coronavirus. Sign up forour Top Stories newsletter, sent to your inbox every weekday morning. To support journalism like this, pleasedonateor become asubscriber. The number of hospitalizations for the coronavirus exploded Wednesday in Utah, with a record-shattering 541 patients concurrently admitted. And with 3,071 new coronavirus cases reported Wednesday, Utah’s rate of new diagnoses continued to rise. For the past week, the state has averaged 3,161 new positive test results a day, continuing a streak of new record highs, the Utah Department of Health reported.“This is really a time of great surge and great importance and urgency to drop the case count,” state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn told state lawmakers on Wednesday. Even as case numbers and hospitalizations continue to rise, Richard Saunders, director of the Utah Department of Health, told the legislative panel Wednesday that he doesn’t expect guidance to change much when officials issue a new public health order after the current one expires Nov. 23. He anticipates thatthe statewide mask mandate put in place earlier this monthwill remain as part of the new health order. But he said no new restrictions are expected on businesses, restaurants, bars or gyms. And it doesn’t appear that the state plans to forbid Thanksgiving gatherings. Saunders said the department is taking a “serious look,” though, at how to regulate social gatherings within the public health order and is “working on wording that deals with whether that social gathering is inside your residence versus outside your residence.”“We’re looking at that as a possible distinction,” he told the state’s Health and Human Services Interim Committee during an update on the coronavirus. “We’re also trying to discern what we specify in the order versus strong recommendations.”Utah’s death toll from the coronavirus stood at 740 Wednesday, with nine fatalities reported since Tuesday and one previous death removed from the count after further investigation. The newly reported deaths include:A Cache County man, age 65 to 84. A Davis County woman, age 65 to 84. Two Salt Lake County women, one age 65 to 84 and the other older than 85. Two Salt Lake County men, one age 65 to 84 and the other older than 85. A Summit County woman, age 65 to 84. A Weber County man, age 65 to 84. A Washington County woman, age 45 to 64. Wednesday marked the end of the virus’ deadliest seven-day stretch since the pandemic began. For now, the state is urging Utahns not to celebrate next week’s Thanksgiving holiday with anyone outside their households as part of an effort to stem the spread of the virus. If families or friends do choose to gather, officials recommend that people keep celebrations small, wear masks and practice physical distancing.“I like to think that if one person at your house was to become positive on Friday morning, how many people would have to be quarantined?” Dunn said. “We want that to be as few people as possible.”Doctors at University of Utah Hospital drew a firmer line, discouraging all Thanksgiving gatherings with anyone outside one’s own household.“Because of the exponential way that the infection spreads, you can have an enormous amplifier effect,” said Dr. Andy Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious disease at the U. The state already has seen large surges of cases after holidays, he said, and “Thanksgiving has the potential to be the scariest one yet.”Utah’s hospitals already are almost full, with staff being stretched thinner and thinner. The 541 Utah patients concurrently admitted were almost 30 more than were being cared for Tuesday. In total, more than 7,100 patients have been hospitalized in Utah for COVID-19, more than 700 of them in the past week. That doesn’t include an all but inevitable spike in hospitalizations in the next two weeks, from the rise in cases this week. And the full consequences of a reckless Thanksgiving in Utah may not be fully visible until January, Pavia said — a development that would be regrettable with such rapid progress on vaccines.“It’s going to take a couple of weeks for any surge that comes out of Thanksgiving to amplify,” he said. “There is an end in sight. It’s not right around the corner, it’s not in January. There’s no reason to risk people’s lives in January when there’s going to be a vaccine available [a few months later].”Even Utahns who believe they have been extremely careful to avoid contracting the coronavirus should stick to their own households for Thanksgiving, said Dr. Carlos Gomez, associate professor of infectious diseases.“We hear that all the time from our patients: ‘We’ve been doing a great job in social isolation,’” Gomez said. “That doesn’t explain the rates in the community. There is a false perception in the public that they are [consistently] doing the right thing. ... Clearly there are breaches.”Pavia agreed.“You’re only as safe as the most cavalier person. You can have done everything absolutely right, but if in that gathering of seven or eight people, one person has ... gotten infected, that in fact puts all of you at risk.”Even those who already have been infected should avoid gatherings, warned Dr. Emily Spivak, an infectious diseases specialist. It’s not known how long immunity lasts after infection.“I would not use that as an excuse to be an outlier” among everyone who is staying home to protect the community, she said. For the past week, 24.1% of all tests have come back positive — far above the 3% positivity rate that state health officials say would indicate the virus is under control. With such a large percentage of tests coming back positive, it is likely that many infected people have not been diagnosed, health officials have said. Thevirus continued to spread most rapidly in Garfield, Sevier and Utah counties, followed by Salt Lake and Wasatch counties. In all five counties, more than one in every 75 people have tested positive in the past two weeks — which means they are considered to have active cases. But the highest concentration of new cases remains in the northern neighborhoods of Orem, where one in every 41 people have tested positive in the past two weeks. Meanwhile, the highest hospitalization rates per capita were in Southwest Utah, according to state data. There were 13,351 new test results reported Wednesday, above the weeklong average of about 12,600 new tests per day. And school-related cases continued to rise to record levels, with nearly 600 new cases among students and employees in the past day, UDOH reported. In the past week, at least 233 teachers have tested positive, and yet another school is entering its second two-week shutdown since fall term began. Brighton High in Canyons School District is closing for two weeks starting starting Wednesday. One possible change to the state’s health guidance could be to ease quarantine requirements for businesses, Saunders said. That could mean someone who was in close contact in a business setting with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 would be able to stop quarantining after seven days with no symptoms and a negative test. Rep. Brad Daw, R-Orem, who attended the interim meeting from home on Wednesday after testing positive for the coronavirus, stressed the infectious nature of the virus and the importance of following public health guidance to prevent its spread.“When my unnamed family member got it, it did not take any length of time for it to spread to everybody else, and it spread very quickly and very thoroughly,” he said. “I think people ought to pay attention to that and realize these guidelines are not there to be mean, they’re there because they’re trying to prevent the spread. As you said before, our hospitals are at capacity. They’re not close. They’re not near. They’re there.”",3,Reliable,0.0972260936895082,0.4353549431598212,1706,3,Salt Lake Tribune

Generally, if you need to really,believe something, you're advised to repeat it to yourself over and over until you internalize it. And so, pundits and Democratic politicians spent days and weeks and months repeatedly warning Americans that there would almost certainly beno winner of the presidential electionon Nov. 3, the long-awaited Election Day in the longest year ever, 2020. No matter how badly we wanted the resolution to come, it simply would not. Such is the nature of a pandemic-year election. Unfortunately, knowing something to be true doesn't always ease the anxiety it brings. And waking up on Nov. 4 to the reality that both President Trump and Joe Biden could still win the White House is unsettling. It begins to feel like an outright emergency when you factor in Trump's declaration, made around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, that he'd in fact won the election — alongside, somehow, the claim that theelection is being stolen away from him. Neither of those statements are true. Trump has not won the election now, nearly seven hours later, and he was not the victor then. There are still hundreds of thousands of votes left to be counted, with outstanding gaps in key battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. The glut of early voting, both in person and by mail, to avoid coronavirus-spreading crowds meant the count would be slower this year, nevermind the fact that virtuallyno state certifies its results on Election Day even in normal times. Wanting a result immediately doesn't make one appear. Such is the nature of a pandemic-year election. Trump, who's never seemed particularly aware that this is a pandemic year to begin with, maliciously disregarded these truisms. ""We will win this. And as far as I’m concerned, we already have,"" he said, alleging falsely that the routine counting of valid ballots constitutes ""major fraud in our nation."" He vowed to stop those votes from being counted in most crucial battleground states that have yet to be called by the major networks — except for Arizona, a state which several outlets agree Biden has won, and which, golly-gee, Trump wants to keep tallying every ballot just in case. Early votes, cast either in person or by mail, are thought to lean heavily Democratic, and the major networks were not always clear what tallies they were referring to as the results started coming in Tuesday night. It led to a lot of uncertainty and confusion, as reputable outlets were showingwildlydifferentprojections of the same state. It's hard enough to count millions of votes in just a few hours; now triple the sources of those votes, between early votes cast in-person, mail-in ballots, and day-of votes and ballot drops, and things get infinitely more complicated. Such is the nature of a pandemic-year election.""We're going to the Supreme Court,"" Trumpvowed, while CNN noted in a perfect chyron that it's ""unclear why."" Biden, for his part, spoke about two hours before Trump did and urged ""patience"" in his Election Day remarks. But he did project confidence, too. ""We believe we're on track to win this election,"" hesaid, but herepeatedthat the result won't be known until ""every ballot is counted.""Ballotsarestillbeingcountedall the while. It looks like the results are tilting in Biden's favor, but it's absolutely not certain. No one can truthfully declare victory yet — which, by the way, is in no small part due toefforts by the president's own partyto suppress votes and make the night a lot more difficult. In the meantime, we're left with an alternate truth: It's outright dangerous to have a leader who refuses to acknowledge a sound democratic process. Some might call it Trump's final slide into full-on authoritarianism. Others have been warning about this for a long, long, long time. You might even call it a mantra.",3,Reliable,0.0823060675883256,0.5026881720430108,890,2,Mic

398,Is It Time for a Woman to Be in Charge? NYC’s Female Mayoral Candidates Discuss Their Platforms,-10.33,44.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/new-york-city-mayoral-race-female-candidates-2021,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-20,23,"New York City has had 108 mayors. Not a single one of them has been a woman—but that could change in 2021 as three female candidates emerge as strong, competitive contenders in the June 22 Democratic primary.“We’re not asking, ‘Can these guys actually do this job?’” says candidate Kathryn Garcia. “But we do ask ‘Can a woman win?’ Every time you have the conversation of viability and notit makes it so people think, ‘Oh, she can’t possibly win.’ Shouldn’t we actually be asking ourselves who’s going to be a good mayor?”Here,meets Garcia, Dianne Morales, and Maya Wiley and hears why—in the midst of a pandemic, economic crisis, and racial reckoning—this is the year for New York City to finally elect a female mayor.“I just felt pulled in to be a very different kind of leader: bold and transformational,” Maya Wiley says of her decision to run for mayor of New York City. A lawyer and civil rights activist, who served as counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio and chaired the Civilian Complaint Review Board from 2016 to 2017, Wiley has a sweeping vision that centers on ending inequality. “Throughout our city’s history, women—especially Black women—have taken on the hard and necessary work of progress,” Gloria Steineim said ata recent campaign event. “And [Maya] is part of that great wave of progress. She is so the woman for this moment.” As it turns out, The Strokes think so, too; the rock band performed a virtual concert fundraiser for Wiley last Saturday.“There are two big things in terms of affordability: One is housing. It is simply too hard for working people to pay the rent and be able to meet their basic needs. I’ve got a plan that is also going to do the other thing, which is to create more and better jobs. I’m going to spend $10 billion in capital construction. That will create 100,000 new jobs, and, at the same time, more affordable housing.”“Women have been decimated in this pandemic.. We know we’ve lost at least a decade's worth of gain in the labor market. Because of the pandemic, women either lost their jobs, or they left jobs because they had to care for their kids. But we [can] shift this focus and look at the care economy as an economy that also can help create more affordability.“Women have been decimated in this pandemic.. We know we’ve lost at least a decade’s worth of gain in the labor market.”“What I'm going to do is, first of all, invest and reallocate money from the Police Department budget, from the Department of Corrections budget, so that we have $5000 grants for family care. I will also create community drop-off centers that are one-stop shop centers for either childcare, elder care, or care for families that have a member with a disability. … That also creates care economy jobs, while we’re creating solutions to one of the most expensive problems families face.”“We had a mental health crisis in this country before COVID, but, boy, did it get worse. Our kids are traumatized, but particularly our kids who’ve been in families that have seen a rise in domestic violence. We’ve seen an astronomical rise in domestic violence, we’ve seen an astronomical rise in rape, and we’ve seen a rise in gun violence—all traumatizing events, obviously, and in addition to COVID and the fear that COVID created. So I’m going to put trauma-informed care in our schools, because we know that trauma-informed care brings violence and discipline issues down, and it also sends graduation rates up.”“We lost 300,000 jobs in the hospitality, nightlife, and arts and culture economy of this city, and that’s over a billion dollars in revenue to our public coffers—not to mention the fact that these are real people with real jobs and families to support. I’ve called on the mayor to create a week-long festival at the end of this summer to show the world that we are back and better than ever. It will be a way to support our arts and culture community at the same time that we’re supporting our small businesses. I’m going to spend $100 million to invest both in grants for the operating costs for our arts and culture institutions and direct grants for our creatives: visual and performing [artists] and writers. Those folks have been punished brutally by COVID in terms of the loss of employment opportunities, and we don’t want them to shutter or be forced out of the city. We want to help get them back on their feet, just like we want to help our small businesses. We have a history of being at the forefront of arts and culture, and we, so we’re going to invest in that. In my capital construction plan, we’re going to create more arts and culture spaces in all five boroughs, but we’re also going to make sure that we have arts back in schools as a core part of the educational program. We have to be investing in our creatives that are being raised right here in New York for thefutureof arts and culture.”“First of all, more than half of the city—52 percent—is female. I was a working mother with two young kids and a mother who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s… I know know the experience of being paid less for the same job. I know what that feels like, what it feels like to fear sexual violence and sexual harassment. Having someone in office who’s had those experiences changes the shape and scope and focus so that it is much more representative of the actual experiences of all New Yorkers.”“I believe in leadership that listens and learns and leads in partnership. I’m not afraid to make decisions—and I will make hard decisions—but they will be informed. I’ll make the call, but I won’t make the call justI know everything I need to know—and I’m certainly not going to be afraid of suggesting there’s something I don’t know—because that’s actually how bad decision-making and bad leadership happens. I think the kind of leadership that we need and that people are desperate for is honest leadership that listens and learns and partners, and that’s the leadership I’ll bring.”“There’s so much I love about New York—so, so much—but if I really boil it down, it’s the. New York is a city of amazing people and diversity and breadth. We have 800 languages spoken here; we have almost 40% of our residents born somewhere else. We have everybody, and it’s just a phenomenal place because of the people make it so.”For years, Dianne Morales, a nonprofit executive who has dedicated her career to helping the working class, brushed aside comments that she should run for office. But, eventually, the political events of 2016 and 2018—coupled with her experience as a woman of color, first-generation college graduate, single mother, and parent of children with learning differences—drove her to finally “shed all the voices in my head that made me think this wasn’t something a woman of color could do,” Morales explains. “All of those things came together in such a way that made me feel like there was something I could bring to the table that was unique... and could be brought to bear at a larger scale to have an impact and make a difference for even more New Yorkers.”“Equity and justice are critical for me; it is the lens through which I view everything in our city. I think about that in terms of access to housing and affordable housing. I think about that in terms of public safety, what that really means for communities. And I think about that in terms of education and the pathways that we are providing to our communities to live in dignity and provide for their families.”“On the housing front, we have centered and prioritized developers and developer profits. My proposal relies on reallocating the investments that we have historically made in these large developers to the community, and prioritizing community-led planning processes and nonprofit affordable housing developers. It includes guaranteed housing for all, including our homeless population and those who are housing-insecure, by really looking at the existing vacant spaces—hotel rooms, storefronts, commercial spaces, and office spaces—and making a commitment to convert those so that we can provide permanent housing. It also includes the expansion of community land trusts so that we can really rebuild communities, and also the commitment to reserve all city-owned land for the creation of affordable housing rather than selling city land to private developers. That’s another practice that I would stop.”“We can’t decouple the recent increase in violence from the increased insecurity that so many New Yorkers have felt over the course of the past year… We have pushed people into these deep states of anxiety and stress at a time when we’re dealing with a global pandemic. I think the critical thing that we need to do to move towards public safety—topublic safety—is to actually provide people with what they need to live in dignity: access to secure housing, enough economic stability that they don’t have to worry about where their next meal is coming from, access to health care in the middle of a global pandemic… These are the things that we need to be prioritizing.“We can’t decouple the recent increase in violence from the increased insecurity that so many New Yorkers have felt over the course of the past year.""“When you think about a safe community, that’s actually what those communities have; they’re not communities that are heavily policed. In fact, communities that are heavily policed are the ones that are most often most harmed, and we know that police are often responding to things that aren’t even crimes. Police don’t prevent crime; they respond to crime—and in many instances, they’re not responding to crimes; they’re responding to social issues of homelessness and mental illness and substance abuse. “I’ve also called for the creation of a community first-responders department that would be staffed with people who are trained and skilled in intervention and de-escalation. It would also serve as a part of a larger ecosystem of human service providers, community-based organizations, medical clinics, and mental health providers, so that people in crisis are actually being connected to something that is going to help break that cycle for them. Now, you see a police officer intervene and, best case scenario, that person is locked up overnight and released the next day back to the exact same situation, or, worst case scenario, that person is harmed or killed. We need to actually have responses that are appropriate to the situation.”“If you look around the world, particularly during the course of the pandemic, the countries that handled this [situation] the best were actually led by women, and I think that’s a reflection of [the fact] that women tend to lead with much less ego, and they tend to lead with much more of a focus on the collective good. We are caretakers whether that’s by nature or by socialization. Even here in this country, I think proportionately women are more effective at getting legislation passed. Maybe that’s because they’re more willing or able to negotiate or compromise. There are indicators that women can be more effective and compassionate leaders, and I think that’s certainly what we need in New York City at this time.”“New Yorkers are, I just think, extraordinary. We’re magical. We’re scrappy. We are colorful and diverse. And we’re fighters. When you think about what we have gone through, from 9/11 on, there is a spirit here of community that transcends even politics at times, and I think that that is a powerful thing. I lived in Boston for seven years and was really, really thrilled to come back home to raise my children here because I wanted them to be a part of the fabric and the dynamic of New York City. There’s nothing like it. We have everything here, and that’s also why I feel like all the fear-mongering around people leaving the city is a false narrative because we are still the greatest city in the world, and this is, I think, a place where everybody would want to be. It’s the best.”“I was watching all of these things that were happening during COVID, and it was trainwreck after trainwreck,” Kathryn Garcia, a Brooklyn-born longterm civil servant and former commissioner of New York City’s Sanitation Department, recalls. “I thought,” During her 14 years of government experience, Garcia got wastewater treatment systems back up and running during Hurricane Sandy and recently led an emergency pandemic food program that has delivered over 200 million meals to New Yorkers in need. Now, in her bid for mayor, she is focusing on bettering the lives of New Yorkers through measures including providing economic relief and greening the city. “If you run government well, the public doesn’t have to think about it,” she says. In a slightly unusual move for a competitor candidate, Andrew Yang has suggested he would hire her were he to be elected. In itsrecent endorsementof Garcia,The New York Timessuggested cutting out “the middleman and elect the most qualified person: Kathryn Garcia.”“It’s about opening up this economy and ensuring that we are giving everyone economic opportunity and economic mobility—getting the fundamentals right. First and foremost, we have to support our small businesses. My Reopen to Stay Open plan is about promoting them, as well as using the public sphere to support them. TheOpen Restaurants programhas been great, but we also need to issue micro loans so that they are here when we all come back.“If you run government well, the public doesn’t have to think about it: Their kids go to a good school, the garbage gets collected, they feel safe.”“If you run government well, the public doesn’t have to think about it: Their kids go to a good school, the garbage gets collected, they feel safe. But it’s also about making it a more livable city: greening the city, making it easier for you to be on a bike, making it easier for restaurants to use the public realm. I fundamentally believe that when you have interesting people who want to stay here, who want to move here, who want to visit here,drives our economy. We have such an interesting city and we should be our own first tourists. We should be the ones who are going to Arthur Avenue or out to Roosevelt Avenue or heading to Staten Island.”“I think the climate challenge is an existential crisis for all of us as humans. I look at the impact of climate resiliency and sustainability in every policy, whether that’s theRenewable Rikers [Act], compost facilities, or electrifying our school buses. We are going to ensure that we are decarbonizing this economy and bringing more renewable power into this city and that we are greening our streetscapes. We are making this a more livable city because that not only helps the planet, but it helps us right now. It’s better for our physical health, it’s better for our mental health, and it also keeps the environment cleaner.”“We are seeing anuptick in crime, as well as a lack of trust in the NYPD. It’s a false choice to say that in order to have respect and equity, you can’t have the police. We have to be able to have both. That means making sure that we’re using our resources to pinpoint where we are seeing crime. And we need to make some reforms. It’s really about holding upper management accountable and making sure that there’s clear and transparent discipline, that we are increasing the age of police officers to 25, that we are requiring them to live within the city. I understand how to do discipline; I did that in Sanitation. You’ve got to be tough but you’ve got to be fair. We’re very clear about what the rules are, and you have to enforce them. Otherwise you can’t be effective at getting your job done. Rebuilding trust with communities is so critical, because without it you can’t solve crime. Ourclearance rateon crime right now is something like 26 percent. We are not solving crime right now, so that is why it’s fundamental that you’ve got to also rebuild the trust with communities.”“You bring your lived experiences. I was a working mom. I know exactly how hard it was to do that in a-pandemic, let alone in a pandemic. Women in general are just better at building teams as managers; that’s been my experience. It is really about the lived experience of being a woman in a workforce, understanding when you’re perceived as not really supposed to be at the table—and men like to interrupt women all the time… Creating a culture that is really about empowering all of those different voices is something that would be very different. The current mayor did hire a lot of women; he just didn’t listen to them.”“I love the fact that New York is a constant surprise, that you go around the corner and there’s someone playing the violin, and—*oh, look!—*there’s that new restaurant that just opened. I love that energy of the street. You literally can just sit at a cafe and the city itself will be entertainment. In some cases, I feel like what perhaps people who aren’t New Yorkers don’t get is that in many ways we’re almost like a small town; you do actually run into people you know. I think they think we’re all in this bubble, but no, because we... But, of course as any good New Yorker will tell you], we pretend that we don’t see the celebrities.”",3,Reliable,0.1617100368767036,0.4202395649617871,3853,3,Vogue

Arlington Heights School District 25 Superintendent Lori Bein discusses possible COVID-19 restrictions and mitigation in District 25 schools for the fall during a district board of education meeting. A sign asking for unvaccinated guests to wear a mask sits at the Arlington Heights School District 25 board of education meeting. Elise Corcoran, 7, addresses the Arlington Heights School District 25 board of education with her mother, Marianne Corcoran, on July 14, 2021. She asked for masks to be optional in the fall. Jack Mungovan, 12, addresses the board during an Arlington Heights School District 25 board of education meeting on July 14, 2021. ""I don't like wearing masks because they make me feel claustrophobic and that makes me feel anxious,"" he said. A sign asks guests to wash their hands during an Arlington Heights School District 25 board of education meeting. Seven-year-old Elise Corcoran stepped up before the Arlington Heights School District 25 board of education Thursday night to deliver her top five reasons why she believes students should not be required to wear masks in the classroom when the new school year begins next month.“When it is hot in the classroom, we sweat and it sticks to our faces,” said Elise, a rising third grader at Dryden Elementary School.“I don’t like wearing masks because they make me feel claustrophobic and that makes me feel anxious,” added Jack Mungovan, 12, a rising seventh grader at Thomas Middle School.“I already lost my first year of middle school to COVID and wearing masks … I really want to be able to experience middle school normally,” Jack said. The pleas of Elise, Jack and the 500 parents who signed an online petition asking that masks be optional in the fall appeared to resonate with the District 25 school board, which voted unanimously Thursday night to give parents at the kindergarten through eighth grade district the choice of whether or not their children wear masks in the classroom in the fall. Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state health department’s recent recommendations that unvaccinated students and staff should continue wearing masks indoors to prevent the spread of the virus, District 25 is among a growing slate of suburban school districts that have passed policies this month that veer from the updated COVID-19 guidance for schools. The updated recommendations arrive at a time when many families are enjoying the state’s loosened restrictions this summer, and some parents are determined that even unvaccinated children should be allowed the same liberties.“We’re getting kids their freedom back,” said Marsha McClary, a mother of five children who attend Barrington Unit School District 220. While the District 220 school board on Tuesdayapproved a plan that gives parents a choice about whether their middle and high school students wear masks in the classroom, officials are still discussing a “phased-in” approach for kids under 12, who are not yet eligible to receive the vaccine.“I understand the need to still wear masks on airplanes, which is no big deal,” McClary said. “But with our kids, we’re talking about five days a week, for more than six hours a day … you can’t see their emotions and their expressions. So much learning has been lost, and it’s going to take a long time to get that back.”Of course, not all parents are in favor of easing mask restrictions, including Alison Thompson,who urged the Naperville District 203 School Board on Mondayto keep students and staff fully masked when classes resume Aug. 16The issue was a hot to pic, with parents arguing their points and stakeholders submitting 46 pages of online comments.“I hate to break it to parents, but it really isn’t a choice individually — it is an all-in situation,” said Thompson, whose youngest daughter has an underlying condition that could put her at risk if she caught COVID-19. Superintendent Dan Bridges asked parents to be patient as the district awaits further state and regional updates on the CDC guidance.“We’ve got what we asked for, we’ve got some guidelines, we’ve got some clarity,” Bridges said. “Once we have some of those questions answered, we will finalize and communicate our plans for the next year.”At Wheaton-Warrenville School District 200, Superintendent Jeff Schuler said in a Thursday parent letter that given the updated guidance, districts can “remove mitigation strategies based on local conditions.”“The board also accepted our recommendation that the first prevention strategy we lift is mandatory mask-wearing at all grade levels, as it offers individuals (both students and staff) and families a choice to continue wearing a face covering should they want to make that choice,” Schuler said.“Our administrators and staff will ensure that our schools remain safe, caring and respectful learning environments that are supportive of an individual’s choice on mask-wearing, As adults, we have an opportunity to model that behavior for our students,” Schuler wrote. Evanston Township High School said in a Thursday email to parents that students and staff who are fully vaccinated do not need to wear a mask indoors at school. Those who are not fully vaccinated must wear a mask indoors at school, and students and staff who are vaccinated “may choose to wear a mask if they wish,” officials said. Meanwhile, officials at Oswego Community Unit School District 308 announced Monday that the district “does not have a masking mandate or policy enforcing the decision for a student or staff member to wear or not wear a mask while in person at school/work,” adding that masks are only required on school buses. Officials said the district does not have a policy requiring students and staff to disclose their COVID-19 vaccination status, and “the district will not tolerate the bullying of individuals for wearing or not wearing a mask.”Some experts warn that the easing of COVID-19 restrictions at schools in the fall is premature, especially given that the highly contagious delta variant is now the predominant virus circulating in the U. S.“It’s very risky to allow individual school boards to determine mask/social distancing policy on their own without justification,” said Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. While Murphy said kids do not typically get very ill with COVID-19 when infected, “some do get very ill, and more importantly, they can bring the virus home to their relatives and friends, essentially feeding the cycle.”“These numbers are not going in the right direction,” he added.“Loosening mask requirements for any unvaccinated group, including schoolchildren, is very risky and will aggravate the ability to control the pandemic and lead to more infections, more hospitalizations and deaths,” Murphy said. Officials at the Illinois Education Association, a state teachers union, last week showed support for strictly following the updated CDC and Illinois Department of Public Health guidance.“Both agencies are correct that vaccines are the best way to keep students and staff safe and for those who can’t get vaccinated, wearing a mask is the next best option,” IEA President Kathi Griffin said. Indeed, even officials at school districts that have established policies that make masking a choice rather than a requirement are well aware of the unpredictability of the virus.“This directive is subject to change based upon changes in applicable factors including an increase in COVID-19 rates or revised public health guidance,” officials with Oswego Community Unit School District 308 said. Back in Arlington Heights, District 25 Superintendent Lori Bein also underscored the importance of parents, students and staff remaining flexible, and understanding that depending upon the community’s COVID-19 rates, the mask choice decree could be rolled back. Bein said the district had zero COVID-19 cases among 850 students enrolled in summer school, and expressed her confidence that the district’s eight schools can fully reopen to pre-pandemic normalcy, including the restoration of all clubs and activities, lunch in the multipurpose room and even field trips. Still, Bein acknowledged she is “not a medical expert,” and despite her faith in the layered mitigation strategies and low virus rates in the district and community, “if we see a jump, we’ll move back to masks.”“We all hope we don’t have to do that, but if we see students and staff are getting sick, or at risk, we do need to come back and talk about that,” she said.

401,Voices of San Quentin: The inside story of how a prison became the nation's biggest COVID cluster,-10.0,44.75,https://popular.info/p/voices-of-san-quentin-the-inside,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,18,"An aerial view of San Quentin State Prison. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)San Quentin State Prison hit a grim milestone this month: it recorded its 25th prisoner death from COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, prisons and correctional facilities have been some of the largest virus hot spots. Today, the 10 biggest clusters of COVID-19 infections in the United States are in prisons and jails, according todatafrom The New York Times. Astudyfrom John Hopkins University and UCLA found U. S. prisoners are 5.5 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and three times more likely to die than the general population. Located just north of San Francisco, San Quentin is currently the largest cluster of cases in the nation, with 2,608 confirmed casesaccordingto the New York Times. In less than three months, the virus infected almost 70% of San Quentin’s prison population. Experts believe this public health disaster was completely preventable. For months, San Quentin managed to avoid an outbreak. But when the virus arrived at the deteriorating facility, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s (CDCR) inadequate response made the situation drastically worse. In recent weeks, the number of new cases at San Quentin have started to slow down. Though this is encouraging, it does not mean that the prison has figured out how to control the spread of the virus. Most inmates at San Quentin have already contracted COVID-19. The factors that led to this disaster in the first place – a combination of negligent leadership and deteriorating prison conditions – persist. In the past 14 days, the CDCR reports San Quentin added13 new cases, bringing the number of active cases in custody to 76. But these numbers are likely an underestimation. Voices of San Quentin (VOS) reports that some prisoners are refusing testing out of fear of being forced to move cells or placed into solitary confinement. Months later, the virus is both a haunting memory and a continuing threat. Until the beginning of June, there had been virtually no coronavirus cases at San Quentin – a remarkable feat considering that the virus beganrampaging throughprisons and jails as early as March. Then, on May 30, the CDCR transferred 121 prisoners from the California Institution for Men in Chino to San Quentin. At the time, Chino had the largest recorded outbreak of any California prison. To curb the virus’s spread, prison officials decided to transfer medically vulnerable prisoners to COVID-free facilities. When prisoners at San Quentin became aware of this plan, they were worried. Christopher Scull, who was incarcerated at San Quentin at the time, told VOS that when he asked the warden, “Isn’t that where the COVID-19 outbreak is?” the warden responded, “Yes, but I can’t stop these buses from arriving.”San Quentin’s residents had their worst fears confirmed. Aside from temperature checks,noneof the Chino prison transfers, including four who had shown virus symptoms before getting off the bus, were tested in the weeks prior to or upon arriving at San Quentin. The transfers werenot quarantined, according to The San Francisco Chronicle. Instead, the newly arrived inmates were placed in poorly ventilated cells before being distributed throughout the prison. Less than a week later, San Quentin began reporting its first cases: 15 of the prisoners who transferred from Chino were infected with the coronavirus,according tothe Chronicle. Within two weeks, the number of daily active cases at San Quentin ballooned from 15 to 498. By the end of June, daily active cases had surged to 1,509, and peaked at 1,635 on July 7. What was once a COVID-free facility, became a disaster zone. When the virus began to circulate, the prison cancelled all activities. Hot meals were halted, a 23-hour lockdown was imposed, and residents were forced to choose between taking a shower or making a phone call every three to five days. But these efforts weren’t enough to stop the spread of the virus at the overcrowded and poorly maintained facility. Prisons are not designed to withstand public health threats, especially when spacing people out is a requisite. In California, most prisons are dangerously overcrowded and San Quentin is no exception. Before the arrival of COVID-19, San Quentin was operating at118%overcapacity. With most men sharing cells (many as small as 4-by-9 feet), shower stalls, and phones, it is practically impossible to practice social distancing. San Quentin is also California’s oldest prison and suffers from years of neglect. “Given the unique architecture and age of San Quentin (built in the mid 1800s and early 1900s), there is exceedingly poor ventilation, extraordinarily close living quarters, and inadequate sanitation,”wroteUC Berkeley and UCSF health experts after visiting the prison on June 13. Strapped for space, officials moved those who tested positive or were exposed to someone who tested positive to solitary confinement as cases began ticking up. “It’s like being punished because they have the virus,” said Al Fredericks, who was formerly incarcerated at San Quentin, to VOS. Eventually, by July, the prison set up tents in the yard to house infected residents. In some cases, prison officials locked in infected residents with non-infected cellmates, residents told VOS.“If you had a cellie and he’s positive and you’re not, they’re gonna lock both of you in there,” said Chanthon Bun, who was released early from San Quentin in July, to VOS. Currently, residents can only leave their cells every three days for a specified time period to shower, make phone calls, and, if they still have enough time, exercise in the yard. Experts warn that these measures are not sustainable. Cells at San Quentin are not meant to be occupied for days on end; under normal circumstances, residents would be spending the majority of their time outside of their cells.“This breakout is so severe, they've got us on full lockdown. I'm getting out my cell once maybe every three days for a shower and a phone call. The rest of the time I'm locked in. I'm talking about completely locked in with another man,” said San Quentin resident Rahsaan Thomas on August 5. “So it's like living in a bathroom with another person. And the thing about San Quentin, it has the tiniest cells of any prison.”Moreover, due to contraband policies, access to antiseptic products like hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies is heavily restricted. While the prison has taken steps to install sanitizer dispensers in some units, it is still unclear if these products are widely accessible. When Popular Information inquired if the prison was distributing hand sanitizer and disinfectants, VOS shared that one San Quentin resident replied “What hand sanitizer? What disinfectant?” He shared that over the course of five months, he had only seen these products twice. Unable to practice basic sanitation, prisoners are left practically defenseless against the virus. A few weeks ago, the CDCRreportedthat tents set up to house infected patients were “decommissioned due to significant reduction in cases.” This sharp decline is promising. But anecdotes from the inside reveal that little has changed.“I feel like they’re trying to let everybody catch it so they could say, OK, everybody got it here so we can just resume,” said Brian Asey, a prisoner at San Quentin, to VOS. While cases at San Quentin have declined, CDCR data shows that there have been 1,159 new confirmed cases in California prisons in the last two weeks. Five prisons reported more than 100 new cases. One prison, CA Correctional Institution, reported 211 new cases over the past 14 days. Other facilities nationwide are also suffering a surge in cases. According to atrackermaintained by The Marshall Project, there were at least 3,808 new cases in Florida and 1,427 in Texas reported among prisoners the week of August 11. Moreover, these outbreaks don’t just endanger incarcerated populations; they impact correctional officers, medical staff, kitchen cooks, chaplains, and hundreds of other workers who enter in and out of prisons each day. Earlier this month, the first San Quentin employee died of COVID-19. CDCR datarevealsthat a total of 272 San Quentin staff have tested positive for the virus. When an outbreak occurs at a prison, it can spread and quickly compromise a community’s public health capacity. When public health experts toured the San Quentin facilities in June, they recommended “that the prison population at San Quentin be reduced to 50% of current capacity via decarceration” and added that “even further reduction would be more beneficial.”During a press conference, California State Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) explained that decarceration efforts were a long time coming: “This is a humanitarian disaster that is compounding another humanitarian disaster called mass incarceration. And we need to be very, very clear that what's happening in San Quentin and what may happen if we don't really change things at other prisons. It's not just because of COVID-19. It's because the state of California for 40 years now has been completely addicted to incarcerating more and more people for longer and longer sentences. And it doesn't have to be that way.”Since March, the CDCR has reduced California’s prison population by more than 10,400. Governor Gavin Newsom (D) also announced that 8,000 prisoners across California will be released early by the end of this month. But some believe this step is not nearly aggressive enough. Philip Melendez, a decarceration advocate,tellsBloomberg Citylab that releasing 8,000 people would shrink the state’s prison population by only 7%.

403,WH Offers No Update on Biden Proposal to Restore Cuba Internet,14.0,36.67,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/23/eight-days-later-joe-biden-still-exploring-options-on-restoring-cubas-internet/,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"President Joe Biden is still exploring options to restore Internet access to Cuba after the regime shut it down on July 11, the White House claimed on Friday. The Communist government of CubacutInternet access on the island in response to protests that began that day,preventingprotesters from communicating or organizing as the political uprising for freedom continues. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not have an update to the president’s claim last Thursday that he was exploring the possibility of the United States intervening by offering restored Internet access to the country.“They’ve cut off access to the Internet,” Biden said during a press conference last week. “We’re considering whether we have the technology to reinstate that access.”Biden spoke about the idea after Governor Ron DeSantis and other Florida Republicanssenta letter urging him to explore options.“The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth, and if we are able to help Cubans communicate with one another and with the outside world, that truth is going to matter,” DeSantis wrote. But Biden still has not acted. When asked for an update to the president’s promise — and if the administration would consider using high-tech balloons to provide Cubans with Internet access, Psaki replied, “I wish it was that easy.”“We are exploring a range of options. We are quite focused and interested in restoring internet access to the people of Cuba,” she added. Psaki did not explain why the United States had not yet acted to help Cubans restore Internet access, but endorsed the idea.“We feel if we could get it done it would be a great step forward and beneficial to the people of Cuba,” she said. Biden faces continued criticism for being too slow to react to Cuba’s protests and remaining unwilling to act definitively to assist the movement. Former President Donald Trump criticized Biden’s reaction to the protests during aninterviewwith Telemundo.“I think he’s from a different planet; he doesn’t understand the plight of the people of Cuba,” Trump said, referring to Biden. “What this administration is doing is just going to prolong it [the Castro regime].”",2,Generally Reliable,0.118923611111111,0.3222222222222222,466,1,Breitbart
404,What will cable news do without President Trump?,-11.67,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-will-cable-news-do-without-president-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,24,"Greetings from stormy St. Petersburg, Florida. Tropical Storm Eta rolled through the Tampa Bay area as I was writing this newsletter, so hopefully the words aren’t blowing off the screen. A tropical storm and Christmas music on the radio at the same time? Yep, it’s 2020. There’s no question that President Donald Trump has been a ratings booster for cable TV news. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC are enjoying some of their best ratings ever. To be clear, there are other factors for why folks are interested in the news these days, including a once-in-a-hundred year pandemic. It also should be noted that on a good night, the big three cable news networks draw fewer than 15 million viewers in primetime — decent for TV, but a pretty low number compared to the overall population. Still, the Trump presidency has been good for business. He tweets. He rants. He raves. And the cable news outlets eat it up. But, Variety’s Brian Steinberg writes, “There’s palpable concern the spotlight may fade with the departure of President Donald Trump and the arrival of President-elect Joe Biden.”So what will happen when Trump is no longer president?There are different theories. One is that interest in the news will remain high, so even with a Biden presidency, ratings will continue to thrive. Plus, the major news story — coronavirus — will remain a story that Americans must follow, perhaps for another year, if not longer. But as far as politics and the White House, the cable news outlets might see a drop in viewership. In a recent earnings call, Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch said, “I would expect as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for the great American pastimes of watching football, and watching baseball, and watching ‘The Masked Singer’ or ‘I Can See Your Voice,’ and we look forward to that shift.”A “more normal news cycle” would mean no coronavirus and a president who isn’t constantly elbowing his way into the news cycle. Lachlan, however, thinks Fox News will continue to lead in cable news viewership.“What we aim to control is share,” Murdoch said on the earnings call. “And I strongly believe and we’ve seen this through, I think, now 18 years, off the top of my head, of different administrations and different political cycles, we’ve maintained our No. 1 position through all of that. … So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be No. 1 and maintain share through that.”That, perhaps, is true. There is plenty of speculation about what will happen to Fox News, a favorite among conservatives and right-leaning viewers. On one hand, maybe a Biden presidency isn’t the worst thing ever. Primetime pundits such as Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham can rail on Biden and his policies for the next four years. Complaining about Biden might be better programming than had Trump remained president with no election on the horizon. On the other hand, Trump supporters might quickly grow tired of being reminded every night that their favorite president did not win the election — and complaining about the other guy will soon grow old. Think of it like fans of a sports team. They can complain about a loss on sports-talk radio right after the game, but they don’t want to keep harping on it for weeks and months on end. After a while, it just becomes depressing. There are other wrinkles to consider. Might Trump start his own network or throw his support behind a place such as OAN? Is CNN boss Jeff Zucker going to leave CNN and what might that mean?But let’s also give credit to the cable news networks. They are run by smart people and have charismatic primetime personalities. We can assume they adjust what they have to attract viewers. And, hey, 2024 isn’t that far away. The New York Times building. (mpi43/MediaPunch /IPX)There are many reasons why The New York Times is such an outstanding news organization. But here’s a perfect example of what makes them so good. With all this talk about election fraud coming from the White House, The New York Times rolled up its sleeves, picked up the phone and went to work. The headline says it all:“The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud.”The Times’ Nick Corasaniti, Reid J. Epstein and Jim Rutenberg wrote, “… top election officials across the country said in interviews and statements that the process had been a remarkable success despite record turnout and the complications of a dangerous pandemic.”They also wrote, “The New York Times contacted the offices of the top election officials in every state on Monday and Tuesday to ask whether they suspected or had evidence of illegal voting. Officials in 45 states responded directly to The Times. For four of the remaining states, The Times spoke to other statewide officials or found public comments from secretaries of state; none reported any major voting issues.”Jeffrey Toobin (Photo: PGDC/MediaPunch /IPX)Jeffrey Toobin has been fired from The New Yorker. During a video call last month with staffers of The New Yorker and WNYC radio, Toobin reportedly exposed himself. Following an investigation, Conde Nast, which owns The New Yorker, announced Wednesday that he has been let go. In a memo to staffreviewed by The New York Times, Conde Nast’s chief people officer, Stan Duncan, said, “I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matters seriously. We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds our standards of conduct.”Toobin announced his firing on Twitter, writing, “I was fired today by @NewYorker after 27 years as a Staff Writer. I will always love the magazine, will miss my colleagues, and will look forward to reading their work.”Toobin also has been suspended from his job and is on leave as a legal analyst for CNN.

Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia called on the state’s secretary of state to resign, citing “failures” in the election process. However, they did not offer any specific evidence to support their claims. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution pushed back hard, doing something pretty much unheard of. It put an editorial above the front-page banner. You can see what it looked like byclicking here. The AJC editorial read, “Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue have assaulted Georgia’s election system. That is dangerous behavior, both for this state and for the nation. Speaking on the record, Purdue and Loeffler offered no specifics. And that is what makes their campaign-speak attack message so unacceptable. Georgians are wise enough to recognize these antics. And Purdue, Loeffler and others should know better.”NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell speaks with former Defense Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday. (Photo courtesy of NBC News.)Why is it so important that President Donald Trump concede the election and that a transition to President-elect Joe Biden gets underway? Here’s a helpful quick explainer from MSNBC’s Katy Tur, who said this on her show Wednesday:“They do have the benefit of Biden previously being in the White House and knowing some of the lay of the land. But I was talking to a senior administration official who was telling me that part of the big problem is not that Biden knows what he’s doing, it’s that they can’t look at the various agencies, see how they are staffed and who needs to be plugged in. They also can’t start the process of the national security background checks, which can take a long time. So that should be unnerving for any American who wants to see a seamless transition of power.”Tur asked Associated Press White House reporter Jonathan Lemire how much longer senior White House officials will continue “soothing the president” before pushing Trump to concede and begin a transition.“This is important,” Lemire said. “This shouldn’t just be about soothing the hurt feelings of a president who lost. … National security is at stake here. There is a surging, out-of-control pandemic in many states right now. And (Trump’s refusal to concede) is slowing everything down, not handing over the keys, so to speak.”Lemire said sources he talked to said this can’t go on forever, but they don’t see it ending anytime soon. It could end after Thanksgiving or maybe not even until the electoral college meets in mid-December. Meanwhile, on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” former Defense Secretary William Cohen called Trump’s refusal to concede “completely inappropriate … reckless and it’s consistent with how Donald Trump has conducted the presidency.”He added, “When you don’t help the incoming administration protect the country then you have failed in your duty. You have failed royally, if I can use the word royal, because the president wants to act like a royal, that everyone else is in his court and they must pay obeisance and pay tribute to him.”MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki talks with Savannah Sellers. (Photo: courtesy of NBC News.)One of the stars of election week TV coverage was CNN’s John King, who spent most of the week on his feet and wearing out CNN’s Magic Wall. My Poynter colleague Amaris Castillo caught up with King for agood Q&Athat you should check out. King told Castillo, “I am a mix of exhausted and excited. The election results are clear, but there is so much news and uncertainty — from the Trump refusal to concede to the continued counting of ballots to the Biden transition launch and the horrific COVID surge. So sleep has to wait a bit longer. That’s OK. It is a dramatic news story and at a very consequential moment, so this is why we do this — and sleep and rest can wait.”John King wasn’t the only big board star during election week. How about MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki?NBC News’ Savannah Sellers went to the big boardto get the lowdown from Kornacki, including questions for Kornacki from Chrissy Teigen. The most pressing questions?Gabriel Escobar has been named top editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer. Escobar had been editor and vice president — second in charge in the newsroom — since 2017. The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Anna Orso and Jesenia De Moya Correa wrote about Escobar: “A former foreign correspondent, he is respected inside and outside The Inquirer as a skilled journalist and an even-keeled manager, as well as a deep listener always armed with a notepad.”Escobar replaces executive editor Stan Wischnowski, who resigned in June after a controversial headline — “Buildings Matter, Too” — in the wake of protests about race. That headline led to the Inquirer doing some soul-searching about the culture in its newsroom and how it covers issues involving race. After Wischnowski resigned, Inquirer Publisher and CEO Lisa Hughes said the company would conduct a national search to replace him, according to the Inquirer. But she stayed in-house by naming Escobar. She told The Inquirer that Escobar is “a seasoned leader who embodies our values, embraces our shared strategy, and understands the diversity of the communities we serve.”The Inquirer wrote, “Escobar, who was born in Colombia, will be one of the highest-ranking Latinos at a U. S. news organization.”Here’s something political and election junkies might enjoy. The Tampa Bay Times is hosting a video chat with journalists today at noon Eastern called “Election 2020: Where do we go from here?” The Times describes it as a “discussion about the election and what it means for our region, state and country.”If you want to listen in,click here.

Much of the state is on a power grid distinct from the rest of the country toavoidfederal regulation and, as cold temperaturesslowed downnatural gas production, millions were left without power and heat. Texas governor Greg Abbott went on Fox Newson Tuesday 16 February tosaythat the episode demonstrates why fossil fuels are necessary and to slam the Green New Deal, a policy proposal put forth by progressives to combat climate change. Yet wind powermakesup only a small percentage of energy production in Texas and Abbott later walked back on the statement. Abbott next proceeded to blame the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the nonprofit that oversees the state’s power grid. Abbottsaidit had been “anything but reliable” and that he would call on the state legislatures to review the company’s preparations and decisions. But a future investigation does little to change the fact that the state governmentfailedto prepare for a storm. They had been warned by a federal report following a significant storm a decade ago to develop the state infrastructure for winter – yet the state left the decision of whether or not to upgrade equipment to power companies, which chose immediate profit over long-term security. Not only do hundreds of thousands of people consequently still not have the resources they need to stay warm, but crisis is begetting crisis. So many Texans are dripping water to keep frozen pipes from bursting that cities havewarnedthat water levels are now so low that the water may be unsafe to drink. Communities have tried to step in where the state has not. Volunteers in the city of Austinpaidfor hotel rooms and delivered food to the homeless. A nonprofit in Houston called the Texas Relief Warriorscookedfor those in need, and a Dallas recycling centre offered up firewood. Some bought up sandwiches for the express purpose of giving them away to those who were suffering most from the blackout. It is, of course, heartwarming to hear that, even amidst a storm and power outages, people have found ways to help those in still greater need than themselves. But just as GoFundMe isnota substitute for health insurance, the charity of volunteers and neighbours is not a policy solution. On Thursday 18 February, meanwhile, it wasreportedafter hours of speculation that Ted Cruz, one of Texas’s two senators, had left the state on a flight for Cancun, Mexico. In 2013, Cruz alsoopposedrelief for Superstorm Sandy, the weather event that hit Democratic-voting states, and has previouslytweetedmockingly of Californian power outages.

406,"The House Just Passed H.R. 8, a New Gun-Control Bill — Here's What It Would Do",-7.33,44.0,https://www.popsugar.com/news/hr-8-gun-control-bill-explained-48214555,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-12,25,"On Thursday, March 11,the Housepassed two gun-control bills that wouldtighten regulations on commercial gun salesby expanding background checks. The two bills are H. R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, andH. R. 1446, otherwise known as the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021 — and many are applauding the steps towardgun restrictions. If you're feeling a bit confused about the exact details of the H. R. 8 bill, we've broken down exactly what it means for the country and what is still needed to set the legislation in place. If passed in the Senate, H. R. 8 would expand background checks and tighten gun-sale regulations. Specifically, theBipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021would broaden background checks for all firearm sales or transfers across the country. Right now, these checks are not required for gun sales or transfers by private sellers,known as the Gun Show Loophole. This bill would also apply to online purchases. By closing the Gun Show Loophole, H. R. 8 would expand background checks in these cases, making it illegal for anyone who is not a manufacturer, dealer, or licensed firearm importer to trade or sell guns, with current laws requiring background checks only for licensed firearm dealers. That being said, as reported by, nonlicensed individuals can still sell or trade guns by doing so through a licensed dealer who would run background checks for them. The H. R. 8 bill would also not create any other kinds of background checks, it would simply expand the cases where they would be necessary. Also, the bill still allows temporary trading and sharing of firearms at shooting ranges, on hunting trips, or wherever it is necessary to prevent ""imminent death or great bodily harm.""Although it will be difficult to get the H. R. 8 bill past the Senate,where it needs at least 60 votes to go to the president to sign, the Democrat majority in both chambers of Congress has paved the way for the passing of this bill in the House — eight Republicans supported H. R. 8, while just one Democrat opposed it. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has committed to getting H. R. 8 on the floor of the Senate for a vote. In a press conference, Schumer said, ""Last time, [H. R. 8] went into Mitch McConnell's legislative graveyard. The legislative graveyard is over. H. R. 8 will be on the floor of the Senate and we will see where everybody stands."" He continued, ""No more thoughts and prayers — a vote is what we need.""Moreover, the White House has also made it more than clear that President Joe Bidenis prioritizing gun control. Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden is ""not afraid of standing up to the [National Rifle Association]"" and has advocated for ""smart gun safety measures."" As the president is committed to passing stricter gun control, outlined in his owngun-policy plans, getting the bills passed in the Senate will be the hurdle to overcome.",3,Reliable,0.0114087301587301,0.4794501133786847,649,2,Popsugar

Orange’s public schools started classes Aug. 10, with everyone studying online. Campuses will open Friday, as planned, for those students whose parents chose that option, the board decided after a more than five hour meeting. Board members, some of them in tears, said they decided to stick with the initial plan so that children who want in-person instruction, and the other services schools provide, can get it as scheduled.“They need to be back in the classroom,” said Chair Teresa Jacobs. “I want to stick to what we committed to.”Last week, the district’s medical advisory panel said the school district should consider opening elementary schools this week but keeping the others closed until Aug. 31. At the meeting, board members heard from lots of parents frustrated that the board might change school plans but also from some teachers who wanted that advice followed because they are fearful about returning to campuses this week because of the coronavirus pandemic. The vote to open all campuses as planned on Friday was 6 to 2, with Jacobs and board members Melissa Byrd, Karen Castor Dentel, Kat Gordon, Pam Gould and Linda Kobert voting in favor. Board members Angie Gallo and Johanna Lopez voted against, both saying they saw value in delaying the start of middle and high schools. The board heard more than two hours of public comment, then asked questions of staff.“This is one of the most difficult decisions we’ll probably every make,” Kobert said, adding the community was divided and no choice was ideal. In the end, she said she thought it was better not to shift starting dates again, as the district did once before when it decided to start online classes last week, upsetting many parents. “Another change is just too much,” she said. “It’s just too much.”Castor Dentel said she could see the value in pushing back the start of middle and high schools but wasn’t sure a week or so would do enough to improve campus safety while it would be “upending plans people have made.”About 30% of the district’s 212,000 students, or about 63,000 youngsters, are expected to start in-person classes this week while the rest continue their virtual lessons. At Monday’s meeting, many parents told the board they were upset it would reconsider a start date it had already approved. They want their children on campus and want that option to start Friday, as the board agreed to in July.“I’m not sure why we’re having the meeting,” said parent Chip Herron.“You made a decision,” he said. “You gave options to all parents. … We expect that our face-to-face option be honored.”Some said a week of virtual lessons through the district’s LaunchEd system — where students take live, online classes — had proved to them that option was a poor choice for their kids. One single mother said her children could not manage at home without her help, and her job would not allow her to skip any more work.“I don’t have any more time off,” she said. But some, including several teachers, urged the board to delay reopening campuses, saying it was not yet safe.“We are not your martyrs,” one ninth-grade teacher said, adding that face-to-face instruction this year also won’t look as it did before schools shut down in mid March. Classrooms are bare, she said, and students will be mostly working on their laptops. Group work and “awesome cool activities” that would put them together or have them share supplies won’t be allowed, and instructors will be “staying as far away as possible” from their students. But the bulk of Monday’s nearly 70 speakers said they wanted campuses to open Friday. Elise Breth, a Maitland mother, said it wasn’t fair to delay an option that so many parents thought was best for their children.“You represent all of us, not some of us,” Breth said. “Thousands of families feel they are not being heard or represented.”Another father said online schooling was too much for his first grader, who did not want to be on a computer all day and missed interacting with friends and teachers.“Sitting in front of a device … is absolutely not conducive to effective learning,” he said, and it requires regular parent help.“They are not able to trouble shoot when technical issues arrive,” he added. The district’s medical advisory committee, which includes pediatricians and infectious disease specialists, recommended staggering the openings at its meeting last Friday, but it also said that might not be doable. Delaying middle and high school students’ return to campuses could give community spread of the coronavirus time to decline, and school administrators time, with a smaller group, to learn how to manage school operations amidst concerns about COVID-19, doctors on the panel said. Younger children also are less likely to spread the virus, making their return less risky, they said.lpostal@orlandosentinel.com",3,Reliable,0.1096239763122879,0.3943879929594214,1106,3,Orlando Sentinel
408,Trump’s impact on Indian Country over four years,-11.67,42.67,https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-trumps-impact-on-indian-country-over-four-years,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-16,16,"When President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, many tribal leaders took await-and-see approach, given hispoor record on Indigenous affairs. Four years later, Indian Country has weathered a failed pandemic response, budget cuts and diminished environmental regulations. Over the span of his administration, many leadership positions in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Interior Department wereleft emptyor filled by appointees never vetted by Congress. The annual White House Tribal Nations Conference, held by President Barack Obama for eight years,ceased. Trump’s three Supreme Court justices include one witha solid understandingof federal Indian law and the U. S government’s responsibility to tribes, as well as one whose judicial perspectives areactively harmful. In the first year of his administration, Trump made his priorities clear with a series of memos and executive orders repealing protections for land and wildlife. His “America First” energy planexpeditedcontroversial projects like the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, which faced monumental, sustained opposition by Native nations and their allies. Hereducedthe newly established Bears Ears National Monument by 85%, a monument whose creation had been Indigenous-led and centered. “Trump took the position against Native people first thing in office,” said Matt Campbell, staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund and enrolled member of the Native Village of Gambell. “So, I think that set the tone early on for the relationship.”Trump’s policy directives also reduced environmental protections. Federal laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act enable tribes to give input on large-scale projects on their ancestral lands. Under Trump, these were weakened. “The total onslaught of federal rule rollbacks under environmental laws was like nothing we’ve ever seen. It was dizzying,” said Gussie Lord (Oneida Nation of Wisconsin), managing attorney of tribal partnerships at Earthjustice. “It resulted in not only a weakening of substantive environmental protection, but was also a real attack on public participation and access to information.”And then, the pandemic: As Senate aides told the,tribal nations were not initially included in the first COVID-19 relief package. Even when $10 billion wasallocatedto tribal nations, distribution was held up for months, withholding critical aid for personal protective equipment, financial aid and testing. “This administration’s record is one of repeated failures for Native communities,” said Sen. Tom Udall, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, in a statement. “The truth is the White House is actively undermining Tribal sovereignty across the country and mishandling a once-in-a-century pandemic that is disproportionately hurting Native communities.”The ramifications are still being felt inthe current waveof COVID-19 infections and deaths. Nationwide, thousands are dying daily. The Navajo Nation, which saw a devastating rise in COVID cases and deaths in the summer, has begun to see the numbers go up again,according to reportingby the. Meanwhile, theCARES Act funding deadlineof Dec. 30 looms.“Tribes have been pushed aside by this administra-tion.”“Tribes have been pushed aside by this administration,” said Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nezduring a speechto the Democratic National Convention in August, saying the difference between the Trump and Obama administrations was “night and day.” Even so, at the Republican National Convention, Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizerspoke in supportof Trump. Many of the decisions over the last four years will have a lasting impact on Indian Country no matter how quickly the new Biden/Harris administration works to reverse them:What started as a campaign-rally promise has resulted in 423 miles of steel walls cutting through the borderlands landscape. The vast majority of those miles already had some kind of barrier, but those newly-added came at a high cost. In Guadalupe Canyon, Arizona, a five-mile stretch that required blasting through rockcost $41 million per mile. Tribal nations like the Tohono O’odham have been clear about their opposition to the construction, which has damaged important natural and cultural sites with no consultation process. “The Trump administration’s reckless disregard for our religious and constitutional rights is embodied in the dynamite and bulldozers now rumbling through our original homelands,” wrote Tohono O’odham Nation Chairman Ned Norris Jr.in. Although Trump signed two bills that federally recognized a total of seven tribal nations, his Interior Department alsowithdrew a legal opinionmeant to help tribes regain ancestral lands,and sought todisestablishreservation lands of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. A federal judge called thelegal memorandumwritten by Interior in Mashpee’s case “incomprehensible” and described it as “one of the worst written documents I’ve ever read from any government agency.”In addition to pushing an oil and gas agenda, Trump removed the U. S. from the Paris Agreement in 2017, even as tribal nationsannounced their intention to upholdthe terms of the agreement. In the meantime, tribes have made strides on their own. This year, five tribal nations called for a U. N. investigation of the possible human rights violation shown by the United States’lack of response and actionto climate-related crises, noting the lack of assistance for coastal communities forced to relocate to higher ground by rising sea levels. The Trump administration’s actions have not slowed in its final months, as its agencies continue to fast-track politically fraught projects. In November, the U. S. Forest Service decided to repeal protections on the Tongass National Forest that kept new logging, mining and hydroelectric dams to a minimum. None of the Southeastern Alaska Native tribes involved supported such a move, and by the end all 11 had resigned from participating in the Forest Service process. Meanwhile, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, despite opposition from Alaska Native tribes and the Gwich’in Steering Committee. In Arizona, the San Carlos Apache Tribe has rejected a U. S. Forest Service land swap that would allow copper mining in an area called Chi’chil Bildagoteel, or Oak Flat, which has important religious and cultural sites. Even though the Forest Service on Dec. 1 moved thefinal decisiondate from April 2021 to Dec. 30, the agency said it “does not reflect an acceleration.”Some of this could be undone by incoming President Joe Biden, orby Congress. Other decisions made by officials in an “acting” capacitycould be invalidated. But precious time has already been lost when it comes to addressing the climate crisis, and the lives that were lost in the worst public health crisis in a generation cannot be regained. On Nov. 8, less than a week after Election Day, the National Congress for American Indians held itsannual meeting,this year focused ontruth and reconciliationand the incoming administration. “We demand a reconciliation back to those basic foundational principles upon which this country was built — principles like justice, like equality, like liberty, like the freedom to just live as our ancestors have lived from when time began,” NCAI President Fawn Sharp (Quinault) said. “Only then can we begin a healing process as a country and as a nation.”High Country News.

409,"Ted Cruz floated flat-out lies about Kristen Clarke. Welp, Senate Democrats aren't bothered",-9.67,41.0,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/5/19/2031160/-Ted-Cruz-floated-flat-out-lies-about-Kristen-Clarke-Welp-Senate-Democrats-aren-t-bothered,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-kos-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-19,24,"Kristen Clarke, a longtime voting rights advocate, is well on her way to becomingthe first woman and the first woman of color to lead the U. S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division since it was created in 1957.""The U. S. Senate has voted 50-48 to advance the nomination of @KristenClarkeJD to serve as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights,"" the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fundtweetedon Tuesday. ""The next step is a confirmation vote by the Senate.”And with Democratic control in the upper chamber of Congress (and the lower too, for that matter), there’s little Republicans can do to block Clarke’s confirmation. Still, that hasn’t stopped them from trying. Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted on Tuesday: “Democrats discharging Kristen Clarke’s troubled nomination from the Judiciary Committee is a grave error. As I’ve said repeatedly, she is a radical extremist with a laundry list of concerning issues plaguing her nomination that go far beyond her support for defunding the police.” That laundry list has all of two items on it, one based on Republicans’ inability to detect satire and another stemming from a misattributed quote. Cruz and other Republicans have beencirculating a quotefrom writer Amiri Baraka and attributing it to Clarke simply because she forwarded an email from Baraka in 1999. In the email, Baraka called police the Ku Klux Klan, which by the way is hardly a radical comparison to anyone with a more in-depth understanding of Black history. But accuracy of the comparison notwithstanding, Clarke didn’t make it. Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committee called Cruz out for his deception in a Twitter thread on May 13. ""Senator, this letter clearly shows the quote you've attributed to Kristen Clarke is not hers,” they tweeted in the thread. “In this email, she's transmitting a submitted poem as part of her part-time student job’s administrative responsibilities. This Committee honors debate but will NOT stand for deception.”It is clear from the face of the email that these are not her words. She told Senator Lee as much in a response to questions for the record. To repeat a debunked talking point is to knowingly spread baseless claims.pic.twitter.com/Bcl9CtqV7TAnother unfortunate senator from Texas tried to dabble in deception last month during Clarke’sconfirmation hearing. Sen. John Cornyn asked if while a student at Harvard University she “argued that African Americans were genetically superior to ah [sic] Caucasians.""John Cornyn grills assistant attorney general nominee Kristen Clarke about an article she wrote for her college paper, seemingly oblivious to the fact it was satirepic.twitter.com/qMG3LNg2AOClarke responded: “No senator,I believe you’re referring to an op-ed that I wrote at the age of 19 about the Bell Curve Theory, a racist book that equated DNA with genetics and race. As a Black student at Harvard at that time we took grave offense to this book. It was co-authored by a Harvard professor. (...) And this op-ed opened with a satirical reference to the statement that you just noted.””What I was seeking to do is hold up a mirror,” Clarke added, “and put one racist theory alongside another to challenge people as to why we were unwilling to wholly reject the racist theory that defined the Bell Curve book.”So basically Clarke has had the moral grounding that makes her especially fit for the Department of Justice gig at least since she was a student at Harvard. I’m sure that wasn’t the point Cornyn was trying to make, but that’s exactly the one hisgotcha questionallowed Clarke to underscore. In Sen. Mazie Hirono’s words from a tweetlast Thursday, ""Republicans are smearing Kristen Clarke because they’re afraid she’ll actually enforce the civil rights laws.""Deval Patrick, the first Black governor of Massachusetts and assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division under former President Bill Clinton, said in anop-edforthat Clarke’s nomination ""should be a no-brainer — presuming you respect the mission of the division.""“Clarke has made a career of just such acts of patriotism. She has handleda wide varietyof civil rights cases and achieved meaningful results, mastering the substance of civil rights law,” Patrick wrote. “Significantly, she has also approached the work as a problem solver, firm in her support of her clients and cause, but able to listen to and actually hear her adversaries.” She has earned the support of “civil rights advocatesandpolice organizations,underrepresented minoritiesandbusiness leaders,” Patrick pointed out. “Let that sink in,” he wrote. “At a moment when hyper-partisan division poisons nearly everything in politics, Clarke has earned the respect and support of friend and foe alike.”This country needs Kristen Clarke at the Department of Justice. Her combination of expertise, experience, skills, and thoughtfulness makes her singularly qualified to ensure the Civil Rights Division will again work for all Americans.#ConfirmClarkepic.twitter.com/tnIRDm3PEJLearn more about Clarke’s background from her ownopening remarksat her confirmation hearing:Thank you Senator Gillibrand for your warm words of introduction. Before I begin, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley, I would like to take a brief moment to recognize my son Miles, my mother, and my partner, who are with me today. I am grateful for their love and support. My journey to this hearing room today may not be an obvious one. It started my junior year of high school, when a teacher loaded my classmates and me into a van and drove us to a courthouse in Hartford, Connecticut, to hear arguments in what turned out to be the landmark school desegregation case, Sheff v. O’Neill. As the daughter of Jamaican immigrants growing up humbly in Starrett City, the nation’s largest public housing complex in Brooklyn, New York, I had never been inside a courtroom before. That moment was a powerful display of the role civil rights lawyers play in our society. I was mesmerized and deeply moved as I watched attorneys argue for more just and equitable educational opportunities. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to be a civil rights attorney. I worked hard in public school. My efforts yielded some lucky breaks that included a seat in a program called Prep for Prep that led me to attend a prep school called Choate Rosemary Hall -- and that trajectory-changing program is why I ended up in that van that day headed to that courthouse. Then it led to Harvard and Columbia Law School. I turned down the high-paying corporate law firms to take my dream job -- in the Justice Department’s Attorney General’s Honors Program where I served for six years, primarily during the George W. Bush Administration. As a DOJ attorney I began my legal career traveling across the country to communities like Tensas Parish, Louisiana and Clarksdale, Mississippi. I learned to be a lawyer’s lawyer – to focus on the rule of law and let the facts lead where they may. When I left DOJ, I carried the words of the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall as my guide:“Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on.""I’ve tried to do just that at every step of my career, from the voting rights project at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, to the Civil Rights Bureau in the New York State Attorney General’s Office, where I was the state’s top civil rights enforcement officer. And since 2015, I’ve led the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the nation’s leading civil rights legal organizations. Formed at the request of John F. Kennedy in 1963, the Lawyers’ Committee activated the private bar to help ensure the rule of law during the turbulence of the Civil Rights movement. I have worked with thousands of lawyers at major corporate law firms across the country who bring to bear the resources of their firms to advance people’s rights. Our nation is a healthier place when we respect the rights of all communities. In every role I’ve held, I have worked with and for people of all backgrounds - regardless of race, national origin, religion, or disability status. I’ve listened deeply to all sides of debates, regardless of political affiliation. There is no substitute to listening and learning in this work, and I pledge to you that I will bring that to the role if confirmed. I would also bring to my stewardship of the Civil Rights Division the lessons I’ve learned over my 20 years as a civil rights attorney -- lessons from the people impacted by my work, lessons from the wise attorneys who have mentored me, and lessons from being a single mother juggling the demands of this work. But perhaps most important, would be fulfillment of the promise I made to myself as a 16-year old girl in that Connecticut courthouse. As I look at my own son -- now the same age I was when I entered that Connecticut courtroom -- I remain committed to the promise of working every day to build a world of equal opportunity for all. A world where no 16-year-old is the target of hateful language. A world where no young man is racially profiled. I dream of a world that values his mind, his heart (and his exceptional soccer skills) -- and does not push him aside because of the color of his skin. I dream of that for every child in America. As the head of the Civil Rights Division, I will bring the same clear-eyed pursuit of justice that has guided me my entire life. I would be honored for you to grant me this humbling opportunity to serve. Thank you.",3,Reliable,0.1010823312489979,0.4459995991662657,2143,1,Daily Kos
410,"Lies, Damn Lies, and Inflation",-12.75,33.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/inflation-covid-mmt-austerity-economy-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-05-18,25,"There are two basic ways to interpret economic news. One is the academic way, in which every development is weighed and scrutinized and plugged into various models in a more or less genuine attempt to intuit what is happening in the chaotic complex system we call​“the economy.” This is what honest economists do, and sometimes they develop new theories that end up causing enormous shifts in global history, many years downstream. This is not the kind of economics we are talking about now, in2021. The other way of approaching economics is the political way, in which each new piece of economic data is hammered and squeezed and molded into a form that serves a preexisting political agenda. This is economics as an instrument to serve politics, not vice versa. This is, unfortunately, the way that most people experience​“the economy”: not as something to be understood, but as something to be either squeezed for all its worth, or something that is squeezing you for all you’re worth. Karl Marx and Adam Smith may have been honest economists in the first category, but most of their disciples in governments have been firmly in the second. It is important to understand this distinction when we discuss economics, lest the discussion go off in two different directions. While academic economists and journalists peer at the past year’s bizarre economic contortions — a historic collapse followed rapidly by a historic government-fueled rebound leading to an uncertain future — and conclude (honestly) that they don’t really know what’s happening, political actors are already sharpening their knives to go to war over what happens next. In terms of political economy, the question now is whether we are poised to enact a new New Deal — a huge increase in government-funded social spending to finally try to turn the tide on inequality that has been building for more than40years — or whether we are instead poised to swing back towards austerity, a brutal budget-balancing to​“make up for” the large spending bills enacted during the past year’s lockdowns. Despite the fact that the trillions of dollars the government spent in several relief bills has successfully staved off whatwould have beenanother Great Depression (and has caused a boom in financial asset prices that is making rich people richer), the institutional preference of the Republican Party is, always, for austerity. The political case for austerity is going to be made no matter what. And inflation is going to be the primary tool used to make it. The honesty of this analysis is beside the point. Along with the contentions​“raising the minimum wage destroys jobs” and​“raising taxes hurts the economy” canards, a key part of the right wing economic gospel is that increasing government spending is bad because it leads to dangerous levels of inflation. Never mind the fact that right-wing economists have been steadily predicting this outcome since the recovery from the2008recession, and it has never come true. They will continue to predict it. Now, inflation is actually here. Never mind the fact that the Fed believes that inflation can be kept under control, and that more government spending is in order — all popular media coverage of inflation occurs in the frame of fear. A little evidence of inflation combined with a lot of fear of inflation will be the formula for turning inflation into a political weapon in service of austerity. You should get ready to hear two primary messages. The first, with each passing month of inflation, will be:​“OUT OF CONTROL government spending is causing inflation that will EAT UP YOUR SAVINGS and cause prices to SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL and we must immediately STOP all new spending and also CUT ENTITLEMENTS.” In this way, longstanding Republican priorities — namely, cutting government spending on everyone except the rich — will be shoehorned into a prescription for today’s (mostly imaginary) problems, without mentioning that the GOP was pushing the same prescription a decade ago when the problems were the opposite. The second message you will hear, which may be a bit subtler, will be:​“This is caused by Modern Monetary Theory, a wacky theory that Democrats embrace, and all this inflation proves that the theory is a failure.” Political speech is about caricatures. The caricature of MMT is:​“These fools think the government can print as much money as it wants with no consequences, but we all know that that will cause runaway inflation.” If you know a little about MMT, you may object to this characterization by understanding that, in fact, MMT specifically focuses on inflation as the signal to tell us how much the governmentspend. That doesn’t matter. It is too nuanced for the caricature, and in politics, the caricature can become far more important than the reality. What percentage of Republicans who hold strong opinions on​“Critical Race Theory” do you think have actually studied critical race theory outside of the caricature? Exactly. It will only take a shift of a single seat in the Senate and a small handful of seats in the House to make the idiotic Republican economic caricatures into the reigning economic orthodoxy of the United States Congress. At that point, the opportunity for transformative change is finished. And even if Republicans don’t manage to win back control of Congress in the midterms, there is the danger that the caricature becomes influential enough to scare Democrats back into the deficit-fearing hole where they have spent most of the past half century. Every last thing happening right now counsels strong, fast action. Get the money out the door now or risk losing any chance at major debt-fueled government spending programs in the foreseeable future. That means the obliteration of any hope for turning around the rise in economic inequality, the single most damaging trend in America in my lifetime. Most Americans are economically illiterate. This is not an insult to them. It is just an observation of fact, and the completely predictable outcome of our nation’s unwillingness to engage in any widespread form of economic education that is not soaked in free market jingoism. For political purposes, nobody knows what MMT is. But they do know enough to fear inflation, because inflation makes stuff cost more, and nobody likes that. Therefore the weaponized rhetorical power of inflation will tend to overwhelm whatever it is being deployed against. And we know that it will be deployed with full force against the possibility that the American welfare state could be permanently expanded. That always makes rich people scared that they’ll have higher taxes, and therefore they will wage war against it. We are now in a race to give people new government benefits before they get tricked out of wanting them. Every month that inflation ticks up, the lies will get louder, and the task will get harder.

412,For the People Act blocked by Senate Republicans,-7.0,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/voting-rights-for-the-people-act-vote-senate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-22,25,"A sweeping bill to curtail the influence of money in politics and protect access to the ballot box failed to clear a procedural hurdle in the U. S. Senate on Tuesday, complicating Democratic efforts to counter a slew of restrictive voting bills being advanced by Republican-controlled state legislatures. Vice President Kamala Harris,who recently added voting rights to her portfolio, presided over the 50-50 party-line vote in the evenly divided Senate. Harris could not act as a tiebreaker because it was a procedural vote, known as the legislative filibuster, which requires 60 senators to support opening debate on a bill. Harris will, in the coming days and weeks, continue to meet with voting rights advocates across the country to make the case that easing, and not restricting, access to the ballot box is essential to protecting democracy, according to a White House official. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. The vice president has previously traveled to Greenville, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia, to meet with voting-rights advocates. She will continue to meet with leaders in states where legislatures are considering or have passed bills to restrict voting access, the White House said.“It is clear, certainly, for the American people, that when we’re talking about the right to vote it is not a Republican concern or a Democratic concern, it is an American concern, this is about the American people’s right to vote, unfettered,” Harris told reporters after the vote.“The fight is not over,” she added.

You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chair of the Rules Committee that oversees the administration of federal elections, said before the vote that her panel would hold a series of field hearings onvoting rights. That will include an examination of Georgia’s lawenacted this yearthat imposes new identification requirements for absentee voters and limits the use of drop boxes.“To my Republican colleagues: this is not the end of the line for this bill, this is only the beginning. Because if you had it your way, voters would not just be stuck at the end of the line but they wouldn’t be able to vote at all,” Klobuchar said in a speech on the Senate floor. Georgia is one of at least 14 states that have enacted laws this year to restrict voting as of mid May, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive policy group thattracks voting access. There were nearly 400 bills introduced in 48 states with restrictive provisions during the same period. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday characterized it as a “wave of anti-voter laws based on the same repeatedly disproven lies that led to an assault on our nation’s Capitol.”Psaki was referring to the mob that attacked the U. S. Capitol in January as lawmakers met to certify President Joe Biden’s valid victory in the November 2020 election. Democrats, and some Republicans, have said former President Donald Trump encouraged the insurrection by repeatedly and erroneously saying voter fraud cost him the election.“They are putting these laws in place because they did not like the outcome and they’ve continued to perpetuate a lie about the outcome of the election,” Psaki told reporters, saying Biden would work with Harris to identify state legislators who want to expand voting access. Republicans have argued that the For the People Act is not necessary and an unacceptable federal intrusion into states’ election administration. Supporting it would also likely draw criticism from Trump, who to a large extent remains the figurehead of the Republican Party even after his defeat. A top aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnellcalled the For the People Act“the worst piece of legislation I’ve ever laid eyes on.”The House of Representativesapproved its versionof the measure, known as HR 1, in March. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republican opposition to the bill showed “they know that the only way for them to win elections is to suppress the vote.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans’ universal opposition to advancing the For the People Act meant “voter suppression has become part of the official platform of the Republican Party.”“In the fight for voting rights, this vote was the starting gun, not the finish line,” Schumer said, adding: “We are going to explore every last one of our options.”But Democrats have limited options in the Senate, where their chances of passing a voting bill are tied to efforts to change or get rid of the legislative filibuster, which requires support from 60 senators to advance nearly all legislation. A handful of Democrats, with Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia andKyrsten Sinemaof Arizona being the most vocal among them, have said they are either reluctant or opposed to changing the Senate filibuster rule. Others have argued that protecting voting is so integral to preserving our democracy that it trumps the importance of Senate rules. Sinemareiterated her positionin a Washington Post op-ed on Monday night, noting that even though she co-sponsored the voting bill, she believes the filibuster “compels moderation and helps protect the country from wild swings between opposing policy poles.”“Would it be good for our country if we did [eliminate the filibuster], only to see that legislation rescinded a few years from now and replaced by a nationwide voter-ID law or restrictions on voting by mail in federal elections, over the objections of the minority?” Sinema wrote. More than 140 LGBTQ+ community leaders and activists in Arizona released an open letter on Monday calling on Sinema, who as the first out bisexual person elected to Congress received support from LGBTQ+ rights groups, to end the filibuster. On Tuesday, at least 10 people were arrested during a demonstration at Sinema’s state office organized by the Arizona Coalition to End the Filibuster.

The American Medical Association has already reported a rise in fatal opioid overdoses in at least 35 states during the pandemic,according toareport, and medical examiners in a number of states have reported a rise in suicides five months into the public health and economic crisis.""The U. S. doesn't have a social safety net, like many countries in Europe. Instead we have the American myth of rugged individualism.""--Jonathan Singer, American Association of SuicidologyFifty-eight suicides have been reported in Cook County, Illinois so far in 2020, compared with 56 total suicides in all of 2019. Low-income, predominantly Black neighborhoods, which have borne the brunt of the pandemic's effects, have seen the sharpest rise in suicides in the county. Officials in cities and counties in California, New Mexico, and Georgia have also been startled by rises in suicides there. On social media,journalist Jeff Stein has posted a number of anecdotes found on the online forum Reddit since the pandemic began, with people across the country this week describing the precarious circumstances they've been thrown into following Senate Republicans' refusal to extend a federal eviction moratorium for some Americans and the $600 benefit, claiming that doing so would keep unemployed people from seeking work--despiteevidence to the contrary. One Georgia residentwrotethat they had $26 in their bank account and that the $600 benefit had helped to keep their fiance's medication in stock, while a person in Arizona wrote that their power was about to be shut off after the pandemic forced their extended family to move in with them.""Doesn't even feel like I'm living in a first world country anymore, and it's been eye-opening losing everything and having to liquidate virtually everything in order to pay bills,"" the personwrote. Some posts alluded to despair and suicidal ideation as the Reddit users described having nowhere to turn.""I don't know what to do anymore,"" wrote a user from Michigan. ""I'd get therapy if my [benefits] ever came through. Feels like they are just waiting for us to die or kill ourselves off. I feel truly abandoned by this country.""Among the tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs since March, at least 5.4 million lost their employer-sponsored health insurance, putting mental healthcare out of reach for many.""The U. S. doesn't have a social safety net, like many countries in Europe,"" Jonathan Singer, president of the American Association of Suicidology, told. ""Instead we have the American myth of rugged individualism--that if you work hard enough you'll achieve what you want in life, and if you don't, it's because of a personal failure.""Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order partially reinstating a federal unemployment benefit, offering just $300 per week. The order was derided as ""an unserious move of political theater"" by the Economic Policy Institute.""This inaction and ongoing uncertainty is causing significant economic pain for workers who have lost their job during the pandemic and their families,""wroteEPI economic analyst Julia Wolfe on Thursday. The White House and Congress arenot expectedto resume talks on another potential relief package until September when lawmakers return to session. The pandemic has brought into sharp relief the precarious circumstances in which millions of Americans already lived before the coronavirus forced businesses across the country to shut down and lay off workers. With one in four renters paying more than half their income to their landlords each month before the pandemic--meeting the federal government's definition of""severely burdened""--the U. S. economic system and itsstagnant wages, high out-of-pocket healthcare costs, andstudent debtcrisis left millions of Americans' daily lives in an even more fragile state immediately after the pandemic hit. Food banks reported reported drastic increases in demand in March, with 90% of inquiries at one Pittsburgh pantry coming from people who were newly unemployed. The U. S. Census Bureau's most recent Household Pulse Survey, which was taken on a weekly basis in the first months of the pandemic and wassuspendedat the end of July,foundthat half of all U. S. adults were feeling ""down,"" depressed, or hopeless in the previous week. Eleven percent of respondents to the survey reported relying on unemployment benefits to pay for basic living expenses, days before the $600 weekly benefit expired.""The pandemic has already generated a combination of factors associated with increased risk, including economic recession, access to firearms, and a generalized sense of anxiety and depression.

The State Department said Austin and Blinken “exchanged views” with Ghani on the security situation, with the secretary of state confirming that the US “remained committed to support a political solution to the conflict” and both officials stressing that “the United States remains invested in the security and stability of Afghanistan.”The department also said Austin and Blinken informed Ghani that America would be “reducing our civilian footprint in Kabul in light of the evolving security situation” and promised to pick up the pace of flying out Afghans who have worked with US and NATO forces and could be marked for extra-brutal retaliation by militants. The Taliban seizure of Kandahar in the southeast and Herat in the west of Afghanistan marked the biggest battlefield successes so far for the hardline fighters. Witnesses described seeing Taliban fighters once detained at Herat’s prison freely moving on the streets. Meanwhile, a Twitter account attributed to Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadireported that Kandahar’s prisonhad been “completely conquered” after “a long siege and violent attacks.”“The personnel surrendered and all the prisoners were released,” the message added, giving no indication of what happened to the prison staff. Witnesses told the AP that the governor of Kandahar province and other officials fled the onslaught, catching a flight to Kabul. In all, the Taliban have captured 12 of the country’s 34 provincial capitals since beginning their latest offensive in May. One of those captured cities, Ghazni, sits on a major highway linking Kabul and Kandahar. Its fall effectively cuts off Ghani’s government from the southern provinces of Afghanistan. Ghazni provincial council member Amanullah Kamrani alleged that the provincial governor and police chief made a deal with the Taliban to flee after surrendering. Taliban video and photos purported to show the governor’s convoy freely passing by insurgents as part of the deal. The swiftness of the Taliban’s advance has led US officials to warn that the fall of Kabul could come within 30 to 90 days,according to the Washington Post. Thirty days from Thursday is the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America, as well as the initial date Bidengave for ending America’s combat missionin Afghanistan. Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon announced that 3,000 US troops would reinforce the more than 600 forces already working at or near the embassy, with press secretary John Kirby saying US officials didn’t want to “wait until it’s too late” to secure the safety of diplomatic personnel. Separately, the United Kingdom said 600 of its troops would be deployed on a short-term basis to support British nationals leaving the country. Late Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Canadian special forces would be sent to Kabul to help with the evacuation of embassy staff. CTV News reported that “sensitive documents” were being destroyed at the Canadian embassy in anticipation of an evacuation. The White House has insisted that Afghan security forces have all the manpower, equipment and training they need to stem the Taliban tide. But video clips of militants riding on American-made Humvees and pickup trucks with M-16s slung across their shoulders has led to recriminations in Washington.“Afghanistan is careening toward a massive, predictable, and preventable disaster,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement Thursday. “And the Administration’s surreal efforts to defend President Biden’s reckless policy are frankly humiliating.”“President Biden’s decisions have us hurtling toward an even worse sequel to the humiliating fall of Saigon in 1975,” added McConnell, who urged Biden to commit more support to the Kabul government’s forces. “Without it, al Qaeda and the Taliban may celebrate the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks by burning down our Embassy in Kabul.”At the United Nations, Reuters reported Thursday that a statement was being drafted by diplomats from Estonia and Norway that would condemn the Taliban attacks, threaten sanctions, and affirm the non-recognition of an Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In Qatar, where peace talks are ongoing, international envoys who met with Afghan government negotiators and Taliban representatives reaffirmed that foreign capitals would not recognize any government in Afghanistan “imposed through the use of military force.”",3,Reliable,0.0728521825396825,0.4690079365079366,968,2,New York Post
415,Biden Pledged to Close For-Profit ICE Detention Centers. Will He Follow Through?,-16.67,38.67,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/01/biden-pledged-to-close-for-profit-ice-detention-centers-will-he-follow-through/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"A GEO Group guard at a Tacoma, Washington, immigration detention center in 2019. Ted S. Warren/APIn 2019, Wilfred requested protection from political persecution at a California border crossing because he saw the United States as a beacon of hope. Instead, Wilfred, an African asylum seeker who asked to be identified by a pseudonym to protect associates in his home country from retaliation, wound up at a Mississippi immigration detention center with practices that he compared tothe slave trade. Prison officials told detainees to walk with their hands behind their back, avoid eye contact with their jailers, and speak only when spoken to. After Mississippi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent Wilfred to Louisiana, where he used his training as a lawyer to help fellow detainees fight their cases. In what he says was retaliation for his lawyering, ICE moved him to the Allen Parish jail, another Louisiana detention center that he called “hell itself.” Upon arriving, he recalled an assistant warden, who was white, telling him, “I hear you’re the trouble maker. If you try to create trouble for me here, I’ll shoot you.”Wilfred’s experience—the indefinite detention, the trauma it caused, and the money prison companies made in the process—encapsulates the detention system President Joe Biden has taken over. The Trump administration took the already large detention network operated by ICE and pushed it to record size by openingmore than 40new detention centers. But during the pandemic, detention levels fell to the lowest in decades, largely due to a Trump administration policy of summarily expelling people at the border. It means thatBiden has taken office with roughly 15,000 people in detention, down from an all-time high of more than 55,000 in the summer of 2019 and about41,000in November 2016. On Tuesday, Biden issued an executive order that directed the Justice Department to phase out its use of private prisons, but the order does not apply to ICE. The Biden administration is considering issuing a similar order to cover immigration detention, but has no immediate plans to do so and some immigrant advocates doubt it ever will,reported. Silky Shah, the executive director of Detention Watch Network, said in a statement that her organization was encouraged by Tuesday’s executive order. But, Shah added, the “Biden administration must now address the private prison industry’s toxic relationship with the Department of Homeland Security,” which oversees ICE. To understand the potential significance of Biden’s campaign pledge, it helps to understand the categories that comprise the civil detention network for immigrants: ICE-owned detention centers operated by for-profit companies, local jails run by prison companies, detention centers owned and operated by prison companies, and locally run jails that have government contracts. Unlike the Justice Department’s Bureau of Prisons, ICE has no detention centers that it owns and operates. Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who led the Department of Homeland Security’s civil rights and civil liberties division during the Obama administration, hopes that Biden will count all detention centers operated by prison companies as for-profit, regardless of whether they’re owned by ICE or local jurisdictions. That would commit his administration to eliminating most of ICE’s detention capacity. As of January 2020, Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, says ICE was holding 81 percent of all detainees at facilities owned or operated by for-profit companies. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what it considers to be for-profit detention centers.)Should this policy be enacted, the result would be that essentially the only ICE detention centers that would remain would be local jails—whichtend to be as bad as or worse than the for-profit detention centers. (The Allen Parish jail that Wilfred called “hell itself” is one of them.) Like private prisons, they’re cash cows. But instead of funneling money to shareholders, they prop up cash-strapped towns and sheriffs’ offices that ICE often pays around $60 per day per detainee. Schlanger knows the problems with local jails but says the main priority right now is to reduce the number of immigrants in detention. Pressuring Biden to stop using for-profit detention centers makes sense as a strategy because he’s already committed to it. Should for-profit detention be eliminated, the question could quickly become where to hold the people who remain detained. Other than abolishing detention altogether, which the Biden administration has shown no intention of doing, the options would be to keep using local jails or come up with a new form of detention that isn’t for-profit. That could meanrepurposing community colleges or halfway houses to hold immigrants, according to a former ICE official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. People at those facilities wouldn’t be free, but they wouldn’t be in jails built to hold a criminal population. Many immigrant advocates, who often favor eliminating ICE detention entirely, would oppose this kind of shift. As Schlanger put it, “I don’t think the advocacy community is very interested right now in taking one huge system of detention and substituting another system of detention.”Sarah Gardiner, the policy director at Freedom for Immigrants, framed Biden’s campaign promise to end for-profit detention as a “critical first step” toward her group’s ultimate goal of detention abolition. Adding to the challenges for the Biden administration is that the number of immigrants in detention mostly plummeted in 2020 because the Trump administration largely sealed off the border during the pandemic. The order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ostensibly to combat the coronavirus, causes border crossers to be summarily removed from the country before they even have a chance to enter ICE custody or to request asylum. The Biden administration has signaled that initially it will keep the CDC order in place to avoid a sudden increase in the number of people arriving at the border, but will presumably end the draconian policy at some point. Once it does, people will start entering ICE custody instead of being immediately expelled, and the numbers of people in detention could quickly balloon unless the agency releases more people on bond or parole than they did under Trump. John Sandweg, who led ICE under Obama, disagrees with advocates who favor getting rid of immigration detention. But he supports ICE taking a more risk-based and individualized approach under which only people deemed a threat to public safety or a flight risk remain detained. “I think we would find that ICE’s detention needs are probably in the 12,000 range,” he says, “and nowhere near the 30 to 35,000 range.”The Biden administration doesn’t have to wait to take this approach. Cho points out that ICE can quickly review the status of everyone in custody with the presumption that people should be released, thereby flippingthe current approach under which the burden is on people in detention to show that they should be released. Beyond that, Cho says ICE could eliminate use of the cash bonds that can be prohibitively expensive. Adopting those changes would help many of the people who remain detained today in facilities where social distancing is impossible and COVID-19 outbreaks have been rampant. (As of Sunday, more than9,000people in ICE custody had tested positive for COVID-19 and 593 were being monitored for active infections.)There are already some signs the Biden administration is moving towards letting out more people. It started a100-day pauseon some deportations, and David Pekoske, the acting Homeland Security Secretary, has directed ICE to provide a process for an individualized review for people who have deportation orders that are more than 90-days old. As part of that process, ICE will look at whether detainees can be released, or have their cases stayed, or reopened. But the status of that process was upended on Tuesday when a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the deportation pause. In May, Wilfred sued for his release, and in a rare move, a judge assigned him a federal public defender. In October, the judge granted his legal team’s request to depose a senior ICE official and the warden of the Allen Parish jail. Two weeks later, ICE released him after 14 months in detention. The case became moot, and the ICE official avoided having to testify under oath. Karim Golding, who came to the United States from Jamaica at 9 years old, has not had the same good fortune as Wilfred. After being arrested as a 21-year-old for selling cocaine and two handguns, he served 10 years in prison. When he was released in 2016, ICE took him into custody. He’s now at the Etowah County jail, anotoriousAlabama jail that ICE uses for the long-term detention of people like Golding who are willing to fight their deportation for years. On March 20, as news of the pandemic spread, Golding and another detainee protested to demand that people transferred to the jail be quarantined first. He put a noose fashioned out of bed sheets around his neck and tied the other end to the second-floor railing of his unit, theInterceptreported. The threat of suicide forced officials at the jail to talk with the detainees about doing more to protect them from COVID-19, but it ultimately wasn’t enough to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. In July, Golding started feeling ill and tested positive for COVID-19. In what appeared to be retaliation for demanding better conditions before testing positive, GoldingtoldtheIntercepthe spent nearly two month in solitary confinement. It was summer in Alabama, and the cell he spent 23 hours a day in lacked air conditioning. After we spoke in December, another outbreak was reported at Etowah, this one affecting six detainees as of Sunday. Like nearly everyone I’ve interviewed who has experienced both federal prison and ICE detention, Golding told me that the conditions in prison had been far better. Despite everything he’d been though, Golding said hefavored keeping some immigration detention for people the government could show are dangerous. He thought that approach would leave ICE with something like two or three detention centers. To Wilfred, itseemed reasonable that people who come to the country seeking asylum would be detained for a few months while they establish that they have a significant chance of being persecuted in their home countries and the US government verifies their identity. The difference, however, is that during that time, he believes people should be held in more humane conditions. He asked why people in civil detention, which is supposed to be non-punitive, are marched around in orange jumpsuits or taken to medical appointments in shackles. “That was my worst experience: the chains,” he says, recalling being shackled, “I felt like the slavery life was reliving itself in us.”Golding hoped that people on the outside would not stop fighting for detained immigrants once Trump was out of office. He compared Trump to 9/11, explaining that the former president had united normally disparate factions. “But we have a tendency of getting complacent after these tragedies, and he was that tragedy,” he said. “You don’t want to be like, ‘Biden is the solution.’ We want to hold him accountable.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.0685140195053988,0.4072416903020351,2448,2,Mother Jones

In this case, Cruise, also the film’s producer, helped develop the protocols meant to get the film through production that spanned from Italy to Norway and London. It is a massive undertaking, and there were reports of Covid issues during the Italy leg of the shoot, which reportedly shut the film down for a couple of days. Cruise told the crew that if the behavior is repeated, those who are caught would be fired. He is very emotional in delivering the message, telling the crew that the industry is hurting, and most of the industry shut down, and that people are losing their homes as a result.

Calling the legislation an effort to impose “unconstitutional burdens on the right to vote”—particularly for Black voters—the plaintiffs accused Georgia Republicans of acting in direct response to former President Donald Trump’s stunning campaign to undo Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in the state. The voting law has attracted national attention, as well as fierce condemnation from Democrats. Georgia Republicans—much like Republicans in other states where brazen voting restrictions have been introduced—have characterized the law as an attempt to prevent illegal voting, despite longstanding evidence that voter fraud is a largely nonexistent problem.“None of the bill’s burdensome and discriminatory changes to Georgia’s election code will increase the public’s confidence in the state’s election administration or ensure election integrity,” the lawsuit, announced byMarc Elias, the prominent election lawyer, argues. “Rather, the grab bag of voting restrictions that populate SB 202 make clear that the Bill was animated by an impermissible goal of restricting voting.”The three groups—the New Georgia Project, which was founded by Stacey Abrams, the Black Voters Matter Fund, and Rise—objected to a wide range of provisions in the bill, including a ban on non-poll workers distributing water to voters waiting in line and restrictions on the use of absentee drop boxes. And as my colleagueAri Berman writes, the “major power grab” would give the state board of elections sweeping powers “to take over county election boards it views as underperforming, raising the possibility that elections officials appointed by and beholden to the heavily gerrymandered Republican legislature could take over election operations in Democratic strongholds like Atlanta’s Fulton County, where Trump and his allies spreadconspiracy theoriesabout ‘suitcases’ of ballots being counted by election officials in November after GOP poll monitors had left.”Biden, in his first White House news conference on Thursday, slammed Republican voter suppression efforts as “sick.”",3,Reliable,0.008392599464028,0.4095701917130488,457,2,Mother Jones

421,Judge dismisses several water uses in White River reservoir case,-1.33,47.67,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/judge-dismisses-several-water-uses-in-white-river-reservoir-case/,https://adfontesmedia.com/aspen-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-31,15,"NewsNews|Dec 31, 2020A water court judge has agreed with state engineers and dismissed several of a water conservancy district’s claims for water for a dam and reservoir project in northwest Colorado. Division 6 Water Judge Michael A. O’Hara III, in a Dec. 23 order, determined that Rio Blanco Water Conservancy District has not provided enough evidence that its current existing water rights won’t meet demands in the categories of municipal, irrigation, domestic, in-reservoir piscatorial, commercial and augmentation for Yellow Jacket Water Conservancy District. The Rangely-based conservancy district isseeking a conditional water-storage rightto build an off-channel reservoir using water from the White River to be stored in the Wolf Creek drainage, behind a dam 110 feet tall and 3,800 feet long. It would involve pumping water uphill from the river into the reservoir. Rio Blanco initially applied for a 90,000 acre-foot water-storage right but later reduced that claim to 66,720 acre-feet for the off-channel reservoir, which would be located between Rangely and Meeker. According to Colorado water law, new conditional water rights cannot be granted without a specific plan and intent to put the water to beneficial use. For more than five years, top state water engineers have repeatedly said the project is speculative because Rio Blanco has not proven a need for water above its current supply. State engineers asked the court to dismiss Rio Blanco’s entire application in what’s known as a motion for summary judgment. The court agreed to dismiss only some of Rio Blanco’s requested water uses.“The applicant has failed to demonstrate that its existing water rights for municipal, irrigation, domestic, in-reservoir piscatorial, and commercial uses are insufficient to meet its needs and are therefore dismissed,” O’Hara wrote in his order. The town of Rangely’s water needs and whether water was needed for irrigation were two main topics of questions from state engineers in hundreds of pages of depositions in the case. O’Hara’s order said there are three water-use claims left to resolve at trial: whether Rio Blanco can get a water right for augmentation in the event of Colorado River Compact curtailment, water for endangered species and water for hydroelectric power. The trial is scheduled to begin Monday, but the parties could still reach a settlement agreement before then.“We are involved in productive settlement discussions with the engineers and both sides hope that produces a settlement rather than a trial,” said Alan E. Curtis, an attorney for Rio Blanco. Even if the parties reach a settlement, the judge will still have to approve the final water-right decree. Curtis said parties often reach settlements at the last minute, sometimes even after a trial has begun. If the case goes to trial next week, a main point of contention will be whether Colorado River Compact compliance is a valid beneficial use of water stored in the White River project. Rio Blanco is proposing that 11,887 acre-feet per year be stored as “augmentation,” or insurance, in case of a compact call. Releasing this replacement water stored in the proposed reservoir to meet these compact obligations would allow other water uses in the district to continue and avoid the mandatory cutbacks in the event of a compact call. According to the 1922 Colorado River Compact, the upper-basin states (Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming) must deliver 7.5 million acre-feet a year to Lake Powell for use by the lower-basin states (Arizona, California and Nevada). If the upper basin doesn’t make this delivery, the lower basin can “call” for its water, triggering involuntary cutbacks in water use for the upper basin. Water managers are especially worried that those with junior water rights, meaning those later than 1922, will be the first to be curtailed. Many water users in the White River basin, including the towns of Rangely and Meeker, have water rights that are junior to the compact, meaning these users could bear the brunt of involuntary cutbacks in the event of a compact call. Augmentation water would protect them from that. State engineers argue that augmentation use in the event of a compact call is not a beneficial use under Colorado water law and is inherently speculative. But O’Hara disagreed, saying there is sufficient legal authority for Rio Blanco to develop an augmentation plan for a compact call.“While it is tempting for the court (to) rule, as a matter of law, that the requested augmentation use is speculative because it is based on an event that may or may not occur, it chooses not to do so here,” O’Hara’s motion reads. Rio Blanco says it needs 60,555 acre-feet of water per year for maintenance and recovery of federally listed and endangered fish. Releases from the proposed reservoir could benefit endangered fish downstream, including the Colorado pikeminnow and razorback sucker. But the gauge used to measure these flows — the Watson gauge — is located downstream in Utah. State engineers say this violates Colorado’s law regarding exporting water across state lines. Rio Blanco says the water will benefit fish in the White River within Colorado and that they use the Watson gauge because there isn’t one between Taylor Draw dam in Rangely and the state line. Where exactly the fish will benefit from reservoir releases is a matter to be hashed out at trial.“The court finds that the location of beneficial use is a material fact in dispute,” O’Hara’s order reads. “The expert reports conflict and the characterization of how and where water is to be used vary.”Another point the parties can’t agree on is how much water from the proposed reservoir would be used by the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program. The program has not committed to a specific amount of water. A May 2019 letter from program director Tom Chart says the recovery program “does not know whether, or how much, allocated storage in the project or other White River basin projects may be needed in order to offset depletion effects to the endangered species to assist in the recovery of the endangered fish.”But, as O’Hara points out, the letter does not say the program will not need water from a future Wolf Creek reservoir.“The letter creates a material fact in dispute, one more suitable for resolution at trial,” O’Hara’s order reads. Also to be decided at trial is water use for hydroelectric power. State engineers say hydropower is not an independent use and depends on the court granting the other water uses. They say that if the other uses are dismissed, then hydropower should be dismissed too. But Rio Blanco says water should be stored in the reservoir specifically for hydropower generation and should not be contingent on other uses. The trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Routt County District Court in Steamboat Springs.

422,Biden under pressure to appoint first Native American to head Interior Department,-6.0,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/biden-under-pressure-to-appoint-first-native-american-to-head-interior-department/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,25,"Help us empower women and all those underrepresented in American media. Join The 19th. President-elect Joe Biden is under pressure to make history with his pick to lead the Department of the Interior by nominating the first-ever Native American to lead the federal agency, which oversees federal land and natural resources, and administers most programs related to the more than 550 federally recognized tribes. A leading contender is Deb Haaland, a second-term House of Representatives lawmaker from New Mexico whose potentially history-making nomination has inspired a persuasion campaign by tribal leaders, environmental groups and progressive leaders. They say the congresswoman — a lawyer, climate activist and enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo — is uniquely suited to be Interior’s first Indigenous leader. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.“We believe it is long past time that a Native American person serve as Secretary of the Interior,” more than 150 elected leaders of tribal nations wrote in a letter last week to Biden’s transition team.“Rep. Haaland has championed the environment, helped lead efforts to address climate change, and worked to improve the nation-to-nation relationship between our Tribes and the United States — all issues within the Department of the Interior’s responsibilities.”The high-profile push to bring Haaland’s Interior candidacy to the fore began just days after television networks declared Biden and Kamala Harris the winners of the 2020 election. On November 13, a dozen environmental organizations said in a letter to Biden that they could “think of no better person to run the Department of the Interior” than Haaland, who would make the agency a “true long-term steward of our nation’s most precious resources.”You have been subscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please email[email protected]to subscribe. This email address might not be capable of receiving emails (according toBouncer). You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. The next day, three dozen groups affiliated with the Indigenous Environmental Network sent a letter saying Haaland was the ideal pick to “help facilitate the Biden/Harris vision for dealing with climate change, addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in Indian Country, ensuring an effective economic just recovery plan for Tribes and communities, overseeing the protection of public lands and fulfilling all treaty and statutory obligations.”“The first Indigenous woman to head the Department of Interior will inspire and provide hope not only to the Indigenous Peoples of this land, but also to all those who have vision for the future,” the network wrote. Haaland’s congressional office declined to comment on the selection process for the Interior post. Biden’s transition team declined to comment on its deliberations or when the president-elect will make an announcement. Haaland has made history before. When she was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018, she was one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, along with fellow Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids from Kansas. Haaland, a former state party chair, had centered her campaign on combating climate change. During Haaland’s first term, she became vice chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, where she also chaired its subcommittee on national parks and public lands. Haaland, the daughter of two veterans — her father was in the Marines and her mother in the Navy — also serves on the chamber’s Armed Services Committee. She handily won her re-election bid in November by more than 15 points. More than 50 of Haaland’s Democratic House colleagues said in a letter to Biden last month that “she has distinguished herself as a respected leader within our caucus” during her first two years in office, citing her leadership on climate issues and her committee stewardship of two public lands bills that were signed into law.“You can make history by giving Native Americans a seat at the Cabinet table for the first time. We strongly recommend that you nominate Rep. Deb Haaland for this important role,” National Resources Committee Chair Raul Grijalva wrote on behalf of the lawmakers. If Haaland has a factor working against her it is the same one that her supporters believe makes her the best pick for the job: her bona fides with the Democratic Party’s progressive wing and policy positions that are to the left of Biden’s. Haaland protested the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock in 2016. She backs the Green New Deal to address climate change and economic inequality, which Biden does not support in full but calls a “crucial framework.” She holds a leadership role in the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Before backing Biden, Haaland co-chaired the presidential campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a fellow progressive. Haaland then became enthusiastically involved in Biden’s campaign, joining his Climate Engagement Advisory Council and hosting Indigenous Women for Biden events. She helped the campaign mark Indigenous Peoples’ Day by appearing with other elected officials and tribal leaders at an October event that highlighted Biden’s plan for tribal nations. In recent weeks, unnamed “Biden advisers” havequestionedwhether Haaland has the right experience for the Interior role. A Biden representative said the remarks were not coming from members of the transition team. “No one is trying to discount Deb Haaland — or her experience,” he said. No decision has been made, and other candidates are still under consideration, including Michael Connor, a member of the Taos Pueblo in New Mexico and a former deputy Interior secretary during the Obama administration. Also thought to be a serious contender is New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall, a Democrat who isretiringat the end of the year and, shortly after the election, released adocument highlightinghis work on behalf of Native communities. The Interior Department was created in 1849 and its leader holds a Cabinet-level position that requires Senate confirmation. It employs about 70,000 people across nine divisions, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. Biden’s Interior pick will likely move early on to reverse a push during the Trump administration to open additional federal lands to oil and gas extraction. Trump’s first Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, left the post after the department’s Office of Inspector General began investigating expensive flights and other expenditures. His replacement, David Bernhardt, was a deputy secretary and oil industry lobbyist. Biden has promised to end all new fossil fuel extraction on public lands.",3,Reliable,0.1375689379114036,0.4139284231749984,1394,3,19th News
423,Joe Biden's botched Afghanistan exit is a disaster at home and abroad long in the making,-2.33,37.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/16/politics/afghanistan-joe-biden-donald-trump-kabul-politics/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-16,24,"The debacle of the US defeat and chaoticretreat in Afghanistanis a political disaster for Joe Biden, whose failure toorchestrate an urgent and orderlyexit will further rock a presidency plagued by crises and stain his legacy. But a stunning Taliban blitzkrieg followed more than 20 years of US and allied policy failures, misunderstandings of Afghan politics and culture, public war fatigue and the culpability and corruption of the failed state’s leaders. And while Biden’s political and geopolitical rivals rush to exploit his mistakes, the true magnitude of the crisis can only be judged in the human tragedy of a people again subject to Taliban persecution. And a failure to fulfill the now apparentlynear-impossible tasks of evacuating all the Afghan translators, workers and fixers on whom the US relied and who now face Taliban retribution would besmirch America’s conscience and global reputation.“It is a stain on our nation’s integrity and honor that even just a few months ago, we were not meeting our obligation to the men and women, our Afghan allies who served alongside us,” Jake Wood, a former US Marine and Afghan war veteran, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Sunday. “We owe them the special immigrant visas. We owe them safety, every bit as much as we owe safety to our embassy workers in Kabul. What will an Afghanistan under the Taliban look like? Its rise to power in the '90s paints a grim pictureBiden remained at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland on Monday morning, but was set to return to the White House to address the nation during the afternoon. Senior national security officials appeared on television news shows in an apparent effort to counter the impression that the administration had been badly overtaken by events. After video emerged of Afghans flooding the tarmac at Kabul airport, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer admitted that the airport was crowded with “desperate” Afghans wanting to leave, but insisted on CNN’s “New Day” that the US had the forces in place “that are necessary to bring stability and security to that airport.”Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan deflected the blame for the scenes of chaos in Kabul, saying on ABC News that the President would speak to Americans “soon.” And he blamed Afghan armed forces for folding in the face of the lightning Taliban advance.“(Biden) thought the Afghan national security forces could step up and fight because we spent 20 years, tens of billions of dollars training them, giving them the best equipment, giving them support of US forces for 20 years and when push came to shove, they decided not to step up and fight for their country,” Sullivan said. The US launched the Afghan war 20 years ago in a mood of vengeance, resolve and unity, after al Qaeda’s attacks on New York and Washington shattered the post-Cold War myth of American hyper power. It is ending it in a rushed race to get out, humbled by a primitive militia, that is nevertheless ready to die for jihad on its home soil and is re-imposing its feudal writ on a war-ravaged nation that bleeds foreign invaders dry. That a war that killed or maimed thousands of Americans, many more Afghan civilians and cost a trillion dollars, ended so abruptly with such an ignominious eclipse was shocking. But it perhaps should not have been. Ironically, Biden’s mismanagement of the withdrawal from Afghanistan underscored his core point — that US visions of forging a functioning nation were illusory and that many more years of US involvement would not make any difference. The evaporating Afghan forces and police that the US spent billions building up to fight the Taliban mystified many Washington officials. This encapsulated how top military brass and diplomats were misled by their own preconceptions and the investment of years of US blood and treasure, troops surges, drawdowns, diplomatic offensives and arbitrary timelines to leave. The sudden Afghan crisis, that developed at stunning speed – at least to most people in Washington who had long since looked away from the country’s longest war – is the most serious political reversal yet for Biden. And it came only days after he celebrated his biggest victories so far – the passage of more than$4.5 trillion combined in infrastructure and budget spending through the Senate. The win defied the skeptics who had long mocked his vow to bring Republicans and Democrats together, followed his earlier signing of a huge Covid-19 relief bill and bolstered his reputation as an effective domestic leader. Much of that momentum – at least for now – risks being drowned out by the imagery of American defeat abroad. Biden now finds himself carrying the political can for two decades of the missteps of others – after adding his own errors. He will be accused of rushing the US exit to create a favorable political narrative as the President who got US troops home before the 20th anniversary of theSeptember 11 attacksin 2001 — plotted by al Qaeda from Afghanistan — and ahead of next year’s midterm congressional elections. At the same time,Bidenwas doing exactly what most Americans, exhausted by long years of foreign quagmires and confused as to why US troops were still in Afghanistan 20 years after 9/11, wanted. There was no national support for escalating the war. To check the Taliban advance, the President would have had to deploy thousands more US troops and to wage new combat without public support. That and his own long-term skepticism about the war left his own withdrawal decision almost inevitable. But the strength of the Taliban advance caught the White House flat footed. Try asSecretary of State Antony Blinken did on Sunday talk shows, there is no way to spin events of the last few days as anything but a domestic political, and geopolitical, wreck. After telling troops to leave, Biden has now had to retain 6,000 of their comrades in Afghanistan to secure the retreat of US personnel at the embassy as Kabul airport is besieged with crowds wanting to leave. A failure to safely get all Americans out, or any ensuing US troop casualties, would threaten catastrophic political damage for the President amid fresh comparisons with the haunting US legacy of Vietnam. US completes evacuation of embassy in Afghanistan as flag comes down at diplomatic compoundBiden’s judgment as commander-in-chief is being called into question since he is on record, in damning video footage, saying that the Taliban’s victory was “not inevitable.” He said there would be no Saigon-style pictures of helicopters lifting off the roof of the US embassy in Kabul. That exact scenario unfolded this weekend after the US rushed to get its people out, and the Stars and Stripes was run down the flagpole as the fundamentalist militia routed by the United States in 2001, surged back into the Afghan capital. Biden was at Camp David all weekend and did not speak to the American people on camera. He did release a paper statement justifying his decision to leave Afghanistan, in which he spoke, misleadingly, about an “orderly” evacuation. And photos of Biden in a secure conference room at the presidential retreat, in a polo shirt, speaking with officials on screen, hardly promoted the intended image of an engaged commander-in-chief. On CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Blinken argued that the US had completed its mission — crushing al Qaeda — and that Biden had been left in an impossible position by ex-President Donald Trump’s deal with the Taliban for the US to leave for good in May, a deadline slightly extended by his successor. If Biden had breached that agreement, Blinken said: “We would have been back at war with the Taliban. And we would have been back at war, with tens of thousands of troops having to go in, because the 2,500 troops we had there and the air power would not have sufficed to deal with the situation.” Despite his defense of the administration’s preparations, Blinken did express surprise at the “hollowness” of the Afghan forces and their collapse and the swift folding of the US-backed democratic government in Kabul. The Secretary of State made some solid points. The initial US victory in Afghanistan over al Qaeda and the Taliban for harboring Osama bin Laden’s terror group did prevent any repeat of 9/11. And Trump did intend for an even quicker withdrawal than Biden. It’s not clear if Trump put any plans in motion to secure an evacuation of US personnel, embassy staff or Afghan translators who supported two decades of US military effort when he signed an agreement with the Taliban to pull US troops out by May of this year. TheTrump administration’s decision to hold negotiations with the Taliban— who Trump had hoped to invite to Camp David — without the Afghan government present – made Afghan government officials and security forces question the support of the US, some analysts say. Scenes from the Afghan capital left the President open to easy Republican attacks.“I ask President Biden to stop finding excuses for his own mistakes and address the country in person,” House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California said in a statement. Republican Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell complained about the “botched” exit from Afghanistan, adding in a statement: “Everyone saw this coming except the President, who publicly and confidently dismissed these threats just a few weeks ago.” On “State of the Union,” the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, blasted Biden for presiding over an “unmitigated disaster of epic proportions.”That many of those aiming the sharpest criticism of Biden advocated the kind of hawkish policies and long engagement in Afghanistan that failed year-after-year, and helped lead to this weekend, is unlikely to quell the political storm raging around the President. Biden’s challenge must now prevent a narrative of failure developing around his administration. The President was already faced with a resurgence of the pandemic — thanks to the refusal of many conservatives to take free, life-saving vaccinations. And despite soaring job creation numbers and Biden’s infrastructure win, Republicans are citing rising inflation and record numbers of undocumented migrants being turned back at the US border to claim his presidency is in crisis. Still, given the deep skepticism of the American public about the cost and the outcome of the post-9/11 wars, snap judgments that the current crisis will permanently wound Biden are premature. Internationally however, the messy US exit from Afghanistan will spur doubts about Washington’s steadfastness as an ally. After declaring “America is back” following the alienating and destabilizing Trump era on his first overseas trip to Europe earlier this summer, Biden’s first real foreign policy crisis is over a botched US retreat. And the President’s clarion calls for the protection of democracy abroad will be undermined by his decision to abandon a fragile democratic government in Afghanistan.

424,The Mobster-in-Chief,-18.67,39.0,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/09/29/mobster-chief,https://adfontesmedia.com/common-dreams-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-29,25,"The white mobs didn't care whom they killed as long as the victims were Black. They murdered people in public with guns and rocks. They set fire to houses and slaughtered families trying to escape the flames. In East St. Louisin July 1917, white vigilantes lynched Blacks with impunity. It was the prelude to what civil rights activist James Weldon Johnson would ultimately call Red Summer. The ""red"" referred to the blood that ran in the streets. The ""summer"" actually referred to the months from April to October 1919, when violence against African Americans peaked in this country. In reality, though, that Red Summer stretched across six long years, beginning in East St. Louis in 1917 and ending with the destruction of the predominantly African-American town of Rosewood, Florida, in 1923. During that time, white mobskilledthousands of Blacks in 26 cities, including Chicago, Houston, and Washington, D. C. In 1921, in a slaughter that has been well documented, white citizens of Tulsa, Oklahoma, destroyed the country's wealthiest African American community (""Black Wall Street,"" as it was then known), burning downmore than 1,000 housesas well as churches, schools, and even a hospital. During this period of violence, the mobs sometimes cooperated with the authorities. Just as often, however, they ignored the police, even breaking through jail walls with sledgehammers to gain access to Black detainees whom they executed in unspeakable ways. In Tulsa, for example, that campaign of murder and mayhem began only after the local sheriff refused to hand over a Black teenager accused of sexual assault. Although white America repressed the memories of Red Summer for many decades, that shameful chapter of our history has gained renewed scrutiny in this era of Black Lives Matter. The Tulsa massacre, for instance, features prominently in the recentseries on HBO and several documentaries are in the works for its centennial anniversary in 2021. Other recent documentaries have chronicled killings that took place in the immediate aftermath of World War Iin Elaine, Arkansas, and Knoxville, Tennessee. But memories of that Red Summer are resurfacing for another, more ominous reason. White mobs have once again moved out of the shadows and into the limelight during this Trump moment. Militia movements and right-wing extremists are starting to turn out in force to intimidate racial justice and anti-Trump demonstrators. Predominantly white and often explicitly racist, these groups now regularly use social media to threaten their adversaries. This election season, they're gearing up to defend their president with an astonishing degree of support from Republican Party regulars. According to a January 2020 survey by political scientist Larry Bartels, most Republicans believe ""the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it."" More than 40% agree that ""a time will come when patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands."" In arecent essayon his survey's findings, Bartels concludes that ethnic antagonism ""has a substantial negative effect on Republicans' commitment to democracy.""As the 2020 election nears, that party is also desperately trying to flip the script by using fear of ""their mobs"" and ""Antifa terrorists"" to drive its base to the polls. ""We have a Marxist mob perpetrate historic levels of violence & disorder in major American cities,""tweetedFlorida Senator Marco Rubio in response to the Democratic National Convention in August. Not to be outdone, the president promptlysaid: ""I'm the only thing standing between the American dream and total anarchy, madness, and chaos.""Of course, this country has no such Marxist mobs. The only real groups of vigilantes with a demonstrated history of violence and the guns to back up their threats congregate on the far right. The white supremacist Atomwaffen Division, for instance, has beenlinked toat least five killings since 2017. In late May and early June, members of the far-right Boogaloo Boisconductedtwo ambushes of police officers and security personnel, killing two of them and injuring three more. Over the summer, as far-right organizations spread the meme ""All Lives Splatter"" around the internet, dozens of right-wingersdrovevehicles of every sort into crowds of Black Lives Matter protesters. The prospect of far-right vigilantes or ""militias"" heading into the streets to contest the results of the November election has even mainstream institutions worried. ""Right-wing extremists perpetrated two thirds of the attacks and plots in the United States in 2019 and over 90% between January 1 and May 8, 2020,""reportsthe centrist think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""If President Trump loses the election, some extremists may use violence because they believe--however incorrectly--that there was fraud or that the election of Democratic candidate Joe Biden will undermine their extremist objectives.""As the violence of Red Summer demonstrated, such acts were once a mainstay of American life. Indeed, the not-so-hidden history of this country has featured periodic explosions of mob violence. Racial justice activists rightly call for the radical reform of police departments. As November approaches, however, uniformed representatives of the state are hardly the only perpetrators of racist violence. Beware the white mobs, militias, and posses that are desperate to establish their own brand of justice. When Donald Trump paints a picture of lawlessness sweeping through the United States, he's effectively accusing the institutions of government of not doing their jobs. In a September 2nd memo, the Trump administration laid out its charges:""For the past few months, several State and local governments have contributed to the violence and destruction in their jurisdictions by failing to enforce the law, disempowering and significantly defunding their police departments, and refusing to accept offers of Federal law enforcement assistance.""As president, Donald Trump has refused to take responsibility for anything, not the more than 200,000 Covid-19 deaths in the United States, not the pandemic-induced economic collapse, and certainly not the racial injustices that prompted this summer's wave of protests. Simultaneously above the law and outside it, the president consistently portrays himself as a populist leader who must battle the elite and its ""deep state."" With conspiracy-tinged tirades about Democrat-run cities failing to enforce the law, he has already symbolically put himself at the head of a mob--for this is just how such groups justified their extra-legal actions throughout our history. The right-wing racists who currently bear arms in defense of the president are part of a long tradition of Americans resorting to vigilantism when they believe the law is not protecting their interests. Whether it was the displacement and massacre of Native Americans, the horrors that slaveowners inflicted on African Americans, the wave of lynching that followed Reconstruction, the bloodletting of Red Summer around World War I, the murders conducted by the Ku Klux Klan and other extremist organizations, or even everyday resistance to federal policies like school desegregation, gangs of Americans have repeatedly taken the law into their own hands on behalf of white supremacy. To be sure, mobs are hardly responsible for all the racist ills of this country. America has always been a place of institutional racism and violence. Slavery, after all, was legal until 1865. The U. S. government and its military did the bulk of the dispossessing of Native Americans. Police departmentscooperatedearly on with the Ku Klux Klan and today's police officers continue tokill a disproportionate numberof African Americans. Mobs have eagerly cooperated with state institutions on the basis of shared racism. But they have also stood at the ready to enforce the dictates of white supremacy even when the police and other guardians of order treat everyone equally before the law. The mob has occupied an unusually prominent place in our history because Americans have cultivated a unique hostility toward the state and its institutions that goes back to the early years of the Republic. As historian Michael Pfeifer notes in his groundbreaking book,, the violent libertarianism associated with the American Revolution and the subsequent lack of a strong, centralized state gave rise to mob violence that gathered force before the Civil War. He writes,""Antebellum advocates of vigilantism in the Midwest, South, and West drew on Anglo-American and American revolutionary traditions of community violence that suggested that citizens might reclaim the functions of government when legal institutions could not provide sufficient protections to persons or their property.""Those mobs didn't necessarily think of themselves as anti-democratic. Rather, they imagined that they were improving on democracy. As Pfeifer points out, many of the vigilante outfits that targeted minorities practiced democratic procedures of a sort. Some adopted bylaws and even elected their own leaders. They held mock trials and votes on what punishments to mete out: hanging or burning alive. Such mobs functioned both as a parallel military and, to a certain extent, a parallel state. The two, in fact, went hand in hand. German sociologist Max Weber famously defined the state as possessing a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force, but that was the German tradition. In the United States, particularly during its first 150 years, the state onlyto possess such a monopoly. Instead, a rough form of frontier justice often prevailed. Before and just after the American Revolution, even whites were its targets, but increasingly its victims were people of color. Slave owners, slave patrols, andmobs dispensed justice throughout antebellum America and the tradition of ""Judge Lynch"" continued long after the abolition of slavery. The pushing of the frontier westward involved not only the Army's killing of Native Americans but extrajudicial violence by bands of settlers. Historian Benjamin Madley estimates that the Native population in Californiadeclined by more than 80%between 1846 and 1873, with as many as 16,000 killings in 370-plus massacres. This ""winning"" of the West also involved the widespreadlynching of Latinos. Mobs were able to dispense frontier justice not only thanks to a strong libertarian tradition and a weak state, but also because of the widespread availability of guns. Coming out of the Civil War, this country developed a distinct gun culture sustained by a surge in firearm production. Gun prices fell and so guns fell into the hands of more and more citizens. Mobs used firearms in the infamous Draft Riot in New York in 1863, whichended up targetingthe city's Black community, and in New Orleans in 1866 when enraged whitesattackeda meeting of Republicans determined to extend civil rights protections to African Americans. In their drive westward, settlersfavoredWinchester rifles with magazines that could fire 15 rounds, giving them a staggering advantage over the people they were displacing. Early gun control laws seldom prevented whites from acquiring firearms because they were mainlydesignedto keep guns out of the hands of Blacks and other racial minorities. Even today, widespread gun ownership distinguishes the United States from every other country. Approximately 40% of American households own one or more firearms, a figure that has remainedremarkably consistentfor the last 50 years. If you look atguns per capita, the United States ranks number one in the world at 120 firearms per 100 civilians. The next country on the list, war-torn Yemen, comes in a distant second with 52 per hundred. With more guns than people within its borders, it's no wonder that the federal government has often struggled to maintain its monopoly over the legitimate use of physical force. Gun enthusiasts have erroneously enlisted the Constitution to justify this extreme democracy of firepower. To guard against tyrannical federal behavior, the Second Amendment of the Constitution preserved the right of state militias to bear arms. However, organizations like the National Rifle Association have campaigned for years to reinterpret that amendment as giving any individual the right to bear arms. That has, in turn, provided ammunition for both the ""castle doctrine"" (the right to use armed force to defend one's own home) and ""stand your ground"" laws (the right to use force in ""self-defense""). Armed extremist groups now imagine themselves as nothing less than the Second Amendment's ""well-regulated Militia"" with a constitutionally given ""right"" to own weapons and defend themselves against the federal government (or anyone else they disapprove of). Improbably enough, for the last four years, the head of the federal government has become one of their chief supporters. Long before becoming president, Donald Trump was already acting as if he were the head of a lynch mob. In 1989, he published full-page ads in theand three other local papers calling for New York City to reinstate the death penalty in response to a brutal gang rape in Central Park. He swore that the city was then ""ruled by the law of the streets"" and that ""muggers and murderers... should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes.""It was language distinctly reminiscent of white mobs bitter about the failure of local law enforcement to execute Blacks accused of crimes. Like many of their predecessors, the accused Black and Latino teenagers were, in the end, found to be quite innocent of the crime. Aftera long legal struggle, the Central Park Five (as they came to be known) were released from prison. Trump hasnever apologizedfor his campaign to kill innocent people. When he ran for president, he quickly moved beyond mere ""law and order"" rhetoric. In his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump deliberately cultivated a following among armed extremists. At a rally in North Carolina, for instance, he warned of what might happen to the Supreme Court if Hillary Clinton were to win.""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,"" he lamented. Then headdedin his typically confused and elliptical manner of speaking: ""Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know."" He was, in other words, suggesting that followers with guns could do something about Clinton's choices by shooting her or her judicial picks. Throughout that campaign season, he regularlyretweetedwhite supremacist claims and memes. At the time, it was estimated that more than60%of the accounts he was retweeting had links to white supremacists. At his rallies, heencouraged his supportersto get ""rough"" with protesters. As president, he's continued to side with the mob. He infamously refused to denounce neo-Nazis gathering in Charlottesville in August 2017, applauded the armed demonstrators who demanded the reopening of the economy in the pandemic spring of 2020, anddefended17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse after he killed two Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Trump has stood up for theConfederate flag, Confederate statues, and keeping the names of Confederate generals on U. S. military bases. In a recent speech denouncing school curricula that teach about slavery and other unsavory aspects of our history, hepledgedto erect a statue of a slaveowner in a project he's been promoting--building a National Garden of American Heroes park. The current administration has cultivated direct links to white nationalists through disgraced figures like Steve Bannon andSebastian Gorka, as well as current advisers likeStephen Miller. In his reelection bid, Trump pointedly held his first pandemic rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he excoriated Democrats who ""want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment"" and ""left-wing radicals [who] burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police officers."" In a literal whitewashing of history, hemade no mentionof the White mobs that had looted businesses and destroyed property in that very city in 1921. Trump's exhortations to his followers over the heads of state and local officials appeal to the mob belief that citizens must reclaim the functions of government, if necessary through force. Right-wing militias explicitly embrace that history. The ""Three Percenters,"" a militia movement that emerged in 2008 after the election of Barack Obama, purports to protect Americans from tyrannical government. Their name derives from the inaccurate belief that only 3% of Americans took up arms to fight the British empire in the eighteenth century. Of course, three percent of Americans are not now members of such militias and White nationalist movements, but their numbers are on the rise. White nationalist groups increased from 100 in 2017 to155in 2019. The several hundred militia groups now in existenceprobably havea total of 15,000 to 20,000 members, including an increasing number of veterans with combat experience. Far from a homogeneous force, some are focused on patrolling the southern border and targeting the undocumented. Others are obsessed with resisting the federal government, even in a few cases opposing Trump's various power grabs. West Virginia University professor John Templeargues, in fact, that not all right-wing militias hold extremist views. ""I have listened to many hours of 'patriot' conversations that didn't sound all that different from what you would hear during a typical evening on Fox News,"" he writes. ""Many seemed to have joined the cause for social reasons, or because they liked guns, or because they wanted to be part of something they saw as historic and grandiose--not because their views were far more radical than those of typical right-leaning Americans.""This is not exactly reassuring, since the politics of right-leaning, Fox News-watching Americans have grown more extreme. With nearly half of the Republicanssurveyedby Larry Bartels prepared to take the law into their own hands, Trump has nearly succeeded in transforming his party into a mob of vigilantes. Don't be fooled into thinking that the president is a law-and-order candidate. He flourishes in chaos and routinely flouts the law. By siding with right-wing militias and their ilk, he daily undermines the state's monopoly on legitimate violence. The debate over defunding the police must be seen in this context. In a country awash in guns and grassroots racism, with a major party flirting with mob violence, getting rid of police departments would be akin to jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire of uncontained extremism. Sure, local law enforcement needs major reforms, massive civic oversight, and right-sized budgets. Police departments must be purged ofwhite nationalists and neo-Nazis. The Pentagon has to stop supplying the copswith military-grade weaponry. But remember: the police can be reformed. What was once an all-white force nowbetter reflectsAmerica's diversity. The mob, by definition, is not subject to reforms or any oversight whatsoever. This is no time to permit the return of frontier justice administered by white mobs and a lawless president, especially with a critical election looming. Mob violence has often accompanied elections in the past, with rival factions fighting over the results, as in thestreet battles of 1874in New Orleans between Republican integrationists and racist Democrats. Like nineteenth-century Louisiana, the struggle this November is not just about Democrats versus Republicans. It's about the rule of law versus racist vigilantism. White supremacy is not going to give up its hold on power without a fight. If you thought you'd seen real American carnage in Trump's four years in office, prepare yourself for the chaotic aftermath of the November election. The mob is itching to take the law into its own hands one more time on behalf of its very own mobster-in-chief.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0630007265286011,0.3873937618711139,4229,2,Common Dreams

Mr Trump has repeatedly boasted about the state of the economy, with its run of strong markets, and record levels of employment.“Despite all of the cynics, I have never been more confident in America’s future,” he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month. He claims actions he took were responsible for the economy’s current state of affairs, while critics point out he was left strong fundamentals by his predecessor. The same could not be same for Mr Obama, who was elected to office, as probably the worst economic crisis since the 1930s took hold. GettyAPGettyAFP/GettyGettyReutersAmong his very first acts, was a plan to reestablish confidence in the markets and banks to prevent further losses. In a tweet posted on President’s Day, a federal holiday held to mark the birthday of George Washington, Mr Obama said the day marked another important anniversary.“Eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history,” he wrote. If Mr Obama was hoping to hit a nerve with his successor, he appeared to have succeeded. Mr Trump responded angrily, tweeting: ""Did you hear the latest con job? President Obama is now trying to take credit for the Economic Boom taking place under the Trump Administration. He had the WEAKEST recovery since the Great Depression, despite Zero Fed Rate & MASSIVE quantitative easing. NOW, best jobs numbers....""....ever.

426,"How Police ""Gang Databases"" Are Being Used to Wage War on Immigrants",-12.33,40.33,https://inthesetimes.com/article/gang-databases-ice-immigration-sanctuary-cities,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"CHICAGO — Wilmer Catalan-Ramirez had lived in the United States for more than10years when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agentsentered his home and forcefully arrested him without a warrant in2017. He spent the next10months in the McHenry County Adult Correctional Facility. He was never charged with a crime and was released in January2018. The Chicago Police Department had erroneously entered Catalan-Ramirez’s name into its database of gang members, then shared that information with ICE, which acted on the bad intelligence. Federal immigration authorities can access similar secret gang databases around the country. Critics say the databasesrely on flimsy evidence and all but criminalize being a young person of color. And if the Biden administration’s statedimmigration priorityof cracking down on criminal organizations is any indication, the practice may be here to stay.“It is not surprising,” says Jane Shim, senior policy attorney atthe Immigrant Defense Project,a nonprofit working to expand migrant rights.​“It was disappointing, however. … There has been so much research and organizing and advocacy around [gang] databases and all of their problems, their inaccuracies, the really problematic ways they are used by both law enforcement and immigration.”Often all it takes for a Black or Brown person to be added to a gang database is to stand on a specific street corner, have a certain tattoo or meet with a suspected gang member. Once in the database, they are officially​“a threat to public safety.” If their immigration status is in question, they become a deportation priority.“Identifying certain categories of people who we [as a society] are comfortable with targeting and putting through this really harmful, cruel process of deportation and detention is kind of the backbone of the modern immigration system,” Shim says. The Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn Collegereports that, between2013and2018, more than17,000people were added to New York City’s gang database,98% of whom were Black or Latinx. A2019Chicago Office of Inspector General’s reportfound that95% of individuals designated as gang members during arrests in the city were Black or Latinx. The names in Boston’s gang database are90% Black or Latinx, according to records obtainedby the ACLU of Massachusetts in2019. Kerry Doyle, a Boston attorney and former chair of the New England Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, says that information from local gang databases is often too unreliable to hold up in criminal cases, but​“immigration judges take it as the truth.”In2017, Doyle represented a young Central American migrant who was detained in the United States for30months without criminal charges. Her client’s mistake was socializing with alleged gang members. Gang databases have drawn criticism from national civil rights groups including Human Rights Watch and Detention Watch Network,which co-signed an April1petitioncalling on the Department of Homeland Security to end its discriminatory​“prioritization” practices. Data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC),a research organization at Syracuse University, finds ICE detained and booked into civil immigration detention62% fewer people in February (1,970), the first whole month of the Biden administration, than in January (5,119), the last of the Trump administration. But gang databases could still play an outsize role in the future of immigration. The American Dream and Promise Act, which passed the House in March, would open a path to citizenship for2.5million undocumented immigrants — but anyone in a gang database will likely be excluded.“Legislators have chosen to turn their backs on those who are most harmed by the immigration system,” the National Immigration Project says about the bill. That includes​“every Black or Latinx immigrant standing on a street corner with their friends whose name was put in a gang database because of the color of their skin.”While advocates push the federal government to end the use of these databases in immigration matters, people like Catalan-Ramirez remain vulnerable. Even so-called sanctuary cities like Boston offer federal agents access to these unreliable databases. But in some cities, activist pressure is building. The Boston City Council recently helda hearing on its gang database. And in Chicago, democratic socialist aldermen Carlos Ramirez-Rosa and Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez leda successful campaign to ban city police from cooperating with ICE.“We are focusing right now on engaging with local representatives and other people in Chicago,” says Xanat Sobrevilla of Organized Communities Against Deportation (OCAD), a group of undocumented activiststhat campaigned for Catalan-Ramirez’s release.​“We are hoping to work to pass [a city] ordinance that would eliminate the local database … to further disconnect this tool from ICE.”I hope you found this article important.

428,Most Americans like remote work — but Democrats like it more,-6.67,34.67,https://www.vox.com/recode/22576811/remote-work-survey-data-for-progress-democrats-republicans-approval,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"Most Americans approve of letting people work from home. But like many things in the US, that perception depends on one’s politics. While Republicans are overall positive about remote work, they were less likely to approve of it compared with Democrats (81 percent versus 89 percent), according to a new poll by Vox and Data for Progress. Additionally, Republicans were less likely to say remote workers labored just as hard or harder than non-remote workers (50 percent versus 75 percent). Republicans were also less likely than Democrats to say remote workers were equally or more productive than non-remote workers (57 percent versus 71 percent). The survey of more than 1,000 people was conducted online earlier this month and is weighted to be representative of the US adult population. Despite the difference between Republicans and Democrats, the high approval rate overall is a good sign for those who would like to continue working from home after the pandemic. Positive perceptions about remote work could help ensure its continuance — especially since workers and their employers have some disagreements about the future of remote work. More than halfof Americans worked from home earlier in the pandemic. And it went surprisingly well, withworkers, theirmanagers, andobjective studiesreporting that employees maintained or increased their levels of productivity. So it makes sense that over the course of the pandemic, employees’ desire to continue working from home increased, and so did employers’ willingness to let them. But there’s still a gap between what employees want and what employers say they’re going to do, according to data from astudyauthored in part byStanford professor Nicholas Bloom. Employees would like to work from home about half the time, while employers plan to let them do so about one day a week. As the more acute effects of the pandemic are subsiding and the number of people who work remotely isdeclining,numeroussurveysofemployers— as well as agiant increase in the number of remote job listings— suggest that many Americans will continue to work from home at least some of the time even when the pandemic ends. What’s less clear is how often that will be. As for the difference between Republicans and Democrats, it’s possible the survey responses reflect the political makeup of remote workers. The survey sample size wasn’t large enough to accurately look at the political parties of those who worked remotely. However, the responses were equally positive among people who did and didn’t work remotely. That’s consistent withdata from Boston Consulting Groupthat said the majority of people, regardless of whether it was feasible in their industry, wanted to work remotely. But we also know that states whose voters lean Republican had a lower rate of working from home during the pandemic (30 percent) than Democratic states (35 percent), according to the Bloom study, which measured the overall work from home rate at 33 percent from May 2020 to March 2021. The desire to work from home after Covid-19 was only slightly higher for Democrats (46 percent versus 45 for Republicans).“Trump aligned the Republican Party to being more working-class and less educated, and these jobs have a far lower ability to work from home,” Bloom told Recode in an email. Overall, though, working from home is a valuable perk, with the average employee saying it’s worth about 7 percent of their salary, according to Bloom’s study. It’s not worth much more than that. Our survey, which asked whether people would prefer the ability to work from home or to receive a 10 percent pay raise, found that two-thirds of people would go for the raise. In addition to the 25 percent of employed people whose jobs are currently fully remote, another 30 percent said some of their work could be done remotely. It’s likely more jobs will have remote possibilities asemployers use it as a perkto attract workers in what’s a very tight job market. How commonplace remote work ends up being remains to be seen, but proponents of the practice have public opinion on their side.

429,Lawmakers Question Legality of Trump Accepting GOP Nomination From White House,-8.33,48.33,https://truthout.org/articles/lawmakers-question-legality-of-trump-accepting-gop-nomination-from-white-house/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"Former Vice President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that he would not be going to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, later this month to deliver his acceptance speech for the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. Before the coronavirus pandemic reached the United States earlier this year, it was assumed that the Democratic nominee would accept the nomination in person as was customary. Instead, Biden will be delivering his acceptance speech from his home state of Delaware, and likely not in the presence of a crowd given the concerns around the rise in COVID-19 infections in the U. S. Other speakers slated to speak at the Democratic National Convention will also not be making the trip to Milwaukee. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, who has had his own set of troubles nailing down a place to accept the nomination for president on the Republican ticket, made a controversial statement Wednesday morning on “Fox & Friends” that he may just use the White House itself to give his acceptance speech.“It’s easy and I think it’s a beautiful setting,” Trump explained. “And we are thinking about that. It’s certainly one of the alternatives. It’s the easiest alternative. I think it’s a beautiful alternative.”The idea of using the White House, a government-funded place of official business for the chief executive, for a political purpose would be highly controversial, if not illegal. Under the Hatch Act, no federal employee may use government resources to promote political causes or purposes. While Trump isn’t technically subject to the Hatch Act, others at the White House who work under him are, and could be found in violation of it if they’re seen assisting him in any way with the speech. Although in the same interview Trump also said he could “go someplace else” if people had qualms about him using the executive residence for his political speech, it nevertheless set off a number of criticisms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle shortly after he made the suggestion. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California), for example, said “it’s very wrong” for Trump to use the White House in such a way.“For the President of the United States to degrade once again the White House as he has done over and over again by saying he’s going to completely politicize it, is something that should be rejected right out of hand,” Pelosi explained. A number of Republicans in Congress were also averse to using the White House for Trump’s campaign speech, including John Thune, a high-ranking Republican senator from South Dakota.“Is that even legal?” Thune asked out loud when confronted with the question.“I assume that’s not something that you could do,” he added. “I assume the re’s some Hatch Act issues or something … I think anything to do with federal property would seem to me to be problematic.”Richard Painter, who served as White House ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, agreed that Trump would be making things incredibly difficult for those who are subject to the law on the matter.“He may not be violating the Hatch Act, but he is ordering other people to. At a certain point you are using White House resources, and that is a violation of the Hatch Act,” Painter said. Kedric Payne, the senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, agreed.“Government employees cannot wear or display campaign material at the White House,” Payne told The Washington Post. “The RNC would have a difficult time arguing that they can reimburse for the expenses, because how do you calculate such things as the fair market value of the White House lawn?”The time to figure out a venue to accept the nomination is winding down, but there are still a few weeks left to make a decision. Trump is scheduled to accept his party’s nomination on August 27. Biden will accept the Democratic Party’s nomination just one week earlier, on August 20.",3,Reliable,0.065063492063492,0.3866269841269841,823,1,Truthout
430,"Jim Hormel: Buttigieg, not Grenell, will be the first out LGBTQ Cabinet official",-6.0,42.0,https://www.washingtonblade.com/2020/12/17/jim-hormel-buttigieg-not-grenell-will-be-the-first-out-lgbtq-cabinet-official/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-blade-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"In the aftermath of President-elect Joe Biden nominating Pete Buttigieg as secretary of transportation, the left and right are at each other’s throats over whether Biden’s pick will be the first openly gay Cabinet official, or if that distinction belongs to former acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell — but one appointee who achieved a historic first for the LGBTQ community says the honor falls to Buttigieg. Former U. S. Ambassador to Luxembourg Jim Hormel, who became the first openly gay U. S. ambassador in 1999 after President Bill Clinton gave him the job through a recess appointment, downplayed Grenell on Thursday and said the real achievement “as the first openly LGBTQ member of the presidential Cabinet” goes to Buttigieg.“Pete Buttigieg will be nominated as secretary of transportation, subject to confirmation by the Senate,” Hormel said. “Following his approval he will serve with full authority at the will of the president. He will be the first official openly LGBT member of the Cabinet. His appointment, if approved, will be a milestone.”Hormel, now 87 and responding to an inquiry from the Washington Blade via email, said the basis for rejecting Grenell’s appointment as a first for the LGBTQ community rests with the word “acting” in the Trump appointee’s title.“The president may appoint an individual to be temporary ‘acting’ head of an agency, bureau or department,” Hormel said. “That appointee can serve in that capacity for a limited period of time without being confirmed by the Senate. Trump has used ‘acting’ appointments time and again, thus avoiding Senate inquiries and investigations.”Like Grenell, Hormel never won Senate confirmation for his presidential appointment. Conservative senators, including the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) and former Sen. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.), refused to allow the Senate to confirm Hormel explicitly on the basis of his being gay. Clinton had to short-circuit the process, using his presidential powers to grant Hormel a recess appointment. But Hormel at least sought Senate approval for his role. Grenell neither sought nor obtained confirmation as acting director of national intelligence, although he had won confirmation for his concurrent role as U. S. ambassador to Germany. Even though Hormel and Grenell had similarities in not obtaining Senate confirmation, Hormel said his “situation differed in two ways.”“First, the hierarchy within the State Department is unique,” Hormel explained. “In the absence of an ambassador there is a charge‘ d’affaires who assumes the duties of ambassador. There is no ‘acting’ position per se. Secondly, in my case, I went through the process of confirmation, but the Senate was prevented from voting. The president then made a recess appointment, and I went to my post fully accredited.”Grenell, who didn’t respond to a request for comment for this article, has largely stayed away from the fray on social media on who gets to be called the first openly gay Cabinet member. However, Grenell upon leaving his post as acting DNI this year posted on Instagram that Trump gave him his chair from the Cabinet room and told him being the first openly gay Cabinet official was a “big deal.“Grenell also said during the election in a video that he was the “first openly gay Cabinet member,” which he said demonstrates Trump is “the most pro-gay” president ever despite the anti-LGBTQ record the administration has built. (The Log Cabin video, though widely seen, was also criticized for inaccuracies and takingfacts and quotes out of context. During the Biden team’s announcement on Wednesday, Buttigieg was careful in his language about the milestone he was setting out to achieve and said his nomination marked “the first time an American president has ever sent an openly LGBTQ cabinet nominee to the Senate for confirmation.”But Buttigieg also recognized he was following in the footsteps of LGBTQ pioneers, explicitly recognizing Hormel’s achievement.“I can remember watching the news, 17 years old and seeing a story about an appointee of President Clinton, named to be an ambassador, attacked and ultimately denied a vote in the Senate, because he was gay — ultimately able to serve only by a recess appointment,” Buttigieg said. Buttigieg, who made history as a gay Democratic candidate in the 2020 primary said at the time his career aspiration was to become an airline pilot and “was a long way from coming out, even to myself,” but gained knowledge from Hormel’s story.“I learned about some of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong, and just as important, I saw how those limits could be challenged,” Buttigieg said. “So, two decades later, I can’t help but think of a 17-year-old who might be watching right now, someone who wonders whether and where they belong in the world, or even in their own family, and I’m thinking about the message today’s announcement is sending to them.”Hormel, in the email to the Blade the day after Buttigieg praised him, was able to return the favor by offering support.“I enthusiastically support the nomination of Pete Buttigieg as secretary of transportation and will acknowledge him as the first openly LGBTQ member of the presidential Cabinet,” Hormel said.",3,Reliable,0.1478826530612245,0.3783503401360544,1172,3,Washington Blade
431,Hopes and Doubts in Beijing,-3.33,46.67,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-11-13/hopes-and-doubts-beijing,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,17,"Never before has Beijing paid such close attention to the outcome of a U. S. presidential election. Chinese leadersrecognizethat competition will define U. S.-Chinese relations no matter who occupies the White House. But they also believe that former Vice President Joe Biden’s triumph over President Donald Trump provides an opportunity to halt—or at the very least slow—the two countries’ alarming march to confrontation. Relations have deteriorated at an astonishing rate during Trump’s presidency. The trade war has been the most conspicuous example of friction, but larger strategic tensions have also heightened the risk of conflict. The Trump administration’s barrage of blame, overtly racist remarks, policies aimed at decoupling, and rhetoric advocating regime change has jolted many officials in the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Unsurprisingly, the prevailing mood on Chinese social media in the wake of the U. S. election is one of relief and optimism, although views of Trump among the general public are by no means uniform. A popular Internet meme captured the public’s enthusiasm for a Biden presidency, rechristening Beijing’s Forbidden City as the “For-Biden City.”But moods of optimism can turn quickly. Only four years ago, China received the news of Trump’s election with similar enthusiasm. Many Chinese leaders viewed Trump as a businessman with whom they could get things done. That proved to be wishful thinking. China’s foreign policy establishment is wary but cautiously optimistic about better relations with a Biden administration. Still, many of the conditions that shaped Trump’s China policy still exist, and resetting relations between the world’s greatest powers will not be easy. During U. S. presidential elections, Chinese leaders have historically avoided suggesting any preference for a particular candidate. The long-standingofficial lineis that “China neverinterferes in the internal affairs of the United States.” But China’s leadership was generally pessimistic about the prospects for improving relations with the United States as long as Trump was at the helm. Although some Chinese decision-makers believed the chaos and bluster of another Trump term would strengthen China, they have also witnessed how the U. S. president’s unpredictable foreign policy pushes both countries closer and closer to conflict. The Trump administration’s actions toward Taiwan have been of particular concern to the Chinese. With the passage in the U. S. Congress of the Taiwan Travel Act of 2018 and the 2019 Taipei Act—bills that have strengthened U. S.-Taiwanese relations and were signed into law by Trump—Beijing fears that Washington is edging toward recognizing Taiwan as an independent country. The administration’s actions and rhetoric on this front have hardened antipathy toward Trump within the CCP leadership and bolstered those Chinese officials eager to take an aggressive approach toward the United States. Beijing believes the Trump administration has sought to defeat China in much the same way that the United States defeated the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Some Trump officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and the senior trade adviser Peter Navarro, have even called for regime change in China. As a result, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the CCP leadership were under no illusions about the possibility of tranquil, harmonious coexistence with a second Trump administration. During an October event in Beijing to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Korean War, Xi urged China’s military to prepare for potential conflict with the United States. In his words, China will “use war to prevent war.”Chinese leaders know that U. S. hostility toward China isn’t confined to the Trump administration. Both Republicans and Democrats have directed harsh criticism at Beijing and advocated decoupling U. S. supply chains from China. At the same time, many Chinese officials don’t believe there is an anti-China consensus in Washington. One noteworthy episode during the vice-presidential debate—when neither Vice President Mike Pence nor California Senator Kamala Harris could give a clear answer about whether the United States sees China as a competitor, a rival, or an enemy—garnered the attention of opinion makers in Beijing. It seemed to underscore the lack of a strategic framework for U. S.-Chinese relations in Washington. Biden has also routinely characterized Trump’s China policy as a failure, suggesting to Chinese officials that the incoming administration will not adopt all of Trump’s confrontational positions, including the goal of decoupling. Analysts within the Chinese foreign policy establishmentare pleasedto see that theBiden foreignpolicy teamfeatures many seasoned professionals with reputations for sensible diplomacy. It has been widely observed in both China and the United States that Biden and Xi maintained a long and friendly working relationship during their overlapping tenures as vice presidents of their respective countries. According to Daniel Russel, a former senior official in President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, Biden and Ximetat least eight times and spent roughly 25 hours together in one-on-one meetings within a span of 18 months in 2011 and 2012. Biden spoke harshly about Xi and the CCP during the presidential debates, but Chinese officials understood those remarks as rhetoric for domestic consumption, not a foreshadowing of Biden’s foreign policy. More broadly, China’s U. S. watchers have come torealizethat their long-standing view dating back to the era of President Richard Nixon of Republicans as friendlier and easier to work with than Democrats no longer holds true. Chinese researchers point out that all 15 congressional members of the China Task Force—a group known for its hawkish approach toward Beijing—are Republicans; that 229 Democrats in the House of Representativesvoted in favorof a September congressional resolution condemning all forms of anti-Chinese discrimination, but only 14 Republicans supported the resolution (and 164 opposed it); and that numerous U. S. public opinionsurveys showRepublicans to be far more hostile to China than Democrats. But even if Beijing is more predisposed to work with a Democratic U. S. administration, a significant reset of the bilateral relationship will be tricky. Chinese leaders tend to attribute the deterioration in U. S.-Chinese relations entirely to the Trump administration’s desire to contain China’s rise. There is no recognition in Beijing of legitimate U. S. concerns regarding unfair Chinese economic and technological practices and its aggressive behavior in the Asia-Pacific region. On the U. S. side, the criticism of the CCP by Republicans in the Trump administration and in Congress—as well as the general public’s hostility to China—poses a major barrier to the new administration’s attempts at rapprochement. The likelihood of a Republican-controlled Senate after the election makes reversing course still more difficult. Chinese officials understand that the serious political divide exposed by the election result—with the United States highly polarized—will force Biden to assuage domestic tensions and could leave him without the political capital to fully transform U. S. China policy. Moreover, Chinese leaders fear that in an effort to bridge partisan divisions, the Biden administration may see an aggressive China policy as a means of finding common ground with Republicans. If so, confrontation between the two countries could continue, or even accelerate, instead of giving way to a more stable balance between cooperation and competition. The Biden administration will surely continue to articulate concerns about Chinese human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Biden could even bring greater force to these criticisms, wedding them to the wider moral mission of defending human rights and searching for racial justice at home. He will likely be more effective than Trump was at harnessing American soft power in U. S. outreach to the Chinese people. Of course, it is highly doubtful that Beijing would meet the full demands of the United States and the international community on these matters; Chinese authorities view unrest in its peripheral regions as a threat to their country’s national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and domestic stability. As a result, Beijing’s conduct in these restive areas is not up for negotiation. Xi and Biden in Beijing, December 2013Lintao Zhang / ReutersThe Chinese leadership is weighing all these possible trajectories of a Biden China policy and seems to be hedging its bets on the incoming administration. On the one hand, Beijing will be eager to reengage with the United States in multiple areas. During Obama’s eight-year tenure, there were as many as 105 government-sponsored bilateral dialogues on subjects including women’s leadership, early childhood education, space exploration, cybercrime, and climate change. The Trump administration condensed those channels to four during the first two years of the administration and subsequently discontinued them entirely. In line with Biden’s foreign policy agenda, China will be particularly interested in working collaboratively on issues of global public health (especially the shared battle against COVID-19), climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, antiterrorism, cybersecurity, and global economic and financial stability. This past summer, Yang Jiechi, one of China’s top diplomats,outlinedthese subjects as areas for close U. S.-Chinese coordination and cooperation. In addition, he saw the possibility of cooperation with the United States in addressing geopolitical challenges in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East. At the same time, however, Beijing believes that China’s economic recovery, its internal handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its relative sociopolitical stability, and its growing international clout give it added leverage in the bilateral relationship. The Chinese leadership may accommodate U. S. demands in certain areas, but it will likely remain firm and uncompromising on anything touching on China’s self-declared core interests of its claim to sovereignty over Taiwan and the maintenance of CCP rule. Unquestionably, tensions with China will persist as the Biden administration navigates the areas where it will cooperate and where it will compete with Beijing. But some influential Chinese scholars see in Biden’s victory the potential for a more productive relationship. Shi Yinhong, a professor of American studies at Renmin University and an adviser to the State Council (the top government organ),recently arguedthat Biden would provide stability and predictability in U. S. policy toward China. In Shi’s view, however, the window of opportunity to stop “tit for tat” escalation with the Biden administration will be brief. The growing influence of China on the world stage and the volatile domestic political environment in the United States will make it harder to patch up the bilateral relationship. Both Beijing and Washington, Shi insists, should not miss the precious opportunity available in the coming months to reexamine past missteps and to reset relations. Shi departs somewhat from the party line in his desire for overcoming the zero-sum mindset, reflecting the goodwill many public intellectuals and Chinese citizens have for the United States—and for the incoming Biden administration in particular. Time will tell how such views might inform the decisions of China’s leadership.",3,Reliable,0.0725787386266428,0.3338564645600574,2329,3,Foreign Affairs
432,Build Back Better for Whom? How Neoliberalism (Re)creates Disaster Risks,-17.0,39.33,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/build-back-better-for-whom-how-neoliberalism-recreates-disaster-risks,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"On November 23, 2020 a ripple went across social media—Joe Biden’s transition website was now registered as “buildbackbetter.gov.” For most people the news here was that the website had received a .gov web address, signifying the official move of the Biden team from contesting an election to wielding power. For people who study disasters though, the news was another chapter in this odd detour of the concept “Build Back Better.”Build Back Better,a phrasefamiliar todisaster researchers, international development experts, and others of the lanyard set who tend to see disasters as “natural events,” has suddenly, strangely, penetrated into the year 2021 as a political slogan. For many who have been operating under the standards of Build Back Better—or those of us who have been actively seeking to critique it—the reaction to this odd parallel life has ranged from enraged and perplexed to dismissive and indifferent. However, for those of us who understanddisasters as part of a socio-political process, this new domain for the slogan was not totally surprising. The origins of Build Back Better are easy enough to pin down—it was foundfloating around the international development/post-disaster reconstruction world by Bill Clinton following the 2005 Indian Ocean tsunami. Since then Build Back Better has become a set of best practices for international frameworks for post-disaster recovery. While the origins of Build Back Better as a concept are simple to outline, the baggage it carries and its relevance to our current moment may not be clear to people who have not grappled with the concept in the context of disasters for the past decade. At the close of World War II, a new order of governments and government-backed international agencieslatched onto international developmentas a tool to even out the inequalities of a global capitalist economy. Both international development and post-disaster reconstruction would develop in an intertwined relationship. The elite actors steering the world economy shared a fundamental belief that prosperity, as brought about by development, would become the stabilizing factor in the post-war world. To this end, trade, globalization, and urbanization were seen as drivers of stability. In the developed yet damaged world, this prosperity was to be revived. In the developing world, this dynamic was brought about through policy and restructuring influences, often imposed by the developed countries. The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference was convened at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in July of 1944. It brought together the 44 member nations of the Allied Powers in an effort to prevent a widespread international economic disaster resulting from the destruction and disruption caused by World War II. The participants in what is now informally referred to as Bretton Woods understood that fascism and the destabilization of Europe that had led to the war was in part the result of an ineffective, if not poorly considered, international approach to the aftermath of World War I. The Bretton Woods strategygave birth to both the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was designed to stabilize global financial markets, and the World Bank, which would engage in reconstruction and development. One of the roles of the capitalist state is to mediate unrest. A disaster is the possibility for unrest— not in terms of panic or riots, but in the creation of spontaneous alternatives to the present formation. At the end of World War II, the Allies worked to confront the mass destruction of the physical environment and theradical political changesthat were necessitated by a mass military confrontation. For example,the reconstruction of Japanled not just to new urban forms for cities across the country, but to a new constitution as well. Likewise, the reconstruction of Germany involved the construction of buildings, as well as the early infrastructure of the Cold War. The moment called for radical action. However, this radical action could not be allowed to disrupt the dominance of capital. As these powerful actors considered the fate of the future world, they sought to maintain their own stability. Institutions formed to repair a world scarred by war—namely the IMF and the World Bank—would find other crises to apply themselves to. These institutions were created in line with the ideology of international development, but this ideology was not static. Over the decades this globalized effort to move beyond the destruction of World War II transformed into a new formation of ideology, policies, and laws known as neoliberalism. During the 1960s embedded liberalism suffered multiple breakdowns in individual countries, spreading outward to the international economy. This crisis of capitalism reached a breaking point with the stagflation of the 1970s. Both Thatcherism and Reaganism came to power, in the U. K. and the United States respectively, offering austerity, privatization, and a deconstruction of the social safety net as solutions to this crisis. As neoliberalism became the pervading ideology and policy set of the Global North in the 1970s, it would also establish itself as the predominant driver of international development and post-disaster reconstruction. The United Nationsdefines Building Back Betteras, “The use of the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phases after a disaster to increase the resilience of nations and communities through integrating disaster risk reduction measures into the restoration of physical infrastructure and societal systems, and into the revitalization of livelihoods, economies, and the environment.” Since its formal introduction to disaster risk reduction (DRR) by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015, “Build Back Better” has been adopted by various INGOs, including the IFRC, the Asian Development Bank, and many others—and has stayed largely within the DRR domain until very recently. During the COVID-19 pandemic it has become a slogan for economic recovery: the OECDused Build Back Betterto outline the post-pandemic plans for a more resilient and sustainable economy; the European Commissionused the slogan in Maywhen announcing their €750 billion stimulus fund. Build Back Better also became a cliché on many policymakers’ lips. On June 30, 2020, the U. K. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonpromisedto undertake “the most radical reforms to our planning system since the Second World War” as this will help to “, build back greener, build back faster” in order to boost spending on infrastructure as a way for “levelling up the country” and avoiding economic recession. It was alsoused byCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and became a centerpiece for American President-elect Biden’s campaign (and now presidential transition). The emphasis of BBB is on continuity–i.e., to keep on going no matter what. The goal is not to alleviate the original conditions that created a crisis, but rather to quickly move past the crisis without altering the underlying political, economic, and societal structures. This emphasizes the core of neoliberalism: not as a mode of economic management, but as a mode of political rationality and government reasoning that constructs and regulates the realm within which a disaster—and then the reconstruction—occur . The contradiction here is that a disaster exposes, and is grounded in, the underlying inequalities in society while neoliberal capitalism relies on the maintenance of those same inequalities. In a disaster, people can lose their livelihoods, shelter, family, sense of dignity, and the physical infrastructure that makes their daily lives possible. What we should always keep in mind, however, is that disasters do not affect everyone equally. Those who are most marginalized in our day-to-day existence are those who are most harmed by disasters. For African Americans forced by geographic segregation to live in flood-prone low-lying areas, or Sri Lankan fishing communities eking out a subsistence living in wooden shanties in the shadows of international resorts, a disaster is not a new, sudden, or unexpected danger. It is a continuation of everyday harm inflicted on those relegated to the margins of society. Disasters don’t simply bring about suffering—they expose it. For those who have no voice in decision-making, no claim to an official place to live, a livelihood tied to meager natural resources or a degraded environment, trauma, suffering, and displacement are not unique to a disaster event. Yet, disasters offer an opportunity—often at a large scale— to improve the material conditions of everyday life for masses of people. This is not only in terms of higher standards of safety and construction, but also in the possibility to address the root causes of disasters—i.e., inequality and injustice rooted in our socio-political structures. Disasters can be a chance to make things better. For example, theGreat Hanshin Earthquakeof 1995 led to a strengthening of building codes across Japan, which saved many lives during the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. However, in the context of neoliberalism, the “better” in the slogan Build Back Better does not always mean good for all, meaning that the benefits are not always (and in fact, are rarely) fairly distributed. In order to find the answers that can truly lead to disaster risk reduction instead of disaster risk (re)creation and the re-establishment of the status quo, we need to first consider the following questions: Who decides what is better? Better for whom? What do we need to do better?Characterized as a way for people and societies to become “more resilient,” Build Back Better epitomizes the problematic ideology of resilience. Disasters areoften portrayedasunexpected external shocksand are frequently naturalized and framed as inevitable, meaning that their root causes cannot be altered, and thus it iswho must adapt. Resilienceand its ability to resolve all contemporary issues has become a useful neoliberal narrative to explain anything fromhow individuals should actandcope withhazards, risks and disasters, to a mainstreamed approach to development. Portrayed as something “good,” resilience has become an important goal that needs to be achieved no matter what. Under neoliberal conditions, resilience therefore can be interpreted as the ability to survive under the conditions of destitution. Such resilience is profitable because “resilient” people can—as sociologist Sarah Bracke notes in her 2016 essay “Bouncing back: vulnerability and resistance in times of resilience”—“absorb the impact of austerity measures and continue to be productive.”As such, the resilience message essentially tells the most oppressed that they should keep taking knock after knock and get better at coping. In a post-disaster setting, the calls for resilience highlight the idea of “self-reliance,” dismantling the redistributive functions of the state instead of providing for the emancipatory social change that is needed in a post-disaster reconstruction if it is to truly reduce disaster risks. Resilience fetishizes the status quo of our social system, to which only few want to go back. The discourse of resilience is highly compatible with the neoliberal ideological frames that, just like resilience, are malleable, nebulous, multifaceted, and replete with contradictions. In fact, resilience has only become popular because it fits so well with the neoliberal discourse. In his propositions for Build Back Better, Clinton stated that “disasters and the response to them can exacerbate existing patterns of vulnerability and discrimination within societies” and that “it is incumbent upon governments, donors, and assistance providers to ensure that relief and recovery efforts do not exacerbate historic patterns of vulnerability, discrimination, and disadvantage.” But is this possible in a society based on neoliberal values that do not coexist well with the values of equality? Here, a famous phrase that states neoliberalism is socialism for few and hardcore capitalism for many comes to mind. Treated as apolitical, Build Back Better is enclaved as a non-political matter, whereas in reality it relies on markets and re-establishes the existing status quo, given that governments need to lead the way. This process re-inserts, or introduces, neoliberal capitalism rather than seeking any alternative. It is also a process of re-establishing “normality,” in which “normal” refers to the hegemonic social structures by which certain subjects are rendered “normal” and “natural” by contrasting them with other subjects deemed “perverse” and “pathological.”Build Back Better has been proposed as a technocratic managerial solution to a crisis. However, such a solution does not stop the spread of precarity. Moreover, given that a crisis is often rooted in extraction, weak governance, or profiteering, one triggering crisis should not be the narrow starting point for a Build Back Better strategy. The concept of Build Back Better needs to focus on eliminating processes that created risk in the first place instead of reconstructing these processes. The ideal of Build Back Better is commendable, but as it is founded on a Western neoliberal tradition, the slogan seems to be missing a somewhat important part: “building back better.” In its current implementation, Build Back Better and its calls for rebuilding the economy, infrastructure, and revitalization of human resources, keeps the subaltern invisible. It allows elite actors to define what is and what isn’t a risk, who is and isn’t responsible for them, and what forms of action are to be taken in response to these risks. It shows a capacity to accommodate (i.e., make “better”)—but not actively change—social and political systems that create risk in the first place. People affected by disasters are offered a choice: be left to suffer through a disaster with little to no organized international assistance, or to be integrated into globalized neoliberal development that would oppress them further. Of course, this is not a choice but a hostage situation—decades of manufactured inequality with the only avenue of escape being through a disaster recovery managed by the same elite technocrats who brought them inequality in the first place. This is the same dilemma facing Americans under the Biden transition—accept the capable technocrats of the existing order or be branded as a fan of the chaos of the Trump administration. Recent Biden cabinet appointmentshave trended in this direction: Tony Blinken as Secretary of State, Janet Yellen as Secretary of the Treasury, and John Kerry as special climate envoy are defended as experienced steady hands who will make sure that the gears grind effectively. This, of course, avoids the question ofis being ground in the gears and whether or not we need these gears to turn at all. This dynamic is all too familiar to anyone who studies post-disaster recovery. The only alternative given to being absorbed by the blob of consultants, technocrats, and international agencies is turmoil and squalor. But this shouldn’t be the case. If we believe that another world is possible, then we do not have to accept the false binary choice of lesser evils. Disaster recovery—political or otherwise—presents us with the opportunity for revolutionary change. But it is an uphill battle.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1296054827940421,0.3511627014699047,3225,2,Current Affairs

Trump's approval comes after days of the president withholding his signature despite the loomingexpiration of unemployment benefitsand a government shutdown. Trump also spent the week publicly denouncing the size of thesecond stimuluscheck his administration helped negotiate.""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000. Or $4,000 for a couple,""Trump said in a videoposted Tuesday. On Saturday and Christmas Day, he also tweeted about the ""measly $600,"" while continuing to press for a $2,000 per-person maximum in asecond stimulus check. The package allocates asecond stimulus check for a maximum of $600forqualifying adultsand theirchild dependents. As with theCARES Act from March, thesecond stimulus checkhas a sliding scale based on youradjusted gross income, andnot everyone will qualifyfor the $600 direct payment. The stimulus package also includes an additional$300 per week in federal unemployment insurance, a tax credit to help businesses pay employees and funding for distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. The IRS is expected to startsending the second stimulus checks, which the agency calls economic impact payments, in about a week, through a mix ofphysical checks in the mail,direct deposits, andEIP cards, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Dec. 21. The US House of Representatives passed the bill Monday, with the Senate passing it later that evening. Trump's signature was the final step needed to pass the bill, which is now considered law. Thissecond stimulus checkthat millions of Americans will receive is a fraction ofthe $1,200 checkallocated in March as part of the relief package in the CARES Act. It comes at a time whencoronavirusinfections are surging in many parts of the country. The package also comes as the US jobs market continues to suffer. Last week, more than 885,000 Americans filed for first time unemployment benefits,according to the US Labor Department. With the health and economic crisis deepening, Congress was under pressure to pass a relief measure before the end of the year. This deal was the result of months of negotiations among the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties, most notably the four top congressional leaders: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York; and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California. In addition to the individual stimulus checks, the$900 billion packagealso includes an additional$300 a week in jobless benefits, which will run for 11 weeks starting Dec. 27, 2020, and ending March 14, 2021. The bill also provides critically needed funds for small businesses, schools, broadband subsidies and vaccine distribution throughout the country. Specifically, the legislation provides $325 billion for small-business loans and grants. There's $69 billion forCOVID-19 vaccineprocurement and distribution and $82 billion for K-12 schools, colleges and universities to help mitigate the effects of the pandemic. In addition to these programs, the bill also provides $3.2 billion in broadband subsidies for low-income Americans and those financially impacted byCOVID-19, to cover monthly service fees. The legislation also provides $1 billion for tribal land connectivity. This money lets broadband providers offer a $50 subsidy ($75 on tribal lands) to help those who are already eligible for the Federal Communications Commission's Lifeline program. This program also makes the $50 subsidy available to families eligible for free school lunches or college Pell Grants, as well as to those who've lost jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recipients can also use up to $100 of the subsidy to pay for a laptop, desktop or tablet. In addition, the legislation provides funding to improve FCC mapping and telehealth services. Consumer advocacy groups applauded Congress for acknowledging how vital broadband connectivity is, especially at a time when Americans continue working and learning from home.""These subsidies will directly support those experiencing financial loss during the crisis, as affordability remains the key barrier to connectivity,"" said Greg Guice, government affairs director at Public Knowledge. ""No American should be forced to go without food, water, electricity or essential communications over broadband.""But the two most controversial sticking points between Democrats and Republicans in the negotiations are missing from the bill. These are the COVID-19 liability protections for corporations and businesses that Republicans wanted and the direct aid to state and local governments that Democrats pushed for to help those governments struggling to make up for lost tax and fee revenue resulting from this year's closures. These issues have been largely set aside and will likely come up again in negotiations for more relief in 2021 afterPresident-elect Joe Biden takes office. Biden previously said he sees the current relief package as a ""down payment"" and that Congress would need topass another bill in the early part of 2021.",3,Reliable,0.0920767441175604,0.3905851518096415,1119,3,CNET

So, he's bringing over 6,000 forces back home and sending another 5,400 to Belgium and Italy. The DOD says the move could start within weeks. But not everyone is on board. Critics – including lawmakers onboth sides of the aisle– say the multi-billion-dollar move would be a ""gift to Russia."" They believe it'll encourage Russian ""aggression and opportunism."" Foreign officials said it'll weaken the NATO alliance, and could hurt US relations with Germany. But US military leadership is supportive of the decision – and argues moving the troops around could help the US more swiftly respond to any Russian aggression. Speaking of Russia... This week, US officials said that Russian intelligence serviceshelped spread disinformationabout COVID-19 through several English-language websites. And that it apparently did this to exploit the US's efforts to contain the virus. This isn't the first time Russia's used disinformation to meddle in foreign affairs (see: theAIDS epidemicand the2016 election). And many are raising the alarm. The US has dialed down its presence in Europe before (see:under the Obama admin). But this time, it comes as the Trump admin faces scrutiny for its relationship with Russia – a country that's shown it's not afraid of meddling...including in the2020 election. Tech CEOs. Yesterday, the heads of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google testified virtually in a hearing before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. It was the first time all four CEOs got together (virtually) to face Congress – and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos's first time performing in front of the tough crowd, who didn'tgo easyon him. The four got questioned on everything from antitrust concerns to data privacy to business dealings with China. And unlike previous hearings, this time Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn't have to explainhow the internet works. These federal agents. Yesterday, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) said she'd reached a deal with the Trump admin for agents to start leaving Portland after weeks of clashes with protesters. She said state police would provide security for a federal courthouse in the city, and that a ""phased withdrawal"" of some federal agents would start today. Meanwhile, the head of the Department of Homeland Security said agents wouldn't leave until he was satisfied that federal buildings were protected. Still on the road: Portland isn't the only city with federal agents anymore. There are more than 200 inKansas City, MO, as part of ""Operation Legend"" – a federal program to bring down violent crime. Yesterday, the Justice Dept announced it's sending more agents to Detroit, MI, as well as Cleveland, OH, and Milwaukee, WI. The US. Yesterday, coronavirus deaths in the country surpassed 150,000 – with more than 1,000 people dying every day – mostly in Southern states. The news comes as federal officials warn 21 states they're in a ""red zone"" and should impose more restrictions to help control the virus.:Red zone. An area the federal gov refers to when it's had 100 new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents in the last week. And more than 10% of coronavirus tests coming back positive. Barbie. This week, Mattel introduced a Campaign Team Barbie set meant to inspire girls to learn more about politics.

Most particularly, he should stop sitting for interviews at all. In yet another Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump continued to beat the drum on his mental acuity and proved once again that he has none. Can't stop watching Trump on the cognitive test:""The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It’s like you’ll go 'person, woman, man, camera, TV.'

Okay, that's very good.""pic.twitter.com/Ggv42oGliu— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1)July 23, 2020Trump told interviewer Marc Siegel in an interview on Fox News that he took a cognitive test at Walter Reed Medical Center in November to prove to voters and the “fake news media” that he is “sharp” and fit to be president. For some reason, however, he would not admit at the time that a cognitive test was included in the visit, saying only that it was a routine annual physical (which does not include a cognitive test), discounting his reasoning because nothing is “proven” to the public when you don’t tell anyone. After a disastrous interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, which aired on Sunday, Trump took much criticism for his rambling answers, his insistence that a basic cognitive test to rule out dementia was “hard,” his utter resistance to fact-checks, and his dismissive attitude toward the coronavirus response that has left more than 140,000 Americans dead. Trump keeps boasting about passing a cognitive test — but it doesn’t mean what he thinks it does— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost)July 23, 2020Trump’s approval numbers are at their lowest and, for context, is on track to be the same as George H. W. Bush’s and Jimmy Carter’s when they ran for their second terms. As a reminder, both lost. No matter how bad these interviews are, Trump insists they’re “great.” However, they’re really not doing him any favors. So much else in the Fox News Sunday interview, but this dangerous statement shouldn't be ignored:""I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election.""Will you accept the results of the election: ""I have to see.""— Bill Kristol (@BillKristol)July 19, 2020Featured image screenshot viaYouTubeNo related posts.",1,Questionable,0.0429861111111111,0.4676488095238094,563,0,Bipartisan Report

LOUIS — Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner won Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the city’s top prosecutor by a healthy margin. Gardner, who is completing her first term, defeated former assistant prosecutor Mary Pat Carl, 61% to 39%, according to final and unofficial results. She will face Republican challenger Daniel Zdrodowski in the November election. He ran unopposed Tuesday. Gardner, 45, thefirst Black woman elected circuit attorney in St. Louis, has promised to continue efforts to reform the criminal justice system. Her controversial first term has been highlighted by tensions with police andcriticism of her leadership as well as prosecutions of powerful peopleincluding a Missouri governor. She has described her opponents as “status quo tacticians” who have wagedracial,politicalandsexistattacks on her reform efforts. She said she also has received racist death threats.“I feel humbled,” Gardner told supporters at a rooftop warehouse watch party Tuesday night. “This is an exciting time, but this is also the people’s time. This is about the people who elected me, the people in this room who fought for equality and justice and this is about people who sent a resounding message that they want reform in the city of St. Louis.”Carl, 43, came in second to Gardner in a field of four Democrats in the 2016 primary. She campaigned on her more than 14 years of experience prosecuting crimes in St. Louis. She pledged to restore stability to a Circuit Attorney’s Office that has weathereddramatic turnover under Gardner. Carl said she had hoped to give crime victims a voice in the courtroom, end cash bail and hold amnesty days for those who miss court dates. She, like Gardner, supports closing the city’s Medium Security Institution better known as the workhouse.“We ran a strong campaign under unprecedented circumstances,” Carl tweeted Tuesday night. “I’m proud of what we accomplished, and grateful for the commitment so many made. I wish Ms. Gardner a successful term. I urge her to be transparent with the public, and build working relationships for a safer St. Louis.”During her campaign, Gardner said she had worked to hold police accountable and reduce crime by focusing on its roots — poverty, addiction and mental health. Gardner took credit for a declining city jail population through pretrial diversion programs and no longer prosecuting people for small amounts of marijuana. A central issue in Gardner’s first term has been her office’songoing legal fight to win a new trial for a St. Louis man imprisoned for 25 yearsfor a murder Gardner insists he did not commit. Carl and Gardner both picked up last-minute financial support from dozens of donors in the two weeks before Tuesday’s primary, according to campaign finance reports. Carl’s campaign took in at least $313,000. Backers included lawyers and businesses, and the St. Louis-Kansas City Carpenters Regional Council. The STL Justice PAC received an $44,000 donation from theJoseph Wingate Folk Societyon July 23 toward Carl’s campaign. Gardner’s fundraising totaled about $200,000 including support from the Missouri Justice & Public Safety Political Action Committee, which on July 29 received a $116,000 donation from progressive New York mega donor George Soros. Gardner also received $5,000 from Hollywood celebrityMilla Jovovichand $5,000 from New Yorkmusic industry executive Jason Flom. Kimberly M.

This op-ed was not in OZY’s pipeline a week ago. Nor was it written by our usual editorial team. I’m dedicating this to the young nation of Belarus, the small, landlocked country in Eastern Europe that has been rocked by police violence after the authoritarian incumbent president, Alexander Lukashenko, claimed a landslide election victory widely viewed by the public as rigged. Nine days later, Belarus is besieged by a horrific level of violence, including more than 6,000 arrests and at least two confirmed deaths. Many more are likely being covered up by officials. The popular myth that Belarusians simply aren’t strong enough to stand up for themselves has been debunked. As a Belarusian citizen, my heart hurts, and my soul is tired. For several days, I watched in dismay as peaceful protesters calling for a recount were met with black-clad riot police wielding stun grenades and rubber bullets. Yesterday, I spent hours talking to some of the victims and their relatives, collecting True Stories of people who were directly affected, stories of broken bones, threats of rape, military trucks turned into gas chambers, sophisticated torture techniques and never-ending beatings. Belarus, which was the main Nazi-Soviet battleground for years, saw every fourth Belarusian die during World War II. Today, I am hearing comparisons between the methods of the Belarusian riot police and those of the Nazis’. This is not surprising to me, as Lukashenko has made security the top priority throughout his 26-year tenure as the country’s president and Europe’s longest-serving ruler, regularly arresting and imprisoning democratic activists and pro-Western leaders. The results are a puppet Parliament, censorship, firm centralization of business activities and finances, and the lack of an independent judicial system. Well, the day of reckoning has arrived. “We, the Belarusians, are peaceful people.” So goes the opening line to Belarus’ national anthem. These words summarize the nation’s spirit at its best. A week and a half into what has become the most widespread protests against the existing political order, you don’t see broken windows or burned-out cars. Instead, families march with young children, dressed in white, roses in their arms. The global Belarusian diaspora stands arm in arm with those back home. The violence unleashed by Lukashenko backfired. The police have retreated, but it may be too late for the president. The popular myth that Belarusians simply aren’t strong enough to stand up for themselves has been debunked. And now that patience and tolerance have run out, the country’s problems of economic stagnation, mishandling of the coronavirus crisis and the human rights violations have led to increasing demands for new leadership.

Blame Barack Obama.,10.67,32.33,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/08/13/dont-blame-trump-for-afghanistans-collapse-blame-barack-obama/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,25,"President Joe Biden’s decision towithdraw abruptly from Afghanistan, without any discernible exit strategy, has plunged that nation into a bloody, ruinous chaos. After pleading with theTalibanto spare our embassy in Kabul, he has nowredeployed 3,000 troopstoconduct a hasty air evacuationof embassy staff. At this stage, the only good that can come from this debacle is that our leaders might wake up and recognize that theObama Doctrineof foreign policy is an abysmal failure and must be abandoned once and for all. Tragically, this lesson comes, yet again, at tremendous cost: widescale human misery and heightened threats to U. S. interests. As we study what’s happened, let’s first dispense with the canards: that this fiasco was inevitable and that it’s all former President Donald Trump’s fault. The reality is that, during Trump’s tenure and despite the Afghan government’s many imperfections, Afghanistan had made great strides. The government controlled most of the country’s territory. There was real economic growth. Women could work. Children could go to school. Further, the cost of fostering regional stability by maintaining a stable Afghanistan was well within reason. The U. S. was spending less in Afghanistan in a year than we used to spend in a week. American forces were training and advising Afghan forces. Our troops were not fighting wars and taking causalities. This was clearly sustainable. And how, in heaven’s name, is Trump to blame for Biden’s disastrous decision to cut and run? Trump was negotiating with the Taliban, but there was nothing wrong with that. The negotiations were conditions-based, and Trump made clear the Taliban would be held accountable for its actions. Moreover, Trump’s team made sure that if, in the end, the Taliban proved untrustworthy, the remaining U. S. force had been sized and scoped to present a serious deterrent to the Taliban and be sufficient to protect U. S. interests. Trump, in fact, handed Biden a problem mostly solved. All Biden had to do was negotiate a lasting settlement from a position of strength or maintain an economy of force presence in Afghanistan if the Taliban failed to deliver. Instead, Biden just decided to call it a day and call the troops home regardless of what the Taliban did on the ground. The Taliban’s offensive should surprise no one, given the conditions handed to it. Why would it not take advantage ofBiden’s abandonment of Afghanistan? It knew full well the odds that this president would try to stop its orgy of murder, rape, forced marriages, and mayhem was near zero. Of course, Biden will blame Trump. He will blame theTaliban. He can make all the excuses and spin all the narratives he wants, but a narrative can’t stop a bullet. This is a disaster. The situation did not collapse until he withdrew troops—and it is impossible not to conclude this happened because of what he decided. Here is the bigger problem. This was not a one-off decision. This is part of a pattern of Obama-Biden foreign policy. And that should surprise no one since the current policies are being managed by much the same people. In Iraq, after spending much time and effort stabilizing the country, former President Barack Obama precipitously withdrew U. S. troops. It was like ordering firefighters who had extinguished a wildfire to notstick around after the wildfire in case the blaze rekindles. ISIS mushroomed overnight, creating the largest and most powerful terrorist state in modern history. In Libya, Obama insisted on leading from behind. And once Muammar Gaddafi was gone from the picture, he ignored the spiraling decline in the security situation until our diplomatic facilities in Benghazi were smoking ruins. This is the Obama-Biden playbook. Disengage in dangerous situations, and hope everything doesn’t go to hell in a handbasket. And when those fond hopes don’t pan out? Time to make excuses; shift blame; do anything but deal with the problem—unless there is absolutely no alternative. In the face of America’s enemies, the default position of Obama-Biden foreign policy default is accommodation and appeasement. Unfortunately, the bad guys are not stupid. They had eight years to study the Obama playbook, and they know what to do with it: exploit the deliberate self-weakening. Biden iscarrying onexactly the same foreign policy. Caving to Russia onNord Stream 2. Refusing to confront China on theorigins of COVID-19. Pleading with Tehran to let the U. S. back in theIran nuclear deal.

Following the attack, Representative Eric Swalwell (D-NY)filed a lawsuit against Brooks, Trump, Donald Trump Jr., andRudy Giulianifor allegedly inciting the riot using incendiary language. Brooks also faced calls from several Democratic lawmakers to be censured or resign from his position over his remarks. Brooks has since defended the speech by claiming it was taken out of context by the ""fake news"" media. In court documents filed last week, Brooks argued that the Swalwell lawsuit should be dismissed since the speech was made within ""the scope of his office"" as a U. S.

Brooks's attorney said that his duties as a congressman include ""making speeches (on the House floor and in public) on public policy issues, current events, American history, American civics, election events and issues, and the like,"" according to the news outlet.

King, then a PhD candidate and assistant minister atTwelfth Baptist Churchin Boston’s historically black Roxbury neighborhood,drove his green caracross town to pick up Scott, who was studying voice at the New England Conservatory of Music. It was a blind date, and a successful one at that. The pairwedthe following year, on June 18, 1953, before moving to Montgomery, Alabama, where Martin served as a pastor at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.

(Per the organization’swebsite, donors have already contributed more than $12 million toward the $15 million campaign.) TitledThe Embrace, the 22-foot-tall, patinated bronze work will feature two pairs of intertwined, disembodied arms. Members of the public will be able to walk underneath and around the sculpture, which will be surrounded on all sides by a patterned circular pathway inspired by African Americanquilting traditions, according to a projectproposal.“This memorial will envelop participants, allowing them to be simultaneously vulnerable and protected,” notesMASS Design Group, which submitted Thomas’ work in response to a 2017 call for proposals, in theproject description.“We were inspired by images of the Kings locked in a powerful embrace and walking arm in arm at the frontlines of a protest or march. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King understood the power of physical collectiveness in advancing our fight against injustice,” the group continues. “As we reflected upon the King legacy, one image—one idea—emerged above the others: [e]mbrace.”King Boston selected Thomas’ design in March 2019 after narrowing down the applicant pool from 126 to 5.

The artist notes that while Martin’s activism has often overshadowed her own, Coretta played a key role in the civil rights movement, particularly in securing her husband’s legacy in the years after his 1968assassination. She founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Changein Atlanta, Georgia, and advocated that his birthday, January 15, become a national holiday.“We often look at the heroes without seeing who is holding them up and where their courage or strength comes from,” Thomas said. “The love that [Coretta] exhibited by carrying [Martin’s] legacy even after he was gone is something we should be paying attention to.”Despite her decades of activism, Coretta “hasn’t received adequate recognition for institutionalizing his philosophy of nonviolence,” Vicki Crawford, director of theMorehouse CollegeKing collection, tells the Associated Press’ Philip Marcelo. “He could not have done it without her by his side.”In addition to Thomas’ sculpture, King Boston directorImari Paris Jeffriesplans to raise money for an economic justice center in Roxbury, reports the AP.“Boston has the opportunity to be the very first city in the nation to emerge post-vaccine as a place that embodies values of justice,” Jeffries tells’ Taylor Dafoe. “Now more than ever people want to ‘embrace’ friends, loved ones, and each other.

443,Farrell: ‘Systemic Racism’ Is Not Solved by Segregating Students,19.67,26.33,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/02/farrell-systemic-racism-is-not-solved-by-segregating-students/,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"Our country cannot pursue racial unity and inclusion through promoting disunity and exclusion. Yet the same people who decry America’s alleged systemic racism are enacting policies and practices reminiscent of the worst days of racial segregation. In one recent case Judicial Watch uncovered111 pagesof records showing that in the quest for “diversity, equity and inclusion,” Wellesley Public Schools in Massachusetts established five “affinity spaces” thatdividestudents and staff based primarily on race. The school district’s “Equity Strategic Plan 2020-2025”includesa “District Equity by Design” scheme which seeks to “amplify student voices” by providing “opportunities for affinity spaces for students with shared identity.” Likewise, “Diversity Staffing” includes providing resources for “affinity spaces for specialized populations within the wider Faculty/Staff (ie. ALANA [Asian, Latino, African, and Native American], Admin Leaders of Color, LGBTQ+, White Educators for Antiracism, etc.).”It should be apparent that establishing these types of bureaucratic frameworks puts the “systemic” in “systemic racism.” There has been a legal war against similar structures established by white racists of “shared identity” for seven decades. Yet the ideologically-driven educators at Wellesley rationalize that thepurposeof these groups is not to stoke divisions but to “continuously examine systems of privilege and bias, and work collectively to disrupt and dismantle inequity in all its forms.” Except, of course, this really obvious form. Perhaps a student would like to escape this toxic emphasis on identity and simply focus on intellectual development. But no, increasingly topics inspired by critical race theory are worming their way into the main curriculum. At Wellesley Schools “Equity Literacy” is now a required part of the program. Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Charmie R. Curry noted in anemailto colleagues that two required courses – “Understanding Equity and Inequity” and “Learning to Be a Threat to Inequity” — focus on “helping us to build/sharpen our structural ideological lenses” and are “are essential to our ability to address inequities in our community.” Whether math has been declaredracisthas yet to be determined. Judicial Watch inquired whether these and other racially motivated policies at Wellesley schools were consistent with state and federal law, including the 14th Amendment, the Massachusetts Equal Rights Amendment or the state School Attendance Law. The districtrespondedthat “no such records exist” of the school addressing these questions. Small wonder, since it would take little intellectual exertion to see the problematic nature of this approach. TheMassachusetts Equal Rights Amendmentis an issue in particular since it mandates that equality under the law “shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.” The type of color-blind, gender-blind equality that previous generations idealized is exactly what is being denied by Wellesley schools, and it is hard to see how this neo-segregation could be upheld in court. Similar efforts are underway nationwide to elevate race to a priority focus in education. In Virginia, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology,the top high schoolin the United States,eliminatedits rigorous admissions test in favor of a more subjective and geographically-based system that would result in a more diverse, less academically proficient – andless Asian— student body. The new system is facing a severe court challenge and is likely to be overturned. Judicial Watch also examinedrecordsfrom Maryland’s Montgomery County Public Schools which include documents related to their critical race theory classes. Here students were taught that the expression “Make America Great Again” was an example of “covert white supremacy,” and part of a spectrum of racist behavior which included racial slurs, “the N-word,” hate crimes, and lynching. The school district also paid nearly half a million dollars to TheMid-Atlantic Equity Consortiumto conduct an “Anti-racist system audit.” The company claims that their “expertise in using intersectionality as part of its theory of change makes us uniquely positioned to conduct the Anti-Racist Audit and mitigate the root causes of systemic barriers.” Nice work if you can get it. Meanwhile in Dedham, Massachusetts Judicial Watchfiled a federal lawsuiton behalf of David Flynn, who lost his position as head football coach after raising concerns about his daughter’s seventh-grade history class curriculum, which was changed to include biased coursework on politics, race, gender equality, and diversity. Most of the problematic changes taking place in the nation’s schools are being decided behind closed doors with no parental input. They are presented as faits accomplis, and any who then question them are subject to charges of racism and calls for cancellation. But it is imperative for parents and concerned citizens to expose these neoracist programs for what they are and protect their children from this divisive, ideologically-driven agenda. The cure for racism is not more racism. One person’s “affinity space” is another person’s “no whites allowed.”",1,Questionable,0.0393660287081339,0.3967840054682159,1084,1,Breitbart
444,The Movements for Eviction Relief and Voting Rights Converge on the Capitol Grounds,-11.33,39.67,https://newrepublic.com/article/163156/cori-bush-eviction-moratorium-voting-rights,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-04,25,"On a balmy, overcast Tuesday in Washington, protesters and lawmakers gathered on either end of the Capitol to urge Congress and the White House to act on two issues of varying urgency: the push for a new voting rights law and a solution to the recently expired eviction moratorium. The public demonstrations raised thorny questions about what, exactly, the United States government owes its citizens. On at least one of those matters, there was something of a breakthrough. The administration on Tuesday evening announceda new eviction moratoriumtargeting “specific areas of the country where cases are rapidly increasing”—even though the White House had previously said it did not have the legal authority to extend the original moratorium beyond its July 31 expiration date. In a press conference, President Joe Biden indicated that while he was uncertain about whether the new moratorium would ultimately pass constitutional muster, it would nevertheless “probably give some additional time” to vulnerable tenants as previously allocated funds for renters’ assistance were disbursed. Biden’s decision may have been largely influenced by the advocacy of Representative Cori Bush and a small cadre of House Democrats who had slept outside the Capitol to protest the lapse of the moratorium. The Missouri congresswoman stationed herself on the Capitol steps for three nights in a row; she allowed other members of Congress to tap in for her on Monday night so that she could get some rest. Bush’s crusade garnered national attention, and other congressional Democrats and activists have joined her on the steps in recent days. Vice President Kamala Harris even briefly met with Bush on Monday for a conversation where the congresswoman asked the White House to take action. In addition to calling for an extension of the moratorium, Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked the administration to expedite the disbursement of $46.5 billion in rental assistance previously allocated by Congress. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke to the Democratic Caucus on Tuesday about how that aid to renters and landlords might be disbursed. Bush and her Democratic colleagues had called on the Biden administration to immediately reinstate the moratorium, after several days in which the two branches seemed to pass the ball back and forth. Last Thursday, the White House unexpectedly asked Congress to take action on its own to extend the moratorium, just two days before its expiration, and right before the House was set to recess. Biden officials believed at the time that it lacked the legal authority to extend it, based on aconcurrence from Justice Brett Kavanaughin a June Supreme Court decision, in which he said that “clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation) would be necessary for the CDC to extend the moratorium past July 31.”But supporters of the extension argue that the situation has changed since Kavanaugh wrote his decision, particularly given the rise in coronavirus cases due to the delta variant. In a press conference with Bush on Tuesday evening, Representative Mondaire Jones also noted that Kavanaugh’s concurrence had no binding effect.“It is odd, I think, to raise issues about the constitutionality of your own executive action shortly before making that executive action,” Jones said, saying Biden’s voicing of doubts about the constitutionality of the moratorium was “not the commentary of someone who’s actually trying to help people.”The White House’s extension is simply a Band-Aid on a larger wound, Bush and other Democrats argue, particularly if it ends up thrown out by the courts. Representative Ilhan Omar told reporters in a conference call by the Congressional Progressive Caucus that the moratorium extension “will only be a temporary solution to the mass eviction crisis.”“We have the House, the Senate, the White House. There is no excuse for our inability to act,” Omar said. An extension of the moratorium failed to pass in the House on unanimous consent on Friday evening. No roll call vote was held, possibly because it may have revealed that some Democrats were unwilling to vote for an extension. Most members of the House subsequently left Washington for a seven-week recess. But Bush, whose passion for the issue was influenced by her own personal experiences with homelessness, set up camp on the Capitol steps on Friday evening, calling on the White House to take action.“I am an organizer. I’m an activist. That’s what I do. So I fell back on what I know to do, which was be visible, put your body on the line, use whatever you have,” Bush told reporters earlieron Tuesday, ahead of the announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The freshman congresswoman, who represents St. Louis, was on the front lines of the protests in the city in 2014 after Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. But any legislation extending the moratorium will come up against a roadblock in the Senate, where 10 Republicans would need to offer support in order for it to pass—an unlikely scenario. Moreover, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday afternoon that extending the moratorium “doesn’t seem to me to require any additional legislative action.”The Senate is currently preoccupied with passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill ahead of a scheduled recess set to begin next week, although the ever-slogging process may cut into that treasured time away from Washington. Senators voted on a few amendments to the bill on Tuesday; within the air-conditioned, marble halls of the Capitol, it was easy to forget that there are any other considerations. But outside those walls and on the opposite side of the Capitol from Bush’s demonstration, the Declaration for American Democracy held a rally on Tuesday as part of a week of action urging the Senate to hold off on leaving for August recess before passing the For the People Act, a sprawling elections and campaign finance bill. Their effort is likelier the more quixotic of the two calls to action on the Capitol Grounds today: Republicans sank the bill in June and are not likely to change their minds. The desire to eliminate the filibuster was in the foreground of the voting rights rally, which was attended by a mixture of activists in T-shirts and more than 100 state legislators from across the country. The abolition of the arcane Senate procedure would allow Democrats to advance their legislation with a simple majority, instead of the current 60-vote threshold that’s proven to be the insurmountable obstacle to this critical part of their legislative agenda.“We shouldn’t be protecting the filibuster over the very foundational principles of American democracy,” Jana Morgan, the director of the Declaration for American Democracy, argued toThe New Republic,noting that the filibuster had historically been deployed to block civil rights bills inthe twentieth century. Some speakers at the rally specifically called out the Senate’s Democrats as the current impediment to enacting wide-ranging voting rights legislation.“Senate Democrats, you have the power to ensure free and fair elections,” said Georgia State Representative Renitta Shannon in a speech at the rally. “Republicans cannot be used as the excuse not to get this done.”Georgia is one of several Republican-controlled states that has considered or enacted voting measures that critics argue will make it more difficult for minority voters to cast their ballot, disproportionately affecting Democrats. According to theBrennan Center for Justice, at least 18 states this year have enacted laws that restricted voting access, as of mid-July.“This is a now or never moment for our country,” said Texas State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, who along with dozens of his colleagues left the state in mid-July to block the passage of a restrictive voting measure. Eliminating the filibuster would require support from all 50 Democrats, and at least two, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have repeatedly and publicly expressed opposition to doing so. Manchin has also raised concerns about the scope of the For the People Act, preferring anarrower voting rights billinstead. The Washington Postreported last week that Senate Democrats are currently working on a revised version of their voting rights bill. Other Democrats have also privately raised concerns about eliminating the filibuster, worrying that it would allow Republicans to pass their own controversial agenda items once they have the majority—which, depending on the results of the midterm elections, could be as early as 2023. But Shannon toldThe New Republicthat these fears were not an excuse for inaction.“They’re just like, ‘Oh, what if we’re not empowered, you know, what happens if we lose elections in the future?’ But what I want them to know is, if you don’t move the agenda you campaigned on, you’reguaranteedto lose elections,” Shannon said. Several Democratic senators made an appearance at the rally, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the committee that oversees voting rights legislation, and Senator Jeff Merkley, the lead sponsor of the For the People Act. Senator Cory Booker, who was also on hand, cryptically referred to “too many people right now who should be with us today who are not standing with us in this fight,” anddenounced the filibuster as an “archaic rule” that is “giving the tyranny of the minority a different name.”Senator Raphael Warnock insisted in an impassioned speech at the rally that the Senate could “walk and chew gum at the same time,” and thus address voting rights even as it moves forward with infrastructure.“We must build our country’s infrastructure,” Warnock said. “We must also repair and protect the infrastructure of our democracy.”Advocates for eliminating the filibuster believe the White House needs to act, just as much as the Senate does. Voting rights activists have previously called on President Biden to endorse ending the practice. The president—who served in the Senate for nearly 40 years—has been unwilling to throw his weight behind its abolition. Shannon, the Georgia state representative, toldThe New Republicthat “there’s only so much organizing that can be down to out-organize voter suppression bills.”“Organizers and voters have done their jobs, and now Senate Democrats have to do theirs, and President Biden as well,” Shannon said. “I want him to use his bully pulpit to make it tough for any Democrat who’s not willing to remove the filibuster. And he needs to get on board as well.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.0430554157298343,0.3480102799870243,2210,2,New Republic

But, over the weekend, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke apologized for for writings he made as a teenager describing fantasies about running over children with a vehicle. Here’s more:“I’m mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed, but I have to take ownership of my words,” the Democratic presidential candidate said during a taping of the “Political Party Live” podcast in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “Whatever my intention was as a teenager doesn’t matter, I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the language I have used, and I have to constantly try to do better.”His comments come after a report Friday revealed O’Rourkewrote prosewhen he was a teenager describing a scenario in which he would accelerate a car into a group of children while hearing them scream. The report alsoshowedhe was a secret member of a hacking group called the “Cult of the Dead Cow,” which focused on showing people how to hack Microsoft computers.“It’s not anything I’m proud of today, and I mean, that’s — that’s the long and short of it,” he said. “All I can do is my best, which is what I’m trying to do. I can’t control anything I’ve done in the past. I can only control what I do going forward and what I plan to do is give this my best.”“One day, as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street. They were happy, happy to be free from their troubles…. This happiness was mine by right. I had earned it in my dreams,” O’Rourke wrote.“As I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood, and then the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. I was so fascinated for a moment, that when after I had stopped my vehicle, I just sat in a daze, sweet visions filling my head,” O’Rourke continued. The news is perhaps not surprising given that O’Rourke supports abortions up to birth. That’s a position he defended yesterday, as videoed during a campaign stop. O’Rourke was captured on camera at a campaign event in Clevelandresponding to a question about third-trimester abortions and whether or not he supports abortions up to birth.“That should be a decision that the woman makes. I trust her,” O’Rourke says. Not only does O’Rourke have a 100-percent pro-abortion voting record like the other Democrat presidential candidates, he alsosponsored a radical pro-abortion billthat would have legalized abortions for basically any reason up to birth. The so-called “Women’s Health Protection Act” was introduced in Congress in 2017, with dozens of Democrat sponsors, including likely presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders. Nicknamed the “Abortion Without Limits Until Birth Act”by pro-life groups, the bill would have invalidated nearly all state and federal abortion regulations, including waiting periods, informed consent requirements, bans on late-term abortions and sex-selection abortions and more. The congressman has also failed to speak out againstNancy Pelosi and House Democrats blocking a request by Republicans to voteon a similar bill to require medical care and treatment for babies who survive abortions. That puts him on record supporting their decision to allow infanticide to continue unprosecuted.

Wouldmass transit take a hitas individuals opt for personal transportation? Would car salesboom in the following years? We don't have clear answers yet, but a snapshot of data at least gives us some indication of the pandemic's affect in the near-term. According to a report from the New York Times, citing data from the Department of Motor Vehicles, car registrations jumped 37% between August and October of last year in New York. You know, the city that was famed for congestion and vehicle traffic even before the pandemic. The 37% rise includes the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, but breaking the data out shows an even more intriguing picture. In Manhattan alone, new car registrations rose 76% and in Brooklyn, registrations climbed 45%. That's a serious amount of new vehicles roaming around tight city streets, and the Times report highlighted the problem that brings with available parking spaces. With more cars, parking quickly started to vanish, especially as city authorities began converting streets, parking lots and other areas into large outdoor dining spaces to try and compensate for tight restrictions on indoor dining. On the flip side, proponents for more mass transit and cycling lanes underscored now is the time to fix the problem for good as we hopefully begin to put the pandemic in the rearview this year. Additional cycling lanes and room for other forms of transport can allow people to move more freely throughout the city. But advocates will still need to convince the thousands of new local vehicles owners first.",3,Reliable,0.1542109405745769,0.4165977961432508,347,3,CNET
447,"Trump will survive impeachment, for now: But make no mistake, this hurts him",-20.0,31.25,https://www.salon.com/2019/12/06/trump-will-survive-impeachment-for-now-but-make-no-mistake-this-hurts-him/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-12-06,25,"After deliberating with the members of her caucus and reading the House Select Committee on Intelligence report on the Ukraine bribery scandal, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday morning that she has directed the chairs of the Judiciary, Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, Financial Services and Ways and Means committees to begin writing articles of impeachment against President Trump. Her speech was quite moving, offering up pertinent quotes from the founders and laying out her reasoning for going ahead after having been notably reluctant to do so. It is unclear whether any of those committees other than the Intelligence Committee will offer evidence of impeachable offenses at this point. Pelosi made it clear that they did not plan to impeach the president over government policy, no matter how grotesque that may be, because the coming election will settle those differences. Impeachment, in her mind, is instead about the president's abuse of power and his nefarious plan to corrupt the democratic process for his political benefit. She and the Democrats seem to think that impeaching the president quickly — and then seeing him quickly acquitted in the Senate — will somehow prevent him from doing that, which strikes me as unlikely. If experience is any guide, Trump will claim ""total exoneration"" and see it as license to do the same thing all over again. After all, the day after Robert Mueller testified before the House Judiciary Committee, Trump got on the horn and tried to bribe the Ukrainian president to do what Mueller proved the Russians did on his behalf in 2016 — interfere in the presidential election. There is some talk that the Democrats will include the Volume II charges in the Mueller Report in an impeachment article on obstruction of justice, which makes sense. The Mueller team obviously wrote that part of the report as a quasi-impeachment referral and handed it to the House practically tied up in a big red bow. It's full of testimony given under oath by dozens of Trump associates, flunkeys and administration officials that tells the story of a presidential campaign to defeat and undermine the Russia investigation. These two crimes, the Russian interference and the attempted Ukrainian bribery, are like bookends, with the first informing the second. Whatever the Democrats decide to do about the specific charges, Trump is going to be impeached. I would think dragging that out and keeping him tied down and off-balance would be the better way to ensure that he doesn't use his office for personal political gain again. But that ship is rapidly sailing out of the harbor. According to CNN, the White House and Republican senators are planning a ""defense"" in which they attack Joe Biden and his son. They don't want to waste the opportunity to smear the former veep some more while the whole world is watching. But regardless of their sleazy tactics, the outcome of the whole thing is preordained. Trump will not be convicted and will undoubtedly strut around the country afterward, bragging that he beat the rap. So it's probably time to start thinking about a post-impeachment election campaign. Trump will certainly be on the ticket next year, barring something totally unpredictable. Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were in their second terms when they faced impeachment. Andrew Johnson failed to win his own party's nomination in the 1868 election, following his impeachment, so this will be a first. But there are some clues about how to deal with this since we've had a couple of elections following impeachment or resignation in the fairly recent past. CNN's Ron Brownsteinhas writtenabout how the presidential successors in those two impeachments ran their campaigns, and how surprisingly similar they were. Despite the fact that running against Trump is like running against an alien from outer space, there are some lessons to be taken from those two examples:In each case, the president's party lost the White House to a candidate — Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Republican George W. Bush in 2000 — who played off lingering public unease about the scandal that had precipitated the impeachment process against their predecessor. In each instance, impeachment functioned like a leak that corroded the foundation under the president's party in the next election. Brownstein looks back at those campaigns, starting with the fact that public opinion was very different in both cases, with Nixon being remarkably unpopular and Clinton enjoying a 60% job approval throughout. But the opposing party's nominee in the following elections ran campaigns with the same subtext. Neither Carter or Bush dwelled on the scandals, but they both presented themselves as the antidote to the ugliness they exposed. Carter said people had heard enough about Watergate but famously pledged ""I will never lie to you"" and promised to give the country ""a government as good as its people."" Brownstein says it was enough to put him over the top with an electorate that was exhausted by Watergate. George W. Bush likewise didn't talk about the impeachment directly but called himself ""a uniter not a divider"" and promised to ""restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office,"" which everyone understood to mean that he wouldn't befoul it with sexual rendezvous in the hallway. Brownstein grants that this situation is different. After all, Trump himself will be on the ballot and will no doubt wear the impeachment as a badge of honor to rile up his rabid following, declaring himself a martyr to the cause of Making America Great Again. But most analysts agree that impeachment will also have the effect of hardening opposition to Trump, making it even more difficult for him to reach beyond his hardcore base. The only way Trump can change that dynamic is by sullying the opposition so that he is seen as the lesser of two evils by just enough people to win. On some subconscious level, he obviously knew that all along, which explains his desire to project his own corruption onto Joe Biden, his own pathological lying onto Elizabeth Warren and his own craziness onto Bernie Sanders. Trump has no analytical skills but he does possess a feral survival instinct which tells him that his only hope is to turn his opponents into mirror images of himself and then attack them for it. Perhaps this will be successful. But it is far more likely that any of the Democrats running, regardless of their various attributes and skills, will be seen as the decent, honest alternative to Trump regardless of how much he verbally assaults them in the campaign. Impeachment brands Trump in a way that he will never be able to escape. As he himselfadmittedto House Republicans, ""You don't want it on your résumé.""It's going to be worse than that. It will be in the first paragraph of his obituary. We can only hope the words ""Donald J. Trump, one-term president ..."" will be there too.",1,Questionable,0.107767335004177,0.4666963241436926,1435,2,Salon
448,Arizona reports highest number of new cases since Aug. 1 as hospitalizations continue to rise,-0.5,53.0,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/11/05/arizona-coronavirus-nov-5-update-2-135-new-cases-28-new-known-deaths/6172772002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/az-central-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,24,"Arizona reported more than 2,100 new COVID-19 cases and 28 new known deaths on Thursday as hospitalizations for the disease continued to rise. Thursday's new-case report marks the first day the state has reported more than 2,000 new cases since Aug. 1. The U. S. on Wednesday tallied more than 100,000 new cases in a single day for the first time. Identified COVID-19 cases in Arizona rose by 2,135 on Thursday to 252,768, and known deaths were at 6,087, according to thedaily report from the Arizona Department of Health Services. New cases have eclipsed 1,000 for nine of the past 12 days. The past several weeks have seen relatively higher daily case reports as the virus spreads at itsfastest rate in Arizona since June, although case numbers are still well below where they were during the summer peak. But new case rates in Arizona fall below the rates reported in 33 other states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'sCOVID Data Trackersays. Cases are surging in North Dakota, where the new case rate per 100,000 people for the previous seven days was 157.8 as of Wednesday, the CDC reports. By comparison, Arizona's rate was 19.3. The increase in new COVID-19 cases in the summer was an early indicator of more hospitalizations and deaths in the weeks to come. Gov. Doug Ducey last week saidArizonans ""need to keep our guard up""but announced no new preventive measures, instead pointing to existing strategies such as restaurant capacity limits. The number of patients hospitalized statewide for known or suspected COVID-19 cases rose to 1,100 on Wednesday, up from 1,065 on Tuesday and 956 on Monday. Wednesday's inpatient total is the highest number reported since Aug. 18. At the peak of Arizona's surge in July, the number of hospitalized patients suspected or confirmed to have the virus exceeded 3,000. The number of patients with suspected or known COVID-19 in intensive care units across Arizona was at 254 on Wednesday, up from 241 ICU beds in use on Tuesday and 227 on Monday. Wednesday saw the highest number of ICU beds in use since Aug. 30. The level is far below what it was in July, when ICU beds in use for COVID-19 reached 970. The number of Arizonans with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 on ventilators was at 128 on Wednesday, the most ventilators in use in a single day since Sept. 4. In mid-July, as many as 687 patients across the state with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were on ventilators. Thursday's dashboard shows 86% of inpatient beds and 86% of ICU beds in use, which includes people being treated for COVID-19 and other patients. COVID-19 patients were using 13% of all inpatient beds and 15% of ICU beds. Overall, 30% of ventilators were in use. Percent positivity, which refers to the percent of COVID-19 diagnostic tests that are positive, has gone up slightly, which many health experts consider an early indicator of a spike in illnesses. Of known test results from last week, the percent positivity was 7%, up from 6% the week prior, according to the state, which has aunique way of calculatingpercent positivity. Percent positivity was at 4% for several weeks during August, September and October, according to state data. Johns Hopkins Universitycalculates Arizona's seven-day moving average of percent positives at 11.7% as of Thursday. It shows the state's percent positivity had reached a relative plateau and is now trending upward. A positivity rate of 5% is considered a good benchmark that the spread of the disease is under control. Reported cases in Arizona: 252,768. Cases increased by 2,135, or 0.85%, from Wednesday's 250,633 identified cases since the outbreak began. Cases by county: 162,958 in Maricopa, 29,456 in Pima, 14,219 in Yuma, 12,510 in Pinal, 6,665 in Navajo, 5,606 in Coconino, 4,596 in Mohave, 4,066 in Apache, 3,134 in Yavapai, 3,085 in Santa Cruz, 2,307 in Cochise, 2,081 in Gila, 1,343 in Graham, 635 in La Paz and 106 in Greenlee, according to state numbers. The rate of cases per 100,000 people is highest in Yuma County, followed by Navajo, Santa Cruz and Apache counties. The rate in Yuma County is 6,183 cases per 100,000 people. By comparison, the U. S. average rate is 2,828 cases per 100,000 people,according to the CDC. The Navajo Nation reported 12,080 cases and 586 confirmed deaths as of Wednesday. The Navajo Nation includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The Arizona Department of Corrections said 2,649 inmates had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Wednesday, including 999 in Tucson; 41,196 inmates statewide have been tested. A total of 799 prison staff members have self-reported testing positive, the state corrections department said. Nineteen incarcerated people in Arizona have been confirmed to have died of COVID-19, with nine additional deaths under investigation. While race/ethnicity is unknown for 30% of all COVID-19 cases statewide, 30% of cases are Hispanic or Latino, 26% are white, 6% are Native American, 3% are Black and 1% are Asian/Pacific Islander. Laboratories have completed 1,826,629 diagnostic tests for COVID-19, 10.1% of which have come back positive. That number now includes both PCR and antigen testing. The percentage of positive tests had increased since mid-May but began decreasing in July and held steady around 4% for several weeks, per the state. Last week it was at 7%, up from 6% the week prior. The state numbersleave out datafrom labs that do not report electronically. ADHS has begun including probable cases as anyone with a positiveantigen test, another type of test to determine current infection. Antigen tests (not related to antibody tests) are a newer type of COVID-19 diagnostic test that use a nasal swab or another fluid sample to test for current infection. Results are typically produced within 15 minutes. A positive antigen test result is considered very accurate, but there's an increased chance of false-negative results, the Mayo Clinic says. Depending on the situation, Mayo Clinic officials say a doctor may recommend a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to confirm a negative antigen test result. Arizona as of Wednesday had the 15th highest overall rate of infection in the country. Ahead of Arizona in cases per 100,000 people since the pandemic began are North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Nebraska, Idaho, Arkansas, Florida, Utah and South Carolina,according to the CDC. Arizona's infection rate is 3,483 cases per 100,000 people, the CDC said. The national average is 2,828 cases per 100,000 people, though the rates in states hard-hit early on in the pandemic may be an undercount because of a lack of available testing in March and April. Deaths by county: 3,672 in Maricopa, 650 in Pima, 361 in Yuma, 252 in Navajo, 237 in Mohave, 230 in Pinal, 179 in Apache, 149 in Coconino, 92 in Yavapai, 76 in Cochise, 73 in Gila, 65 in Santa Cruz, 31 in Graham, 18 in La Paz and fewer than three in Greenlee. People aged 65 and older made up 4,337 of the 6,087 deaths, or 71%. While race/ethnicity is unknown for 11% of deaths, 42% of those who died were white, 30% were Hispanic or Latino, 11% were Native American, 3% were Black and 1% were Asian/Pacific Islander, the state data show. The global death toll on Thursday was 1,227,544 and the U. S. had the highest death count of any country in the world, at 233,767, according toJohns Hopkins University. Arizona's death total of 6,087 deaths represents 2.6% of COVID-19 deaths in the U. S. as of Thursday.

C., only to lose faith in decentralization the next time they win control of Congress and the presidency. Bossing folks around is, after all, a lot more fun than being bossed around. So, it's refreshing to see in this deeply divided country at least tentative steps towards bipartisan agreement that not every issue should be settled by dictates issued from the nation's capital. As encouraging as it is, though, this grudging acceptance of live-and-let-live doesn't go far enough.""American federalism has always been a partisan issue — the GOP are the modern advocates,""notesDemocratic political adviser and former legislator Frank Pignanelli in theDeseret News. ""But the left-leaning have reason to be equally suspicious of overreaching nationalism on key issues: privacy, immigration, environment, etc.""Pignanelli joined with Republican counterpart LaVarr Webb to warn of frantic pandemic-era spending and rules-making by first the Trump and then the Biden administrations. ""[T]his immense federal intervention comes at the risk of making states even more subservient to the federal government, both financially and with more federal regulation and mandates.""Pignanelli isn't the first Democrat to discover the attractions of decentralization.""In the wake of the presidential election, as Democrats realized that Republicans will soon control all three branches of the federal government, progressives disinclined to secede from the Union rediscovered another exit strategy: states' rights,"" Jeffrey RosenwroteforThe New York Timesin 2016. Democrats spent the next several years battling for local governance against the Trump administration's insistence on federal control over matters such asimmigrationandmarijuana. Since then, Democrats have recaptured the presidency, the House, and (sort of) the Senate. Now they're back to insisting that beltway preferences should prevail—at least when their party's positions on issues such asgunsandtaxesdiffer with local preferences. This back-and-forthing on the value of local control vs. central supremacy is exhausting, not to mention overtly opportunistic. As Pignanelli adds, with Webb's agreement, ""Federalism must be a bipartisan issue. Otherwise, it will continue to be subject to the inconsistent whims of elections.""To some extent, this opportunism is baked into American politics, argued Ernest A. Young, then of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, in a2004Brooklyn Law Reviewarticleabout attitudes towards federalism during the War on Terror. He saw switching preferences on central vs. local power as inherent to a system in which elections are won and lost, rotating factions through control of the federal government and localities. ""Federalism is about dividing power; nothing much depends on what the power in question is being used for,"" Young wrote. But ""[i]t is also about providing institutional space for a diversity of political views"" and so is inherently important beyond its utility to whoever lost the last federal election. State and local autonomy functions ""as a rallying point for political opposition to national policy"" and ""assures that a particular faction cannot become entrenched and unaccountable in power.""Or, as Webb put it in theDeseret News, ""On issues like gun control and the minimum wage, why not let Wyoming be Wyoming and New York be New York? Half of congressional dysfunction could be eliminated by modestly accepting the diversity of our country.""That political differences are coming into dangerous conflict is obvious not just from the formal contests observed by Pignanelli, Webb, and Young, but from the national tensions and strife of recent years. Februarypolling by CBS News/YouGovfound that 57 percent of Republicans think of Democrats not as political opponents, but as ""enemies""; 41 percent of Democrats return the sentiment.""The country is increasingly split into camps that don't just disagree on policy and politics — they see the other as alien, immoral, a threat,"" Nate CohncommentedinThe New York Timeslast month. It's not an unprecedented problem, he notes, and other countries that have divided into mutually loathing camps have kept the peace and held together through arrangements including ""power-sharing agreements, devolution or home rule.""Power-sharing, devolution, or home rule sounds a lot like federalism, come to think of it, and for good reason. Decentralization of power reduces the danger that people will resent top-down decisions that are contrary to their own preferences – and that may even be maliciously intended to hurt ""enemies"" in a sectarian society. If you believe that people of varied values and preferences shouldn't be forced to live in lockstep, it makes sense to embrace ""space for a diversity of political views"" and to largely ""let Wyoming be Wyoming and New York be New York.""But the federalism of the Constitution was designed for a nation of about4 million people; many states and evensome countiesare now more populous than the whole country was at the founding. Are you really allowing free range for diverse views by devolving control down to the level of aCaliforniaor aTexasthat each contain multitudes sufficient to entertain many more conflicting ideas than the original United States could have contemplated? EvenLos Angeles County, with 10 million people, is far larger than the entire United States of 1790. At this point,realfederalism, through the devolution of power, requires more than paying lip service to the existence of states and their ability to set independent policies. Decision-making has to go further down the food chain, at least to the county level, to revive something like the federalism of the Constitution. To the extent possible, power shoulddevolve to individualswhose right to make their own decisions and govern their own lives should be respected. Individual self-rule is about as pure an expression of the distributed power embodied by federalism as you'll find. Failing that, the major parties will continue to pretend that they care about federalism when they've lost control of Washington, D. C., and discard their faith in the principle when they've regained a grip on the central political apparatus. And the country will continue to descend into sectarianism and strife as they play their opportunistic games.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0972581150611453,0.4150101301616453,1398,2,Reason

Trump also slammed that recovery as tepid and made several other claims that includedanother implicit criticism of the Federal Reserve chairman,whom he appointed. Did you hear the latest con job?

452,Attorney General Barr bombs premise of Black Lives Matter,22.33,20.67,https://www.lifezette.com/2020/09/attorney-general-barr-bombs-premise-of-black-lives-matter/,https://adfontesmedia.com/lifezette-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,22,"Black Lives Matter is based on a simple premise: Racist white police officers are killing black people because they are black. But actual numbers show that a majority of those killed by police are white and that only 32% are black. So, if racist white police officers are hunting down innocent blacks, then why are they killing more whites than blacks? Why, by two to one, are you safer with a police officer if you’re black than if you’re another race?The answer is obvious: Black Lives Matter, like so many Democrat disinformation operations, is a hoax. Like Russian collusion and the Ukrainian phone call before it, Black Lives Matter is based on a lie that is willingly spread by the media. But U. S. Attorney General William Barr is having nothing of it.“I think the narrative that the police are on some epidemic of shooting unarmed black men is simply a false narrative,” Barr said Wednesday on. “The fact is that it’s very rare for an unarmed African American to be shot by a white police officer.” vast majority (68 percent) of those shot by police officers are not black. So those alleged killer racist officers must be color blind. The majority shot by police are white —52 percent— while 32 percent are black. African American males make up six percent of the population but commit over many times that percentage of crimes, according to findings from the National Institutes of Health and the FBI. Thus their chances of being involved in police situations are much higher to begin with. All the evidence points to one inescapable conclusion: police officers shoot more white people than black people by 20 percent. So, going by facts and the premise of the movement, it should be called “Male Lives Matter,” “White Lives Matter,” or more than not, “Criminal Lives Matter.”Barr continues: “At the same time, I think it would be an oversimplification to treat the problem as rooted in some deep-seated racism generally infecting our police departments. It seems far more likely that the problem stems from a complex mix of factors, which can be addressed with focused attention over time.”Barr is not a politician but the nation’s top law enforcement officer, so he can’t and shouldn’t go into the factual consequences of his data-driven assertion. But he is also a very intelligent man and is not oblivious to the obvious conclusions. The amazing part of this is the complete intellectual disregard Democrats have for America and especially for black Americans. They believe that by lying about this issue, in contravention of easily discoverable facts, that black Americans will rise up in indignation and blame the president. But something else happened. Since the riots and the media ascendancy of Black Lives Matter, the president’s poll numbers have skyrocketed with black American voters. Trump received about 6-8 percent of their votes in 2016. Now, his standing is around 25 percent and growing. He’s quadrupled his support. So even in today’s America there are times when a Democrat lie won’t work.",0,Problematic,0.0596527777777777,0.4182973710317459,640,0,LifeZette

Ted Cruz of Texas clashed with a fellow Republican, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, during a discussion of coronavirus spending and the federal deficit. According to the Washington Post’sJames Hohmann, Cotton “suggested” that “Republicans should be willing to keep racking up debt to maintain power.” But Cruz vehemently disagreed, declaring “What in the hell are we doing?”Cotton, Hohmann notes, “argued that the full conference needs to focus on protecting their most vulnerable members. Cotton postulated that Democrats would spend more money if they win the Senate majority in November — and therefore, it is cheaper in the long run to allow the size of the spending package to grow with more goodies to benefit incumbents who are up for reelection.”It remains to be seen whether or not President Donald Trump will win a second term in November. Many recent polls have shown Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — in some of them, by double digits. But whether Trump leaves the White House in January 2021 or January 2025, Republicans will eventually have to debate what a post-Trump GOP will look like — and as Hohmann sees it, the clash between Cruz and Cotton could foreshadow a clash between the Republican senators in 2024.“Cruz and Cotton are among the small clique of ambitious Republican senators in their forties who have been laying the groundwork to run for president in 2024, along with Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.),” Hohmann explains. “The dueling stances Cruz and Cotton staked out behind closed doors offer an early taste of the ideological battles we can expect as Republicans increasingly vie to take the torch from President Trump. These fights will flare up faster and hotter if the president loses in November. Others outside the Senate, such as Vice President (Mike) Pence and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, are also expected to compete for the nod.”",1,Questionable,0.1339285714285714,0.36875,462,0,AlterNet

From the Washington Post:The legal challenge takes aim at Georgia’s Election Integrity Act, which was passed in March by the Republican-led state legislature and signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp (R). The law imposes new limits on the use of absentee ballots, makes it a crime for outside groups to provide food and water to voters waiting at polling stations, and hands greater control over election administration to the state legislature. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Kristen Clarke, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, will make the announcement later Friday alongside others who worked closely on developing the lawsuit, including Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta and Principal Deputy Assistant Pamela Karlan, the people familiar with the matter said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the action has not been formally made public. Of course, we can expect Republicans in Georgia and across the nation to view this as some kind of “big government” overreach while pretending that Kemp’s desk isn’twhere Black votes go to dieand pretending that the state isn’t stillpurging voters from the registration rollsfor seemingly arbitrary reasons. Don’t be surprised if pro-keep-the-negroes-from-the-polls advocates continue to push the “big lie” that widespread voter fraud is the reason laws are being proposed and passed in an effort to secure elections even though Kempadmittedthat his state’s new laws aren’t related to fraud. Republicans—who have attempted tolimit voter access in at least 43 statessince the last election—knowthat they need to restrict voting in order to win. Hell, even their orange Crush-flavored cult leader who used to occupy the Oval Officehas admitted it. And since the party that believes all things Critical Race Theory are of the devil can’t get anywhere in the vicinity of a majority Black vote in any given election, Republicans know their best bet is to place as many barriers between us and the ballot box as humanly possible. They don’t have to admit it; their legislation tells the story. Anyway, according to the Post, this lawsuit represents “the first major voting rights case the Justice Department has filed under the Biden administration,” and it will likely be a welcome move to all who have protested against voter suppression in Georgia, which includes citizens,celebrities,religious leaders,corporations, Atlanta sports teams,Major League BaseballandAtlanta’s mayor. Seriously, all we want is to vote unrestricted, and if that threatens the GOP’s chances of gaining power again, maybe it’s time the party looks inward instead of cheating to win.",0,Problematic,0.151664673046252,0.4670255183413079,623,1,The Root

The United States suffers 40,000 deaths by gun annually. Six in 10 of those are suicides. Three in 10 are homicides that involve more mundane but still life-shattering uses of weapons, typically handguns. Most of the remaining deaths are accidents. Mass shootings,horrifyingly frequentas they are, barely register in totals. For each gun death of every kind, shockwaves of pain ripple through families and communities. For each injury, too: There are more than100,000 of thoseannually. Demanding universal background checks is necessary; it is insufficient.

The pressure is even higher than normal for all the newsroom stakeholders involved in the final decision: How do our visual choices reflect all the significance of the day?Many papers opted for a traditional swearing-in photo, with varying crops. That image certainly captures the gravitas of the moment, but it also hews to what one might expect to emerge from Washington, D. C. Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts as Jill Biden holds the Bible during the 59th Presidential Inauguration at the U. S.

Biden has already twice been sworn in as vice president; Wednesday’s images weren’t significantly different than 2009 or 2013. A handful of news organizations took approaches that didn’t home in on Biden. The San Francisco Chronicle, which covered Harris heavily during her work as the city’s district attorney and later as one of California’s U. S. senators, featured Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff at the top of the page with Biden applauding to the side. Front pages showing Inauguration Day from the San Francisco Chronicle, The News-Times and the Tampa Bay Times.“After much editing by director of visuals Nicole Frugé, considering wire photos, and staff and freelance options, we chose to feature the best image captured by our staff photographer Gabrielle Lurie,” Chronicle creative director Danielle Mollette-Parks said. “It was a joyful, authentic moment featuring both Harris and Biden that we felt our Bay Area audience would connect with.”The eight Hearst newspapers in Connecticut all featured an image of President Biden looking across the aisle at Harris. The design team is mostly based in Norwalk, though working from home. Wendy Metcalfe, vice president of content and editor-in-chief of Hearst Connecticut Media Group, said she worked with the team throughout Wednesday thinking about how the visuals and headlines would work together to represent “an overall theme of unity.”“As a community publication, it’s also very important to reflect what local residents are feeling,” Metcalfe said. The News-Times in Danbury had four residents’ headshots on the front.“Being frank about where we are and where we need to go or not go, we also included the quote about ‘much to repair’ that level set some of the obstacles or opportunities that the new president felt lies ahead,” Metcalfe said. Front pages showing Inauguration Day from The Detroit News, The Tennessee Tribune and The Free Lance-Star. The (Poynter-owned) Tampa Bay Times had a striking full-cover photo. “The main thing we decided before anything else is that we wanted Biden AND Harris on the poster front,” said Paul Alexander, the Times’ deputy editor of planning and design. “… History was bigger than the president this time.”The challenge Alexander’s staff encountered was a 2021 problem: Because of social distancing, finding the right image wasn’t simple. The Times initially designed the page horizontally “because Biden and Harris never really got close enough for a strong vertical.” Alexander said they persisted and found the vertical image for the final front. The Detroit News led with an image of a Biden-Harris fist-bump.“She represented so many firsts for the nation that we hoped that she could be a meaningful part of the lead image,” executive editor and publisher Gary Miles said. The photo the News chose has an iconic quality. “We’ve gotten a strong reaction from the community so far, including single copy purchase requests from other states,” Miles said. A couple of other news fronts stood out. The Tennessee Tribune is a Black-owned publication based in Nashville. Its cover displayed images of the Bidens and the Harrisses with equal weight. And The Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, Virginia, curated a selection of images from the day. One issue the Times encountered: Thursday is not part of itstwice-weekly print publishing schedule. “We are considering running individual posters of the president and vice president and some other elements from today’s paper on Sunday to make up for the lost keepsake,” Alexander said. If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It's not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up.

460,Joe Biden’s Hopes of Getting His Agenda Through Congress Are Dimming,-19.33,38.0,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/joe-biden-hopes-of-getting-his-agenda-through-congress-are-dimming,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-15,25,"and the GOP might agree on one thing: If Democrats pass the bipartisan infrastructure planbrokeredlast week, their appetite to push a more ambitious bill tackling issues like climate change and inequality on a party line vote later will be diminished. Though generally reluctant to giveJoe Bidenanything approximating a political victory, Republicans have openly mused in recent days about supporting the $1.2 trillion deal carved out by SenatorsRob PortmanandKyrsten Sinema—believing, apparently, that doing so could make it easier for them to quash other big-ticket Biden agenda items.“The stars are kind of lining up for an infrastructure bill,” Senate Minority Whiptold. “And if you do do something bipartisan on that, then I think doing something partisan on reconciliation—in some ways, with certain Democrats—it gets a lot harder.”Sanders, it seems, thinks so, too, and on Monday announced he would not support the plan as it stands—potentially setting the stage for fellow progressives in the House and Senate to mobilize against it. “I wouldn’t vote for it,” the Vermont Independenttold reportersMonday. “The bottom line is there are a lot of needs facing this country. Now is the time to address those needs, and it has to be paid for in a progressive way, given the fact that we have massive income and wealth inequality in America.”Biden in Marchoutlined a proposalthat would address not only the nation’s crumbling roads and bridges, but also its“soft infrastructure”needs—measures to improve child care, combat climate change, expand access to healthcare and education, and to tackle other “needs in peoples’ homes and communities,” as White House Press Secretaryput itat the time. Republicans didn’t like the price tag and complained that it defined infrastructure too broadly: The plan, according to House Minority LeaderKevin McCarthy, was a “‘kitchen sink’ of wasteful progressive demands.” Those GOP arguments haven’t always been ingood faith, but Biden spent the spring trying to negotiate a bipartisan deal anyway. Some Democrats’ patience has been wearing thin as deliberations drag on, and have called for their plan to be passed through reconciliation—a process that would allow them to circumvent the Republican blockade, but would require all 50 members of their own caucus to be on board. There’s no guarantee that’ll happen, given the unwillingness Sinema andhave expressed toward passing any legislation—including onvoting rights, which the GOP is actively working to restrict—without Republican support. So when Biden’s talks withShelley Moore Capitobroke down last week, Sinema and Manchin formed a new gang of 10 andconvened over pizzato hammer out a plan. What they came up with is still expensive, but focuses more narrowly on traditional infrastructure. Some Democrats, including Senate Majority LeaderChuck Schumer, havesuggestedthey’d support the compromise plan if their soft infrastructure priorities could be done separately through reconciliation—essentially breaking infrastructure into two parts. The problem, of course, is that Manchin and Sinema have not committed to the second part—and Republicans may be betting that they won’t if the first part passes. Democrat, part of the gang of bipartisan negotiators, seemed to think it wouldn’t be a problem: “It’s my understanding that everybody has said that they can support reconciliation in some form,” shesaidMonday. But Manchin, in his own remarks to reporters, offered little in the way of assurances to his party: “There’s a lot more that needs to be done,” he said, “so we need to work it the same way we’re working this one.” Democrats, wanting to deliver on the ambition of Biden’s original plan, have been skeptical of that work; SenatorRichard Blumenthalcalled the bipartisan deal “paltry” and “disappointing.” He told reporters that he could still “hold my nose” and vote for it, but only if there was an “irrevocable commitment” to reconciliation—a promise Manchin and Sinema don’t seem to want to make. Sanders’ opposition to the bipartisan package—which could rally other Democrats against it—could put pressure on the pair to actually make some sort of commitment; the party has but a narrow majority in the House and controls a split Senate, and any defections could, in theory, thwart the bill. Then again, they might not need all Democrats on board if they can attract enough Republicans. “If this gets off the ground,” a senior GOP aidetold, “it’s either 10-ish Republicans and almost all Democrats or it’s 20-25 Republicans and 10 or 15 Democrats voting against it.” Of course, even that’s not a given, considering Senate Minority Leaderhas yet to tip his hand. Indeed, he only gave the bill a “maybe 50-50” shot of passing when asked about it in a Mondayinterviewwith conservative radio hostHugh Hewitt. “Both sides would like to get an infrastructure bill,” he said, but there are “red lines” he would not cross—particularly when it comes to the tax cut he andDonald Trumprammed through in 2017. That, perhaps, underscores the bad faith with which he and his party have approached these negotiations. “Compromise” in McConnell’s Washington has always meant significant concessions from Democrats and few, if any, from Republicans—and that hasn’t seemed to change since Biden and the Democrats swept into power in January. The road to an infrastructure deal remains uncertain, full of potholes and blind curves. Where this proposal ultimately goes is anyone’s guess. But Sanders, Blumenthal, and others in the Democratic caucus are right to be frustrated: Republicans don’t seem willing to practice the bipartisanship they preach, and only appear to be considering compromise as a means of blocking the rest of Biden’s agenda. “This week, we couldn’t get any Senate Republicans to support legislation to guarantee equal pay for equal work,” SanderswroteFriday, the day bipartisan negotiators announced their infrastructure agreement. “Do we really believe more time and more negotiations will get them to vote for an infrastructure package that truly addresses the crises we face?

ByThomas FullerOpen this articlein the New York Times Audio app on iOS. SAN FRANCISCO — Two grandmothers stabbed and a third punched in the face in broad daylight. An 84-year-old man fatally shoved to the ground while on his morning walk. In the past seven months, at least seven older Asian residents have been brutally attacked in San Francisco, a city with one of the largest Asian American populations and the oldest Chinatown in the country.“It’s a horrible feeling to be afraid in your own community,” said John Hamasaki, who is a member of San Francisco’s Police Commission and who is ethnically Japanese. “People are genuinely afraid to go outside, to walk down the street alone.”The attacks first shocked and angered Asian American residents in the city. But the question of what to do about the violence has now become a source of division. Many residents of Chinese descent are calling for a significant increase in police patrols. The city’s Asian American leaders, however, said they would rather explore solutions that do not involve law enforcement. One of the most proudly liberal cities in the country is torn between its commitment to criminal justice reforms in the wake of George Floyd’s killing and the brutal reality of the city’s most vulnerable residents being stabbed in the middle of the day on busy city streets. Connie Chan and Gordon Mar, the two members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who are of Chinese descent, have been under pressure from Chinese activists to increase police staffing, a move the elected officials have largely resisted. Chinese activists — many of whom also denounce Chesa Boudin, the city’s district attorney, for not being tough enough on crime and back a recall effort against him — have shown up at meetings to challenge officials, including Ms. Chan and Mr. Mar.

462,Virginia’s radical Dems pass despicable bill that makes assaulting a police officer no longer a felony!,25.33,25.67,https://therightscoop.com/virginias-radical-dems-pass-despicable-bill-that-makes-assaulting-a-police-officer-no-longer-a-felony/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-right-scoop-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"Virginia Democrats are making their mark on this anti-cop Black Lives Matter movement with an attack on police of their own:– The Virginia Senate passed a bill this week that would downgrade assaulting a police officer in the commonwealth from a felony to a misdemeanor. Senate Bill 5032 would eliminate the mandatory minimum term of confinement for “an assault and battery committed against a judge; magistrate; law-enforcement officer; correctional officer; person directly involved in the care, treatment, or supervision of inmates; firefighter; or volunteer firefighter or any emergency medical services personnel and provides that such crime can no longer be committed as a simple assault and must result in a bodily injury.”The measure to defelonize assaulting an officer was introduced by Virginia Democrats in July, following nationwide calls for police reform in the wake of George Floyd’s death.“Our constituents want change,” state Sen. Mamie Locke, a Democrat, said when introducing the bill. “We hear that loud and clear from them. They want policy change. They’re pretty much done with thoughts and prayers. They’re done with ‘one more discussion’ and hearing us say, ‘We’ll get it done.’ … They want policy change.”Currently, assaulting a police officer in Virginia is a felony punishable by a minimum of six months in jail. The bill will need to be approved by the House in the General Assembly before it goes to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, also a Democrat, for signature. Attacking police officers is their answer to so-called police brutality? Wake up Virginians, this is the horror show you voted for!This bill isn’t going to do anything but increase the attacks on police officers by Black Lives Matter/Antifa thugs! It will also create a loophole that can be used to claim thatorthat assaultisn’t really bodily injury. And if Virginia’s corrupt prosecutors, like the one in Portland, suddenly claim they aren’t going to prosecute misdemeanors, then it’s OPEN SEASON on cops for every to bit thug on the streets!Those in Virginia who still respect police officers need to pressure the GA not to pass this monstrous bill. And they should dare governor blackface to sign it. Because if they don’t and this bill passes, there’s going to be a huge police officer exodus in Virginia like they’ve never seen before.",1,Questionable,0.0345238095238095,0.4336734693877552,517,0,The Right Scoop

464,“Complete incompetence:” Biden team slams Trump’s COVID work,-8.33,44.67,https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/nothing-for-us-to-rework-biden-team-starts-from-scratch-on-covid/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,19,"Just a day into office, President Joe Biden and his administration have unveiled a comprehensive,200-page strategic planand over a dozen executive orders and actions to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic currently rampaging across the country. With the running start, the administration hopes to finally get control over the virus, which has already taken the lives of more than 408,000 Americans. The number of deaths is expected to top 500,000 next month, Biden saidin an appearance Thursdayto unveil his strategic plan.""Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better,"" he said, calling his approach to the pandemic a ""full-scale wartime effort.""The lag between people becoming infected, developing COVID-19, and succumbing to the disease will keep the numbers grim for weeks to come, regardless of new efforts put in place today. But the administration says it's also facing challenges from inheriting the work from the previous administration. In remarks Thursday, Biden criticized the federal response so far: ""For the past year, we couldn't rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and coordination that we needed, and we have seen the tragic cost of that failure.""Upon taking office,sources in the administrationtold CNN that they were shocked by the state of the federal work on the pandemic—or the lack thereof. ""There is nothing for us to rework,"" one source told the outlet. ""We are going to have to build everything from scratch.""Another source echoed that the Trump administration had no plan and that Biden's administration would have to start from ""square one."" Upon realizing the situation, the administration member reportedly responded: ""Wow, just further affirmation of complete incompetence.""To get control of the pandemic, Biden moved ahead with a series of actions, signing executive orders Wednesday requiringmasking and physical distancing on federal propertiesandorganizing a White House COVID-19 response team. Thursday, he revealed 10 additional executive orders, which aim to: boost manufacturing for vaccine supplies and equipment; reimburse states for emergency supplies and National Guard deployments; increase testing capacity; support the development of new therapies; boost health data collection; guide schools on how to safely reopen; guide businesses on how to keep employees safe; require masking on transit and negative tests from international travelers; ensure and equitable pandemic response; and restore America's leadership in public health on the global stage. The 200-page strategic plan, titled ""National Strategy for the Covid-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness,"" fleshes out all the steps Biden has planned to tackle the pandemic. Chief among the priorities is to speed up vaccination, which has been plagued by disorganization since rollout began in December. So far, the federal government has distributed nearly 38 million doses, but only17.5 million doses have gone into people's armsand only about 2.4 million people have received their second dose. Biden has set a goal of administering 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days in office. To reach that goal, Biden aims to speed vaccine development, make the vaccine available to more people, increase the number of places people can get vaccinated, and expand the medical workforce that can administer vaccines. He has already authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency to begin setting up the first of many federal vaccination sites. One of the biggest vaccination hurdles so far appears to have been coordination between states and the federal government. In his final days at the helm, former Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, laid the blame solely on states for the bungled rollouts. States, meanwhile, pointed fingers at the federal response. To address the problem, Biden noted in his remarks Thursday that he has directed FEMA to assign a ""COVID response liaison"" for each state, so that every state will have its own federal point person to coordinate federal and state efforts to distribute vaccine and get shots into people's arms. Meanwhile, Biden also took steps to rejoin the World Health Organization, retracting withdrawal notification sent by the Trump administration. In an address Thursday, top infectious disease expertAnthony Fauci told the WHO board: ""The United States stands ready to work in partnership and solidarity to support the international COVID-19 response, mitigate its impact on the world, strengthen our institutions, advance epidemic preparedness for the future, and improve the health and wellbeing of all people throughout the world.""",3,Reliable,0.063320707070707,0.4609780844155844,977,3,ARS Technica

""We're becoming desensitized.""He believed that the group on W. Lake Street had every right to be there. But he noted that some residents at the Walkway Apartments, which advertises ""posh Uptown living,"" ""are scared. Some people are just plain sick of it, to have that noise [outside] their window.""The intense movement against police brutality marched into the heart of Uptown, the hub of trendy nightlife and high-end apartments, over the weekend after Winston Smith, a Black man, was killed there by a federal task force on Thursday. Protesters shut down major intersections, faced walls of police and drew curious looks from bystanders on sleek apartment balconies and at stylish restaurants. Demonstrators gathered outside the parking garage at W. Lake Street and Girard Avenue where Smith, 32, was shot after dining at Stella's Fish Cafe. Well-wishers left flowers, signs and candles nearby, and scrawled his name and messages about police reform all over the intersection in chalk. Somebody wrote ""Wince Way"" — using Smith's nickname — on the driveway into the garage. The U. S. Marshals Service, which led the task force that killed Smith, has said officers shot him after he fired a gun from his car as they tried to arrest him on the fifth floor of the ramp on a warrant of felon in possession of a gun. CARLOS GONZALEZ • cgonzalez@startribune.comMinneapolis’ Uptown neighborhood, pictured Monday, has been the site of protests over killings by law enforcement. The officers were not wearing body cameras, and there is no known video of the incident. Protesters say police have made claims that contradict video so routinely — including initial reports that George Floyd died after a medical incident — that they cannot trust law enforcement accounts without footage. Protest leaders say it's important for those in Uptown to understand that police accountability is their problem, too.""A human being has been killed and we still don't know the truth. … This is what we have been talking about for far too long, and there's a lot of communities like Uptown that have thought it ain't coming to their neighborhood,"" Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told a crowd that had joined him in blocking off Lyndale Avenue and Lake Street over the weekend. Activists marched through Uptown in 2013 to call for the prosecution of police who shot Terrance Franklin in the basement of a neighborhood house, though most protests over police violence in recent years have been held in other parts of the city — from the North Side to downtown to southeast, where police killed Floyd in May 2020. Scrutiny over Smith's killing comes as Uptown reels from a rash of business closures, lootings and crime — and the scars of a mass shooting last summer that killed one and injured 11. The pandemic's toll still lingers: the popular Chino Latino restaurant and Apple store have closed after two decades, and Uptown Theatre down the street is being evicted for not paying rent over the last year. Shuttered buildings abound. Steve Taylor, who runs the Uptown Crime page on Facebook, said he supports the rights of protesters. But he raised concerns that unrelated groups of rioters tend to follow later at night and have already set dumpsters on fire last week and broken into several shops. Police arrested more than two dozen people Friday. He worries that vandals could damage small businesses already struggling to recover.""Uptown,"" said Taylor, ""has been through so much pain.""Protesters planted themselves in the street and renounced ""killer cops"" last weekend. At Stella's, a waitress took a photo of a smiling couple raising their drinks as demonstrators shouted in the background.""Everybody that was in Stella's on Thursday, I want y'all to stand up,"" Smith's brother Kidale Smith called out from the street over the weekend. ""Come out. Come find me. I need this information. They want to keep everything hidden, and this is how they get away with everything.""He questioned why the U. S. Marshals Service, which led the task force that killed his older brother, had not released more details.""I want the U. S. marshals to come down here and face me,"" Smith declared. The crowd began marching east on Lake Street.""Say his name!""""Winston Smith!""They reached Lyndale and spread out so that cars could no longer pass. Hussein and others noted that Smith was killed the same day the city moved to reopen George Floyd Square.""What does that tell you about what's happening?"" Hussein asked. ""We've got to wake up. They think we gave up. They think we went home.""Civil rights leader Nekima Levy Armstrong took the microphone.""Give yourselves a hand for being out on these streets on Saturday night in Uptown Minneapolis,"" she said. ""Where we see signs that say 'posh apartments,' where we see some of the finest restaurants … A lot of the people who live over here don't think that the movement affects them because they're comfortable.""But, she added, ""we try to warn them that nobody is safe if you allow the police to have unchecked power and no accountability.""Gesturing to the Walkway Apartments, activist Lavish Mack told a fresh crowd of protesters Sunday night that somebody had thrown a water bottle at him from the balcony earlier.""They just want their regular status quo,"" he said. He led the crowd to the corner of Hennepin and Lagoon avenues. Motorists began turning around as they reached the mass of people in the street. Mack tried to convey that they should be angry at law enforcement, not those protesting the authorities for killing people. Protesters marched past a series of cops, yelling, ""Hands up, don't shoot!"" Outdoor diners on Hennepin stared as the marchers' chants of Smith's name overpowered the night. Some raised a fist in solidarity. As the sky darkened, the protesters faced a wall of police standing in the street once they returned to Lake and Girard. Some passersby honked their horns in support. A few Black participants screamed at a Black policeman in the lineup, questioning how he could be in his line of work. The crowd groaned as Kidale Smith urged a more conciliatory attitude toward law enforcement. City Council President Lisa Bender came to watch from across the street after putting her children to bed. Barely audible above the crowd's chants, she said that police were escalating tension, and having them be the only response for a protest over a police killing put everyone in an impossible situation. She had been urging the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to say more about the killing. ""I think we will continue to see protests,"" she said, ""until there is more information.""Aaron Lavinsky contributed to this report.

466,Stock market performance during Biden's first 100 days has officially bested everyone from Trump back through Truman,-2.0,45.33,https://fortune.com/2021/04/29/stock-market-performance-under-biden-first-100-days-sp-500-spx-nasdaq-dow-jones-djia-april-2021-update/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"Stocks are booming under Biden. In the 100 days since President Joe Biden was sworn in on Jan. 20, the stock market has risen 9.3%, making it the best first-100-days stretch for stocks under a new president since President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s astronomical gains in 1933, per LPL Financial data. (That’s based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s close the day prior to the inauguration through Wednesday’s close.) The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up over 10% since Biden assumed office. Per LPL, the Dow has returned an average 4.3% under the first 100 days of a new president. And notably Biden’s record tops his predecessor President Donald Trump’s stock performance for the same timeframe (up 6%). Certainly, presidents don’t have much control over how the stock market performs. But if anything, LPL’s chief market strategist Ryan Detrick argues “we think it means, whether you like Joe Biden’s policies or not, the stock market is saying things are getting better,” he tells. To be sure, the market isn’t necessarily a good gauge of the health of an economy, and the one Biden inherited is still forging its way back to health. But Detrick notes “the stock market is a leading indicator for the economy, and with stocks doing this well the last 100 days, … it’s saying there are some positive things on the horizon.”Indeed, the economy has been roaring back from the depths of the pandemic;GDP for the first quarter grew an ample 6.4%, and corporate earnings seasonis off to a very strong start. As for the market,stocks have continued to hit new highs. Biden made it clearfrom the outsetthat his administration was aiming to be all about action. Since his inauguration, President Biden has signed multiple executive orders and a massive $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, and accelerated the pace of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Biden has also proposed other big spending packagesaimed at infrastructureandsocial programs like child care and education. According to Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, “We’re seeing an administration that is acting faster and bolder than most people would have expected,” he tells. Still, much of the boost Biden is getting in the markets may be due to the fact that, “The economy continues to recover, COVID continues to get better, and I think that Biden is getting the political benefit of that, at least so far,” suggests Mills. And with huge stimulus spending and an ever-accommodative Federal Reserve, LPL’s Detrick argues “you could say President Biden came into a pretty good situation with the dovish Fed and reopening.” In that sense, he suggests the market would “probably” be doing well regardless of who was president. Not all of Biden’s proposals are being embracedby the business community, including his intention to raise the corporate tax rateandcapital gains tax. But Mills believes the Street is “pricing in” an “increase in investment taxes, but probably in the 28% range,” he says, instead of Biden’s proposed39.6% figure. And those like LPL’s Detrick point out that, regardless of how investors feel, none of these policies come as any surprise to the Street (Biden is “doing what he said he’s gonna do”). Still, the threat of rising inflation and theupcoming bearish seasonality of the next few months for the marketcould put a dampener on things. But for Detrick, “to put a bow on it, the market is clearly okay with President Biden’s policies … [and] the way he’s taken the first 100 days on the job,” Detrick suggests. “Because if the market wasn’t, we wouldn’t be doing what we’ve been doing.”",3,Reliable,0.1703107263107263,0.3680979637646303,842,3,Fortune

468,The Hypocrisy of Police Action Against Women Mourning Sarah Everard,-8.67,37.67,https://www.popsugar.com/news/sarah-everard-london-vigil-pictures-48215587,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-14,25,"On March 13, crowds gathered across the UK to mourn the death of Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old South London resident was killed earlier this month while walking home, and a Metropolitan police officer has been accused of her murder. Throughout the day,individuals who felt connected to Everard's tragedycongregated at Clapham Common, including Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge. But as evening approached, tensions grew between demonstrators and police presence, leading to forceful actions and aggressive arrests. Everard's death served as a reminder of the lack of safety women experience across the globe. The gathering at Clapham Common meant to memorialize one of the last places she was seen but the main ""Reclaim These Streets"" event in London was cancelled after police cited COVID-19 precautions. Mourners assembled that night anyway. According toreports, it took less than an hour forMet police officers (mostly men) to close in on the crowd. Their corralling techniques made social-distancing impossible, as they used force against the peaceful vigil. Photos taken at the event show women dropped to the ground as police made arrests. Image Source:Getty / Kristian Buus/In PicturesThe hypocritical police action against women wasn't lost on the world watching, as a police officer from the very same group stands accused of Everard's death. Women see themselves in Everard, when they fear for their safety or experience lifelong harassment. Women visited the vigil to express solidarity. For that same safety to be threatened once again, at the hands of police, is haunting. On Sunday morning, the police released a statement and said, ""We were placed in this position because of the overriding need to protect people's safety."" However, outraged activists continue to call for the resignation of Cressida Dick, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service. London's mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted, ""The scenes from Clapham Common are unacceptable. The police have a responsibility to enforce Covid laws but from images I've seen it's clear the response was at times neither appropriate nor proportionate."" Undeterred, many mourners continue to assemble in London throughout the weekend. As society reflects on Everard's murder, the police action at her vigil, and the ensuing political response it's essential to remember those who are too often excluded from this narrative: BIWOC. Across the seas, on the very same day, the world mournedthe loss of Breonna Taylor, another woman killed at the hands of police. When activists sought justice for her during rallies last summer, they faced another level of police aggression. Last year, Met police officers allegedlyposed for selfies with the dead bodies of Black women. As the Black communityexpresses outragetowards this institution on Twitter, it's clear, the demands for change must be inclusive.",2,Generally Reliable,-0.045,0.3427777777777777,626,2,Popsugar

About five weeks earlier, John Havron was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, which ravaged his body. The day had come for him to leave his house for hospice. But it was tough going. Havron’s wife, son and stepson kept asking him — how do you feel? Are you ready to go? Is it time?Confused and slightly disoriented, Havron could only say, “OK.”“Dad was struggling. He was out of it,” his son, Todd Havron, said about that day in 2018. “He couldn’t really vocalize. It was hard to see somebody so strong be so scared.”After about an hour, someone said, “Do we want to call Felice?”Felice Apolinsky — longtime program director of Nashville cancer support organization Gilda’s Club — became close friends with John Havron nine years earlier. That’s when Havron showed up at Gilda’s Club because his first wife had been diagnosed with cancer. With kindness and love, Apolinsky walked him through his wife’s illness and death in 2010. About eight years later, Havron himself got cancer. And Apolinsky walked beside Havron and his relatives again. She showed up to his house just 15 minutes after she got the call. Everyone inside relaxed as soon as she walked in.“It took about two minutes,” Todd Havron said. “He looked at her, said her name, and said, ‘Yeah, I’m ready to go.’”Apolinsky has been building that kind of trust with people since arriving at Gilda’s Club 22 years ago. In June, Apolinsky, 56, announced her retirement to spend more time with her 87-year-old father, who died July 29. But the curly-haired, pint-sized “angel on earth” will retire anyway. Apolinsky will be honored Sept. 3 at Gilda’s Club’sannual Red Door Bash fundraiser, a virtual event this year. She leaves behind a legacy of helping thousands of people with cancer — and loved ones of people with cancer — with big hugs, a quick smile, an open heart and quiet competence. Of those thousands, Apolinsky perhaps grew closest to Havron, who entrusted her with a sacred duty just before he died two years ago. The roots of that relationship started two decades ago when Apolinsky, then a 34-year-old social worker, practically forced herself onto the staff of a brand new Gilda’s Club. She’d been working with Nashville adolescents and others. In 1996, Apolinsky — just months after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer — found herself at an organizational meeting for a Nashville chapter of New York-based Gilda’s Club, named for comedian Gilda Radner, who died of cancer in 1989.“I immediately fell in love with the mission,” said Apolinsky, who connected strongly with the group's emphasis on building a community of those dealing with cancer. She sent Nashville Gilda’s Club founder Sandy Towers a 14-page pitch and convinced Towers to go to lunch with her.“She had a better handle on the mission that I even did,” Towers said. “I sat there in utter amazement.”For “minimal pay,” Apolinsky enthusiastically started support groups for those with cancer and for relatives and friends of those with cancer. She also launched nutrition and cooking classes, grief groups, programming for children of people with cancer and more; they're free for participants, supported by donations. Apolinsky and other staffers help Gilda's Club members walk through the sadness of death, but they are quick to point out there is much joy celebrated as well. Much of the club's programming teaches members how to live life after battling cancer. Apolinsky has gone to hundreds of cancer-free anniversary celebrations, birthday parties, baby showers, weddings and parties. Her friends say her sense of humor sometimes is downright goofy. Michael Dinwiddie, Havron's stepson, called Apolinsky “this wonderfully strong yet kooky person.""The real gift, friends and club members say, is her ability to balance those parts of her personality and to walk through endless days of super-charged emotions.“I’m always amazed at the resilience she has to get up every morning and put herself out there,” Towers said. And, Apolinsky has a way of making deep connections with members from their first interactions, several participants say. Katherine Sjoblom, 54, of East Nashville, said she called the club 10 years ago, distraught, after finding out she had bone marrow cancer.""What do I tell my young kids?"" she remembered asking. A staff member put the call through to Apolinsky, who calmly and kindly answered Sjoblom’s questions.“I felt heard, and I felt like someone understood this is a really horrible moment in my life,” Sjoblom said, voice cracking as tears spill from her eyes.“How many times has she given this advice, and yet she still made me feel important?”Apolinsky shows the same compassion and respect to volunteers and fellow staff members.“Felice is genuine, caring, supportive, inclusive and authentic, and what she shows you is from the heart,” said volunteer Dana Davis, 53, a social worker who runs support groups at Gilda’s Club. “I consider Felice a warm hug. And I don’t say that about many people.”Apolinsky remembered that John Havron came into Gilda’s Club for the first time in 2009, devastated that his wife of 40 years, his childhood sweetheart, had brain cancer. Havron stood out to her.“He had sparkly eyes and a beautiful smile, even when he was weeping when he introduced himself,” she said. Havron’s wife died eight months or so after that, and Havron kept coming back for grief groups and for support.“It was a really dark time for him,” Apolinsky said. “His biggest cheerleader had died, and he was going home to an empty house. The nights were very long and very lonely.”Apolinsky started to call Havron regularly. She saw him in her office for informal one-on-ones and encouraged him to do volunteer work. The two formed a strong bond, and eventually Havron emerged from the darkness. He started to date again. Havron brought his girlfriend, and eventual wife, Belinda Dinwiddie Havron, to Gilda’s Club to meet Apolinsky.“I was absolutely terrified to meet her, much more so than I was to meet his children,” Dinwiddie Havron said. “I knew she was a very important part of his life. He knows Felicia and trusts her. What if she says it’s too soon or she doesn’t approve?”Apolinsky approved, and she helped Havron walk through feelings of guilt and disloyalty toward his first wife. Two years ago, Havron called Apolinsky in her office to tell her he had cancer. The prognosis was bleak. She sat in stunned silence for a few minutes before the tears came.“My heart literally hurt,” she said. After Havron went to Alive Hospice, Apolinsky checked in or visited every day until he died three weeks later. During one visit, Havron asked his family to leave the room so he could speak to Apolinsky privately. No one hesitated. Havron then dictated affirmations for each of his children, grandchildren and stepchildren, while Apolinsky clumsily typed into her iPhone notes app. He spoke of one grandchild’s spunk and personality, another’s grace, another’s tenacity. He pointed out one child’s sense of humor, another’s reliability. Havron’s message for his wife: “You are my everything.”Days later, Apolinsky read the affirmations aloud during Havron’s funeral, looking each of his loved ones in the eyes as she read his final messages to them.“It went from honoring my stepfather to him honoring us,” Havron’s stepson Michael Dinwiddie said. “I realized then even more how dear Felice was to my stepfather. Her giving that speech was probably the most appropriate thing.”Apolinsky called it “one of the most important things I had ever done.""“What a gift for each person to know what they meant to him and what he loved most about them and what he wished for them.”:gildasclubmiddletn.org:e.givesmart.com:gildasclubmiddletn.org/ways-to-give/volunteer",3,Reliable,0.1628003721424774,0.5154317261685682,1897,3,Tennessean

They presented news and, for the most part, let people come to conclusions for themselves. Sure, the media leaned left, but they at least made an effort to appear neutral. These days, they make no such pretenses. When it comes to guns, they seemingly trip over themselves to shape a narrative that is decidedly anti-gun, including by asking non-expertswhat to do about gun violence in Chicago. Now, I’m not going to dip into what happened with the child in question because I haven’t followed that story. However, I will address the suggestion that the increase in firearm sales is somehow responsible for the increase in violence in Chicago. It ain’t. While Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is notorious for blaming Chicago’s violence problem on states like Indiana, the truth of the matter is that very few of those increased gun sales had anything to do with criminals trying to get guns. Those are law-abiding citizens buying firearms to protect themselves during particularly uncertain times. Since these folks also clearly are part of the “defund the police” crowd–it’s a topic of discussion later on where they try to justify it–they’re part of the reason gun sales remain high. No one wants to trust a defunded police department. You can say you want those funds reallocated so they’ll work better, but none of the programs being considered will yield instant results, meaning crime will likely increase as there will be fewer cops on the streets. In such a situation, do you really think people aren’t going to want guns?Criminals, on the other hand, get their guns off the black market. There’s been no evidence of an increase in black market sales, though. Why is that? Well, it’s likely because the criminals already had their guns. However, the folks Lisa Ling spoke with wouldn’t really know much about that. They’re activists, not experts. They found a narrative that works for them and CNN is giving them all the amplification it can. Yet there is a solution to crime in Chicago, though I don’t expect CNN to cover it. That answer is making it easier for people to defend themselves. In Illinois, House Republicans are trying to reform the FOID systemthat is plagued by delays these days. Four GOP state House lawmakers on Wednesday voiced complaints from their central and southern Illinois constituents who say they have waited months after applying for new or renewed gun ownership licenses without an update from the Illinois State Police amid an unprecedented volume of applications this year. Reps. Avery Bourne, R-Morrisonville, CD Davidsmeyer, R-Jacksonville, Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis and Mike Marron, R-Fithian, repeated their criticisms of the Firearm Ownership Identification card and concealed carry license systems during a virtual news conference. The group discussed reforms they have suggested in the past which have stalled in the General Assembly. In theory, the FOID is supposed to prevent criminals from buying guns. If it works as advertised, then reforms that speed up the process should be a net benefit to the citizens of Chicago. If it doesn’t work, then it’s time to scrap it. (Spoiler: It doesn’t work as advertised, as we can see from Chicago’s history.)Regardless, it’s past time for CNN to quit asking activists how to solve problems when they don’t have a clue what they hell they’re talking about.",1,Questionable,0.0755968778696051,0.4163161922252831,746,1,Bearing Arms

It's tradition for the president to brief Congress on their priorities. But this year, it all looked a little different,because COVID-19. But also because for the first time in history the two people framing the president (the veep and the House speaker) werewomen. Yesterday, after fist-bumping his way down to the podium, Biden got right to substance. Here's what he had to say about…as in the virus we all want to put behind us. Biden talked up getting more than220 million shotsinto arms in less than 100 days. He pointed out thatall Americans age 16 and upare eligible to get vaccinated. And thatmore than halfof US adults have gotten at least one shot. His message: ""go get vaccinated, America.""as in Biden made the case for his$2 trillionAmerican Jobs Plan. He said focusing on replacing lead pipes in schools and homes, strengthening the country's power grid, and building energy-efficient homes would create millions of jobs all while tackling climate change. He also wantsequal payand a$15/hour minimum wage.as in Biden has big plans for child care, family care, and health care. Case in point: his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. It includes a proposal foruniversal preschooland tuition-free community college. Biden's also pushing forpaid family and medical leave, an extension of the child tax credit, and investment in historically Black colleges.as in he hadwords for China, calling President Xi Jinping an ""autocrat"" and saying that wind turbine components should be made ""in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing."" He alsocalled out Russiafor election interference, and Iran and North Korea for their nuclear programs. But he doesn't want the US to continue with the ""forever war"" in Afghanistan.as in he thanked Congress for taking action to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from hate crimes. But he wants more. Like theEquality Actto protect LGBTQ+ Americans. And for Congress to pass the George Floyd police reform billby next month.as in Biden wants background checks, an assault weapons ban, an end toghost guns(like untraceable 3D-printed guns), and to getguns out of the hands of abusers. And he says it's time for ""Congress to act.""By raising taxes on thewealthiest Americans. Biden said it's time for corporations and America's 1% to pay ""their fair share."" And that he'd bump up thecapital gains rateon those making over $1 million. But claims he won't raise taxes on Americans making less than $400,000. While the Dems cheered, not everyone bought into Biden's vision. Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), the Senate's only Black Republican, delivered theGOP rebuttal. He said our nation is ""starving for more than empty platitudes."" And he criticized the Biden admin for public school closures and ""job-killing"" tax hikes. He also discussed his personal experience with racism – and blamed the admin for partisanship and division. Today marks 100 days since Biden took office. Last night, he laid out an ambitious agenda for the days ahead. But in order to get it done, he'll need support from a divided Congress. Whether it takes up the call remains to be seen. Here's where Biden standson his campaign promises after 100 days in office. This study. Yesterday, researchers revealed that air pollution in the US disproportionately affects Americans of color – regardless of where people live or how much they make. Researchers from five universities found that although the US has made strides to curb air pollution caused by cars, trucks, and construction, people of color have not benefited the same way as white Americans. And that Black Americans, in particular, are exposed to higher averages of polluted air particles (21% more) that account for between 85,000 and 200,000 deaths every year. For comparison, white Americans are exposed to 8% less than the average exposure. Pushing for change: Activists and scientists are calling on the Biden admin to take action to address the inequities because ""the deck is stacked against people of color."" Biden's proposed some changes in his infrastructure bill, but progressives say the plan doesn't go far enough. Michael Collins. Yesterday, the Apollo 11 astronaut died at age 90 after battling cancer. In 1969, Collins joined Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in NASA's first moon landing. But Collins never stepped foot on the lunar surface. Instead, he held down the fort (aka command module) and flew the spacecraft solo. He became known as the ""forgotten"" astronaut partly because he didn't get the press Armstrong and Aldrin did. After the historic trip, Collins went on to launch and oversee the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. NASA remembered him as a ""true pioneer."" And Aldrin, as the man who helped carry the team to ""new heights and to the future."" RIP. Rudy Giuliani. Yesterday, federal agents searched the home and office of former President Trump's personal lawyer. Since 2019, prosecutors have beeninvestigatingGiuliani's dealings – on behalf of Trump – in Ukraine.

The Delta variant may be twice as transmissible as the conventional strain. But California and the rest of the nation are far more protected against COVID-19 than ever before. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, and the U. S. has one of the highest per capita rates of inoculation in the world. And vaccines available in the U. S. are believed to be effective against the Delta variant, as they have been for all known variants. But that still leaves tens of millions of unvaccinated people still potentially vulnerable.“If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”Officials don’t expect another deadly COVID-19 surge on the order of those that wallopedthe nation three timesin the past 15 months. Rather, the risk is more that the Delta variant will take root in pockets of unimmunized communities that haven’t previously been infected with the coronavirus. This is the kind of future experts expect: one in which most of the population, who are vaccinated, are well protected against the world’s worst pandemic in the last century, while risks remain for those who aren’t vaccinated. Now, “nearly every death due to COVID-19 is particularly tragic,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “because nearly every death — especially among adults — due to COVID-19 is, at this point, entirely preventable.”California is particularly well placed to deal with the Delta variant, with 73% of the state’s adults having received at least one dose of vaccine — even better than the respectable national rate of 66% — and because many other Californians have survived COVID-19 from past surges.“We will never see the surges that were overwhelming our hospital system,” said Dr. Robert Kim-Farley, medical epidemiologist and infectious diseases expert at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. “There just is not enough people susceptible at this time to create those magnitudes of surge.”Nationwide, the average number of new coronavirus cases reported daily has fallen to about 11,000 — one of the lowest numbers since the beginning of the pandemic and a 96% decline from the peak of more than 252,000 cases a day reported in early January. At the peak, about 3,500 Americans were dying a day from COVID-19, and now, fewer than 300 Americans are dying a day. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U. S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said he didn’t think national daily death counts would approach anywhere near past peaks.“I don’t think ... that you’re going to see things like 1,000 deaths a day. I think that is a bit much. But there is a danger — a real danger — that if there is a persistence of a recalcitrance to getting vaccinated, that you could see localized surges,” Fauci said. “All of that is totally and completely avoidable by getting vaccinated.”Experts don’t expect a return to stay-at-home orders that shut down broad swaths of the economy due to the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, which was first identified in India.“No. Absolutely not. No, no, no, no,” said Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla. “We’re not going back. The really good, highly potent and safe vaccines have put us in a position that’s solid.”That optimism is particularly welcome in California, which just last weekfinally reopened its economyfollowing more than a year of coronavirus-motivated limitations and closures. During the height of last winter’s surge, about 550 Californians died daily from COVID-19. Now, California is reporting about 20 deaths a day from COVID-19. But just as important as how many new cases are being reported is what kinds of variants are being spread through these additional infections. The Delta variant is showing up worryingly often, setting off alarm bells at both the state and federal levels.“The Delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the U. S. to our attempt to eliminate COVID-19,” Fauci said. Nationwide, between May 9 and May 22, the Delta variantcomprisedless than 3% of genomically sequenced coronavirus samples. But between June 6 to June 19, that proportion rose to more than 20%. The United Kingdom, where officials were recentlyforced to postponea planned easing of COVID-19 restrictions due to an uptick in coronavirus cases, provides a cautionary example of the Delta variant’s extraordinary infectiousness. There were only a tiny handful of cases of the Delta variant in the U. K. in late March, but that grew to about 25% of cases by early May. By mid-June, 95% of cases were tied to the Delta variant. But the U. K.’srecent uptickin cases and hospitalizations is still very mild compared with its winter surge. Daily coronaviruscasesin the U. K. are down more than 80% from the winter peak, while the number of people in thehospitalwith COVID-19 is still down by about 97%. While the Delta variant is known to be considerably more infectious, experts differ on whether they think it causes more severe illness than other coronavirus strains. Fauci said this week that the variant is associated with increased disease severity as reflected by hospitalization risk. Topol agreed: “More young people are getting infection, right, and they’re winding up in the hospital. That’s not a good sign.” By contrast, with the conventional strains, young people — which Topol said refers to those under age of 40 — were rarely in the hospital. But, Topol added, there’s no evidence the Delta variant is more likely to cause death than other variants. The U. K. is still reporting fewer than 15 COVID-19 deaths a day since the beginning of May, down from about 1,300 deaths a day at the peak of the pandemic. Not everyone is convinced that the Delta variant is more likely to cause more severe disease. COVID-19 hospitalizations in the U. K. are actually growing more slowly than new cases — meaning the chance an infected person has of being hospitalized has been reduced, said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases expert at UC San Francisco. Another promising sign, Gandhi said, is that there doesn’t seem to be any increased risk to young children. Young children are already less likely to contract the coronavirus because they have far fewer proteins called ACE2 receptors in their noses that the coronavirus needs to access to infect the body. In California, the Delta variant has grown from comprising 1.8% of analyzed coronavirus samples in April to 4.8% of them in May. The Delta variant is now thefourth most-often identified variantin California. Still at the top is the Alpha variant, first identified in the U. K. (also known as B.1.1.7), which represents 58.6% of samples. Some counties report those data individually. Northern California’s most populous county,Santa Clara, for instance, has confirmed 58 cases of the Delta variant. And in Los Angeles County, officials say they identified 64 cases of the variant among residents from late April to early June, with most of those confirmed within the last few weeks. Delta “is the most infectious variant that has been identified to date here in California,” L. A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Tuesday. “And that means, for those people that aren’t vaccinated, it is going to pose a big risk.”Ferrer noted that much of the documented transmission in the county appears to be occurring in households, as 34 of the confirmed variant cases lived with one or more people tied to other cases. When the county next updates its sequencing findings, Ferrer said she is “positive that we will see a significant increase in specimens that are testing positive for the Delta variant because … it does in fact proliferate very quickly.”Vaccines that have been shown to be effective against the Delta variant include the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the two-dose AstraZeneca inoculation — which is not yet authorized for use in the U. S. but is in widespread use in the U. K. and similar to the one manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.“We have the tools. So let’s use them and crush the outbreak,” Fauci said. Among the vaccines available in the United States, both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna require two shots, administered several weeks apart. Johnson & Johnson entails a single dose. One recent study found that gettingboth dosesof the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant and 96% protective from hospitalization. Though 73% of adult Californians have at least one shot, only about 59% are fully vaccinated to this point,according to datafrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Walensky cautioned that the Delta variant “represents a set of mutations that could lead to future mutations that evade our vaccine,” adding “that’s why it’s more important than ever to get vaccinated now to stop the chain of infection, the chain of mutations.”Some experts are optimistic that this coronavirus will not mutate to a point where it overpowers our vaccines.“After these 18 months of evolution, we haven’t seen anything that has evaded our vaccine protection,” said Topol, who recently wrote about the subject for the journalNature Medicine. But, he added, “we have to be generous about getting vaccines everywhere — because that’s our best defense to prevent that from happening.”",3,Reliable,0.1467182912872568,0.4676107130417475,2254,3,LA Times

But with home prices hitting record highs, demand for single-family rental homes is soaring – and so are the rents. Single-family rents were up 5.3% year over year in April, rising from a 2.4% increase in April 2020, according to CoreLogic. That is the largest gain in nearly 15 years. Rents for single-family detached homes (not townhomes), were up an even stronger 7.9% compared with a year ago, as millennials in particular seek more outdoor space. Nearly half of millennials surveyed by Corelogic, and 64% of baby boomers, said they, ""strongly prefer"" to live in a single, stand-alone home.""Single-family rent growth showed a strong rebound in April 2021 with all price tiers back above their pre-pandemic rent growth rate,"" said Molly Boesel, principal economist at CoreLogic. ""While rent growth slowed last April at the start of the pandemic, the rate of rent growth this April was running above pre-pandemic levels even when compared with 2019 and shows no signs of diminishing.""The rent gains are across all price categories, even low end, which exceeded pre-pandemic rent increases for the first time. By category, the gains are as follows:·(75% or less than the regional median): 3.9%, up from 3.2% in April 2020·(75% to 100% of the regional median): 4.8%, up from 2.5% in April 2020·(100% to 125% of the regional median): 5.1%, up from 2.3% inApril 2020·(125% or more than the regional median): 6.1%, up from 2.2% in April 2020Regionally, by top 20 metropolitan markets, rent gains were highest in Phoenix, where single-family rents were 12.2% higher than a year ago. Next, Tucson, Arizona, with a gain of 10.6%. That was followed by Las Vegas at 9.3%. Atlanta, which had the lowest unemployment rate of the 20 metros, came in fourth at 9.1%. On the flip side, Boston saw an annual decline of 5.9% in rent prices and has experienced the largest decrease of the 20 metropolitan market rent prices for nine straight months. Chicago was the only other decliner, at 2.6%. With home prices continuing to gain at a double-digit pace, and more potential buyers being priced out, demand for single-family rentals is unlikely to cool anytime soon.""The inflation that is currently here is slowing the most interest rate sensitive part of the economy, that being housing,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Advisory Group.",3,Reliable,0.1572707595434868,0.4143217893217893,631,3,CNBC

FormerU. S. SurgeonGeneral Jerome Adams saidcoronavirusmask guidance may be ""premature"" or ""wrong"" in the face of potentially dangerous new variants. Adams served as surgeon general under former President Donald Trump, taking a prominent role throughout the early phase of the pandemic. He recently took to Twitter to voice his own regrets and concerns over mask mandates since then.""Last year Tony Fauci and I famously, prematurely, & wrongly advised against masks,"" Adams wrote in a rare admission of a misstep. ""I felt it was the best call at the time, but now regret it.""""I’m worried the CDC also made a similarly premature, misinterpreted, yet still harmful call on masking in the face of [rising] delta variant.""He urged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to instead advise people to get vaccinated and wear masks in areas with higher cases of COVID-19 until numbers start to decline. The CDCupdated its guidancein May to say that fully vaccinated individuals no longer need to wear masks indoors or outdoors, nor do they need to socially distance either. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky praised the guidance at the time as a major step toward normalcy. However, the delta variant has increasingly taken focus in recent weeks as it became the leading strain of COVID-19 in a number of countries. Walensky said in late June that nearly one in two samples sent for genomic sequencing now come back positive for the delta variant. The CDC said on July 6 that the delta variant islikely the dominant strainin the U. S.

The two days of testimony produced in the case brought by GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward produced no evidence of fraud or misconduct in how the vote was conducted in Maricopa County, said Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Randall Warner in his Friday ruling. Warner acknowledged that there were some human errors made when ballots that could not be read by machines due to marks or other problems were duplicated by hand. But he said that a random sample of those duplicated ballots showed an accuracy rate of 99.45%. Warner said there was no evidence that the error rate, even if extrapolated to all the 27,869 duplicated ballots, would change the fact that Biden beat President Trump. The judge also threw out charges that there were illegal votes based on claims that the signatures on the envelopes containing early ballots were not properly compared with those already on file. He pointed out that a forensic document examiner hired by Ward’s attorney reviewed 100 of those envelopes. And at best, Warner said, that examiner found six signatures to be “inconclusive,” meaning she could not testify that they were a match to the signature on file. But the judge said this witness found no signs of forgery. Finally, Warner said, there was no evidence that the vote count was erroneous. So he issued an order confirming the Arizona election, which Biden won with a 10,457-vote edge over Trump. Friday’s ruling, however, is not the last word. Ward, in anticipation of the case going against her, already had announced she plans to seek review by the Arizona Supreme Court. And a separate lawsuit is playing out in federal court, which includes some of the same claims made here along with allegations of fraud and conspiracy. That case, set for a hearing Tuesday, also seeks to void the results of the presidential contest. It includes allegations that the Dominion Software voting equipment used by Maricopa County is unreliable and was programmed to register more votes for Biden than he actually got. Along the same lines, Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers on Friday called for an independent audit of the software and equipment used by Maricopa County in the just-completed election.“There have been questions,” Fann said. But she told Capitol Media Services it is not their intent to use whatever is found to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election. In fact, she said nothing in the Republican legislative leaders’ request for the inquiry alleges there are any “irregularities” in the way the election was conducted.“At the very least, the confidence in our electoral system has been shaken because of a lot of claims and allegations,” Fann said. “So our No. 1 goal is to restore the confidence of our voters.”Bowers specifically rejected calls by the Trump legal team that the Legislature come into session to void the election results, which were formally certified on Monday.“The rule of law forbids us to do that,” he said. In fact, Bowers pointed out, it was the Republican-controlled Legislature that enacted a law three years ago specifically requiring the state’s electors “to cast their votes for the candidates who received the most votes in the official statewide canvass.”He said that was done because Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote nationwide in 2016 and some lawmakers feared that electors would refuse to cast the state’s 11 electoral votes for Trump, who won Arizona’s race that year.“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said in a prepared statement. “But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.”Photos of the 2020 General Election voting, election night and ballot processing in Pima County, Maricopa County and throughout Arizona.",3,Reliable,0.0656521739130434,0.3961594202898549,836,3,Arizona Daily Star

The agency, which is tasked with protecting current and former presidents alike, has paid $40,011.15 from January 20 to April 30 to stay around the clock at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. That amounts to around $396 per night — payments that are being financed by U. S. taxpayers. The move is considered unusual but not without precedent. President Joe Biden, who doesn’t currently charge the Secret Service rent, did so as vice president. But he did not charge the agency nearly as much as what Trump presently is billing them. From 2011 to 2017, Biden charged the Secret Service around $2,200 per month to stay at a cottage on his property in Delaware, or close to $75 per night. Historians who spoke with The Washington Post on the matter said that Trump’s extensive charging of the agency is without precedent and noted that as a former president he receives a lifetime pension and other benefits that could easily pay for their stays. Trump has so far received $65,000 from his pension alone in his first few months out of office. His status as a supposed billionaire means he could also afford to waive rental fees toward the Secret Service. “It’s tacky. Just because you can make a buck doesn’t mean you should make a buck,” Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, said to The Post. “And especially when you have a situation where you’re an ex-president. You’re not going to starve.” The payments from the agency to Trump’s properties also violate the spirit of a promise he made while in office. The former president said he would donate all of his presidential salary back to the federal government — and it appears, on the surface, that he followed through on that promise. But if he continues to charge the Secret Service so exorbitantly, the agency’s Mar-A-Lago fees alone could easily exceed his salary donation in a decade. Trump also profited greatly off of taxpayers during his presidency , taking more than 4,000 trips to his properties alone between the years of 2017 to 2019, making at least $1.6 billion from his businesses during his presidency, and charging the Secret Service to pay for their overnight stays during that time and beyond. From when he was inaugurated up to September 2020, Trump made at least $1.1 million from the Secret Service alone. Trump also charged the agency for days when neither he nor his family were even at their properties. As Trump and his family members made numerous visits to his resorts, it was necessary for the Secret Service to have a place to stay in order to be close by. But the former president would not cordon off a specific room for the agency when he went to stay, forcing agents to book a room full time at Mar-a-Lago even when no one that needed security detail was there just to ensure that they could get a room close to the president. Trump’s visits to his properties weren’t the only way he benefited from the presidency. Foreign diplomats also reserved rooms at his properties, many of whom were seeking to gain his favor on a number of issues, earning him income he likely wouldn’t have received had he not been president. Ethics experts have questioned if Trump continuing to have a financial stake in his companies’ assets during his presidency violated the Constitution’s emoluments clause against receiving gifts.",2,Generally Reliable,-0.0243518518518518,0.4476851851851852,759,1,Truthout

If that never occurred to you, you can consider yourself lucky and privileged. Even though feeding yourself and your family is is the least you can do to survive, for many Americans it is out of their reality to do what for some of us is just the basics for the maintenance of our lives. To say 2020 has been a hard year is not enough. 2020 has been the toughest year in decades for several families around the country. Even during easier times, millions of American families battle hunger on a daily basis, and right now, times couldn’t be farther from easy. That is what we’re going to talk about today. We about to disclose some very disturbing data which points out that over 50 million Americans will face starvation by the end of this year. Keep tuned and don’t forget to like and subscribe to our channel and to help spreading this very important message. From all the unsettling things we have seen so far in 2020, to witness a massive amount of families having to count their coins to find money to minimally feed themselves is one of the most tragic situations America has undergone over the past few decades. Many Americans were forced to change their lifestyle dramatically, cutting their food budgets due to a lack of income, while many others are now only having one or two meals a day, and demands at food banks around the country are spiking like never before. Yesterday, Bloomberg has published a report that could only be defined as one of the most devastating situations this country has ever faced. It reveals the struggles of a number of rural workers that expend the day inside plantations amongst an abundant amount of food that they can no longer pay for. Jessica Traxler is one fo these workers. Surrounded by food that she couldn’t afford, and “sitting in a faded-out Chevy sedan one July morning in southern Minnesota, she looked out at corn stalks, lush green, as far as the eye could see. A few miles to the east, a mill was pumping out flour. Just beyond it, a farm grew peppers, beans, and berries. To the north, there were dairies, one after the other. To the south, a huge pork plant. Grain elevators, poultry yards, cheese plants—all stood just a short drive away,” describes the article authored by Catarina Saraiva, Carolina Gonzalez, and Peyton Forte. If there is a place that portrays how atrocious America’s hunger problem has become during the sanitary outbreak, it is both sadly and ironically in the middle of the breadbasket that supplies food from coast to coast. It is being projected that the ranks of Americans fighting hunger are going to increase by 45% this year, meaning that over 50 million are likely to face starvation or at least severe food deprivation until the end of 2020. The story describes that “Traxler, her husband, and six children are among them. She had come to this spot, an empty school parking lot in the town of Mankato, to collect free boxes of food staples: milk and apples and carrots. Hundreds of Minnesotans waited in line ahead of her for hours.“It’s been hard,” she said. “We’ve had to dramatically change how we eat.”According to Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization, about one-third of those relying on food shelves, large-scale and emergency food distributions at this moment are in such situation for the first time in their lives, just as Traxler and her family, after losing her job due to shutdowns related to the health crisis. In some parts of Minnesota, that number can escalate up to 70%. Now, the roughest debate regarding deeply-rooted systemic inequalities is about one of the most basic divides: who will eat well and who will go hungry. Millions of families are already unassisted and don’t have enough to eat. Over 60 million jobs were lost and every day it goes by this number only rises. Even though you might think that your job is safe, and hopefully it is, millions of others also thought their jobs were safe right before they were let go. With that said, we want you to know that our aim is not at all to discourage you. As Michael Snyder describes what is on his latest book “Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America”: “there is hope in understanding what is happening, there is hope in getting prepared” and we say there is hope in trusting that there is still a way out of this mess. Stockpile your food, gather your supplies, join forces with your friends and neighbors. Keep informed, and most importantly, protect yourself. To be prepared is to be able to face the harsh reality and still keep your mind strong enough to face hardships resourcefully.”For more economic collapse news visit our website:-○Viewer comment:Minnesota Prepper DIY,“I’m sure it will be more like 100 million by the end of Winter.”I agree… – CP",0,Problematic,0.0674412698412698,0.552026455026455,1105,0,Before Its News

Evidently, through the use of the system, he can access the recordings from wherever he is deployed. One of the boys shares that he wishes his dad will come home, and waves as he steps off the porch saying, “Bye daddy, I’m going to school to learn a lot.”The other excitedly updates his dad about how he has learned to ride a bike without training wheels, shouting, “Alls I need for help is to push, and then I’m all going by myself!”Most heart wrenching, is perhaps the little girl, who leaves multiple messages wishing her dad would come back soon.“Dada, I love you so much.

Hurricanes, heat waves and winter storms have all stressed the power grid in recent years, resulting in millions of power outages and, according to the Department of Energy, costing the U. S. economy up to $70 billion a year. Meanwhile, flooding, wildfires, landslides and other disasters are taking a toll on the nation's highways, bridges and other infrastructure. The bill includes $110 billion of new funds for repairing and rebuilding roads and bridges and other major projects, with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity and safety. The funding would include $40 billion alone for bridge repair, replacement and rehabilitation. The White House projects the initiatives set forth in the bill would add an average of about 2 million jobs per year over the next decade, according to the Associated Press. It's considered a cornerstone of President Joe Biden's administration. The bill would be funded with $210 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief aid and $53 billion in unemployment insurance aid that remains unused by states that halted the program. The rest of the funds would come from several other smaller pots of money. Critics have expressed concerns over the bill's size, scope and financing. The Congressional Budget Office said it would add $256 billion to deficits in the next 10 years, the AP reported. The Senate approved the bill in August in what was considered a rare bipartisan move, after months of political wrangling. The House vote was on hold after more objections and delays to try and ensure enough votes to pass. Here's a look at some of the other major climate-related provisions, according to thebill textand White Housefact sheet:-$105 billion for modernizing and expanding transit and rail infrastructure, including replacing thousands of buses with zero-emissions vehicles.-$17 billion for port infrastructure and $25 billion for airports. The money would be earmarked for repair and maintenance backlogs, reducing congestion and lowering emissions.-$11.6 billion to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers for construction projects related to flood control, dredging and other infrastructure. Funding would also be provided for flood control and coastal emergencies.-$7.5 billion to build a national network of charging stations for electric vehicles.-$3.5 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for flood mitigation actions and assistance.-$3.5 billion to the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program, which aims to reduce energy costs for low-income households by improving energy efficiency at home.-$2.6 billion to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation's lead scientific and regulatory agency on climate and weather. The funds would include $492 million for coastal and inland flood and inundation mapping and forecasting along with ""next-generation water modeling activities;"" $50 million for wildfire prediction, detection and observation; and $80 million for supercomputing infrastructure used for weather and climate model development to improve forecasting and detection of droughts, floods and wildfires.-$216 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, more than half of which would be designated for ""community relocation."" There are 567 federally recognized tribes in the U. S. representing more than 5 million people, and many live on lands taking the brunt of climate changeimpacts, according to data from the federal government's U. S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. In Alaska, for example, rising temperatures are melting sea ice and glaciers and thawing permafrost. In the western part of the contiguous U. S., tribal populations face drought and water challenges. These changes in climate affect homes, communities, schools, water supplies and food supplies. Some communities are already moving to higher ground.",3,Reliable,0.0641414141414141,0.3181660353535353,1052,3,The Weather Channel

That’s 160 million people.“Let’s celebrate ourindependenceas a nation and ourindependencefrom this virus,”Bidensaid from the White House on Tuesday afternoon. He said new pop-up clinics – including mobile clinics – will be deployed to help meet the new benchmark. Pharmacies will also expand walk-in appointments. Additional resources will be devoted to rural areas, where inoculations have lagged. NEW: Pres.

He said federal officials will ship vaccines directly to pediatricians. “The administration is “challenging” states to administer at least one shot to as many teens as possible by July 4, so they can be fully vaccinated by the time school starts in the fall,”reports USA Today. More than 40% of US adults – some 105 million – are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data, and 147 million Americans have received at least one dose. The New York Timesprovides more details on Biden’s remarks:In an afternoon address, the president pledged more funding for outreach campaigns designed to convince those reluctant to get shots of the need to protect their own health and that of others. Despite a flood of vaccine available, providers are administering about 2.29 million doses per day on average, about a 32 percent decrease from the peak of 3.38 million reported on April 13, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Senior health officials have decided thatherd immunity — the point at which the virus dies out for lack of hosts to transmit it — will likely remain elusive.

But that was then. This is now. The press and the Biden campaign itself insisted last year these incidents raise legitimate, and even troubling, questions about a president’s overall fitness for office. So, we’re going to have to speculate now about Biden’s health, right?No, really — remember that particularly insipid episode, the one where newsrooms and Democratic operatives theorized that former President Donald Trump’s penchant for descending ramps and staircases slowly, deliberately, and sometimes with assistance was indicative of something far more serious?“Trump’s Walk Down Ramp at West Point Raises Health Questions,” read the headline to a June 14, 2020,New York Timesreport authored by Maggie Haberman. CNN did entire segments featuring on-air headlines such as “Trump’s mystery hand clutch.”“Why the Donald Trump-West Point story actually matters,” read the headline to a CNN “analysis.”TheWashington Posteven fact-checked Trump’s claim that a ramp he descended following an address at a West Point graduation ceremony had been “very slippery.” This defense, the newspaper declared, is “inconsistent with the weather, which on Saturday in West Point, N. Y., was sunny and clear-skied. The grass plain on which the commencement took place was dry.”Speaking of questionable defenses, the White House said Friday that Biden tripped three times in a row because “it’s pretty windy outside,” as White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. “It’s very windy. I almost fell coming up the steps myself.”Uh huh. The Washington Posthas not yet fact-checked this claim. As for Trump, then-Democratic presidential candidateJoe Bidenhimself said during the election, “Look at how he steps, and look at how I step. Watch how I run up ramps and he stumbles down ramps. Come on.”Biden for President even releaseda two-minute television adin Oct. 2020 contrasting the supposed spry and quick-footed Democratic candidate with the supposed puttering Republican incumbent.“Some people are always in a hurry,” the ad says over a montage of Biden walking, jogging, and even riding a bike. The ad continues, interspersed with footage of Trump walking slowly down ramps and staircases, “When Joe Biden is president, America is just going to have to keep up.”Surely, the same people who speculated about Trump’s health will ask similar questions and make similar insinuations about Biden following the Air Force One incident. Surely, these same people will likewise attempt to draw trend lines connecting Biden’s stumbling with his frequent verbal missteps, his forgetfulness, and the fact that his foot was in an orthopedic boot recently.

488,Sponsor says bill banning abortion method lacks vote to advance in Nebraska Legislature,4.0,47.0,https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/sponsor-says-bill-banning-abortion-method-lacks-vote-to-advance-in-nebraska-legislature/article_b229bca3-bbeb-520e-abb4-95146ce02fc2.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,22,"LINCOLN — A controversial abortion bill got its day in the legislative spotlight Wednesday, but its future appears murky. State Sen. Suzanne Geist of Lincoln, who introduced Legislative Bill 814, acknowledged she doesn’t currently have enough votes to cut off a filibuster. She said she will be working to get them in the nine remaining days of the session. Debate on the bill ended after three hours under a practice instituted by Speaker of the Legislature Jim Scheer of Norfolk. He will schedule the measure for continued debate if Geist shows that she can muster the necessary 33 votes for a cloture motion. LB 814 seeks to ban a common second-trimester abortion method known medically as dilation and evacuation. The procedure involves dilating a woman’s cervix and removing the fetus in pieces. Opponents call the procedure dismemberment abortion. The bill was named the top priority of the session by abortion opponents. Tempers flared last week before lawmakers voted 30-8 to pull LB 814 out of the Judiciary Committee, where it had been stalled. Wednesday’s discussion took a more measured tone, as senators debated about life, death, freedom, constitutional law, health care and stages of fetal development. Supporters of the bill said the majority of Nebraskans would support the proposed ban, which seeks to do away with an abortion method they called “horrific to talk about,” “barbaric” and “inhumane.”“I think it’s a fitting time to ask ourselves what’s the value of life,” Geist said. But she also said the measure would not limit access to second-trimester abortions in Nebraska, saying that they could be accomplished in other ways. Nebraska statistics show that most second-trimester abortions in the state are done using other methods, in contrast to national numbers showing the dilation and evacuation method is used in 95% of abortions at that stage. Other abortion foes cited those statistics in arguing that the proposed ban would pass constitutional muster. Sen. Andrew LaGrone of Gretna said the courts would treat a Nebraska ban differently from those challenged in other states. The courts have blocked such bans in all but two of the dozen states that have passed them. The two states where bans have taken effect have no abortion providers that perform second-trimester abortions. Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who led opposition to the bill, predicted that LB 814 would be overturned as well if it were passed and that the state could end up paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. She and other advocates of abortion rights argued that decisions about whether and how to do an abortion should be left to doctors and women, guided by their families and their faith.“We aren’t truly free unless we can make decisions about our own lives, our own bodies,” Hunt said. Some senators took a third position, saying they supported the goal of LB 814 but not the specifics of the measure. Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue questioned why the bill would ban the use of forceps to remove pieces of a fetus but allow the use of suction. She also questioned why it would give a husband the right to sue a doctor who violated the ban but would not give the same right to an unmarried father. The abortion procedure banned by LB 814 is used from Week 13 through Week 24 of a woman’s pregnancy. The ban would apply when clamps, forceps or similar instruments are used to remove pieces of a viable fetus. The ban would not apply if suction is used to remove pieces of a fetus. It also would not apply if the fetus was dead before being removed. Under the bill it would be a Class IV felony, punishable by up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine, for a doctor to perform such an abortion. The bill also would allow a doctor to be sued for performing the procedure. The woman having such an abortion could not be charged. Nebraska has 49 state senators in the Legislature.

489,The Unlikely Rebound of Mainline Protestantism,-1.67,44.0,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-unlikely-rebound-of-mainline-protestantism,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Since we’re at a delicate moment in our democracy—featuring a Presidential candidate who lost the Electoral Collegeby just 42,918 votesand responded by urging his followers toattack the Capitol—we should be grateful for signs of certain kinds of moderation returning to our national life. A new Gallup poll reports that, as vaccinations spread and unemployment drops, more Americans say that they are “thriving” than at any time in the past dozen years, which surely means that at least some of the anger in the country might wane. And, last Thursday, the Public Religion Research Institutereportedsome interesting numbers about faith in America, which may indicate something similar. Most of the news coverage of the P. R. R. I. study has focussed on the fact that it shows a dramatic drop in the number of white Americans who identify as evangelical Christians, from twenty-three per cent of the population in 2006 to fourteen per cent in 2020. There has also been a slight drop in the number of “nones”—the religiously unaffiliated—from twenty-six per cent in 2018 to twenty-three per cent in 2020. But what I found most unexpected was the reported uptick in the number of white mainline Protestants. According to the study, they represent 16.4 per cent of the population (up from thirteen per cent in 2016), which means that they now outnumber white evangelicals, some of whom may have defected to the traditional denominations. Though the methodology is a little unclear—this “2020 Census of American Religion” categorizes all self-identifying white Christians who said that they weren’t evangelical or born again as “white mainline Protestants”—the news seems as profound as it is unexpected. For several decades, a prevailingnarrativeof white American Christian life has been about the decline of Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Lutherans, and other once-dominant Protestant sects. In this telling, the “mainline” became the “sideline,” as congregations fled the moral relativism of out-of-touch pastors, who replaced God’s word with liberal politics. Having been baptized a Presbyterian, grown up as a Congregationalist, and spent my adult life as a Methodist, I watched this decline close up. Churches closed, congregations aged, and the image of Christianity in the popular mind came to be one of sexism, libertarian capitalism, and a pervasive individualism—the idea of God as, above all, a “personal savior.”The fade of that brand of evangelicalism in America—the P. R. R. I. report shows that its cultural hegemony isincreasingly confinedto the Southeast—is not a great shock. As early as 2007, researchers were picking up strong signals that young peopleweren’t as inclinedto follow those churches on key cultural issues: eighty per cent of even young churchgoersreported, critically, that their strongest perception was that Christianity was “anti-homosexual”—not an illogical conclusion given the amount of time that evangelicals spent on the issue (oddly, since the Gospels never mention it). Eventually, most white evangelical congregants tied themselves toDonald Trump—in 2016, eighty-one per cent of white evangelical voters chose him and, according to aP. R. R. I. poll from 2018, he had a seventy-two-per-cent approval rating among them—despite the fact that he showed not the slightest sign of Christian understanding or behavior. As a result, at least in part, someprominentevangelicals started to leave their churches. (And, certainly, someevangelicals never supported Trumpism.) New recruits are not flooding in to replace those who have left: white evangelicals, according to the P. R. R. I. report, are now the oldest of religious Americans, with an average age of fifty-six. The reported rise in the number of mainline Protestants, though, is surprising. Diana Butler Bass, an unflagging chronicler of American Protestantism who, having gone in her personal life from the mainline to the evangelical and back again, was ahead of her time,points outthat, for decades, the media paid no attention to these declining (and demure) denominations, concentrating instead on the provocative Falwells, Swaggarts, and Robertsons. “If one was born after 1980, it was hard to know that mainline Protestantism even existed,” she writes. The new numbers, of course, don’t mark anything like a return to the previous status quo, when mainline Protestantism ruled American spiritual life. Take 1958 as a high-water mark: that year, as Dwight Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the Interchurch Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the religion researchers Mark Silk and James Hudnut-Beumler report that fifty-two per cent of Americans, many of whom were moving to the new suburbs, were affiliated with one of the mainline denominations that are members of the National Council of the Churches of Christ, which was headquartered in that building. (It is sometimes called the Protestant Kremlin—or the God Box.) Without this “firm foundation, national morality could not be maintained,” the President intoned. (Ike himself, raised in the Mennonite tradition, was baptized a Presbyterian less than two weeks after taking office.)But the very broadness of the church’s reach was its weakness: attendance was, as many pointed out, often more a cultural expectation than an active commitment. As the nineteen-sixties and seventies wore on, and the liberal denominations started making significant commitments around racial justice and peace, many of their adherents did fall away. For others, though, the churches didn’t go far enough, with many wavering for decades about the idea, for example, that gay congregants should be full participants in church life. Being in the middle seemed a recipe for irrelevance. Yet perhaps the Trump years have taught us a little bit about the virtues of a kind of modest center—even now, according to the P. R. R. I survey, thirty-five per cent of white mainline Protestants identify as Democrats, thirty-three per cent as Republicans, and thirty per cent as independents. (TheBidenyears may prove instructive, too, as the Catholic bishops—who have made common cause with right-wing evangelicals for years—threaten todeny the President communion.) In any event, these mainline churches are not the same as those of the suburban heyday of the sixties. Like surviving local independent bookstores responding to modern readers, they have had to becomemore responsiveto the emotional needs of spiritual seekers, channelling the desire for connection into the arts and a wide array of service projects. Butler Bass writes a newsletter, in which, after the P. R. R. I. poll came out, shedescribedhow a declining Episcopalian church in Santa Barbara, California, that she once attended managed to rebound: “They married gay members before marriage equality was legal in California. They went to protest marches. They innovated liturgy. They read liberal theology books, studied feminist and liberation theology, embraced contemporary biblical criticism. They followed no plan—except for believing that Christianity was an adventure and that Christian community could be transformative, challenging, and deeply spiritual in and for the world.” Today, when activists fight pipelines or police brutality, they often lean on support from the clergy of such places of worship, who tend to skewmore liberalthan their congregants in the pews. Butler Bass and other church progressives may now compete with evangelical megachurch pastors as unofficial spokespeople for their faith, complicating the public image of what white Protestants in America believe and how they act. “A really important moment is here,” she wrote last week. “The story of an old religious tradition hasn’t ended the way critics once thought. Paraphrasing the words of the old Monty Python sketch, ‘We’re not dead yet.’ We’ve just been awaiting resurrection.”",3,Reliable,0.0613255411255411,0.3475994227994228,1717,3,The New Yorker

But while it may seem counterintuitive, the cost of living has actually gone down in some parts of the world, according to areportreleased Tuesday by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The study found ""currency weakness has followed the pandemic as it spread across the world,"" contributing to decreases in the cost of living in cities throughout the Americas, Africa and Eastern Europe. Western European cities, on the other hand, became costlier. Zurich, Paris and Hong Kong tied for the most expensive city, according to the report, a twice-annual survey of 138 goods and services in around 130 cities. In March 2020, when the last report came out, Singapore, Hong Kong and Osaka, Japan, tied for the No. 1 spot. Some of the biggest factors influencing cost of living changes since the COVID-19 pandemic began include government actions, a fall in disposable income, changes in lifestyle, local currency exchange rate movement and supply chain problems, according to the report. Zurich's and Paris' increases are attributed to the rising euro and Swiss franc. Singapore, which had been at No. 1 since 2014, dropped lower on the list after a wave of foreign workers leaving the city during the pandemic set deflation in motion. Osaka saw similar trends. Several U. S. cities became less expensive as a result of the weakening of the U. S. dollar during the COVID-19 pandemic. New York, the city that makes up the base rate for the report, dropped to seventh place from fourth. Los Angeles also saw a decline, falling to ninth place from eighth. Two cities in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, also saw dramatic decreases from the last report. Both cities fell from a tie at No. 96 to a tie at No. 119 – reflecting the country's weakened currency and rising poverty levels apparent throughout Latin America, according to the report. Tehran, Iran, saw the greatest leap in rankings this year, moving up 27 places from No. 106 to No. 79. The authors of the report say the jump is tied directly to U. S. sanctions, which have stopped some imports from reaching the country.

""Violaremeans 'to bear in on with force' and in the classical period it came to mean 'injure, dishonor, outrage, violate.'"" We use ""violent"" to describe weather events and animal predation, Nagler says, but these are metaphorical meanings, for ""only humans can, properly speaking, be violent.""The boundaries of violence have also been scrutinized since antiquity. Christian peace traditions have long examined violence to understand what is and isn't pleasing to God. The African theologian Tertulliandeemedimprisonment, torture, execution, warfare, and any ""occupation of the sword"" impermissibly violent. Early Quaker leaderstestifiedthey had ""wronged no man's person or possessions,"" and thus ""used no force nor violence against any man.""All this is to say the question of how to define violence isn't new. It has been asked for centuries and, frankly, answered well. We know violence when we see it. We know, as those Quakers did, that it includes forcibly harming peopletheir possessions. There's nothing in the definition that limits the physical harm in question to human bodies, and destroying possessions can destroy lives, as anyone who lost their home, food, or livelihood in theTulsa race massacreor agenocidal famineor underscorched-earth policycould tell you. This runs contrary to the belief of growing number on the left, who, in the words of' Nathan J. Robinson, argue the ""word 'violence' should be reserved for harm done to people,"" because to do otherwise would imply equivalence between people and property. But this redefinition is absurd. Of course, violence against a thing is not the same as violence against a human. But then, neither is punching someone the moral equivalent of beheading them. Violence has degrees. To admit this is not conflation. We also know ""violence"" has never meant exclusively verbal attacks. Language can be intended to inflict harm. It can even incite or command or encourage violence. But language is not itself violence, nor is silence violence (as a crowd of demonstratorsinsisted in a viral videofrom Washington on Monday), no matter how nicely it rhymes. Silence in some circumstances may excuse or endorse or permit violence, and it doesn't diminish the gravity of such abuses to say silence is not violence itself. This distinction is the one truth of the otherwise lying nursery proverb: Sticks and stones may break your bones, and words will also hurt you — but they won't hurt you with physical force, and that means, however otherwise evil, they'renot violence. This should not trouble us. Applying the label of ""violence"" is hardly the only way to condemn intentional harm. We have lots of other words for this! But evidently it does trouble us. Or least it troubles that portion of the American leftwhich has decidedwe ought to adjust the definition of violence to newly exclude property damage and include harmful silence or speech. That's not to say the right always uses the word violence appropriately. President Trump has misused it by accusingRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) of ""violence"" for her policy views on Israel and Palestine. More commonly, as Pence demonstrated, the word is misused by omissionin referenceto law enforcement wings of the state: Pro-death penalty conservatives tend not to speak of executions as violence, though certainly they are. Euphemisms of ""officer-involved shootings"" or police ""discharging theirweapons and striking someone"" avoid acknowledgement of state violence, too. Violence is a constant this summer, so how we speak about is particularly urgent right now. Refusing to recognize violence does nothing to stop it. We can't pretend it away, whatever its source. The mushrooming violence in Kenosha is what people mean when they say ""violence begets violence"": not that one act of violence deserves or justifies another, but that they often follow and attract each other, spreading organically, like rot, infestation, contagion. Denying or downplaying any of these violent deeds can only make that reproduction more difficult to halt.",2,Generally Reliable,0.024409772326439,0.420541392763615,1429,2,The Week
492,The Women Fighting for Prison Abolition Believe a Better World Is Possible,-12.67,42.33,https://www.glamour.com/story/the-women-fighting-for-prison-abolition-believe-a-better-world-is-possible,https://adfontesmedia.com/glamour-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-07,18,"Back in June, Marilynn Winn got the word: Atlanta’s 2021 budget had just come out, and it included an $18 million allocation for the city jail. The news felt like a betrayal. In 2019, in response to a years-long campaign byactivists, Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms signed legislation toclose the municipal detention centerand turn it into a facility to help low-income citizens. So why were politicians still funding it handsomely?Winn launched her troops. The director ofWomen on the Rise, an Atlanta-based organization composed mostly of formerly incarcerated women, Winn has a database of 400 members, plus close connections with another 50 organizations. Despite the driving rain that day, hundreds of people responded to her alert and turned up to protest. They won that battle. The allocation was reduced to $3.5 million—just enough to cover the needs of the handful of detainees still there—and the mayor reiterated her intent to shutter the jail completely.“We want to see it demolished,” says Winn of the facility. And the $14.5 million that’s no longer in the budget? “We’re fighting for the money to be earmarked for community services.”Winn and her allies are one stream in a social movement spreading across the country that’s only started to receive mainstream attention: the prison abolition movement. “Defund the police” became a rallying cry during the protests following George Floyd’s killing in May, but the movement’s ambitions are far broader. Its aim is to dismantle the criminal justice system, abolish its police forces and prisons, and replace it with a comprehensive investment in community services and a localized system of conflict resolution that prioritizes relationships and healing. The slogan may be new, but the campaign has been building for over two decades. Its advocates are all over—an army of true believers that includes academics, lawyers, grassroots activists, and the leaders of influential groups likeCritical Resistance,Common Justice, andSoutherners on New Ground. In large part, the whole thing is driven by women. Ask for suggestions of prominent abolitionists to follow, read, and learn from, and you’ll get name after name of passionate, ambitious women leading the charge. Most are women of color; many are queer or gender nonconforming. Criminal justice, by contrast, has long been the purview of men. Ninety-seven percentof police chiefs,88%of police officers, at leasttwo thirdsof corrections officers, and the vast majority of prison wardens are men. In elected office, too, the gender gap is still enormous, meaning that men have not just carried out the policies that punish and incarcerate but crafted them too. We know how that’s worked out. Over the last four decades, the system has become increasingly punitive and heavy-handed, particularly toward people of color. In 1980, 500,000 people wereincarcerated; by 2016, even as rates of violent crime have fallen, that number had swelled to more than 2 million. Today, Black young adults areseven timesmore likely to be arrested than their white counterparts. The United States is responsible for20%of the world’s incarcerated people, and60%of them are people of color. Five out of sixpeople released from prison are rearrested within nine years, and those who remain free struggle to find jobs and often even to vote. The human cost is incalculable. The literal price tag for this catastrophe is growing too. In the era of mass incarceration, funding dedicated to public safety and criminal justice has steadily risen. In 1982, justice-system expenditures—that is, spending on police, corrections, and judicial services—was $86 billion, adjusted for inflation; by 2012, it hadgrownto $265 billion. Those expenditures don’t fund social services or grassroots interventions, which are for the most part not considered scalable solutions, so virtually all of those funds have been used to build new prisons and jails, and hire more police, corrections, and probation officers. In the rush to throw money at the problem, few have stopped to ask: What do survivors of crimes or those hurt in the process?“I came to this from working in domestic violence and sexual assault [prevention and advocacy],” says Mariame Kaba, a longtime educator and activist and a leading abolitionist. “I recognized that what folks were asking for wasn’t what we were doing. The system wasn’t working; people weren’t getting what they needed.”What sets abolitionists apart from others who want to improve the system is that they’re emphatically not reformers. Their plan is not to increase spending or community policing efforts, upgrade technology, or add rehabilitative programs. A system this inherently violent, racist, and ineffective can only be scrapped, they say. “It’s a vision that’s about creating a different kind of world—different communities, different relationships, different organizations,” says Beth Richie, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and one of the early thinkers around prison abolition. Abolitionists would like to see some of the billions spent on incarceration and policing invested at the front end: in education, mental health services, health care, housing, economic development—programs that, in low-income communities, have been underaddressed for decades. In both Atlanta and St. Louis, for example, per capitafundingfor public safety in today’s dollars doubled between 1980 and 2017, while social services budgets declined by more than half. Meanwhile, drug possession, sales, and abuse would be decriminalized, removing what was the topsourceof arrests over the past decade. With housing, jobs, and quality education available to those who need them, far fewer crimes would occur, abolitionists say. And many of those that do could be addressed by community services. Even today the police spend only about4%of their time addressing violent crimes like homicide, robbery, or rape. Domestic violence, immigration, homelessness: All of those issues that currently result in police calls could likely be more effectively addressed by community programs and trained counselors who don’t employ violence. And when a serious crime does occur—armed robbery, say—abolitionists explain that community councils and local antiviolence groups could be empowered to identify, apprehend, and bring the perpetrator to a restorative justice process. In those practices, together with community members and family from both sides, a crime survivor explains what they need to make things right, then holds the guilty party accountable for meeting those expectations. In the case of armed robbery, the person who’s responsible might have to spend a year participating in a violence-reduction program, while also doing community service as a form of restitution. Abolitionists admit that the entire framework isn’t fully baked—and won’t be, until it’s given a real chance. “Since community-based and grassroots antiviolence programs have so little funding due to our overreliance on law enforcement, we literally won't know our full potential until defund happens, because we're either forced to collaborate with law enforcement, or all the funding is going to law enforcement,” says Ejeris Dixon, a consultant and editor of the recent book. It’s an utterly radical vision: more holistic, pragmatic, people-centered. Perhaps it sounds like just the kind of “softer,” gentler approach that women would pursue. But it’s not quite that simple. Many abolitionists view gender on a continuum and are reluctant to label their approach as particularly “feminine.” If anything, the overrepresentation of women in the movement stems from a shared belief in collectivism—a focus on the community over the individual.“Most of the people who are organizers are women, in all movements,” explains Kaba. Indeed, women have been a driving force in manyprotests around the worldover the past decade. Organizing, as civil rights leader Ella Baker put it, is “spade work”: the foundational effort that prepares the ground for something new. It’s composed of all the small, nonheroic actions that are required for people to become involved in social change: developing relationships, circulating fliers, holding meetings, following up. In Atlanta, for example, Marilynn Winn and her partners—all women, by the way—put in years building connections, broadening their alliance, researching approaches, and chipping away at legislation that landed people in jail in the first place. It’s been painstaking, underrecognized work—“and that’s typically gendered labor,” says Dan Berger, a professor at the University of Washington who researches the history of prisons and social movements. He and Kaba point out that a large cohort of the original abolitionists were women, as were members of the antilynching movement, early prison reformers, and civil rights activists. They just weren’t as publicly prominent. “There are these grand moments of giving speeches or going to the barricades, where historically men have been very visible, but those have been rarer than the day-in, day-out work of organizing,” explains Berger. But the prison abolition movement is also borne of something more explicit in women’s—and especially Black women’s—experiences. The movement’s modern roots date to the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore founded Critical Resistance, and when INCITE!, a nonprofit, held a hugely popular conference on violence against women of color. Those leaders were looking for a way to protect themselves, because the government wasn’t doing it. After all, women who’ve experienced sexual assault or domestic violence have little reason to report the crime. Conviction numbers arepainfully low. Trials are grueling. And acall to the police in a domestic violence situationcan lead to the automatic arrest of a woman’s partner—whether she wants that or not—and sometimes her arrest as well, potentially destabilizing her entire family. Black women in particular have been failed by the criminal justice system. Asking the police for help in cases of assault have often resulted in their own harassment or arrest. Take, for example,Tondalao Hall, who served 15 years in prison in Oklahoma for failing to report that her boyfriend was abusing her children (he served two years for his crime). Or the case ofMarissa Alexander, who fired a single warning shot at her husband, who she said had abused her, and was detained for five years. At the same time, Black women have watched their brothers, fathers, sons, and whole communities fall prey to the criminal justice system and have wound up picking up the pieces. They’re often the ones struggling to support their families, cover bail and attorney costs, and visit incarcerated loved ones. “Women have been so deeply affected by mass incarceration,” says Amanda Alexander, the founding executive director of the Detroit Justice Center. “Locking people up—that only created more damage, brought more trauma on top of trauma, and didn’t address root causes. Especially as Black women, it seemed ludicrous that we’d ever be able to look to the police for safety, or to the courts as a place of protection or safety or justice. We’ve been forced to think beyond these systems.”That’s true, too, for queer, trans, and gender-nonconforming people. “We’re already outside of so many traditional networks,” says Dixon, the consultant, who identifies as nonbinary. “We build safety [for ourselves] because there’s no one else to do it but us. There are so many innovative community safety strategies coming out of those communities.”There is no road map for abolition, because it’s never been done before. But advocates have notched important victories, establishing a framework that can be replicated in other cities and states. Reductions in police budgets, for example, is one top priority; police force funding has been cut inSan Francisco,Chicago,Seattle, andBaltimore. Los Angelesvoters recently elected to use 10% of the city’s unrestricted funds for alternatives to incarceration, and inColorado, $4 million in corrections funding has been reallocated to community development programs in two regions. Last year New York lawmakers voted to close the Rikers Island jail complex, though Mayor Bill De Blasio has pledged to build four smaller facilities to replace it—something activists are now fighting. This summer, St. Louis aldermen elected to shutter the Workhouse, a medium-security detention center with notoriously dangerous conditions. And San Francisco mayor London Breed recently announced that County Jail #4, located at the top floor of the city’s Hall of Justice and targeted by advocates for closure, will cease operations this fall. While most abolitionists see themselves as operating outside the system, those working on the inside admit that the activists have given them space to propose changes too.“If you don’t have people advocating for something really idealistic, you don’t make enough room for ‘reasonable people’ to come from behind and fill in. That way the ball keeps moving forward,” says Heidi Mueller, director of the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice. In July she announced a plan to close the state’s five large juvenile facilities, where 125 young people are currently detained, and utilize community-based centers instead. Juvenile justice has been a key area of attention, resulting in what Mueller describes as a “tidal wave” of change in the field across the country.“I do think that women are coming into these roles and trying to approach them with more humanity and love and connectedness; that is part of the change we’re seeing,” says Mueller. “And I fully lean into that.”But undoing deeply ingrained practices will be a long haul. Winn in Atlanta knows this. Despite years of policy battles to reduce the number of people detained in jail, despite their triumph when the mayor finally pledged to close the detention center, she and her allies still aren’t done. Until the mayor and city council make good on their promise, they have to remain vigilant. Some advocates are suggesting the municipal government repurpose the building, but she and her partners want to see it completely demolished.“If it sits there, we’re afraid that they’ll want to keep it,” she says.",3,Reliable,0.0761202148636703,0.4711112622107386,3080,2,Glamour
493,Has Biden Abandoned Student-Loan Forgiveness?,-14.33,38.0,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-student-loan-forgiveness.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-08-20,25,"The cost of college in America is too damn high. For decades, that has been the consensus among debt-laden university graduates andpolicy experts alike. The United States spends more per student on higher education than any developed country save Luxembourg. And in the judgment of theOECD, America’s exorbitant tuition rates have “virtually no relationship to the value that students could possibly get in exchange.”As a result of this policy failure, U. S. college attendees and graduates collectively hold over $1.7 trillion in student debt — andstudent-loan forgivenesshas becomea defining cause of the American left. Shortly before his inauguration, Joe Biden called on Congress to forgive $10,000 of every borrower’s student debt, but the president did not include any loan forgiveness in his COVID-relief plan. And the$6 trillion budget Biden released in Maydoesn’t feature any student-debt forgiveness either. That doesn’t mean all hope for student-loan forgiveness is dead, however. Here’s a rundown of where the fight for debt relief stands now. During his campaign, Biden called for:• Forgiving $10,000 in federal student-loan debt for every borrower.• Forgiving all of the undergraduate student debt accrued by borrowers who attended public colleges or minority-serving nonprofit colleges.• Expanding the existing Public Service Loan Forgiveness program by canceling $10,000 a year in student debt for every year a borrower works in a public-sector or nonprofit job, for up to five years. Meanwhile, to address the underlying college-affordability crisis, Biden proposed making public colleges tuition-free for students from households earning less than $125,000 a year and increasing Pell Grants. Other Democrats have proposed a more sweeping debt jubilee: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren have called on Biden to forgive $50,000 in federal student-loan debt for every borrower through executive action — which is to say, without congressional approval. Biden has rejected this proposal on both substantive and procedural grounds. The presidentsaid in February, “I don’t think I have the authority to [cancel student debt] by signing the pen.” He has separately maintained that $50,000 is too high a sum, especially given the relatively high incomes of Americans who graduate from high-tuition colleges. So Biden has shot down progressives’ highest hopes for debt forgiveness, but he still officially wants Congress to forgive a ton of student debt. Yet he has declined to include any form of student-loan forgiveness in his budget request to Congress. There are many possible reasons for this decision. One is that the Democratic Party’s thin congressional majorities have a limited tolerance for new federal spending; some Democrats are squeamish abouttax increases, while others are uncomfortable with increasing the deficit. This political constraint makes it impossible for Biden to enact every policy he promoted on the campaign trail. In fact, it’s not clear that the president will have the votes to enacthis top governing priorities, which include investments in climate, infrastructure, elder care, child care, universal prekindergarten, child allowances, paid leave, and tuition-free community college. By all appearances, student-debt relief ranks fairly low on the president’s list of desired policies. He spoke little about the issue during his campaign, and he has gone out of his way to advertise his opposition to canceling more than $10,000 per borrower in a bid to reassert his “moderate” credentials (which his relatively ambitious spending planshave called into question). In a recent interview with the New York, Biden said he doesn’t consider himself a “progressive” because “the idea that you go to Penn and you’re paying a total of 70,000 bucks a year and the public should pay for that? I don’t agree.” The choice to triangulate on this issue isn’t entirely unreasonable. Democratsneedto increase their support among non-college-educated voters, and some polls suggest that Americans who’ve never attended college view student-loan forgiveness less favorably than those who have: In February,a Harris-Yahoo Financepoll found Americans with a high-school education or less opposed student-debt forgiveness by a margin of 65 to 35. This said,other surveyshave found that non-college graduates (a group that includes Americans who attended some college but did not graduate) back forgiveness by a slightly larger margin than college grads. In any case, there does appear to be strong majority support forat least someamount of federal student-loan forgiveness. If Biden had put student-debt relief in his budget request, it (probably) wouldn’t have made much substantive difference. Moderate Democrats in the Senate have already demonstrated that they’reperfectly comfortable rejecting the president’s requests. And as of this writing, there aren’t 50 votes in the Senate for forgiving $10,000 per borrower. Generally speaking, presidential budgets are largely public-relations documents since Congress has the ultimate authority over spending. The White House apparently concluded that capping the size of its budget request at $6 trillion was more important than pleasing debt-forgiveness advocates from a political perspective. But there is another complementary explanation for the White House’s decision: Although Biden has expressed skepticism about his authority to cancel student debt without congressional approval, the White House asked Education secretary Miguel Cardona toprepare a memoexamining the legality of such a move. The Departments of Justice and Education are still working on that review. And higher-education expertMark Kantrowitzbelieves Biden iswaiting for that memo’s verdictbefore seeking congressional support. The notion that the president can spend more than $1 trillion on wiping out Americans’ student debt — by himself, with the stroke of a pen — may sound far-fetched. But there is a coherent legal theory behind the idea. The Higher Education Act of 1965empoweredthe Department of Education to “compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption.” And thanks to a reform passed under Barack Obama in 2010, the federal government now owns roughly 92 percent of all student debt. Which is to say, more than $1.5 trillion of Americans’ student debt is owed to the Department of Education — which has the explicit authority to waive “any claim” it possesses and can therefore unilaterally make all that debt disappear. This theory makes sense to me. But it needs to make sense to federal judges in order to work, and thanks to the Trump presidency,the federal judiciary is quite conservative. “Using an executive order to forgive federal student loans will likely be met with a lawsuit and preliminary injunction and eventually fail,” Kantrowitztold NBCin November. So for mass student-debt forgiveness to happen through executive action, three things would need to occur: (1) The Department of Education’s review would need to find that Biden has the authority to cancel student debt, (2) Biden would have to decide to use that authority, and (3) the judiciary would need to uphold his right to that authority. All three of these developments seem unlikely. As I have mentioned, Biden evinces little enthusiasm for the student-debt issue and has generally gone out of his way to steer clear of controversy. Exploiting an obscure federal statute to deliver $430 billion in aid to the minority of Americans who hold student debt — in defiance of Congress and on the basis of a coherent but contested legal theory — just doesn’t seem like Uncle Joe’s game. What’s more, in late July, House Speaker Nancy Pelosisaidshe does not believe that Biden has the power to cancel student debt through executive authority. While the president has shown little enthusiasm for blanket student-debt forgiveness, his administration is trying to mitigate borrowers’ burdens through regulatory action and legislative proposals. On his first day in office, Biden extended the moratorium on student-loan repayment through the end of September (the administration does not expect to extend that deadline further, however, so borrowers will once again be on the hook for payments come October). Meanwhile, Biden’s COVID-relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, included a provision that makes income derived from forgiven student loans untaxable through the end of 2025, which is to say, if you have your student loans forgiven before 2026, you will never owe taxes on that income. That clears a potential hurdle to mass forgiveness, although the provision did not come at Biden’s request, and its ultimate significance remains unclear. The administration’s most significant actions on student debt will likely come through regulatory rewrites of existing debt-forgiveness programs. The White House has already taken steps to eliminate red tape and make it easier for borrowers to qualify for forgiveness. But its full package of regulatory reforms will take time to implement, as they must be enacted through an arduous process of hearings and deliberation. Among the changes the administration is pursuing are:In recent decades, entrepreneurs in the for-profit college space made a disruptive discovery: You don’t need to develop a quality educational institution to get rich off federal student-loan dollars. You can just invest heavily in advertising that tricks prospective students into attendingyour garbage pseudo-college. Alas, the Obama administration stifled this innovation by imposing accountability standards on federal student loans; institutions that failed to guide a reasonable percentage of their students into gainful employment upon graduation would no longer be eligible for federal dollars. Further, Obama made students who had already attended a shoddy for-profit school eligible for debt forgiveness. During his time in office, 99.2 percent of borrowers who applied for such forgiveness received it. But the Trump administrationloosened the Obama-era rules, and Betsy DeVos’s Department of Education denied forgiveness to 99.4 percent of eligible borrowers. The Biden administration is working to restore Obama’s accountability standards. In March, itcanceled $1 billion in student debtfor roughly 72,000 defrauded borrowers. If you take on student debt and then develop a medical condition that prevents you from securing the gainful employment your education was supposed to provide, you can apply for debt forgiveness under the Total and Permanent Disability Discharges program. But failure to provide proper documentation of one’s poverty can cost eligible borrowers their due relief. Meanwhile, many disabled borrowers are not aware of the program, or else, so infirm as to be unable to put together an application. Biden addressed the first of these three problems earlier this year, when he temporarily exempted borrowers from certain documentary burdens in their applications. In March, the Department of Educationcanceled $1.3 billionof student debt for 41,000 disabled borrowers who had applied for relief. Advocates for disabled borrowers had insisted that the DOE had both the legal authority and bureaucratic resources to forgive the student debt of eligible borrowers even if they did not submit applications: Any borrower receiving disability benefits through Social Security would meet the program’s eligibility requirements. Thus, the government could use the information it already had to identify eligible borrowers and forgive their loans. On August 19, the Biden administration did precisely this, unilaterallywiping out $5.8 billion in debtfor over 300,000 disabled borrowers. The PSLF is supposed to encourage highly educated Americans to work for the public instead of for private corporations, even though the latter tend to offer higher pay. If you make your monthly student-loan payments for ten years while working for the government or a qualifying nonprofit, the rest of your loan balance is supposed to be forgiven. But the program’s rules are so elaborate and confusing thatbarely one percentof borrowers who applied for PSLF have received it. The Biden administration aims to rewrite those rules to make it easier for applicants to secure relief. The president has also proposed expediting borrowers’ eligibility for forgiveness under the program: Under his plan, borrowers would have half their loan balance forgiven after five years in public service. Finally, Biden’s American Families Plan — one of his top legislative priorities — would modestly increase college affordability by upping Pell Grants, making community college tuition-free, and boosting aid to schools that serve minorities. In sum, blanket loan forgiveness remains possible. But in all likelihood, the Biden presidency will yield only small-bore reforms that deliver relief to specific kinds of borrowers, while most will carry on bearing the burdens of America’s inefficient, scam-ridden system of higher education.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0407835963319834,0.4428740632127728,2711,3,New York Magazine
494,"If We Are to be Hated, Let It Be for the Right Reason",8.67,32.0,https://stream.org/if-we-are-to-be-hated-let-it-be-for-the-right-reason/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,24,"ByMichael BrownPublished onJanuary 18, 2021•On numerous occasions, Jesus promised us, His followers, that we would be hated. That is something we should expect and even embrace. Let’s just be sure we are hated for the right reasons. Being hated for the wrong reasons is not something to be embraced, let alone celebrated. Jesus said, “You will be hated by everyone because of Me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved” (Matthew 10:22). But note those words “because of Me.” We will be widely hated because of our association with Him, because of our preaching in His name and because of our adhering to His values. For this, we will be reviled, rejected, persecuted and even killed. Such has been the case throughout Church history, and such is the case worldwide to this moment, as every single day, Christians aremurderedsimply because of their faith. Great is their future reward. Jesus also said, “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated Me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed My teaching, they will obey yours also” (John 15:18-20). To the extent that we live by a different spirit than the fallen, rebellious world lives by, to that extent, we will be cast out. To the extent we emulate the character of Jesus, to that extent the world will treat us the way it treated Him. That’s why Jesus said, “Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you” (Matthew 5:10-12). The prophets were stoned more than applauded, hated more than celebrated, persecuted more than praised. Jesus said it would be the same for us — because of Him and because of righteousness. That is part of our lot in life: to be treated just as He was treated. (To refresh your memory, He was crucified.)When we are rejected because of Him, we consider it an honor. As Acts records, after the apostles were flogged for by the Sanhedrin for preaching in Jesus’ name, they “left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name” (Acts 5:41). What an honor and what a joy. The religious leadership was treating them the same way it treated Yeshua. And so the apostles rejoiced because they were whipped in His name, thereby recognized as part of His family, as leaders in His movement. That’s why they rejoiced. As for the injunction they were given by the Sanhedrin to no longer preach in that name, this was their response: “Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah” (Acts 5:42). With full respect for the governing authorities, they were going to obey God rather than man. They would preach more, not less. We should follow their lead when the government tries to silence us. But there is more that the Scriptures have to say about suffering persecution and opposition. Peter wrote, “If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name” (1 Peter 4:14-16). There is nothing honorable about being hated because of our self-righteousness (rather than for the sake of righteousness). There is nothing positive about us being reviled and even persecuted because of our hypocrisy and sin. There is nothing praiseworthy about being rejected because we are obnoxious or nasty or mean-spirited or violent. To repeat the words of Peter, “If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler” — or, as some translators put it, a “troublemaker” or a “busybody.”Yet some of us think we are suffering persecution for the Gospel whereas we are really experiencing the consequences of having big, opinionated, unfiltered and unrestrained mouths. We think we are being treated like Jesus when, in reality, we are being treated like jerks. So, by all means, let’s stand strong and tall, unashamed of the gospel of Jesus and unashamed of the principles of righteousness, which include standing for the unborn, for the family, for justice, for the poor. But let us not confuse suffering for Christ with suffering for our carnality. The former is our honor. The latter is our shame",1,Questionable,-0.0349550449550449,0.5364257964257964,1183,1,The Stream
495,Nearly 900 CTA workers have had COVID-19; 18 of them drove the busy No. 79 or No. 49 bus routes,-7.33,46.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/12/11/22166210/cta-covid-coronavirus-bus-drivers-routes-rail-operators-amalgamated-transit-union-local-241-covid19,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,25,"Two of the CTA’s busiest bus routes — the No. 79 that runs along 79th Street and the No. 49 on Western Avenue — have recorded the most coronavirus cases among bus drivers, with nine drivers on each run falling ill over a six-month span, records show. Three other routes — the No. 4, No. 8 and No. 22 — each saw eight CTA drivers infected with COVID-19 over the same period. Four more routes — the No. 3, No. 20, No. 29 and No. 72 — had seven drivers each diagnosed with the virus. Lea este artículo en español enLa Voz Chicago,la sección bilingüe del Sun-Times. Together, those nine routes carried more than 65,000 riders on the average weekday in September. Thirty-three CTA L operators reported catching the coronavirus during the same six-month period. Eleven worked the Red Line before reporting their illness and 11 the Blue Line. Both rail lines operate 24 hours a day. CTA employees were among those deemed essential to stay on the job as the pandemic exploded. Between mid-March and mid-September, 470 of them reported testing positive, records obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times show — about 4% of the government agency’s workforce of nearly 11,000 people. Since September, 400 more CTA employees have been diagnosed, according to Catherine Hosinski, a spokeswoman for the mass transit agency, though their job assignments weren’t released. Eight CTA employees have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, records show. The No. 49 bus, which operates on Western Avenue. Nine CTA bus operators who were infected with the coronavirus reported that was the last route they worked. It’s among the CTA’s busiest bus routes. The CTA hasn’t been conductingcontact tracing,so it’s impossible to say whether employees got the virus on the job or could have passed it along. But spokesman Brian Steele says the CTA requires employees to report “if they test positive for COVID-19 and to also identify coworkers who were close contacts.” He says the CTA tells those employees “to remain at home for 14 days from the date of last contact” and advises those with possible symptoms to stay home and check with their doctor. There are no reports “that we’re aware of” of passengers who think they might have become infected from a CTA bus driver or L operator, Hosinski says. Records the agency released indicate the last route a bus driver was on before reporting having tested positive. But it’s possible those drivers had been working other runs before then. Some operators bounce between routes. And some who got sick had been off-duty for a while when they tested positive.“We are not aware of any hot spots or notable outliers among the work locations,” Hosinski says. The Blue Line was the last place 11 CTA L operators worked before reporting they tested positive for the coronavirus between mid-March and mid-September. The Red Line had the same number. Records show:The Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents most CTA employees, wants “hazard pay” for the agency’s workers. But the CTA says its union contracts “do not provide premium pay for working during a public health crisis.”The union also says the CTA hasn’t done enough to protect employees or notify co-workers of those infected. Keith Hill, president of ATU Local 241, which represents bus employees, says, “There’s not enough service out there to accommodate the passenger load.”Hill also says bus drivers are put in a tough spot to enforce a ridership cap and mask rule — which many riders ignore.“We have people boarding every day coughing and spitting on the bus, and there’s nothing we can do,” he says. According to the CTA: “All bus operators sit behind a plexiglass shield and have little direct interaction with customers in the few seconds it takes to board and pay their fares. That said, every effort has been and continues to be made to minimize the potential hazards that may still occur during these limited interactions. Among the measures we’ve implemented to better protect our frontline workers has been the distribution of PPE to all employees (including masks, hand sanitizer, gloves, face shields, disinfectant cleaners, etc.), increased cleaning of facilities and vehicles, enforcing social distancing requirements in the workplace and making adjustments to our day-to-day operations, such as vehicle capacity limits.”Citing studies, Hosinski says, “There’s limited evidence to say that transit is a spreader of coronavirus” in a significant way. On 40-foot buses, pandemic rules generally allow 15 riders, Hosinski says. On 60-footers, it’s 22. CTA buses and trains have operated for the most part on normal schedules during the pandemic, but ridership has plummeted. In September, the number of bus passengers was down 60% over 2019. The CTA projects revenue will fall nearly $400 million in 2020.",3,Reliable,0.0676002536889633,0.4167388167388165,1095,3,Chicago Sun-Times

497,"As Construction Continues Amidst Covid-19 in DC Area, Bezos’ WaPo Raises Few Objections",-16.5,30.5,https://fair.org/home/as-construction-continues-amidst-covid-19-in-dc-area-bezos-wapo-raises-few-objections/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-25,25,"“Insane.” That’s what Marc Gunther thought as he looked out of the window of his downtown Bethesda, Maryland, apartment. Below him, cramped construction crews were building a headquarters and adjoining hotel for Marriott, the world’s biggest hotel chain. The $600 million project, which has received $60 million in public funding, is scheduled to be completed in 2022, pandemic or not. Recently, two of the site’s approximately 300 workerstested positive for coronavirus. After shutting down the site for deep cleaning and implementing enhanced safety measures, work was scheduled toresume this week. Gunther called the resumption of work “nuts” in aMediumpost (4/3/20), headlined “Luxury Condos and Corporate Office Buildings Are Not Worth Dying For.”The day before his post, Gunther had a short letter to the editor published in the Washington Post(4/2/20), the dominant news outlet for the “DMV”—DC, Maryland and Virginia. Gunther’s letter appears to be the only mention in thePostof the dangerous situation at the Marriott site. And it’s not just Marriott getting a pass. Despite thePost’s unique ability to bring about DMV-wide change, the paper has mostly kept quiet about the region’s dangerous construction sites, thereby inviting human tragedy. In a rarePoststory (3/28/20) on the dangers posed by today’s construction sites, officials were given ample space to repeatedly claim all is well: “We can continue to operate safely,” said a spokesperson for general contractors, “and we should.”Workers, meanwhile, are less concerned with “the dangers of contracting coronavirus on the job” than simply having a job, said a union official. Besides, there have been no reports of coronavirus on any city project site, DC officials said, effectively claiming the pandemic miraculously leapfrogged over these potential hotspots.“I work on a construction job site with 150 to 200 others in an environment that is impossible to protect from the coronavirus,” wrote Mike Pitzer, a project manager in the DMV who is risking his job by refusing to work amid the pandemic. In aPostop-ed (4/17/20), Pitzer raised safety concerns thePosthas yet to condemn with its powerful editorial page, or even report on:Most of the workers on our job site are employed by contractors, whose crews include carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, electricians, etc., and their helpers. Some of these subcontractor workers will have commuted in vans with seven or eight others. If the DMV doesn’t follow the lead of other states and ban nonessential construction, the pressure to work will continue to run down the chain of command. If subcontractors don’t work, Pitzer explained:Not only would they lose the revenue, but they also would probably damage important relationships with the bigger contractors who hired them. They also could be at risk for monetary penalties if they don’t complete work by the schedule agreed upon in the contract. And their workers risk being fired if they don’t show up. AnotherPoststory (4/12/20) warns about the “catastrophic” impact the pandemic is likely to have in Langley Park, Maryland, a densely populated, largely Latino community outside DC, where many are undocumented and therefore ineligible for federal stimulus checks or unemployment benefits. While thePostbemoans the harm the pandemic will inflict on Langley Park, the paper is loath to call out those who are exacerbating the situation, such as developers, who are placing profits ahead of the community’s health. ThePoststory profiles Marcos, a 55-year-old who returns from his construction site each day knowingthe risk of bringing the novel coronavirus home with him: home to his daughter with disabilities and a feeding tube in her stomach; home to a 7-year-old son with asthma; home to a wife without legal status and a household where the adults lack health insurance in a neighborhood packed with other vulnerable families. Marcos and his family all sleep together in their living room so they can earn extra money renting out their only bedroom, an arrangement that makes limiting the virus’s spread among family members difficult. Despite “stay at home” orders being in effect throughout the DMV, where the virus death toll has nowtopped 1,000, construction continues, thanks to its being deemed “essential.”“When restaurants, coffee shops, retailers, gyms, barbershops and movie theaters have been shuttered,” Gunther asked in hisMediumpost, “what makes construction so special?”When asked about the “essential” designation for construction, local officialspoint to federal guidelinesthat allow for it, or just as often sayno comment. Not that a comment is needed. The writing is on the walls of the high-end buildings sprouting up.“Our ‘essential’ work,” wrote Pitzer, the project manager, “is constructing a new apartment building—not a bridge, not a road, not a hospital, but new, non-subsidized apartments.” Gentrification is the DMV’s growth industry, and not even a pandemic can mess with profit margins and project timetables. And the DMV’s most high-profile timetable belongs toAmazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post. In northern Virginia, just outside DC, construction ofAmazon’s massivesecond headquarters, HQ2,remains on scheduledespite the pandemic. Alsoon scheduleis construction of a new $390 million concourse at Reagan National airport, located just1,800 feetfrom HQ2’s Crystal City outpost. That’s as the crow flies, although in a few years it’ll be walkable, thanks to a$40 million pedestrian bridgethat, once built, will connect Crystal City and HQ2 directly to the airport. The pedestrian bridge is part of$762 millionin public subsidies Virginia is givingAmazon, a trillion-dollar company, for locating HQ2 in the state. (Amazonmay have ended up in northern Virginia regardless of subsidies, in order to be near the Pentagon and gain a leg up on a $10 billion military contract.)Elsewhere in northern Virginia, the construction of vast data centers is being fast-tracked, withAmazon Web Services(AWS) “lead[ing] the way, as it often does,”Washington Business Journal(4/17/20) reported. “There may be as many as a dozenAWSdata centers under construction now or in the near future in Loudoun alone.”Meanwhile, in DC, “A global pandemic and economic crisis is not slowing down” progress on a 323-unit building anchored by anAmazon-owned Whole Foods store (Bisnow,4/15/20). And in Maryland,Amazonis continuing its rapid growth, as it expands into another “massive new warehouse” (Washington Business Journal,4/17/20). In not calling for the shuttering of DMV construction, thePostis aligning itself with the interests of its owner, the richest person alive (whose wealthincreased by $6.8 billionin just the past week). Across the Potomac River, in Maryland, construction also continues. The state’s governor, RepublicanLarry Hogan, is not only pro-development, but is himself a real estate developer—a fact thePostnow tries to hide.“The governor offeredAmazon, our owner’s company,$8.5 billionto locate HQ2 in his state.”Hogan “wasa suburban real estate developer before becoming governor,” thePost(3/19/20) recently reported (emphasis added). That’s like saying President Trumpwasin the hotel business—a statement thePostwould never make, and rightfully so. Like Trump, Hogan has a company that is named after himself, not held in a blind trust, managed by a family member; also like Trump, he’s continuing to make deals while he’s in office, and potentially benefiting from his official actions (Washington Monthly,1/20). When Hogan designatesreal estateandconstruction(like the Marriott headquarters) essential, is this a conflict of interest? ThePostwon’t ask, even as Hogan rakes in a small fortune from his company, around $2.4 million in just his first three years in office. While Hogan may have personal financial reasons for designating construction “essential,” the health consequences of doing so may be catastrophic. If thePosthighlighted this danger, it would pressure the pro-development governor to shut down construction sites. This appears to be what happened in New York. In stories on the danger of construction sites in the Big Apple, several news sites—unlike the Washington Post—prioritized the views of workers over officials. The difference was dramatic. Workers say “social distancing is a social myth,” read a New YorkDaily Newsstory (3/26/20) that included photos of workers “in dangerously close proximity.” The story quoted hardhats onTwitter: “Put a stop to this now,” said one worker.“Just riding the elevator to where you need to work is like an affront to the whole idea of social distancing,” another worker toldThe City(3/23/20). Like many industry whistleblowers, he remained anonymous, fearing possible retaliation from his employer.“I’m essential to the pocketbooks of rich contractors and essential for spreading the virus, but that’s about it,” electrician Kirk Gibbs told the New York Times(3/25/20). “They should really shut down these projects for two months…. I’d just hate to see more people die and get sick.”“Construction sites, even during normal times, are notoriously dirty,” theTimesreported. Workers often share a single portable toilet, which rarely has soap or hand sanitizer. Running water is not common…. They share tools, and procedures require that they closely watch over one another. In the wake of reports like these, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reversed himself and banned nonessential construction. If similar reporting is found in the Washington Post, the DMV could follow New York’s lead and save lives.",1,Questionable,0.0063032646365979,0.4486556653223317,2270,2,FAIR

Tammy Baldwin, Rep. Gwen Moore, Gov. Tony Evers, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley. The letter was addressed to Matthew Krueger, U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Kruegertold the Journal Sentineland other news outlets last week that federal agents coming to Milwaukee in several weeks will focus on violent crime, illegal gun cases and slowing the city's rising homicide rate, insisting their arrival was not a response to protests or civil unrest. The group wrote that they appreciate his statements, but added that they still want more answers about the plan.""The recent conduct of federal agents in Portland, Oregon, has caused great concern in Milwaukee and Wisconsin about the purpose and scope of any expanded federal law enforcement mission in our city and state,"" the letter reads. ""We want to make it very clear that we do not support anything similar to what we have seen in Portland, Oregon, here in Wisconsin.""The influx of federal officers will coincide with Milwaukee hosting a scaled-back, mostly virtual Democratic National Convention and ongoing protests against police brutality and racism. The effort is part of the U. S. Department of Justice's Operation Legend, which recently brought more than 200 federal officers into Kansas City after a 4-year-old boy was shot and killed. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had suggested such federal intervention was on its way in a weekend TV interview, prompting Evers to send a letter opposing such intervention citing recent reports from Portland, Oregon, where federal officers in unmarked vehicles have grabbed protesters off the street without any record of their detention. In Tuesday's letter, some of Wisconsin's most powerful Democrats also asked for a number of specific details, including:""While we were disappointed in the manner in which this program was announced by Attorney General Barr and the White House, we appreciate you speaking to several of us in recent days,"" they wrote. ""We look forward to your prompt response to these questions and working with you to ensure the people of Wisconsin understand the purpose and scope of this operation.""Members of the Milwaukee Common Council have also raised concerns about the plan. District Attorney John Chisholm told council members at a meeting Monday that the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office willprosecute federal agents who violate the law.""Kidnapping, false imprisonment, unlawful assault — those are simply crimes,"" Chisholm said. ""Those are crimes no matter who commits them, whether it's a federal agent or a citizen.

Perhaps they should havegotten out of their bubbles more!This, by the way, was meant as an introduction to a Tucker Carlson segment from last night in which he laid out some of those fears for the future. Surprise — it was pretty racist. If America becomes a place in which you have to violate your own conscience in order to hold a job, you're not allowed to protect your family from mob violence, where your children can't afford to get married and raise your grandchildren because employers don't like their skin color, then what's the point of all of it?It always comes down to ""And then there will be no more white babies, ever again,"" doesn't it. But how about this? What if these people are ""scared"" because they are watching Fox News and the people on Fox News are telling them that they need to be scared. That if Democrats are in power, white people won't be allowed to have jobs and that the streets will be teeming with murderous mobs. What if they are confused because they're watching Ainsley Earhardt and she's up there, as a voice of authority, telling them — incorrectly — that the election was stolen from them and that there is tons of evidence to prove that this is true. Here's the question that a lot of people are asking: If there is a question about the votes and if they think that it was rigged, and many people do believe that, then we need investigations, and we need to know that our votes count, that our — votes were legal, and we need to find out where the problems are so we can make sure this doesn't happen in the future because if these Democrats, if they win Georgia, people fear that from here on out, there are going to be mail-in votes, which we don't trust now because the president doesn't trust it and we all have heard these stories of people getting four ballots and two of them were dead people. And so you have to have trust and integrity in the system; it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat, we should all want that. And with so many people questioning what's happening, an investigation — many of these Republicans just want it investigated. None of that happened. None of it. It was all Fox, OAN, Newsmax and Trump lies.

Similarly, if you tell people it is their right to overthrow the government, if you scare them about the secret liberal communist plans to genocide all of the white people, if you tell them that the election was stolen from them? Some people are going to do some bad shit. What is it that's supposed to happen here?

Y., last October. A recent study found the number of children contracting the coronavirus is on the rise. A student wears a face mask while at the Post Road Elementary School in White Plains, N. Y., last October. A recent study found the number of children contracting the coronavirus is on the rise. As coronavirus cases climb worryingly across the United States, a recent study shows that the number of children contracting the virus ""steadily increased"" in July. In the last week alone,according to the report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, nearly 72,000 cases were reported in children, roughly 19% of the total number of new cases nationwide. And while hospitalizations and deaths remain low, the number of child coronavirus infections increased by 3% over the last two weeks of the month after declining earlier in the summer. Since the pandemic began a year and a half ago, approximately 4.2 million children have tested positive for the coronavirus. The good news is that severe illness and death are still uncommon for children who contract the virus. In states reporting, children accounted for fewer than one-quarter of 1% of all COVID-19 deaths. Seven states reported no child deaths, while other states reported 0-0.03% of all child coronavirus cases resulting in death. As of July 29, a total of 358 children have reportedly been killed by COVID-19 in the U. S.""However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,"" the report reads. That said, the report acknowledged that the figures could be inaccurate for a handful of reasons. The ages designated as a ""child"" vary from state to state, ranging from newborns to 20, and some states altered their definition of a child during the pandemic. Further complicating things, the most up-to-date numbers include testing figures from only 11 states, according to the report. Only 23 states and New York City reported hospitalizations and 43 states — along with New York City, Puerto Rico and Guam — reported mortality rates. Florida stopped reporting child hospitalizations in late June and Iowa stopped updating child testing data shortly after. And in Nebraska, the COVID-19 dashboard has been unavailable since the end of June. Parts of the country are considering reimplementing protective measures as cases climb. With the start of the school year just around the corner, the same organization that conducted the report is recommending that students over the age of 2 and all staff — vaccinated or not — mask up. Some states though, including Arkansas,Florida, South Carolina and Texas, have implementedlaws prohibiting mask mandates in schools. With cases running rampant across his state, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is caught in a bind. The governor is still not in favor of a statewide mandate, but he wants thelaw banning state and local mask mandates overturnedto give schools the opportunity to implement mask mandates.""In hindsight, I wish that it had not become law,"" Hutchinson said at a news conference Tuesday. ""But it is the law, and the only chance we have is either to amend it or for the courts to say that it has an unconstitutional foundation.""To date, the coronavirus has claimed the lives of more than 612,000 people.

502,Democrats Push Further Into GOP Territory With Fundraising Surge,-8.67,45.0,https://about.bgov.com/news/democrats-push-further-into-gop-territory-with-fundraising-surge/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-16,17,"Democrats across the competitive House landscape turned in yet another strong fundraising quarter, bolstering the party’s bid to expand its hold on the chamber. In 44 of the 58 districts the Cook Political Report rates as competitive, Democratic nominees raised more than their Republican opponents from July through September, according to a Bloomberg Government analysis of Federal Election Commission reports filed by Thursday’s deadline. That includes historically GOP-leaning districts in southside Virginia, southern Minnesota, Long Island, N. Y., and Alaska, along with the suburbs of Phoenix, Indianapolis, Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta. Rather than hunker down to protect the most vulnerable seats picked up in the 2018 wave, Democrats are seeking to parlay their fundraising advantage and Joe Biden’s lead in the presidential election into a larger and more durable majority.“Right after the November elections in 2018, the word was that Chairwoman Bustos had the toughest job in town,” said Michael Fraioli, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, referring toCheri Bustos(Ill.), head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “That’s all turned around now. Not only are we not going to lose seats as Democrats, but we’re going to pick up some and the question is how many and where.”Of the 58 districts rated competitively, 30 are held by Republicans, 27 by Democrats, and one by a Libertarian. Republicans need a net gain of 17 seats for a majority. The Cook Political Report says a Democratic gain of up to 10 seats is the most likely outcome. Most Republican incumbents in competitive, suburban districts were outraised by their Democratic challengers. Democrats made major gains in suburban districts in 2018, thanks to a combination of voters’ frustration with President Donald Trump and, relatedly, college-educated voters moving away from the Republican Party. It paved the way to a 40-seat net gain.“Were fighting very hard,” said Sarah Chamberlain, president of Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports several suburban Republicans. “We’re hoping to not see a wave in the suburbs, but the more people I talk to — it’s close.”Unlikely opportunities for Democrats to make gains include Virginia’s 5th District, a conservative-leaning area that runs from the North Carolina border to exurbs of Washington, D. C. Cameron Webb (D), a doctor and first-time candidate, raised more than $2.7 million in the quarter compared with $723,000 for Bob Good (R), who ousted Rep. Denver Riggleman(R) at a district convention in June. In Arizona’s 6th District, a well-educated and Republican-friendly area enveloping parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale, physician Hiral Tipirneni (D) raised more than three times what Rep. David Schweikert(R) brought in and ended September with nearly triple what the incumbent had in cash on hand. Schweikert has been hobbled by ethics violations, and the House voted in July to reprimand him. Republicans and Democrats attributed Democrats’ strong fundraising to the party’s online tool, ActBlue, which directs small, online donations to candidates that need it the most. The GOP’s online fundraising system, WinRed, hasn’t been around nearly as long and isn’t as established among donors.“One of the fundraising advantages Democrats have — and it’s one of the few we have — is we’ve really lapped the Republicans on candidate online fundraising,” said John Rowley, a Democratic consultant. “It’s an area where Republicans haven’t caught up.”“It all goes back to ActBlue,” Chamberlain said. Rob Simms, a former executive director at the National Republican Congressional Committee, cautioned that while the numbers are impressive, it’s not necessarily a show of electoral strength.“One thing that often gets lost looking at these numbers is the overwhelming majority of Democrats’ money is coming from outside the district and outside of the state,” Simms said. “You have this energy on the Democratic side fueling the fundraising, but a lot of it is coming from New York, L. A., and San Francisco.”There were some bright spots in third-quarter fundraising for Republicans, who are targeting the more than two dozen Democratic-held districts Trump carried in 2016. Iowa state Rep. Ashley Hinson (R) reported more in third-quarter receipts and cash on hand than freshman Rep. Abby Finkenauer(D) in a district Trump narrowly won. Iowa’s 1st District, which includes Cedar Rapids and Dubuque, is one of only 11 Democratic districts rated as a Toss-up. South Carolina state Rep. Nancy Mace (R) topped freshman Rep. Joe Cunningham(D) in both categories in a coastal district Trump won decisively, though the Cook Political Report still gives Cunningham the advantage. The jaw-dropping amounts from Democrats in swing districts has allowed the DCCC — the party’s House campaign arm, which itself announced topping $70 million in third-quarter receipts — to invest in offensive opportunities, including nine districts where Trump won by 10 or more points. That includes suburban areas where Democrats made large gains in 2018 and hope to continue to expand in 2020. The DCCC’s independent expenditure arm, which controls where it spends tens of millions of dollars on advertising, booked $648,000 in New York’s 1st District in recent weeks to aid college professor Nancy Goroff’s (D) challenge to Rep. Lee Zeldin(R) on Long Island. It also booked $330,000 in ads in Arkansas’ 2nd District, based in Little Rock, where state Sen. Joyce Elliott (D) is taking on Rep. French Hill(R). The Cook Political report currently gives Republicans the edge in both. Democrats also reserved airtime in several other Republican districts, such as Alaska, where Rep. Don Young— the House dean — has held the state-wide seat since 1973. Rowley said these buys illustrate not only the party’s fundraising advantage and the political environment, but also how well-positioned many of most vulnerable Democratic freshmen are.“It’s freed them up to play real offense,” Rowley said. “If they weren’t within striking distance, they wouldn’t be in those races. It’s not the culture of the Democrats to casually play in Alaska and Arkansas.”To contact the reporters on this story:Emily Wilkinsin Washington atewilkins@bgov.com;Greg Girouxin Washington atggiroux@bgov.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story:Kyle Trygstadatktrygstad@bgov.com;Bennett Rothatbroth@bgov.com",3,Reliable,0.1268523846055491,0.4029506182987196,1419,3,Bloomberg Government

Theauditof Arizona’s Maricopa County’s nearly 2.1 million ballots is the result of Republican state senators’ efforts to recount votes there because of unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud made by former President Donald Trump. The Republican senators hiredCyber Ninjas— a Florida-based private technology company — to do the audit.“Either do it right, or don’t do it at all,” wrote Arizona’s top election official, secretary of state and Democrat Katie Hobbs, in a letter to the state Senate Republican’s audit liaison Ken Bennett, according to Phoenix NBC affiliatedKPNX 12.

Regardless of the outcome of the recount, Arizona’s Republican-led Senate does not have power to change the election results,The Associated Pressreported. The U. S. Department of Justice said this week it had its own concerns about whether Arizona’s recount broke federal election laws. Also, Cyber Ninjas’ plan to contact voters directly could be considered illegal voter intimidation, said Principle Deputy Assistant Attorney GeneralPamela S. Karlan, according toPolitico. The audit, which began in late April, has been met with legal challenges and criticism since its inception.

504,Time to Ditch the Global Bureaucracies,17.33,33.67,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/time-to-ditch-the-global-bureaucracies/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"It’s just a few days into the Biden administration, and the president has alreadyrejoinedthe Paris climate accord andmended fenceswith the taxpayer-funded World Health Organization (WHO). These moves are part of a larger strategy to reengage with International Governmental Organizations (IGOs) and continue subsidizing global bureaucracies such as the United Nations (UN). Once again, these bloated, unaccountable organizations will receive full U. S. taxpayer funding despite an abysmal track record at promoting peace and helping the environment. The reality is that IGOs stymie efforts to clean the air, avert wars, and tackle the global pandemic. President Biden should work toward a new multilateralism that actually addresses the world’s problems. The U. S. foots the bill for a substantial share of international governance, spendingmore than $10 billion per yearto prop up IGOs such as the UN. For that amount of money, taxpayers deserve transparent global bureaucracies that make a positive difference in the world. Unfortunately, the UN and the WHO consistently fail to deliver and tend to create more problems than they solve. The U. S. is the single largest contributor to the UN’s “peacekeeping” operations, spendingmore than $1 billion per yearostensibly to keep the peace in troubled regions. Yet UN peacekeepers regularly destabilize the regions they work in by preying on the vulnerable populations of host nations. In Haiti, “peacekeepers” have brought their own pandemic of sexual abuse and scores of unwanted, out-of-wedlock pregnancies. In a2019 surveyconducted by University of Birmingham and Queen’s University researchers, 10 percent of 2,500 interviewed Haitians volunteered that pregnancies caused by “peacekeepers” were a pressing problem for poor soon-to-be mothers. Human Rights Watch senior reporter Skye Wheelernotes, “Haiti is just one of many countries where peacekeepers have raped women and girls, or sexually exploited them in exchange for food or support. My colleagues have also reported on rape by African Union forces in Somalia, French and UN peacekeepers in Central African Republic and UN troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo.” By funding the UN, the Biden administration is setting the stage for more abuses and greater suffering. Even loftier programs such as the Paris climate agreement create more problems than they solve. In order for signatory countries tomeet the treaty’s 2°C target, economies around the world would need to be rapidly decarbonized. This would happen at the expense of the world’s poor who rely on inexpensive fossil fuels. The rigid requirements of the accord would also result in unintended consequences to the environment. In 2019, researchers from the Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, and the Woods Hole Research Centerwarnedthat shifting to renewables “will require a larger spatial footprint to support production resulting in land-use tradeoffs…we found that the ranges of 1,574 threatened and endangered species could be impacted if renewable energy is sited without consideration of current land cover.” The problem isn’t with the steady adoption of cleaner technologies and lowering of carbon emissions, which the U. S. has beendoing for 20 years. Rather, it is the coordinated international frenzy to do something dramatic that is leading to a rash of unintended consequences. Cleaning the air and promoting international peace are worthwhile goals, but the U. S. can work toward them without squandering taxpayer dollars on corrupt, ineffective organizations. The Biden administration can and should pursue multilateralism wherever possible, including lowering the barriers to trade for technologies that can help clean the air we breathe. President Biden can also work with his counterparts in other liberal democracies to improve lives and spearhead peace talks in war-torn nations without resorting to “peacekeeping.”IGOs have outlived their usefulness, and there’s no use doubling down on a failed approach to global governance. It’s time for President Biden to go bold and move away from failed international bureaucracies.is a senior fellow for the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0233639303083747,0.3960820558042781,886,2,The American Conservative

Newsom, battling to remain CA governor past the September 14 recall election, made the comments about Mr. Elder during a campaign stop at a Mexican restaurant this weekend. The Democrat tied Elder to former President Donald Trump, seemingly to frighten West Coast leftists into stronger support.“Though we defeated Trump, we didn’t defeat Trumpism. Trumpism is still alive and well, even here in the state of California,” Newsom said. “If you don’t believe me, just consider … the likely person to enter an oath of office, to enter in the governor’s office in just a matter of weeks if we don’t reject this recall.”“Don’t think for a second that this recall is not about all of you,” the governor added. “It’s about each and every one of us and the values we hold dear.”Newsom was referring to Elder, who’s leading in the latest recall election polls.“The latest Emerson College and Nexstar Media’s ‘Inside California Politics’ poll shows support for the effort to oust Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom has grown in recent weeks as the state has experienced an increase in COVID-19 transmission,”The Daily Wirereported earlier this month. The poll “found support for the recall at 46%, up from 43% in the previous poll from July 20, two weeks ago. However, 48% said they opposed the recall, and 6% of likely voters are undecided, pollsters found, adding that the number of undecided voters had fallen 3%.”“Newsom’s approval rating fell from 49% last month to 48% in the current poll. In addition, 42% said they disapproved of Newsom’s job performance, while 10% were unsure or had no opinion,” The Daily Wire added. Some of Californians’ top issues were homelessness, Covid-19, and crime — which jumped 7% from July. A nervous Newsom reiterated the same this weekend on CNN. “We turn out our base, we’re going to win, unquestionably. It’s not a persuasion campaign. People are locked in,” Newsomsaid. “But the profound consequences — particularly the leading candidate on the other side, Larry Elder — people just need to take a close look.”The Democrat then accused Elder, a black man, of “promoting” “bigotry and hate” as he alleged former President Trump does.“Democrats need to wake up (to) what’s at stake, and we made it easy,” Newsom added. “It’s all mail-in ballot. Simple question: ‘Should he be recalled?’ ‘No.’ Send it back. Don’t even consider the second question with those 46 candidates.”Elder, a 69-year-old conservative host, commentator, and author, haspromotedchoice and freedom over state mandates when it comes to Covid-19 precautions, a stark contrast to Newsom. The candidate is leading other Republicans in the recall contest.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0338235294117646,0.4136904761904763,683,2,Daily Wire

Does JOE BIDEN?No, the media and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not understand that. But most of the American people do, and that’s why Trump’s response was not just brilliant and correct, but savvy, when responding to the call by his opponent’s for top-down centralized control.“While Joe Biden will allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens, wants the President of the United States with the mere stroke of a pen to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months,” said Trump on Thursday. “I guess he thinks it’s good politics.”That last rebuke about politics was perfect. I hope whoever wrote it for him gets some kudos.“Different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the Corona problem. He does not identify what authority the president has to issue such a mandate or how federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and know what is needed it.”WATCH below, via Grabien.

The future of fashion may be conflicted, and we don't have all the answers, but we do have one thing to look forward to: the up-and-coming designers who are changing the narrative of fashion. We're excited to introduce you to's Generation Next Class of 2020. This mentorship initiative was launched last year to identify and champion voices we think are up next to lead and push things forward in the fashion industry. The designers from last year's inaugural Generation Next class are now off doing amazing things: Hanifa is innovating runway shows, and debuted her latest collection with a3D digital show;Slashed by Tia is creatingstylish face maskswith her signature ruffles now that covering our faces every day is the new normal; and Dyke Sport was recently worn byRosaliaat an Astroworld performance. This year,’s editor in chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner and fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston selected, with the help of our style team, five fashion brands that we feel embody the ethos ofTeen Voguefrom sustainability to inclusivity. There’s Sheena Sood of Abacaxi, Edvin Thompson of Theophilio, Elliss Solomon of Elliss, Tolu Coker of Tolu Coker, and Krystal Paniagua of Krystal Paniagua. What young designers need to succeed varies based on the designer, and includes building relationships with luxury retailers and mentorship with stylists and fashion editors for placement in publications. Our mission is to give young designers resources to set them up for success, by bringing them together with fashion industry insiders for critical networking opportunities and fostering new relationships. Ahead, meet the Generation Next Class of 2020…. and stay tuned for what's next. Designer Sheena Sood, born in the Minneapolis suburbs, now based in New York2018Sheena Sood caught our attention because of her handmade, environmentally friendly bright designs that tell a story of travel and nature. Sood, a South Asian-American designer, worked as an assistant designer for Tracy Reese, and decided to branch out on her own in 2018. Her tie-dye and mindfully made textile prints are an ode to her childhood and culture. Every look is infused with a sense of boldness, and the name of her collection, Abacaxi, is derived from the Portuguese word for pineapple. As an advocate for slow fashion, her pieces are produced in Delhi and made using artisans in India. Whether crocheted dresses or knit tunics, the collection is an innovative play on traditional silhouettes that are sure to evoke wanderlust. Designer Edvin Thompson, born in Jamaica, now based in New York2016Edvin Thompson is a creative who comes from humble beginnings in Jamaica. After launching his collection in 2016, in New York, he has continued his rise as an innovative talent. “For women and men who show courage while facing an adversary, I design for evidence of trials and triumph, adhering to the constant celebration of life,” he says. Combining nostalgia and Thompson's love of upcycling clothing, each piece moves as a wearable biography, with emotional power and raw energy. The collection is heavy on the details with ruffles, fringe, and intricate headpieces that toe the line of avant-garde couture in silhouette but are somehow still wearable. It’s all Thompson's way of breaking down the barriers in fashion around what “certain people can wear,” and creating his own dialogue with a customer that isn’t interested in the norm. Designer Elliss Solomon, based in LondonByP. Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara Delgado2016London-based designer Elliss Solomon launched her collection in 2016, after graduating from Central St. Martins, with a desire to create a line that was chic in simplicity but conscious of waste. The conversation around using natural organic fabrics, bamboo, and recycled ocean plastics that have a low impact on the earth isn’t new, but Solomon has brought a fresh perspective and an energized approach to simple, elegant pieces that are breathable and comfortable. From conception to creation, Solomon is acutely aware of her clothing, and wants to attract people who may discover her brand because they care about the environment but become customers because of its excellent design. Solomon is everything that fast fashion is not, and what the fashion industry needs. British-Nigerian designer Tolu Coker, based in London2017British-Nigerian fashion designer Tolu Coker launched her eponymous line in 2017, after working at Maison Margiela, J. W. Anderson, and Celine, just to name just a few. Coker strikes a balance between dissecting the complexities of diasporic Black identity, maximalist embellishments, and prints with a skillful approach to mainly unisex designs. Her work extends beyond clothing, including illustrations and documentaries with embedded notes of her family history. From her father, an activist in the Black Panther movement in the U. K., to using her platform as a designer to express political reform, Coker is continuously redefining contemporary culture. Designer Krystal Paniagua, originally from Puerto Rico, now based in London2020Krystal Paniagua launched her eponymous line this year, after graduating from the Royal College of Arts and heading back home to Puerto Rico. A common thread in her collection is celebrating her homeland while demonstrating a sense of irregularity and decay through distressing and embroidery. From knit cutouts to dresses molded to the body, Paniagua has developed both a technique that is all her own and a fluidity with knitwear that the industry has never seen. Aiming to create a relationship with the wearer of each item, the collection is inclusive of size and lifestyle while maintaining a strikingly modern approach.",3,Reliable,0.1576638639138638,0.4581396136543196,1285,2,Teen Vogue

Liz Cheney may be many things, but we are safe in assuming she is not stupid. She must have known that fist bumping President Joe Biden,insistingDemocrats are not the “sworn enemies” of Republicans andtweetingin all caps that “anyone who claims” the 2020 election was stolen is “spreading THE BIG LIE,” would cost her a House Republican leadership post and, by 2022, probably her House seat too. Furthermore, as the offspring of the former vice president and ruthless bureaucratic warrior Dick Cheney, another safe assumption is that the congresswoman has an endgame. But what is it?Two daysthe fateful fist bump, Liz Cheney wasaskedby the New York Postif she would ever consider running for president. She responded, “I’m not ruling anything in or out—ever is a long time.”If her plan is to run for president in 2024, we may want to reconsider the assumption that she is not stupid. All available data suggests the path for an anti-Trump politician in today’s Republican Party is imaginary. Trump holds an88 percentapproval rating among Republican voters, according to an in-depth party analysis conducted in March by the Republican polling firm Fabrizio, Lee and Associates. Some 57 percent believe Trump should remain party leader. The same number would vote for him a presidential primary “no matter what.” Only 16 percent of Republicans would definitely vote for somebody else. Cheney’s refusal to accept “The Big Lie” puts her squarely in the party minority. An April CNN poll determined that 70 percent of Republican votersbelieve“Biden did not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency,” while an April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60 percent of Republicansthinkthe 2020 election was stolen from Trump. There’s a reason why House Republicans are not interested in expending their political capital to defend her. Besides, we’ve already seen people try to run against Trump in a presidential primary, and it wasn’t pretty. Try to think of Trump’s 2020 primary rivals without emulating Rick Perry’s most infamous moment (“Let’s see. What’s the third one there? … Oops!”). Perhaps Cheney is interested inleadingthe nascent third-party effort being organized (or, to be more precise, threatened) by Miles Taylor, the former Trump administration official-turned-Trump-critic who wrote that anonymous book about Trump. Such a move would not be worthy of a political chessmaster. Cheney must know that most third-party efforts crash and burn. And those involved, according to the New York Times, appear to largely be Republicans who don’t hold current office and had already effectively purged themselves from the party. Such a group is more likely to shrink thebig tent by depriving them of the right-leaning “Never Trump” vote, than becoming a major force of its own. While Cheney may not be concerned about the electoral prospects of Democrats, presumably she isn’t going through all this trouble just to splinter the Democratic vote and help Trumpian Republicans—possibly including Trump himself—regain power. So what could Liz Cheney be thinking? I suspect the answer lies in the last five words of her statement to the: “ever is a long time.” The endgame is not winning in 2024, but winning control of the party after 2024. Liz Cheney is the daughter of a man who served in high-ranking posts under Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. Surely she knows that parties are buffeted by events and change over time. And if events prompt the GOP to eventually turn away from Trump, the Republican who made the most prominent break with Trump would be uniquely positioned to lead the party. Yes, the Trumpification of the Republican Party was brewing for a long time, going all the way back to the Nixon-era Southern Strategy. But let’s not forget: Just nine years ago, the party’s standard-bearer was Mitt Romney. Today’s Republican Party is little more than a cult of personality. But how long can a cult of personality sustain, especially when the personality at the top is so widely unpopular? Last month’s NBC News pollpeggedTrump’s favorability at 32 percent. (Even if Trump tends to underpoll by a few points because his supporters are less likely to participate in polls, that is an abysmal number.)Parties can only lose so much before its rank-and-file members conclude, “the problem isn’t you, it’s me.” The experience of the Democrats in the 1980s and 1990s suggests a rule-of-three. To be beaten twice by Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 could be excused by his unique charm. To beaten by charismatic Reaganthe awkward George H. W. Bush in 1988 convinced Democrats that they had their own internal problems to solve. So in 1992, exasperated primary voters were prepared to accept a moderate who breaks with liberal orthodoxy on welfare, the death penalty and the overall scope of government, and Bill Clinton met that moment. Following other losing streaks in history, parties sought presidential nominees who could turn the page on their pasts. After losing five consecutive presidential elections to Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman over the course of the Great Depression and World War II, Republicans embraced the war hero Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and reversed their fortunes with a nominee who had little interest on overturning the New Deal. Around the turn of the 20thcentury, Democrats lost the presidency twice in a row with the agrarian populist William Jennings Bryan, then tried the conservative Alton Parker and still lost, then lost again with Bryan, before finally succeeding in 1912 with the urbane progressive Woodrow Wilson. Trump’s 2016 victory staved off a rule-of-three moment of reckoning for Republicans. But since then, Republicans have lost both chambers of Congress and the presidency. What if Republicans fail to take back Congress in the 2022 midterms? Then whiff in the 2024 presidential election? That would be a lot of losing to swallow. Would Republicans still let an unpopular Trump function as their de facto party boss? Maybe the cultish grip Trump has on Republicans is so tight, they don’t care if they lose. Or, they will keep storming the Capitol and denying reality after every defeat. However, history suggests losing parties eventually adapt to reality, for their own survival. When the GOP is ready for reality, Cheney will be ready and waiting, because her defiant rejection of The Big Lie gives her the cleanest of breaks from Trump. Her actions are in stark contrast to former governor of New JerseyChris Christie. He too has tried to distance himself from the insurrection. But he also said this month that he would give Trump an “overall” grade of “A.” Christie is straining to maintain some credibility with the party’s mainstream while also appealing to the anti-Trump minority. Cheney isn’t trying to blur any lines, and that may be to her benefit down the line. Adam SerwerbelievesCheney doesn’t deserve to be cleansed of Trump’s sins. Last week, he made the case that Cheney is not the antithesis of Trump, but the precursor, as she helped “build” the GOP “monster” over which Trump now presides. His case rests on Cheney’s scurrilous attacks against Obama-era Democrats for being soft of terrorism. Cheney “insisted that the president was secretly sympathetic to jihadists” and “launched a McCarthyite crusade against seven unnamed attorneys in the Obama-era Justice Department who had previously represented terrorism suspects.”Serwer concludes that Cheney’s demagoguery and demonization “is the logic of the War on Terror, and also the logic of the party of Trump.” But drawing that connection between Cheney and Trump skips past the party’s ideological shift on foreign policy that widely separates the two. Cheney is an old-fashioned conservative hawk who wants to treat Russia as an adversary. Trump is a quasi-isolationist promoter of “America First.” Cheneyopenly criticizedTrump’s embrace of Putin. Last month, the pro-Trump websitechargedCheney with using reports of Russian bounties against American soldiers in Afghanistan—reports now treated by U. S. intelligence with “low to moderate confidence”—to “undermine Trump.”The intra-party foreign policy divide is acutely relevant to understanding what’s driving Cheney’s actions. She was always uncomfortable with the direction Trump was taking the party internationally, and she wants to return the GOP to its late 20th century hawkish roots. Unless Biden takes an unexpected hawkish turn, expect Cheney to use her augmented media platform to swipe at Biden’s foreign policy in equal measure as she swipes at Trump’s mendacity. This is why Democrats can’t get more excited about Cheney’s principled revolt; she is grounded in principles Democrats don’t share. In recent weeks she has arguedagainst rejoiningthe Iran nuclear deal andagainst withdrawingtroops from Afghanistan. Of course, Trump agreed with her on the Iran nuclear deal; his foreign policy vision was an ideologically inconsistent mix of “America First” isolationism and knee-jerk opposition to whatever Barack Obama did. But Cheney’s foreign policy views are deeply held and aggressively waged. She is unlikely to join with Democrats to stop Trumpism. She wants to unite her fellow hawks to stop DemocratsTrumpism. But she must know she is in no position at present to lead an ideological army to win control of the GOP, let alone the White House. All she can do now is plant her flag, own her turf and wait until the moment is hers to seize—most likely after 2024.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1178749131526909,0.4611252739030518,2076,1,Washington Monthly
510,"San Diego public schools can provide in-person enrichment and therapy to students, officials say",1.67,50.0,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2020-08-19/san-diego-public-schools-can-provide-in-person-enrichment-and-therapy-to-students-officials-confirm,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,20,"There is now a way San Diego County public schools can serve students on campus withoutapplying for a waiveror breaking the state schoolclosure mandate. Schools can offer in-person enrichment programs for free by using money set aside for state- and federally-funded after-school programs. While schools can’t provide in-person classes, there are no state rules prohibiting schools from offering other in-person support programs for students, County Superintendent Paul Gothold said recently. Therefore the San Diego County Office of Education is allowing districts and charter schools to use after-school programs to provide enrichment activities, including academic support, during the school day for small groups of students, Gothold wrotein a letterlast week to the county health department. In a win for students with disabilities, Gothold also said there are no rules barring public schools from providing in-person therapy services or special education assessments to students one at a time — outdoors and by appointment. Students with disabilities have not been getting all their special education services during the pandemic, andseveral parents saythe services they are getting virtually don’t work so well for their kids.“In fact, educational agencies are required to provide services to the extent possible and are responsible for ensuring that the needs of these students are met,” Gothold wrote. “I cannot imagine that the state or county intends to deny or further delay children with disabilities access to the individual assessment and therapy services they need and are guaranteed by federal law.”Gothold said the urgency to serve students in need is too great to wait for more state guidance.“We cannot delay any further while waiting for clarifying language from the state; we must act now,” Gothold wrote. “It is a matter of equity for our most vulnerable students.”The stateconfirmed last week that schools can offer on-campus enrichment through after-school programs. The state has yet to address solutions for special education. Gothold’s letter presents public schools with options to counteract inequities that have emerged during the pandemic. In the absence of in-person school, many parents with resources have been able to get in-person help for their kids more quickly than those without resources. They can pay tuition at private schools, which arebetter-positioned than large school districtsto apply for school reopening waivers. They can pay for child care at licensed day cares. They also can pay for tutors to leadlearning pods for their children. Meanwhile students with the highest needs — including homeless youth, foster youth, low-income students, children of essential workers and students with disabilities — are less likely to be able to take advantage of such opportunities. ASES, or the After School Education and Safety program, is the state-funded after-school program that could provide solutions for those students, along with 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which is a similar federally-funded program. ASES programs are run by organizations like the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club in partnership with schools, and they are funded based on the numbers of low-income students at a school. There were 309 ASES programs in San Diego County last school year that served 45,690 students, according to the San Diego County Office of Education. Some school districts are offering child care but are charging fees. ASES is one of the only options that are free for families, said Kim McDougal, executive director of the YMCA Child Care Resource Service.“That’s a program we’re really prioritizing getting open ... because it serves the most high-need families,” McDougal said. Chula Vista Elementary, the fourth-largest district in the county, is one of the first districts to take advantage of this new permission from the county office. Last week the district announced it will offer free enrichment programs through ASES for 1,500 students as soon as Sept. 8. It also will offer fee-based spots for another 500 children. Priority for enrichment programs will go to the children of Chula Vista teachers, foster and homeless youth, and other children in need, the district said. The district had about 23,000 students last school year.“To be able to do distance learning, we need to be able to provide options for our neediest families, and those include essential workers,” district spokesman Anthony Millican said. “In our opinion this is an essential, protective service for our most vulnerable populations.”The county education office says that these after-school programs must keep students in fixed cohorts of 10 or fewer students. Students in third grade and higher will have to wear masks, while children in lower grades would be encouraged to wear masks, which is in line with state school guidance. Six-foot physical distancing also must be enforced. Some district officials are willing to bring students back to campus for ASES but not for regular school. Chula Vista Elementary has said it will not apply for a reopening waiver because the COVID-19 levels are too high in south San Diego County. ASES would involve bringing far fewer students back to campus, Millican said. And because ASES programs are run mostly by third-party staff, the district also doesn’t have to bargain for the approval of teachers or other staff unions. Chula Vista’s teachersand teacher unions in other districts have said they do not want to return to campus until their local zip codes reach low COVID-19 levels and until schools implement stringent safety measures — some of which districts say they may not be able to afford.",3,Reliable,0.1504965012156792,0.4201897189568422,1161,3,San Diego Union-Tribune

The nation’s top infectious disease expert made the comments when he was asked how “to break down the myths and the historic trepidation” during a virtual conversation called “Making It Plain: A Conversation with Dr. Fauci and The Black Community.”Corbett, a viral immunologist, rose to public prominence in March when it was revealed she was a lead scientist with Dr. Barney Graham’s coronavirus team in the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health. She was among the team of scientists who met within April when he took a tour of NIH’s Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory. In addition to over 10 years of research experience, Corbett holds a Ph. D in microbiology and immunology and graduated from the University of Maryland-Baltimore County with a degree in sociology in 2008. A fewtweets have resurfacedof Corbett speaking candidly about the medical community. In a March tweet, she alleged the poor Black community may be overlooked for treatment if ventilators were in short supply. The following month she “plead the fifth” on the suggestion that the pandemic is an act of genocide against Blacks. Dr. Fauci said while he understands the Black community’s mistrust due to decades of racism in medical care and inhumane experimentation on Black Americans, the pending COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. He reiterated his claims were underscored by the involvement of Corbett — who came under fire for tweets dating back to February which addressed the correlation between systemic racism and medical malpractice.“Kizzi is an African-American scientist who is right at the forefront of the development of the vaccine,” Fauci added. “So, the first thing you might want to say to my African-American brothers and sisters is that the vaccine that you’re going to be taking was developed by an African American woman. And that is just a fact.”Thanks to@blackdoctor_orgfor asking this question. And, for Dr. Fauci for now making it likely impossible to enforce “Kizzmekia” cause everyone now knows he’s allowed to say “Kizzy”. Haha 😂 recent survey by the COVID Collaborative showed only 14 percentof Black Americans trust the safety of a vaccine, while slightly more, 18 percent, believed it would actually work. Corbett toldCNNshe understood why Black Americans had reservations and noted the medical profession had work to do to earn the community’s trust again.“I would say to people who are vaccine-hesitant that you’ve earned the right to ask the questions that you have around these vaccines and this vaccine development process,” Corbett said. “Trust, especially when it has been stripped from people, has to be rebuilt in a brick-by-brick fashion. … And so, what I say to people firstly is that I empathize, and then secondly is that I’m going to do my part in laying those bricks. And I think that if everyone on our side, as physicians and scientists, went about it that way, then the trust would start to be rebuilt.”Reports of Fauci’s comments were met with mixed reviews on social media. While some Twitter users asked why Corbett’s race should even matter, others praised Corbett being recognized for her great work. Still, others said they didn’t care if a Black woman was involved, they still would not take the vaccine.“Why is this a headline?” tweeted user @blondieinohio in response to one of TMZ’s tweets about it.“Almost everyone mentioing (sic) why is this news happens to be Caucasian. That’s part of privilege minorities hardly ever hear about our accomplishments, history in school is about whites minorities have take classes to learn about ours.

Let’s Start at Nine Thousand.",7.0,45.67,https://www.cato.org/article/how-many-lives-will-we-save-choosing-our-own-vaccination-programme-not-eus-lets-start-nine,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,18,"Delay is extremely costly in this pandemic. When the post‐​mortems are written, lethargy will rank high on the list of consequential policy mistakes. With a rapidly spreading virus, procedural bureaucracy or a failure to grease the wheels for vaccine rollouts will be found to have cost tens of thousands of lives in each advanced country, alongside incalculable damage to livelihoods. As I explain in my forthcoming book, Economics In One Virus, governments have certainly spent big on testing, tracing, and vaccines. But the sums are piddling in comparison to the amount allocated for economic relief. The latter is demanded by voters, but it would have been wiser to put more funds into paying over‐​the‐​odds to encourage vaccine manufacturing scale‐​up, to overcome bottlenecks, and to facilitate around‐​the‐​clock rollout as soon as vaccines were ready. This would have handsomely paid for itself in a more rapid economic normalisation, not to mention the lives saved. As economist Alex Tabarrok has written, this was the easiest cost‐​benefit analysis in the world for policymakers. When the inquiries begin, governments will lament their relative stinginess on spending where it mattered most. With a rapidly spreading virus, procedural bureaucracy or a failure to grease the wheels for vaccine rollouts will be found to have cost tens of thousands of lives in each advanced country, alongside incalculable damage to livelihoods. As of writing this on Monday, the UK’s vaccine rollout performance is improving still, of course, with nearly 600,000 jabs registered Saturday and England’s figures for Sunday up 45 per cent on the week. It might seem a bizarre time then to lament that we didn’t go quicker still. Yet two months after the first vaccine was approved, still only around 14 per cent of the public have received at least one dose. While the manufacturers and the NHS are (understandably and heroically) pulling every lever given where we are, we will surely regret in future not having had an Israeli‐​style mobilisation in place. That’s not to say the UK’s performance has not been *relatively* impressive. The dexterity of the MHRA in understanding the trade‐​offs associated with the approvals process puts the US to shame, as that country stalls on approving AstraZeneca’s vaccine despite tens of thousands of Americans dying per week. The UK government’s willingness to stump up more cash has exposed the false economy of the EU’s haggling over pennies in contracts too. For the costs of delay are exacerbated by the way this virus and the vaccines operate. An infection might take three to four weeks before it manifests as a death. Vaccines themselves take a couple of weeks before they are high efficacy. So now we see the consequence of the relative lack of acquired protection for many elderly people in mid‐​January. It is only in the next three to five weeks that we should start seeing the big vaccine‐​induced falls in mortality, if indeed vaccines really do have near the 100 percent touted effectiveness in preventing deaths. The Covid‐​19 Actuaries Group (CAG) believes that if the Government delivers on its eminently achievable target of vaccinating all over‐​70s, care home staff, frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically vulnerable, by mid‐​February, daily Covid‐​19 deaths will fall by two‐​thirds by the end of the month. By the tail end of March, deaths should be down 86 percent against a world without vaccines. So one can understand the angst inside the EU—their tardiness in getting vulnerable populations vaccinated will cost lives that will be all the more observable if British trends go as expected. How many extra deaths have we avoided through our speedier rollout? Calculating the exact magnitude is extraordinarily difficult. Lockdowns and tier restrictions perversely lower the immediate “lives saved from vaccines,” because without them more people would have been exposed. Working out how many lives the UK will save compared to the EU in the coming months is also muddied by not knowing the eventual speed of each country’s vaccination program or the underlying prevalence of the disease for the nations. But comparing the UK to France, Germany, Italy and Spain (the EU‑4) gives us an idea of magnitudes. These countries have only vaccinated between two and four percent of their populations respectively, and are currently vaccinating at a rate of 0.11 to 0.12 percent of their populations per day. The UK has vaccinated 14 percent of its population, and is currently vaccinating over 0.55 percent of its population per day. If extrapolated forwards, the UK would vaccinate its four priority groups once by mid‐​February. The EU‑4 would achieve the same proportion of population dose numbers by mid‐​to‐​late July. Indeed, even if the EU‑4 were suddenly able to up their daily vaccinations to UK rates from now, they would not hit the same number of doses as a proportion of the population as the UK’s February target until early March—three weeks behind. My calculations based on the Covid‐​19 Actuaries Group report suggests that, if the vaccine is 100 percent effective in eliminating death, the UK has already seen around 1,300 fewer deaths as a result of vaccines. Given the lags discussed between infections and deaths, as well as the time it takes for vaccine efficacy, this is almost certainly close to 1,300 more lives saved than would have been saved had we been as tardy as the EU. Projecting forwards to how many lives are being saved from the recent and current vaccinations is more difficult. We have to try to model what cases and deaths would have looked like absent a vaccine. We would also need to know how fast the EU vaccination program will become, something that I profess no knowledge of. But, for illustrative purposes, let’s assume that, absent a vaccine, deaths would otherwise have fallen through February and March as a pure reflection of how they rose in December and January. Under this scenario, the UK has already locked in 9,000 fewer deaths through mid‐​April than if it had moved at the EU‑4’s vaccination pace to date (saving 20,000 lives overall). And that’s assuming the EU‑4 countries wake up tomorrow and suddenly match the UK’s speed. Realistically, of course, some of the EU‑4 are not planning to widely vaccinate for a month or two, while they are sticking to the regimen of two doses sooner that will leave fewer people on the Continent protected in the near‐​term. So, it’s very safe to say the UK will have saved tens of thousands of additional lives relative to going at the EU‑4’s pace over the coming months, with the gap especially dramatic if the EU does not up its game in the very near future or if, as a result of vaccinations, the UK then relaxes its lockdown restrictions. The costs of delay in public health and economic terms are clearly enormous.",3,Reliable,0.093969176818014,0.4431109265411592,1532,3,Cato Institute

Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion. Ulises Ruiz/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionActivists supporting the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico march in Guadalajara, Mexico, on September 28, 2019. Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion. Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion as a crime, a landmark ruling that clears the way for the legalization of abortion across the country. The court took up the issue on Monday when eight of 11 justices voted to revoke a law in the state of Coahuila that punished women with up to three years in prison for having an abortion — even in cases of rape. The other three justices joined in the decision Tuesday, declaring such laws unconstitutional.""Today is a historic day for the rights of all Mexican women,"" said Supreme Court Chief Justice Arturo Zaldivar on Tuesday.""It is a watershed in the history of the rights of all women, especially the most vulnerable,"" he added. The ruling sets a precedent that would force judges across Mexicohome to one of the world's largest populations of Catholics—to hand down similar rulings and expands early abortion for millions of women in Mexico's 32 states. The decision was being celebrated as a major victory for the women's rights movement across Latin America that has gained momentum in recent years, prompted byrecord femicide ratesand a majorabortion rights victoryin Argentina last year. Inspired by that hard-fought triumph, tens of thousands of women in Mexico have taken up green bandanas — a symbol of abortion-rights activists in Argentina — calling for the decriminalization of abortion beyond the four states where it is legal up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.""This Supreme Court decision has legal ripple effects beyond the Mexican state of Coahuila and applies across Mexico,"" Paula Avila-Guillen, executive director of the Women's Equality Center, said in a statement following the decision.""As of this moment, any Mexican state that criminalizes abortion is in direct defiance of the Federal Constitution. As of this decision, all Mexican states where abortion is still criminalized are obligated to modify their legal frameworks to comply with the standard set by the Court,"" Avila-Guillen added. She noted that the ruling sets a precedent for women who are currently behind bars for seeking an abortion to be freed. Avila-Guillen called Mexico's decision a bright spot in the fight to protect women's reproductive rights around the world — one that comes just days after Texas enacted what amounts to the strictest anti-abortion measure in the U. S. The Texas law bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.""The pro-rights 'Green Wave' is poised to take over the region and bring it to the 21st Century, even as we see the United States Supreme Court and Texas walk women back into darkness,"" she said. Now that women in Coahuila, which borders the state of Texas, can choose to terminate their pregnancies through the first trimester, Avila-Guillen suggests some American women may benefit from Mexico's new law. She asks: ""Could the safest way for Texan women to have access to a safe, legal abortion soon be to make their way to Mexico?""",3,Reliable,0.0626569751569751,0.2896874146874147,735,3,NPR
515,State lawmakers continue crusade against Roe vs. Wade with flood of new abortion bills,-6.0,45.67,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-04-22/abortion-bills-state-legislatures-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,25,"Energized by the conservative tilt of the U. S. Supreme Court,legislators in Republican-led states have put forward hundreds of abortion restrictions, including near-total bans, eager to offer the vehicle to achieve a long-standing goal: the unwinding of Roe vs. Wade. The barrage of bills introduced this year — the first legislative session since Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed last fall, cementing the court’s conservative majority — reflects the growing sense of opportunity among abortion opponents.“There’s just a lot of hope out there on the pro-life side,” said Arizona state Sen. Nancy Barto, a Republican. “For a long time, we haven’t made a lot of progress. Everybody is seeing the possibilities now. It has emboldened states.”And they’re emboldened not only to further limit the procedure, but to challenge the 1973 landmark ruling that established the right to abortion nationwide. Abortion rights advocates have identified about 500 measures that lawmakers at the state level have introduced to impede the procedure, including bans based on the gestational age of the fetus, as well as prohibitions on terminating a pregnancy due to race, sex or genetic anomaly. Some bills would prevent doctors from prescribing abortion pills through telemedicine visits; others would allow men with paternity claims to block an abortion against a pregnant woman’s wishes. And both sides in the abortion debate are advancing laws that look ahead to a potential post-Roe nation, in which access to the procedure would vary from state to state.“What’s happening this year is a continuation” of the flurry of strict abortion bills in 2019, said Kristin Ford, national communications director for NARAL Pro-Choice America. “It’s almost as if the anti-choice movement threw all of their most cruel attacks into a blender.”The frenetic legislative action and legal challenges around the issue belie the fact that public opinion on abortion has remained relatively steady for the last two decades. Americans aremore or less evenly splitwhen asked by Gallup whether they consider themselves “pro-choice” or “pro-life.” A consistent majority backs legal abortion in some circumstances, and polls have found that by a healthy margin, respondents do not want Roe vs. Wade to be overturned. In recent years, however, states have passed abortion prohibitions with the aim of undoing that court decision. One ban, a 2018 Mississippi law to outlaw almost all abortions after 15 weeks, waits in limbo at the Supreme Court, where the justices have taken an unusually long time in announcing whether a review has been granted or denied — leaving the extent of the court’s appetite to revisit Roe unclear.“I don’t read minds and I don’t place bets on Supreme Court cases,” said Katie Glenn, government affairs counsel at Americans United for Life. “There were a lot of smart people who thought the court would overturn Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey” — a 1992 case that affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion, but that also broadened states’ ability to regulate it. Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state reproductive health policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that supports access to abortion, said that nowadays “it’s pretty clear the court is solidly antiabortion.”“What is unclear is what kind of cases they will take that could undermine abortion rights,” Nash said. The most direct threats to Roe are the various bans. Thetrend acceleratedafter Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the court in 2018, and has continued this year in states such as South Carolina and Arkansas. The latter passed a bill outlawing abortion in all cases except to save the mother’s life; it does not include exemptions for rape or incest. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, upon signing the Arkansas law in March, acknowledged it “is in contradiction of binding precedents of the U. S. Supreme Court,” but noted it was “the intent of the legislation to set the stage for the Supreme Court overturning current case law.”The fact that the court has yet to rule on such abortion bans has not deterred state-level lawmakers; if anything, they appear more eager to propose their own versions.“There’s some sense that some states want to have their name on the case the court ultimately takes to overturn or change the underlying abortion law,” said Laurie Sobel, associate director for women’s health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisanhealthcare nonprofit. Mallory Quigley, spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion, said the bevy of bans creates an “avalanche effect” that feedsthe argument that the American public — through their elected representatives — wants Roe revisited.“We know the court is not immune to public opinion,” Quigley said. “The more states are advancing these bills, the more it increases the demand for the Supreme Court to weigh in.”Meanwhile, a narrow Supreme Court victory for abortion rights advocates last year — a decisionstriking down a Louisiana abortion law— also opened a window for opponents, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s opinion in the case signaling his willingness to consider other regulations.“That case essentially invited other types of abortion restrictions to come to the court to get clarity,” Sobel said, noting that the current crush of bills can be attributed to “not just the confirmation of the new justice, but the opening the chief justice created.”Arizona’s Barto is among the state lawmakers who have introduced legislation to chip away at abortion access. Her bill, which passed the Legislature on Thursday and is headed to the governor’s desk, would bar abortions on the basis of genetic disorders such as Down syndrome — an act of selective reproduction that she says is tantamount to discrimination against those with disabilities. Doctors who perform abortions in such cases would face criminal penalties. Her efforts dovetailed with a federal appeals court decision last week to uphold a similar ban in Ohio. The decision conflicts with decisions in other federal districts, teeing up an opportunity for the Supreme Court to weigh in. The genetic abnormality provision “is a bigger bite than we’ve taken in a while,” Barto said. “It’s going to make people think.”Her bill would also prohibit dispensing of abortion pills through the mail, another focal point this year due to the rise of telemedicine during the pandemic. The Biden administration last week temporarily lifted the requirement for an in-person visit to obtain abortion medication. Abortion rights advocates are pressing the administration to make that change permanent. Barto said banning the distribution of such pills by mail is a necessary safety measure. Opponents to such mandates note that the Food and Drug Administration says drug-induced abortions are safe for terminating pregnancies before 10 weeks. They see such bills as more about finding new ways to inhibit women’s access to abortion.“We have seen bans on the methods used during second trimester. Now we’re seeing attempts to limit a major method of early abortion,” Nash said. Advocates on both sides say there is also an uptick in states modifying their constitutions and statutes in preparation for the potential overturning of Roe vs. Wade. Voters in Kansas, for example, will consider an antiabortion amendment to the state’s constitution next year. Lawmakers introduced the amendment in response to astate Supreme Court rulingthat said access to abortion was “a fundamental right” in the Kansas Constitution.“It came as a complete shock to most Kansans when in 2019 their state Supreme Court discovered this right to abortion that had never been eliminated in the 100-plus years of the Kansas Constitution being on the books,” said Glenn of Americans United for Life. “We saw a lot of lawmakers say, ‘Could that happen in our state?’”Such moves have not been limited to abortion opponents. In New Mexico, lawmakers repealed an abortion ban that had been on the books since 1969 (and that was unenforceable after Roe vs. Wade) in order to ensure that the right to abortion was preserved in the state even if Roe is no longer the national standard. Antiabortion advocates are also wading into other contentious statehouse battles this year, namely the raft of voting restrictions introduced in response to former President Trump’s false allegation that the 2020 election was rife with fraud. Polls show that Republican voters’ faith in elections plummeted with Trump’s refusal to accept last year’s results. Susan B. Anthony List, along with other social conservatives, launched a multimillion-dollar campaign this year to advocate for tighter voting laws.“We’re engaging in this fight because our very ability to win elections is predicated on our ability to turn out voters, which requires voters to trust the system,” Quigley said. Rachel Sussman, vice president of state policy and advocacy for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said she wasn’t surprised that lawmakers who oppose abortion are also pushing laws that restrict the right to vote, as well as legislation focusing on transgender people — especially limiting access to or outright banning certain medical procedures for trans youth and regulating their participation in school sports. Conservative legislators “are using a coordinated strategy to keep their control by any means possible, including changing the rules of engagement and dismantling democracy altogether,” Sussman said.“That threat is rooted in everybody’s ability to live free,” she added, “whether that is the ability to make the decision about their own body or whether it’s about getting crucial healthcare that they need to live [as] their full selves.”",3,Reliable,0.1018519085736066,0.4423381388004029,2053,3,LA Times
516,California’s Central Valley and the Colorado River Delta Are Epicenters for North America’s Migratory Birds,-2.0,49.0,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/californias-central-valley-and-colorado-river-delta-are-epicenters-north-americas-migratory-birds-180976892/,https://adfontesmedia.com/smithsonian-magazine-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,15,"A database called eBird reveals as many as 65 million birds fly through these Western migration zonesMigratory birds have followed the same flight patterns for millennia, searching for abundant food resources. The journey is often risky, and birds undergo harsh weather patterns—from storms that can throw them off course to dry arid landscapes that provide little to no food resources. A new study published this week infound tens of millions of birds depend on the river and wetland habitats weaved within the Colorado River Delta and California’s Central Valley while they make their journey across the dry western landscapes, reports Corryn Wetzel forAudubon. These two regions were suspected as essential stopover sites by ornithologists in the past. But not enough evidence supported this idea until data collected from the community science appeBirdshowed otherwise. eBird is an app where anyone from seasoned birders to casual novices can note when and where they saw a bird species. Scientists use the data collected from eBird to track species populations, spot trends, and trace habitat use. Using eBird along with a mathematical model created byPartners in Flight, the researchers determined that more than 65 million birds travel through California’s Central Valley during the spring migration and 48 million during the fall, reports. About 17 million birds pass through the Colorado River Delta, an area approximately the size of Hawai’i, during the spring, and 14 million birds pass through during fall migration. The eBird data was narrowed down to 112 species of birds that researchers knew used the regions knew used the regions during migration. A significant portion of a bird species’ entire population flies through these Western regions. The data found that in the spring, more than 27 percent of North America’s tree swallows migrate through the Colorado River Delta, and an astonishing 80 percent of Lawrence’s goldfinches migrate through the Central Valley, according to aNational Audubon Societystatement. In fall, nearly 40 percent of Anna’s hummingbirds migrate through the Central Valley.“If more than one percent of the species population uses that site, then we know that that site is really important to that species at the population level,” says Williams DeLuca, a migration ecologist and lead author of the study, to. The Delta and Valley, while crucial to various species of birds, has been altered in the past by human development, agricultural expansion, and diverted river flow. The changes in the ecosystem have birds under extra strain from the already challenging journey, but the data shows that despite the alterations, the birds continue to depend on these landscapes’ reports,.“These migratory pathways are ingrained in birds, and they are sort of still following them even though there's a fraction of the landscape available that used to be there,” Andrea Jones, director of bird conservation for Audubon California and co-author of the study, tells. Deluca and his team hope that the data will inspire conservation efforts for these habitats before the bird species are pushed to their limits.

517,"Having Sexual Assault Survivors Like AOC In Congress Matters, & Here's Why",-15.33,36.67,https://www.elitedaily.com/p/having-sexual-assault-survivors-like-aoc-in-congress-matters-heres-why-60802035,https://adfontesmedia.com/elite-daily-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,16,"On Monday, Feb. 1, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took to Instagram Live to powerfully describe the terror she felt during the violent Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6. In a video that lasted more than an hour, she recounted her experience when the mob of Trump supporters broke into the Capitol, threatened legislators, and forced them to evacuate or hide. Ocasio-Cortez also disclosed she is a survivor of sexual violence, explaining that her previous experience “compounded” her trauma from the riot. During the livestream, Ocasio-Cortez criticized pressure from Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley to “move on” from both the attack and their incitement of it, calling the efforts similar to silencing tactics used by abusers who perpetrate sexual violence. “I’m not going to let it happen to me again,” the congresswoman said of being urged to remain silent after assault. “And I’m not going to let it happen to our country.”Like Ocasio-Cortez, I’m a survivor of sexual assault. When I heard that she was a survivor too, I wasn’t shocked or even surprised. It’s something a staggering amount of women and other marginalized genders have been forced to go through — even those in power. As our government grows more diverse in gender and ethnicity, inevitably our legislature will also consist of more and more people living with the trauma of gender-based violence. That’s messed up. But when we have survivors in government who are able to speak openly about their experiences while making decisions for the welfare of the people, it gives survivors a chance to equalize the playing field. The#MeToo movement that booted a number of prominent menfrom both sides of the aisle out of Congress revealed how many accused abusers are already in power. Two of the nine lifetime members of the Supreme Court — Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas — have beenpublicly accused of sexual violence, though both have denied it. These are the people who get to make decisions about federal laws likeTitle IX,abortion policy,anddomestic violence protection, which impact survivors like the very people they’ve been accused of harming. Ocasio-Cortez’s revelation about her assault made headlines, but sadly, she isn’t even the first person in Congress to have survived sexual or domestic violence or harassment. Rep. Katie Porter has spoken about her experiences with domestic violenceand how those experiences were weaponized against her during her campaign. Former Rep. Katie Hill, whoresigned amid allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a staffer, has been open about her experiencewith sexual violence, like revenge pornand domestic abuse, and says she was harassed by the public for it. Even following Ocasio-Cortez’s brief disclosure about her sexual assault, she wasaccused of lying about her experiences of trauma, and even those who believed heraccused her of “emotional manipulation”and using it for political gain. According to the CDC’s 2015 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, 1 in 5women in the United States have experienced attempted or completed rape, and more than 43% have experienced ”some form” of contact sexual violence. The likelihood of experiencing sexual violence increases for women of color: 40% to 60% of Black women report being subjected to coercive sexual contact by age 18, according to the National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community. One-third of Latina women in the U. S. will experience intimate partner violenceduring her lifetime, per the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, and Latina migrants are subjected to an increased risk of sexual violence — 60% to 80% — during the immigration process. And the Department of Justice (DOJ) saysmore than half of Indigenous womenwill experience sexual violence in their lifetimes. As a survivor, knowing that there are people like Ocasio-Cortez fighting for me in government gives me a little more faith that one day, the government might get to a point where those in power are providing for the needs and safety of all people in the United States, not just the most powerful. For example, one of the first things Ocasio-Cortez did in her first term wassign on to co-sponsorRep. Barbara Lee’sEACH Woman Act, which would repeal the Hyde Amendment and make abortion accessible and affordable to all. (The amendment bans the use of federal funds for abortion, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the pregnant person’s life is physically threatened.) In February 2019, Porter fought for areport on the intersection of firearm possession and domestic violenceand has advocated for the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), as well as a number of other things to protect and address violence against survivors. But what happens when we allow Congress to become a life-threatening space for survivors? ""When we go through trauma, trauma compounds on each other,” Ocasio-Cortez said in her livestream. When survivors enter spaces that feel unsafe and trauma intensifies, it becomes less likely these needed voices will be heard and more likely accused abusers will continue to wield their power relatively unchecked. As a survivor who had to navigate a college campus with my abuser and others who had stalked or harassed me, I know how isolating it feels to try to do your work, change the world, and grow as a person when so many surrounding you are abusers or enablers who look the other way. “Boys will be boys,” “These things happen,” and “You’re overreacting” are the refrains of almost every workplace or educational setting that’s hostile to survivors. It’s the same refrain that Ocasio-Cortez’s political opponents, like Cruz, used to try to diminish and silence her trauma about the Capitol attack. “There's a lot of partisan anger and rage on the Democratic side,”Cruz told reporterson Jan. 28. “It's not healthy for our country, it's certainly not conducive of healing or unity, but everyone has to decide how they want to interact with others.”Ocasio-Cortez’s response to Cruz’s demand for complacency called out the similarity in tactics. “These folks that tell us to move on, that it’s not a big deal, that we should forget what’s happened or even telling us to apologize, these are the same tactics as abusers,” Ocasio-Cortez said in her live video. One of the most common ways abusers try to silence the subjects of their abuse is throughDARVO: Abusers will deny their behavior, attack their victims, and then try to act as though they are the ones who have been victimized.“We cannot move on without accountability,” she added. “We cannot heal without accountability.”It’s comforting to know, as a fellow survivor, Ocasio-Cortez is speaking truth to power and voicing so many of my own thoughts and experiences. But to do so, survivors have to put themselves in harm’s way in spaces and with colleagues who minimize their trauma, disregard their safety, and do their best to push survivors out of the spaces they deserve to be in. That shouldn't be the price they have to pay. It shouldn’t take having survivors in Congress to increase our faith in people who swore to defend us. We should, of course, strive for a government — and society — with neither abusers nor survivors in positions of power because it means we have fixed the systems and mindsets that lead to assault in the first place. But in the meantime, if we continue to make government a hostile place for survivors, where people can't share safely and bring their full experiences and selves to the table, then as a country, we stand to lose their voices. Those 1 in 5 American women and all other survivors of assault stand to lose the champions who truly understand what they have gone through and what they need. When survivors hold power and influence, they can fight to remove abusers from power, incorporate consent workshops into U. S. education systems, provide funding for people who’ve been assaulted, and build more shelters. There’s no limit to what they can do. But if they have to risk their lives and mental health to do it, then we won’t see the change we need. We’ll just see what we’ve always seen — abusers in power, escaping accountability.

518,Extinction Rebellion’s Liberal Moralism Can’t Save the Planet,-23.33,32.0,https://jacobinmag.com/2021/07/extinction-rebellion-liberal-moralism-green-movements-climate-crisis,https://adfontesmedia.com/jacobin-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,24,"Catapulted to media attention by its stunts, Extinction Rebellion has wasted its platform on a message of individualized guilt and obedience to the powerful. To avert climate disaster, we need economic transformation, not pointless moralism. Protesters attend a demonstration at Blackfriars Bridge, London, 2018. (Julia Hawkins / Flickr)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Ahead of the United Nations’ COP26 conference on climate change this fall, climate activists are raising the alarm for the planet’s future. Extinction Rebellion (XR) is one group sure to have an aesthetically punchy presence — bound to be followed by the usualliberal media praiseandright-wing mockeryof its stunts. XR has, in times of growth, enjoyed animpressive digital presence. Dynamic and shareable content across platforms has spread its ideas and advertised its actions. But — as I saw in my own former role as an admin on XR’s social media pages — it soon became clear from the messages coming from a minority of supporters that its politics could easily lend weight to reactionary narratives. This was intensified by the pandemic, which brought a faster pipeline from ostensibly radical liberal tendencies that spoke of “anti-politics” and “post-politics,” to a certain comfort with nativist dogmas. In the first instance, this lack of political sharpness manifested itself in XR’s call for a “depoliticization” of the climate issue, calling for a “Citizen’s Assembly” that would supposedly take the whole problem in hand. But, with the reduction of travel-related pollution during lockdowns, enthusiasm that “nature was healing” complemented more reactionary sentiments. XR social media suggested that borders should remain closed permanently, as a measure for solving the climate crisis. Similarly, when XRcame out explicitlyagainstsocialist politics, this will have surely alienated many groups working alongside it. From buzzwords like nonviolence and horizontalism, to campaigns that appear soft on the police and take a hard line against population growth, XR’s failings ultimately stem from one central problem: the absence of a strong class politics. To discover its radical energy, this green movement must become red — be clear about the causes of climate chaos and back just solutions to climate chaos that can mobilize the social majority. Extinction Rebellion has suffered a long decline. While it has always relied heavily on its social media presence, this red line on the graph below shows mentions of the group’s main account on Twitter over the course of the past twelve months. The small spike in interest in January and recent signs of life are still relatively quiet for an international movement that hasrepeatedly drawn mainstream media attention. But aside from those blips, XR is dead in terms of sustained relevance to political discourse — not least given the political positions it has taken. This partly owes to the effects of the pandemic on discussions of environmental problems. For the more bourgeois sections of climate activist milieu, COVID-19 transmission made it easier to explicitly support measures against immigration and population growth. This isn’t new. Both before and during the pandemic, British broadcaster David Attenborough has periodically intervened in mainstream media to claim that “humans have overrun the planet.” An October 2020studyby Jarrow Insights showed that the most popular online pages featuring Attenborough are articles where he is quoted as highlighting population growth as the central cause of climate catastrophe. Attenborough is also a key patron of Population Matters, a think tank which aims to combat human population growth. In its original incarnation as the Optimum Population Trust it advocated “zero migration in the UK” — as if migration to the UK is the issue that will determine the fate of humanity. The lack of an anti-imperialist analysis of the factors driving migration is, however, endemic to climate groups, from generally liberal movements like XR to the more obviously reactionary think tanks like Population Matters. These population-cutting narratives are, indeed, common in XR’s campaigning. Take, for example,this videoposted on XR’s UK Twitter account in May. It promotes a #RebellionOfOne, advocating for young women to commit to giving up plans for starting a family — that is, saving the planet by not having children. “I’m taking up a rebellion of one because I’m grieving for children that I did not conceive,” the activist summarizes. XR is fundamentally driven not by collective solidarity but by a politics of individualized sorrow and bad feeling. Instead of offering an alternative to capitalist atomization, XR reflects it back onto itself. The bourgeois climate movement is, to recycle Karl Marx’s line on religion, a “sigh of the oppressed creature”; albeit a sense of oppression mostly worked up by middle-class liberals from core capitalist nations. Predictably, XR’s media wing has facilitated those narratives, as activists shareGuardianarticles parroting think tank advocates for population decline. Yet, a 2015 briefing bysuch a mainstream institution as Oxfamfound that the “poorest half of the global population are responsible for only around 10% of global emissions yet live overwhelmingly in the countries most vulnerable to climate change — while the richest 10% of people in the world are responsible for around 50% of global emissions.”Groups like XR are keener to focus on anti-human myths than on the root cause of the climate problem; namely, capitalism’s necessity for infinite growth, production, and exploitation on a finite planet. Jeff Bezos and Elon Muskescaping to spaceis a clear opportunity to show where capitalist climate destruction leaves the elite, while workers toil in a burning planet. An honest recognition of capitalism’s centrality as the agent of climate destruction would lead to the understanding that we should either abolish it or expect extinction, rather than rely on “pragmatic” tinkering that stands “above politics.” Instead, XR offers a naive liberal utopianism,dismissing socialismout of hand while relying on short-termist fixes like theClimate and Ecological Emergency Bill. It is in critical danger of reducing environmentalism to ineffective moral protest. This is, ultimately, the cost of having a politics irrelevant to the most oppressed victims of the climate and class struggle, from London to the Global South. Tellingly, the graphs that depict Extinction Rebellion’s online traction, or lack thereof, have gathered data from a period of twelve months in which Black Lives Matter and criminal justice campaigns have been at the forefront of left-wing organizing. In the UK, arguably the central struggle of the summer has been to “Kill the Bill,” i.e. stop the Tory legislation that would hand police powers to target and criminalize protests that cause “annoyance.” The campaign has brought together trade unions, migrant rights groups, GRT (gypsy, Roma, and traveler) activists, sex workers, and even Extinction Rebellion supporters. However, in the absence of a class-based analysis that puts the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill in the wider context of neoliberal authoritarianism, fully coherent with the SpyCops Bill and anti-migrant Hostile Environment, XR has been timid once again. The group even attempted to rename the campaign to Kill the Act, in order to escape from accusations of supporting police abolition. Any such accusation would surely have rung hollow anyway, given XR’s own tendency for police cooperation. XR posters instructing activists to peacefully get arrested as a display of nonviolent resistance have led tospeculation about XR being an “op”— a covert police operation mimicking a progressive movement in order to root out activists. While one might doubt that this is literally true, the real question is whether anything would be different if it was. If XR’s actions are so blatantly counterproductive, then something deeper is clearly wrong with its approach. Activism whose strategy centers on performatively being put in handcuffs may be OK for some white middle-class people who don’t have to worry too much if they get arrested. But effective campaign strategies ought to aim higher. That would mean conscious working-class mobilization that recognizes the brutality of capitalism and its destruction of the climate, rather than wasting valuable crowdfund money subsidizing activists on a conveyor belt to the court system. In fact, discussion of XR’s relationship with the police has become toxic for its image more broadly. Nolan MacGregor, director of strategy at Jarrow Insights, said that policing “makes up a much larger share of XR-related discourse, and spikes pretty consistently whenever people are talking about XR,” adding that the organization’s “relationship with the police is one of the defining features of XR discourse.”MacGregor suggests that “most of the posts mentioning XR and the police are not supportive of XR,” and that “most of the time XR and police were mentioned together, it was to criticise XR.” Their activists “almost never liked to talk about it,” according to the social media data specialist. For MacGregor, the graph shows that “every time people start talking about XR, they start arguing about the cops. This is part of the reason why XR has lost steam. The critique of its relationship with the police has really caught on, especially since a lot of the people XR tries to appeal to — middle-class young people — have been paying very close attention to Black Lives Matter.”He says their research on XR has revealed that “they have not had a single moment where they escaped that criticism.”Further tweets from recent weeks — now deleted — have further weakened any hope of XR proving strong anti-imperialist credentials, or even being able to speak beyond its existing bubble. Migrant workers who have moved to London in response to often US-backed war and terror are hardly going to find much in common with such patronizing messaging. Dog-whistling migrants as a factor for “disease” and nonviolent activism as a “revolutionary” strategy is not just insulting, but factually incorrect. In the preface to Frantz Fanon’sThe Wretched of the Earth, Jean-Paul Sartre implores the reader to “get this into your head — if violence were only a thing of the future, if exploitation and oppression never existed on earth, perhaps displays of nonviolence might relieve the conflict. But if the entire regime, even your nonviolent thoughts, is governed by a thousand-year-old oppression, your passiveness serves no other purpose but to put you on the side of the oppressors.”As mainstream media cover the run-up to COP26, groups like XR must get it into their heads. Our wretched Earth needs class and climate organizing, not a funnel into prison for young activists. The next popular climate movement can only avoid a slow death if its politics are as red as they are green. Mark Montegriffo is a socialist writer and organizer based in London.

519,The world’s money transfer system is China’s Achilles heel in its sanctions battle against the US,-1.67,45.33,https://qz.com/1893235/swift-transfer-system-leaves-china-vulnerable-to-us-sanctions/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,25,"When the USsanctioned11 Hong Kong and Chinese officials for their roles in curtailing Hong Kongers’ freedoms, Beijing scoffed. One senior officialoffered to send $100to the US just so president Donald Trump could freeze it. China quickly reciprocated bysanctioning 11 prominent Americans. But China is actually far more vulnerable to US sanctions than it will let on, even if the sanctions are aimed at individuals and not banks. That’s because the primary system powering the world’s cross-border financial transactions between banks, Swift, is dominated by the US dollar. Known in full as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the Brussels-based Swift cooperative serves as a giant messaging network used by banks and other financial institutions to quickly and securely send information—like money transfer instructions—to each other. The network’s 11,000 members ping each othermore than 30 million times a day. According to thelatest data(pdf) from Swift, more than 40% of global transactions on its platforms are denominated in dollars. Since the bulk of dollar transactions are cleared through American banks, the US can argue that those transactions pass through US soil, thereby giving the US legal jurisdiction over them. That means the US has outsize control over the machinery of international transactions—or,as the Economist put it, “America is uniquely well positioned to use financial warfare in the service of foreign policy.”That’s why banks in Hong Kong are now wary of providing services to the 11 sanctioned Hong Kong and Chinese officials. According to local media reports, several banks have already suspended certain services, including high-speed bank transfers, to the sanctioned officials, and will also have to suspend credit cards issued by US companies like Visa and Mastercard. Meanwhile, Chinese state-owned banks are also taking steps to comply with the US sanctions, with at least one bank refusing to operate accounts for the sanctioned officials,according to Bloomberg. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has brushed off the sanctions and said she hasno US assets anyway. But she has acknowledged that the credit card curbs are an “inconvenience,” though nothing compared to the “honor” of having been endowed with the mission of safeguarding China’s national security. The police chief, Chris Tang, said the sanctions were “meaningless” to him, adding that protecting national security was his duty and honor. Tang did, however, move his residential mortgage from London-headquartered HSBC to the Bank of China just three days before the sanctions hit,according to local news outlet HK01. Separately, thepolice credit unionlast week moved HK$11 billion ($1.4 billion) in assets from foreign banks to China-based institutions. Though Swift describes itself as a “neutral utility” with no authority to make or enforce sanctions decisions, even banks without branches in the US will have vested interests in complying with US sanctions, lest they risk losing crucial access to dollar funding. As law firm Allen & Overyexplains in a note, “global banks with no US banking license may still be exposed to enforcement actions by US civil and criminal authorities… if there is a sufficient US nexus that may be as minimal as dollar payments cleared through the United States.”China is under no illusions about vulnerable exposures to the dollar-dominated global payments system. Just last month, the Bank of China published a report urging Chinese banks toswitch away from from Swift. “A good punch to the enemy will save yourself from hundreds of punches from your enemies,” the report noted. To wean itself off of dollar dependence, China launched its own yuan-denominated clearing and settlement system, called theCross-border Interbank Payment System(CIPS), in 2015. Though CIPS has grown rapidly in the years since,it remains tiny. Only 980 financial institutions have used the service, less than a tenth of the number using Swift. And it processes a mere $19.4 billion a day, compared to up to $6 trillion a day on Swift. Russia, India, and China are looking intobuilding a Swift alternative, but that plan is in its infancy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong,the source of much ofChina’s foreign direct investment, processes US dollar settlementson Swift(pdf).“[W]ere China to have its own cross-border clearing system that operated independently of Swift and US banks, then it would be less vulnerable to US sanctions,” said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at University of California, Berkeley, who studies global currencies. But an internationalized yuan with enough clout to displace the dollar’s dominance doesn’t look likely to materialize anytime soon. Until then, China will be nowhere close to being an equal sparring partner in its sanctions battle against the US.

520,The 2020 Election Result Completely Discredits The Democratic Leadership,-22.67,33.83,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/11/the-2020-election-result-completely-discredits-the-democratic-leadership,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"As of the time of this writing, Joe Biden has a lead in enough states that, if present trends hold, he will narrowly win the presidency. This would be a huge relief, because Donald Trump is amonstrosityand four more years of his authoritarian leadershipwould bean utter disaster for workers, immigrants, and the climate. I would be hugely relieved if Joe Biden became president,not because I think his presidency will in any way be goodbut because it averts the worst possible catastrophe. But even assuming Biden is sworn into office, Election Night 2020 was a rude awakening for Democrats, because many of them were hoping to see Donald Trump resoundingly repudiated by the electorate. This did not happen. Turnout massively increased in this election (a greater percentage of eligible voters turned out than in any electionsince 1900), but this was not because the public rose up in unison to defeat Donald Trump. In fact, millions who didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 voted for him this time. Biden actually appears to have done faramong certain constituencies than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Some heavily Hispanic parts of South Texas that broke overwhelmingly for Clinton split far more evenlybetween Biden and Trump. Trump managed tomake inroads among voters of colorthat I am certain the Biden campaign never thought was possible. The fact that this election is so close is a serious indictment of the Democratic Party leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead from a pandemic that the Trump administration has handled with the grossest incompetence. My colleague Eli Masseysums things upaccurately:If Joe Biden couldn’t thrash Trump under these circumstances, God only knows how he could have won if COVID-19 hadn’t happened. Trump has been an abysmal president. His approach to climate change threatens the lives of countless human beings. The case against him should be open-and-shut. Yet the Democratic Party lost to him once and has come close to doing it again. How?I have already seen some Democrats on social media blaming the voters. Americans just must be more irredeemably stupid and racist than we thought. I do not think this attitude is correct or helpful. Why are the native Spanish speakers of Miami and South Texas less enthusiastic about Biden than they were about Hillary? Do we simply blame them for “not knowing their own self-interest”?The answer to what is going on is not actually mysterious. The left has been saying it over and over ad nauseum: the Democrats have failed to offer a compelling alternative. Joe Biden has been an uninspiring corrupt corporate candidate. He’s been, incredibly, less politically competent than Hillary Clinton. He opposes policies that are hugely popular with voters. He’s been unable to generate enthusiasm—we rightly criticized Trump for holding giant rallies in the middle of a pandemic, but we also know Trump is right that Biden couldn’t hold giant rallies even if he was willing to pay people to come. Democrats have taken voters of color for granted. We know this. My colleague Malaika Jabali, in “The Color of Economic Anxiety,” documented how Black voters in Wisconsin felt completely unseen and unheard by the Democratic Party. My colleague Briahna Joy Gray has spent the entire election cycle warning that Joe Biden was treating voters of color like they wereobligated to vote for him. The Biden campaign’s outreach to Latino voters was infamously abysmal, sometimes not even rising to the level of being patronizing. It was just lazy and insulting, such as Biden pulling out his iPhone andplaying the song “Despacito” for 15 seconds. There were reports that his campaign didn’t even consider these voters “part of the path to victory” and therewere warnings before the electionthat this was going to cause problems:Politicoreports. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee “in spite of, not because of” his Latino outreach,Politicowrites, but more than 20 Latino political operatives say his luck may not hold in the general election. Indeed, it did not hold, because it turns out you need more than luck. You also need hard work, and there was little sign throughout the campaign that Biden’s team was actually putting in the work necessary to resoundingly defeat Trump. The Biden campaign seemed to be coasting on a sense of self-assurance, convinced that Donald Trump couldn’t possibly be reelected. Some of us were horrified when we realized how little campaigning Biden was actually doing; there was a period where Trump’s campaign was knocking on a million doors a week and Biden’s was knocking on zero. The Biden campaign’s messaging was all over the place. He completely screwed up the first presidential debate, sounding weak and incoherent. As with Clinton, there was no clear set of things that Biden was telling voters he would actuallyfor them. I do not know if anyone could name Biden’s signature promises, beyond “not banning fracking,” “not passing the Green New Deal,” and “not wanting Medicare for All.” These points he hammered consistently. Trump did not do well either in that first debate (both improved in the second debate) and it was notable how bad Trump’s own campaign was. His messaging was incoherent (was Joe Biden an Antifa-loving socialist or a corrupt Washington elite?) and hewasted giant piles of his campaign cash. He lost the powerful populist rhetoric that swept him into office in the first place, in favor of attacks on Biden’s ne’er-do-well son Hunter, a strange issue to choose for an electorate focused on the pandemic and the economy. Trump made serious missteps and often seemed desperate. Defeating him should have been a cakewalk. It was truly shocking to see many Democrats learn absolutely nothing from 2016. I tend to be politically cynical, but to seeof the lessons learned was remarkable. The central points that I and others on the left have been emphasizing over and over since that election were:This last point should have been one of the absolutely central lessons from 2016, an election in which Trump outperformed his polls and shocked the nation. But, incredibly, thecomplacency of 2016returned in 2020. I was rather shocked myself, because I thought we had all learned thatpolls canunderestimate Trump’s support, since many Trump voters don’t like to admit they’re Trump voters (and some are QAnoners who probably think pollsters are part of the socialist globalist pedophile-cannibal ring). I spent monthsarguingwith people who insisted that the polls had been “fixed” since 2016 and the same thing that happened once could not happen twice. I even heard this from leftists skeptical of Biden, and I suspect that there was a certain “wishful thinking” bias creeping in. Nobody on the left wanted to have to actually work to get Biden elected, because he was transparently awful, so there was an inclination not to question polls showing Biden with a comfortable lead. The polls were not reliable, just as they were not reliable in 2016. Dave Wasserman of thesays they have “rarely led us more astray.”FiveThirtyEight’s final Florida average, for instance, put Biden ahead in the state by 2.5 points. As of right now, Trump is winning the state by 3.4 points. The site put Trump ahead in Texas by 1.1 according to the polls, but he’s winning right now by 6.1. In Ohio, Trump was ahead in the polls by 0.8, but he’s winning by 8 points. Though it appears Biden will win, pollsactually led to predictions of a “Biden landslide,” and it’s obvious that this was not only a complete mirage, but hugely irresponsible to even discuss. When people falsely assumed Biden was this far ahead, they could wrongly assume that the Democrats had everything under control and all the average person needed to do was keep scrolling Twitter and checking to make sure everything was still in hand. I have warned people beforenot to ever listen to polling pundit Nate Silver, and this election showed exactly why. He offered people the reassuring observation that for Trump to win would require a serious polling error of the kind unlikely to occur. Well, a serious polling error did occur, and though it may not have beenenough to give Trump the win, it is obvious that these sorts of statements from people like Silver put the country at risk by downplaying the possibility of Trump seriously outperforming expectations. Silver, as I noted in my analysis, is always careful to hedge by saying that he’s only commenting on what isprobable, but this actually shows why his work is extremely unhelpful. He predicts that anything could happen (even a big polling error), so that whatever happens, he can say “I predicted that.” Indeed, when I asked him if a Trump victory would mean his analysis was useless, he told me that it wouldn’t, because a Trump victory was one of the set of things he said could happen. This means that he has carefully made sure he never issues a “falsifiable” prediction. But it also means that taking his probabilities as meaningful commentaries on reality is very, very dangerous. The best approach to an election you want to win is to assume you’re likely to lose and do whatever it would take to reverse that outcome. Let’s be very clear: the Democratic Party screwed this election up massively. Trumpactually did better than he did in 2016in areas with high COVID-19 deaths. Union members in Ohioappearto have gone for Trump, and most of the people who saw the economy as the top issuevoted for Trump, even though this should theoretically be the issue on which the Democratic Party is strongest. Now, Democrats are not going to take the Senate. The candidate that the leadershiphand-picked to run againstMitch McConnell (instead of progressiveCharles Booker) got crushed. Themassive amountthat was spent to defeat Lindsey Graham went nowhere, predictably. The Democratssquandered money on pitifully unpersuasive messagesin races that they should have been able to win. Theyfailedto flip Republican target seats in the House and even lost important seats. Even though a popular progressive policy, the$15 minimum wage, attracted overwhelming support in Florida, the Democratic candidate did not. The fact that there were many voters in Florida who voted for both Donald Trump and a $15 minimum wage should be a puzzle for the Democratic leadership. Why do they support a candidate who opposes the very thing they seem to support? Fox Newsrecently publishedresults of polls of voters confirming that large numbers support government-run healthcare, restrictions on gun rights, the preservation of abortion rights, and a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. How, then, could Donald Trump, a person who is doing exactly the opposite on all of these issues, come so close to winning reelection?There is nothing surprising here, however, to anyone who has read, say,Thomas Frank’s, or who was paying attention to Michael Moore’s warning in 2016that Trump would win. (Current Affairsalsoexpressed its concern.)Current Affairscontributing cartoonistMatt Lubchanskyputs it well when they say “if I were the opposition party candidate or candidates I would simply espouse policies with broad-based support that improve people’s material conditions in clear and accessible language.” That’s exactly what hasn’t happened, and heads need to roll in the party over this. Pelosi, Schumer,Tom Perez: these people need ousting. They have failed. It makes me terribly sad to think about how differently this could have gone. We had a candidate, Bernie Sanders, who wasuniquely well-positionedto counter Trump’s messaging. But as my colleague Luke Savageputs it, “Democratic elites expended more energy, conviction, and zeal to defeat Bernie Sanders, his movement, and Medicare For All than they did to defeat Donald Trump.” Sanders had a formidable organizing apparatus, an agenda designed to address ordinary working people’s basic material concerns, and even aproven effective Latino outreach strategy. I, andother writers for this magazine, have spent the past four years warning that not only are candidates like Biden going to tank the Democratic Party’s long-term electoral prospects, butthe leftthat can plausibly restore Democratic political fortunes. As Joe Biden (potentially) flounders and staggers across the finish line and centrist Democrats lost house seats, a reported26 out of 30 nationally-endorsed Democratic Socialists of America candidates won their races. DSA candidates tend to win inunexpected placesbecause they put in the work and have a message designed to appeal to a broad base of voters. (“If we win, you won’t have to worry about money when you need to go to the doctor” is an argument that people can be enthusiastic about making on the doorstep, as compared with “If we win, the parasitic private insurance industry will be preserved but we will make several important tweaks to Obamacare.”)There is anargument madethat the left cannot win because being called a “socialist” hurts Democratic candidates, with Joe Biden having been wounded by this attack. But I think that misunderstands the problem. Being called a socialist does hurt, if you acknowledge that being a socialist is bad and are put on the defensive about it. But every Democrat is hit with this attack, even if they are obviouslya socialist (which Biden clearly isn’t). The best approach is not to try to meekly insist that the socialist charge is a lie, but to lean into it, to say “What of it?” and to explain why the socialist agenda is reasonable and moderate. If you think that can’t be done, just have a look at Bernie talking to Trump voters orspeaking at a Fox News town hall. He doesn’t run away from the label, he explains what it means to him, and then the audience ends up going “hm, that actually sounds pretty reasonable.” At the debates this cycle, Biden and Harris’ worst moments were when they defensively insisted that they didnotsupport the job-killing Green New Deal. They would have done much better if they’d replied: of course I support the Green New Deal, because itcreatesjobs, and if you don’t understand that, you’re an idiot. Instead of asking me to disown the Green New Deal, why don’t we ask why the Republicans are content to let the planet burn? Democratic defensiveness makes it seem as if they’re shifty, and looks like an acknowledgment that Republicans are right that socialism and the Green New Deal are bad. Disowning socialism makes you look weak. Embracing it makes you look cool and tough. I do not want to dwell too much in the counterfactual fantasy of a Bernie-Trump race, but it does need to be emphasized that Joe Biden’s failure to effectively fight Trump—a man whose closing argument to the country was a video of himdancing to the YMCA—shows the urgent need for something fresh, new, and real. No more pretending that candidates we all know are bad are actually secretly competent and have a plan. No more pretending that “I’ll cancel a certain amount of student debt for people who run a business for three years in a disadvantaged community” is a serious plan to deal with the student debt crisis. No morelofty words covering up detestable deeds. People can see through that crap, and they’re tired of it. There is no mandate for centrist politics in this country. No flood of Republicans is going to defect from Trump to support Biden if Biden just pledges his love of fracking enough times. Assuming Biden staggers over the finish line, we have got to spend the next several years building a very different Democratic Party, in order to avoid some horrible neo-fascist like Tom Cotton or Dan Crenshaw taking the presidency in 2024. Biden will likely do very little, and will be relatively unpopular from the moment he takes office. The Republican senate will obstruct him, and he will use them as an excuse to avoid doing even the limited number of things we might reasonably have hoped for from him. It may be a sort of non-presidency, and that is alarming in some ways and advantageous in others. It is alarming because we urgently need action to be taken on climate change, and Biden is likely going to sit uselessly twiddling his thumbs, growing steadily more unpopular and reminding the country why they don’t like the Democratic Party. It is advantageous because it gives us a few years to try to build an authentic left alternative and fill the leadership vacuum. These are going to be critical years for the left. We must build institutional power. We have to pressure the Biden administration in every way we can. We need to unionize as many workplaces as possible. Everyone who cares about the future of the country should be a dues-payingDSA member. Strong independent media organizations that can combat right-wing lies and present left arguments compellingly to a mass audience need to be built and buttressed. (Organizations likeand this magazine are doing our best to fill this need and could really use yoursupportin these coming years.) We will not have much time: the 2020 map shows us that the Biden presidency is doomed if the right regroups, because even if Trump is voted out, “Trumpism” is alive and well and has mass appeal. The Democratic Party establishment fundamentally does not know what it is doing. This was proved definitively in 2016. This year, what we have learned is that is not only incompetent, it is also unteachable. It will not get better, not even in response to this calamity. If it’s up to the people currently in charge of the party it’d be Harris/Buttigiegin 2024. Nothing will change unlesschange it, which it is now our responsibility to do. A Biden presidency is a relief, but only a small one. It is also a burden, because it means that we must now act fast to totally change the party, before it is too late. There can be no relaxing and “going back to brunch.” Our work is cut out for us.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0649994171550294,0.5317486330751637,3962,2,Current Affairs

Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Research Center shows a total of 91,530 total confirmed cases on Election Day, including 1,130 deaths. Additionally, there were more than 50,000 hospitalizations on Tuesday, according to separate data compiled by The COVID Tracking Project, an effort launched bymagazine. More than 20 states have announced more new COVID-19 cases in the past week than in any other seven-day period, with states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — three states that play a major role in the presidential contest — setting single-day records on Tuesday. The pandemic continues to affect the U. S. sporting world on all levels. The athletic department at the University of Wisconsin announced Tuesday that its football team, one of the country’s top programs, is cancelling its scheduled game against Purdue University this Saturday due to an ongoing surge of coronavirus cases among the team’s players and coaching staff, including head coach Paul Chryst. This is the second consecutive cancellation for the Badgers after calling off last Saturday’s contest against Nebraska. The United States leads the world with more than 9.3 million of the world’s 47.4 million total COVID-19 infections, including 232,627 deaths. France also reached another grim milestone Tuesday, as it recorded 854 new COVID-19 deaths, its highest increase since mid-April, according to Reuters news service. India, second only to the United States in the number of total COVID-19 infections with more than 8.3 million , appears to have turned a corner in its battle against the pandemic. The health authority recorded more than 46,000 new infections over the past 24 hours ending Wednesday, the tenth consecutive day the South Asian nation has posted fewer than 50,000 new cases. But New Delhi reported more than 6,700 new cases Tuesday, the highest single-day rise for the Indian capital city. The situation is also improving in Australia, as Premier Gladys Berejiklian of New South Wales state announced Wednesday on Twitter that the border between New South Wales and the southern state of Victoria will reopen on November 23. The border has been shut down since July, when a second wave of COVID-19 cases swept across Victoria and its biggest city, Melbourne, which peaked at more than 700 new cases a day and 819 of the nation’s 907 total deaths. The surge led state authorities to impose a strict lockdown of the city and its 5 million residents that was finally lifted last week.

522,Floridians are voting for special school taxes. Are lawmakers paying attention?,-1.33,48.0,https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/elections/2020/11/04/floridians-are-voting-for-special-school-taxes-are-lawmakers-paying-attention/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tampa-bay-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,21,"Pinellas County voters smashed all expectations Tuesday with their 80 percent support of their school district’s property tax referendum. A similar scenario played out across the state. Alachua County received 79 percent backing for its school sales tax ballot question. About two-thirds of residents backed a Hernando County school property tax increase, and school sales taxes in Duval, Brevard, Santa Rosa and Charlotte counties. Clay and Okaloosa county voters authorized higher sales tax collections to help pay for school construction and maintenance projects, as well. Only in Liberty County did voters defeat a proposed school sales tax initiative, with 50.27 percent opposed. Add to those the 21 successful ballot initiatives that districts won in 2018, and the trend becomes clear.“The wave of local referendums since (they were authorized in law) demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that the people of Florida want higher funding for the education system,” said Beth Rawlins, a consultant who has spearheaded Pinellas County’s effort since 2004, when it was the second such vote in the state. But the idea that voters may boost revenue for their local schools has raised questions about whether that jibes with Florida’s decades-old financing rules, devised in the face of lawsuits across the nation that accused states of not spending public education money equitably. The Florida Education Finance Program aimed to equalize per-student funding among school districts regardless of wealth and size. It essentially allowed the Legislature to establish a “required local effort” for district property tax rates, then collect and reallocate the revenue in a way that would allow a place like Hendry County, population 42,000, to operate schools similarly to a large county like Palm Beach. As districts find themselves stretched for resources, though, they aren’t necessarily able to react in the same way with referendums. In recent years, that’s become more evident. The state reduced the money it sends to districts for school construction needs, for instance. It also pushed to increase the minimum teacher pay to $47,000 but didn’t allocate enough money to ensure that happened in all districts.“We’re not getting enough money from the state. That’s the bottom line,” said Olga Swinson, Pasco County schools chief finance officer and a past chairwoman of the Florida School Finance Council. “The only way for us to have that money is to have these tax referendums.”It can create a system of haves and have-nots among districts, Swinson observed. Consider the teacher salary issue. Pinellas easily met the $47,500minimum and offered everyone else a 3.45 percent raise, all because of its referendum revenue. Pasco, which has no local-option property tax, fell short of that mark and scraped enough together to offer raises of less than 1.5 percent to others. Of course, Pasco, which already successfully uses a local-option sales tax to cover capital needs, has the wherewithal to call another referendum if it wished. With a growing property base, it could generate significant amounts of money. Other less well-off districts might not have that choice, said Andrea Messina, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association. Some districts are property poor, while others have less personal wealth. Each situation means that, even were they to pass a referendum, the amount they generated could be less per person, or they’d have to ask for more per person to reach an equitable level. That’s if they can get the word out.“Part of the problem is, getting a referendum passed, you have to have enough money to have a campaign to explain the reasons,” Messina said. “Just to educate the community on the needs requires a level of funding that many districts don’t have. ... It is a real concern.”Two political action committees backed Duval County’s sales tax initiative, for instance, raising a combined $1.7 million on the successful measure, according to theFlorida Times-Union. In 2018, the Palm Beach County School Board spent nearly $400,000 to hire a consultant for its property tax ballot question, which passed. Other districts haven’t raised that kind of money to promote their referendums. But it points to the type of effort needed to make sure the public has adequate information to make a decision. Several lawmakers have taken the position that they’ve sufficiently budgeted to support Florida’s public education system. They’ve stated that districts should streamline their spending if necessary, but if local communities want more, that’s what the referendum process is for.“That’s what the districts are doing,” Swinson said. Those votes are sending a clear signal, added Rawlins, the Pinellas consultant.“I think that over time the Legislature should get the message that this is clearly what their constituents want and it is firmly in the wheelhouse of their job,” she said. “They ought to be genuinely working to provide more funding for all our school systems ... instead of passing the buck. I think there’s a big lesson in this.”ELECTION RESULTS — FLORIDA AND TAMPA BAY:See all races,statewide and in Hillsborough, Pinellas and other Tampa Bay counties.

523,Media Disappointed as Fauci Paints a Modest Image of Trump,18.67,29.0,https://www.libertynation.com/media-disappointed-as-fauci-paints-a-modest-image-of-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,18,"In a recent interview with, Dr. Anthony Fauci sat down once more with the media to give one of his first major interviews since Donald Trump’s departure from the White House. The intent behind this sudden interview was clear; the media giant wanted to get the inside scoop from Dr. Fauci himself on the Trump administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic without the supposed political pressure they claimed the former president had placed on him. Fauci himself is not safe fromcontroversy. Both the left and right, at different points, have questioned his back-and-forth opinions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, Fauci has been treated like a celebrity for his outspoken and prominent advice that often seemed at odds with Trump’s rhetoric. Since Trump’s departure, the media appeared to be eagerly waiting for the first interview with Fauci, expecting a bombshell condemnation of Trump’s response to the pandemic. Reality proved just the opposite. Fauci’s interview with thecertainly proved interesting and informative on his role in the Trump administration. Unfortunately for liberals throughout the country, their hopes for an attack on Trump’s COVID-19 record did not come to fruition. The infectious disease expert summed up the perceived differences between himself and Trump as a case of simple miscommunication. Throughout the interview, Fauci repeatedly mentioned Trump’s intention to put a positive spin on almost all the information from his advisors. Interestingly, Fauci seemed to blame Trump’s circle of advisors that appeared to resent the more negative but realistic outlook on the COVID-19 pandemic he and White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Brix usually shared. Fauci ultimately seemed to blame the overly optimistic views of then-President Trump on his coronavirus task force members. Throughout the interview, Fauci repeatedly stated that Trump appeared to take his advice to heart when speaking with him one-on-one, but that the then-president’s statements would usually completely turn around upon speaking with other advisors. To be clear, Fauci’s words should not be taken as gospel. Since the beginning of the pandemic, hisdefeatistattitude has dominated the media cycle. Despite this fact, his answers gave credit to Dr. Birx’s recent statements to the media that the president was receiving competing data from sources outside of herself and Dr. Fauci, leading to a façade of conflict within the task force adopted by the media. Infamous clips showing Dr. Fauci disagreeing with statements the president had just made were summed up as Fauci’s way of presenting the facts in a manner that was not meant to be confrontational to the president but to provide his own views on the pandemic. By the end of the interview, Fauci had discredited countless media reports about his friction with Trump. He continued to insist that the president merely “expressed disappointment” with Fauci’s opinions and statements. Fauci even praised Trump’s lack of personal confrontation with him, debunked media reports encouraged by the interviewer, and refused to answer a leading question about Donald Trump’s responsibility for the loss of life in the pandemic. The Fauci bombshell interview was anything but damning, providing no political ammunition for the liberals who have treated Dr. Fauci as the second coming of Christ in their crusade against Trump. To his credit, Fauci refrained from making the interview political or espousing anti-Trump rhetoric after the president’s departure, as some of the 45th president’s allies and staff have done. Even now, Dr. Fauci has come outstronglyagainst liberal advocates refusing to admit that schools should reopen, possibly further souring his reputation with an anti-Trump coalition opposed to a gradual return to normal life. The Biden administration is currently split on deciding whether to advocate a return to in-person schooling or not. Dr. Fauci will quickly prove to be a more positive voice for returning to education that the progressive left has been firmly against for months. After all this time, Dr. Fauci’s relationship with Donald Trump has been uncovered, and bereft of the drama the left so desperately desired as another potential slurring of the former president’s legacy.

525,"From homelessness to homicides, Garcetti leaves L.A. with unfinished business",-15.0,38.67,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-10/mayor-eric-garcetti-departure-leaves-unfinished-business,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"For Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, there is so much unfinished business. Homeless encampments have taken holdthroughout the city, even though hundreds of millions of dollars have gone toward shelter and low-income housing. Transit ridership has beendeclining for years, despite billions of dollars devoted to new rail construction. And while city leaders are looking torework the dutiesof the Los Angeles Police Department, moving away from armed responses to certain calls, they’re also contending with a surge in homicides andgun violence. The person who succeeds Garcetti as mayor will have to confront those issues and decide whether to embrace the departing mayor’s current agenda or chart a different course. Given public dissatisfaction with homelessness, crime and public transit in the city right now, it’s almost certain that several candidates who run for mayor in June 2022 will promise change, said political consultant Dermot Givens. In the short term, any interim replacement for Garcetti will be less likely to rock the boat, Givens said. “To get appointed by the council, they would have to promise ... they’re not going to make waves, or create any interference for the upcoming campaign.”President Biden announcedFridaythat he had tapped Garcetti to serve as the U. S. ambassador to India, a position that requires U. S. Senate confirmation. How much more Garcetti could have accomplished over the next 18 months, when his term is scheduled to end, is a subject of debate. Garcetti allies say his biggest initiatives — expanding the county’s transit system, transitioning away from fossil fuels and building permanent housing for homeless Angelenos — were always going to take several years to execute, going well beyond his two terms in office. They also argue that key pieces of his agenda are already completed, such as increases to L. A.’s minimum wage and the recent renegotiation of city employee contracts, which significantly cut costs. Whether Garcetti’s work is viewed as finished or unfinished, a new mayor could chart a sharply different course, replacing his department heads, choosing a different crop of volunteer city commissioners and pursuing different strategies for addressing the city’s biggest problems. Garcetti’s replacement also could have a different take on the role of city government. Although he spoke frequently during his tenure about taking City Hall “back to basics,” Garcetti pushed city agencies out of their comfort zone during the COVID-19 pandemic, assigning them duties that were not part of their core mission. The mayor openedfree COVID-19 testing sites, even though county government — not City Hall — is responsible for public health. He had librarians and other city employees serve ascontact tracers. And he helped turn some of L. A.’s most recognizable spots, including Dodger Stadium, into majorvaccination sites.“It will be interesting to see whether an interim mayor will be as willing to draw outside the lines as Garcetti has been,” said sociology and American studies professor Manuel Pastor, who directs theEquity Research Instituteat USC. As Los Angeles emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, its most pressing issue by far is homelessness. The humanitarian crisis has sparked public calls for action that are frequently in conflict, with some demanding the removal of tents from parks and sidewalks and others insisting that encampments remain until permanent housing is available for those who need it. Garcetti pledged nearly $1 billion for homelessness initiatives in his budget, with Gov. Gavin Newsom calling for billions more statewide. That money could make this the most critical moment for homelessness in Los Angeles in nearly 40 years, said Gary Blasi, professor emeritus of law at UCLA. Blasi fears that much of those funds could be spent on temporary measures to make homeless encampments less visible, while failing to address the root of the problem. “This is a time of tremendous potential that could easily be squandered chasing short-term political gain,” he said. Over the past year, Garcetti has attended ribbon-cuttings for new shelters, “tiny home” projects and affordable housing built with funding from Proposition HHH, the $1.2-billion bond measure he endorsed in 2016. He also has been grappling with a federal judge’s recent order toget people off skid row,which is nowon appeal. Judge David O. Carter has chided Garcetti for concentrating HHH funds so heavily on permanent housing with social services, which has been expensive and slow to build. That criticism has cast “a pall of uncertainty” over the city’s strategy for combating the crisis, said Alan Greenlee, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Nonprofit Housing, which represents developers of affordable housing.“The debate is turning into this zero-sum game” between housing and immediate shelter, Greenlee said. “We have to do both.”By August, city officials expect to have opened more than 6,400 beds for homeless people — motel rooms, overnight parking and other facilities — over a 14-month period. Meanwhile, housing advocates have begun strategizing about what happens when the city runs out of HHH money, which will only serve a fraction of the city’s homeless population. One idea being discussed is a new voter-approved tax, said Tommy Newman, vice president at the United Way of Greater L. A. The next mayor will have to decide whether to support such a strategy, Newman said, and look for ways of building permanent homeless housing that are less expensive.“It’s the right time to have a debate: Do we keep investing in affordable-housing creation the way we’ve been doing it? Or do we find new ways of reducing costs and building it faster?”Garcetti also has been facing questions about the future of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, where he served repeatedly as chairman and controls four of the board’s 13 seats. Metro is in the middle of a construction boom, building new rail lines in downtown Los Angeles, on the Westside and elsewhere, paid for in part by Measure M, the transportation tax Garcetti championed in 2016. Yet Metro is also struggling with declining ridership. The agency saw weekday boardings on its buses and trains drop from 1.5 million in September 2013 — not long after Garcetti was sworn in as mayor — to 1.2 million in September 2019, according to Metro’s figures. By September 2020, six months into the city’s COVID-19 shutdowns, weekday boardings had fallen again by half, below 600,000. Metro is nowattempting to rebuild. With passengers starting to return, the next mayor will need to figure out how much of L. A.’s workforce intends to work from home permanently, said Richard Katz, who spent eight years on Metro’s board. The answer, he said, could scramble passenger demand and complicate the effort to rebuild ridership.“You’ve got to look at the impact on light rail,” he said. “You’ve got to look at the impact on long-distance commuting.”Garcetti has championed efforts to providefree faresfor children, college students and seniors, which could potentially boost ridership but also take a bite out of the agency’s budget. At the same time, transit activists are arguing that the entire Metro system should be free to all passengers. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Metro bus passengers have not had to pay. But that could change in the coming months. While Metro is grappling with whether to go fare-free, the Los Angeles Police Department is facing far more urgent demands for change in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. Last year, Garcetti and the council responded to massive protests over Floyd’s killing by cutting the LAPD’s budget, reducing the size of the force and promising new measures to take some assignments out of the hands of police. Garcetti has embraced a pilot program to send social workers, not police officers, to nonviolent mental health emergency calls. Meanwhile, city agencies arepreparing to studystrategies for moving traffic assignments out of the LAPD, possibly by handing them to civilian city workers, such as parking enforcement officers. Taking traffic enforcement away from the LAPD would reduce the number of traffic stops that end in police violence, said Chauncee Smith, who manages theRace Countsinitiative for the nonprofit civil rights groupAdvancement Project California. Such a move would also decrease the number of racial profiling incidents involving Black and Latino motorists, he said.“Whether the mayor is Garcetti or some other person,” Smith said, “there is an urgent need ... to explore alternative models of traffic safety.”But while grassroots activists have been urging city leaders to scale back the LAPD’s duties, others have been voicing alarm over rising gun violence. As of July 3, homicides were up nearly 41% compared to the same period in 2019 — the last full year without COVID-19, according toLAPD statistics. The number of shooting victims was up nearly 40% over the same timeframe. Jorja Leap, adjunct professor at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, said she fears the surge in gun violence could spark a public backlash against community policing programs and partnerships with gang intervention workers.“What terrifies me is that people will say, ‘Crime is increasing, we’ve got to stop this,’” she said. “And they’ll go back to the bad old days of command-and-control policing.”The next mayor, interim or otherwise, will face calls to rethink city spending priorities and invest more heavily in marginalized neighborhoods. Shifting prioritiesThe city’s newest budget sets aside $35 million to keep Angelenos from slipping into homelessness and even more for a citywide guaranteed-income pilot program, which will aid families on the brink of poverty, according to the mayor. Those investments were largely made possible by a windfall of pandemic relief from the federal government, which runs out next year. The next mayor will have to decide whether to keep those programs going and, if so, how to pay for them without that federal money, said Hamid Khan, coordinator for the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition. Khan’s group has long called for big cuts to the LAPD, with the proceeds going toward housing, child care and other social services. “Exactly what are the priorities of the city?” he asked. “Does the city want to keep being a police state and police their way out of all these problems?”Former City Councilman Mike Hernandez believes a shift in priorities is already underway, with the city’s elected leaders putting more money into aid to immigrants, working-class renters and those who are homeless. The mayor and council, he said, are confronting “the reality that we’re a majority-minority city.”“We’re trying to basically create environments that are welcoming to everybody,” he said. “And it’s going to cost a lot of money.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.0693786605551311,0.3848628087598676,2375,3,LA Times

As a result, I write about him more than most police chiefs in the country. Considering this is the same country with Portland and Chicago, that’s actually saying something kind of impressive. However, I also believe in giving credit where credit is due. Every now and then, a blind squirrel finds a nut or what have you and this time, it was Acevado who found it. In particular,he touches on a stark realityon why Democrats failed to flip Texas despite all the money spent on doing just that. Houston police chief Art Acevedo, who was previously the police chief in Austin, offered some ideas on Twitter for why Texas wasn’t won over by Democrats this time. In response to a statement about there being more Republicans than Democrats in Texas, Acevedo wrote: “Texas Democrats can thank ‘socialist democrats and defund the police crowd’ led by@GregCasar,@JimmyFlanniganand the rest of the AustinCity Council. Fact, Americans and Texans want better policing, not de-policing, and they don’t want anything to do with any form of socialism.”Texas Democrats can thank “socialist democrats and defund the police crowd” led by@GregCasar,@JimmyFlanniganand the rest of the AustinCity Council. Fact, Americans and Texans want better policing, not de-policing, and they don’t want anything to do with any form of socialism.— Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo)November 4, 2020Come ride with me in a marked police car and we can ask folks.— Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo)November 4, 2020Acevedo is not a conservative or a Trump supporter. On the contrary, he made news back in June when he appeared on CNN andtold the presidentto, basically, shut up about how to deal with protesters. And last year, Jazz wrote about Acevedogoing on a gun control rantafter four of his officers were shot. He definitely leans left and would probably be happy to see Texas turn blue. But even he considers Austin’s socialist city council members a bridge too far for Texas. And that’s not an exaggeration in this case. If you’re not familiar with Greg Casar, who Acevedo mentioned in his tweet, he’s a Democratic Socialist on the Austin City Council:It’s important we remember that there are divisions in the liberal ranks. The only thing they all agree on is how much they despise President Trump. That includes some like Acevedo who lean fairly far to the left but still aren’t going to support outright socialism and damn sure don’t want to see their police defunded. That might work in New York, California, or Massachusetts, but it’s never going to fly in Texas. Now, there are a lot of people who look at Texas as being more conservative and pro-gun than Texas really is. Oh, it’s both of those things, but there are states that are much more conservative and much more pro-gun. Despite that, though, Texas has a reputation. Another part of that reputation is a love of law and order. They like their lawmen there. Lawmen are part of the mystique of the Old West, a mystique that Texas has embraced completely. Defunding the police is never going to fly there. Of course, that’s not to say that Democrats would have fared any better without socialism or “defund the police” rhetoric. I’m not convinced that would have made a lot of difference, but it certainly wouldn’t have hurt their chances to at least appeal to more moderate centrist independents. Not that it matters, though.

It comes after a study found that global carbon emissions from using fossil fuels fell by a record amount in 2020 as a result of lockdowns around the world. But researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA), University of Exeter and the Global Carbon Project say emissions are expected to rise again in 2021 because the fall was so large this year. They warned that greener measures are needed as economies recover - including encouraging cycling, walking and electric cars in the UK in a bid to deliver the annual emissions cuts required to curb climate change. Lead researcher Professor Pierre Friedlingstein, of the University of Exeter, said we have a ""unique opportunity"" to make long-lasting change. He said: ""We are in a unique position now, not only because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but because of pre-existing climate policies, new green deals and net zero commitments.""Countries responsible for 50% to 60% of global emissions are committed to net zero, and there will be large economic stimuluses being produced. Greta Thunberg cleared of public order offence after judge throws out chargeLabour's Reeves won't commit to £28bn pledge - after being asked 10 timesGreta Thunberg: Activist got 'final warning' to move before arrest at London protest, trial hears""All of this combined is a unique opportunity to actually tackle and break the long-term emissions in carbon dioxide and therefore climate change.""There's hope, but of course, action needs to be taken and followed.""The analysis showed that the UK saw one of the biggest drops in emissions at 13% because of major reductions in transport - the largest source of climate pollution for the country - and was hit by two waves of government measures. Emissions from industry could already be up to or above 2019 levels, however, and stimulus efforts by world governments have focused on existing sectors rather than new green technology and measures - though the UK is among those doing better on that front. Sustained cuts of one to two billion tonnes in annual carbon dioxide emissions are required every year this decade to limit temperature rises, the researchers warn. Professor Corinne Le Quere, from UEA, said: ""All elements are not yet in place for sustained decreases in global emission, and emissions are slowly edging back to 2019 levels.""Government actions to stimulate the economy at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic can also help lower emissions and tackle climate change.""She added that action on transport in the UK would help limit the increase in emissions in the coming years.""Stopping the rebound now would have to be done with encouraging walking and cycling and electric bikes if you want to do it quickly by 2021, and longer-term, it's about electric mobility,"" she said. Transport made up the biggest share of falling emissions as car journeys were reduced and aviation was forced to halt. And this month, global emissions from road transport were found to be still 10% below 2019 levels, while aviation pollution was 40% lower than last year. Globally, carbon emissions from burning coal, gas and oil for power and transport, from manufacturing cement and from industrial processes fell by a record 2.4 billion tonnes - a 7% drop on 2019 levels.",3,Reliable,0.0529788301129764,0.3158430999894414,713,3,Sky News

Now, documents obtained by's Motherboard describe just how police agencies use one tool to extract data from Apple devices. It's more evidence that officials aren't stymied by encryption half as often as they claim, but just want to paw through our information without effort or expense.""'How to unlock and EXTRACT DATA from Apple Mobile Devices with GrayKey,' the instructions, seemingly written by the San Diego Police Department, read,""'s Joseph Coxrevealsof the documentation obtained with a public records request. ""The instructions describe the various conditions it claims allow a GrayKey connection: the device being turned off (known as Before First Unlock, or BFU); the phone is turned on (After First Unlock, or AFU); the device having a damaged display, and when the phone has low battery,"" he adds. GrayKey's existence isn't a revelation, though the documentation provides interesting insight into its capabilities. Georgia-based Grayshiftopenly markets the producton its website, including a recently released version thatworks on Android phones.""Annual licensing for GrayKey with iOS and Android support begins at USD $9,995,"" the company notes. Malwarebytes Labs got a glimpse of a GrayKey device in 2018 and published images along with a description of its operation.""GrayKey is a gray box, four inches wide by four inches deep by two inches tall, with two lightning cables sticking out of the front,"" Thomas Reedwrote for the security firm. ""Two iPhones can be connected at one time, and are connected for about two minutes. After that, they are disconnected from the device, but are not yet cracked. Some time later, the phones will display a black screen with the passcode, among other information. The exact length of time varies, taking about two hours in the observations of our source.""That two-hour extraction time still seems valid based on information on the Grayshift website. GrayKey uses a brute-force approach to gain access to devices, and the instructions obtained byreveal that alphanumeric passcodes offer greater challenges to the approach than number-only codes—especially if users avoid using real words. Even after a device is returned, the intrusion isn't necessarily over. ""As part of a feature called HideUI, GrayKey also allows agencies to install the agent which surreptitiously records the user's passcode if authorities hand their phone back to them,"" Cox cautions. But Grayshift wasn't the first company to help law enforcement agencies break into encrypted devices. In 2016,Apple repeatedly told the FBI to pound sandwhen asked to bypass the privacy protections on its phones. TheFBI then turned to Cellebrite, based in Israel, to gain access to a locked iPhone.""Cellebrite, the Israeli company, said its sales increased 38 percent in the first quarter to $53 million as more police departments bought its tools to hack into suspects' phones,""The New York Timesreportedearlier this month, indicating the company is still active in that market (that verybusymarket, I'll add).""[H]igh-profile cases in which law enforcementcannotaccess the contents of a phone overshadows a more significant change: the rise in law enforcement's ability to search the thousands of phones that theycanaccess in a wide range of cases,"" according to anOctober 2020 report from Upturn, a nonprofit that scrutinizes police use of technology. ""Our records show that at least 2,000 agencies have purchased a range of products and services offered by mobile device forensic tool vendors. Law enforcement agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia have these tools.""""We found that state and local law enforcement agencies have performed hundreds of thousands of cellphone extractions since 2015, often without a warrant,"" the report adds. That doesn't mean that tech companies are complacent about hacking tools and flaws in their security. Grayshift ""is constantly in a cat-and-mouse game with Apple, which tries to fix security issues that GrayKey takes advantage of,"" observes's Cox. The result, undoubtedly, is improved technology all around, with vulnerabilities ultimately detected and closed off not only to law-enforcement contractors, but also to criminal hackers. That said, police and intelligence agencies aren't restricted to waging technological cold war against cryptographers and tech companies; they also rely on old-fashioned sneakiness. After taking down Phantom Secure, an organization that specialized in offering secure communications to criminals, law enforcement set up a fake outfit to take its place.""In an innovative effort, the FBI, with the help of the Australian Federal Police, launched their own encrypted communications platform and supplied more than 12,000 devices to hundreds of criminal organizations that operate around the globe,"" the FBIannouncedon June 8. Needless to say, the provided devices protected nobody's privacy and resulted in hundreds of arrests. So, law enforcement would seem to be doing just fine, sucking the information out of the vast majority of targeted devices (often indiscriminately) while occasionally running up against the occasional tougher nut. Even in those cases, some jurisdictions allow for the issuance ofwarrants to compel the surrender of passwords, or else. That's a lot of arrows in cop quivers. But governments still insist that ""tech companies should include mechanisms in the design of their encrypted products and services whereby governments, acting with appropriate legal authority, can gain access to data in a readable and usable format,"" as amulti-national manifestosigned by the United States reiterated just last fall. Privacy protections of any sort, no matter how frequently bypassed, just seem to offend the sort of people who go into government. That said, turnabout is fair play. Matthew Rosenfield, the security researcher who, as Moxie Marlinspike, created the Signal secure messaging app, says it's possible to install software on your own device that will compromise the technology police use to extract data.""[W]e found that it's possible to execute arbitrary code on a Cellebrite machine simply by including a specially formatted but otherwise innocuous file in any app on a device that is subsequently plugged into Cellebrite and scanned. There are virtually no limits on the code that can be executed,"" hewrote in April of this year.

530,Homeland Security Tells ICE to Cut Ties With Jail That Sicced Dogs on Migrants,-12.0,39.0,https://truthout.org/articles/advocates-welcome-move-to-close-ice-lockups-at-2-county-jails/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,25,"In a move hailed as “a major win” by migrant rights advocates, the U. S. Department of Homeland Security on Thursday announced it is moving to end migrant detention at two county jails under federal investigation for alleged abuses including forced sterilizations and unleashing dogs on detainees. DHS said in a statement that Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas directed U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to “discontinue use” of the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center at the Bristol County Jail in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts and to “prepare to discontinue the use” of the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia. In a memo to Tae Johnson, the acting ICE director, Mayorkas said that “we will not tolerate the mistreatment of individuals in civil immigration detention or substandard conditions of detention.” In March, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) led a letter from progressive U. S. lawmakers urging the Biden administration to “sever the financial incentives” fueling an “abuse-ridden system of mass incarceration” by ending immigrant detention contracts with local jails. The letter specifically mentioned Bristol County Jail, where the Massachusetts attorney general’s office found that officers sicced dogs on migrant inmates and assaulted them with pepper spray, resulting in at least two hospitalizations. Last September, House Democrats demanded an emergency investigation into allegations of medical abuse at the Irwin County Detention Center after whistle blowing nurse Dawn Wooten alleged that an alarming number of forced hysterectomies were performed on migrant women prisoners there. According to Amnesty International, “Some women were reportedly unsure why the procedure was performed, or they were not fully informed of what procedures would be performed on them.” While Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson — a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policies — called the DHS cancellation a “political hit job,” migrant rights advocates welcomed the news. The Massachusetts-based FANG Collective and the advocacy group Detention Watch Network issued a joint statement noting that “this is the first time ICE has cut a contract for a detention center in recent years.” “The announcement signals a major win for people who’ve been detained at the facility and bravely spoken out against its abuses and for local organizations who have long fought to shut it down,” the groups said. Detention Watch Network executive director Silky Shah said that “we applaud the brave detained people who have demanded their freedom.” “The shutdown of Bristol is happening because of their bravery and the years of advocacy work led by local groups documenting how inhumane and unjust the facility is,” said Shah. “And while we are celebrating this win, we know that this must be the first step of many, including ensuring that people are released and not transferred to other detention facilities when contracts are cut.” “Bristol exemplifies how the system as a whole is fundamentally flawed and we call on the Biden administration to continue to cut detention contracts and shut down facilities for good,” added Shah. “Simply put, everyone should be able to navigate their immigration case at home and in community — not behind bars in immigration detention.” Activist and FANG Collective co-founder Sherrie Anne André — who last March was sentenced to 30 days behind bars for their participation in an August 2018 anti-ICE protest at the Bristol lockup — said that, “While I am feeling a sense of relief and gratitude towards those who have relentlessly pushed for the dissolution of this ICE contract, I know that the relationships between ICE and Bristol County have been forged, and that [Sheriff Hodgson] will continue to abuse his position of power while inflicting the harms of white supremacy on our communities.” “Contracts should burn. Prisons should burn. We need to continue to forge our own relationships with each other outside of these harmful systems to build a beautiful future for all of us,” André asserted. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey also welcomed the DHS announcement, tweeting that the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office “has a long history of abuse and neglect.” “Today’s decision is a big step toward protecting immigrant detainees from further harm,” Healey asserted. In announcing the DHS move, Mayorkas said: “We have an obligation to make lasting improvements to our civil immigration detention system. This marks an important first step to realizing that goal. DHS detention facilities and the treatment of individuals in those facilities will be held to our health and safety standards.” “Where we discover they fall short, we will continue to take action as we are doing to day,” he added.",2,Generally Reliable,0.076836917562724,0.3269073220686124,993,1,Truthout

S. history education centered on the nation’s founding principles. Biden, who was inaugurated on Wednesday, is expected to sign 17 executive actions, according to a press release. A number of those actions are a direct reversal of Trump-era policies, including the travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries, the construction of barriers along the U. S.-Mexican border, and the 1776 Commission to promote a “patriotic education.”Through his day 1 executive order, Biden will “rescind the Trump administration’s 1776 Commission,” which “has sought to erase America’s history of racial injustice,” the Biden-Harris transition team said in a press release. Formed last September by then-President Donald Trump, the 1776 Commission is commonly seen as a direct response to New York Times’ 1619 Project, which portrays the United States as an inherently racist nation. The Pulitzer Prize-winning project consists of a collection of essays that argue, among many other controversial claims, that the primary reason for the American Revolution was to preserve slavery.“Neither America nor any other nation has perfectly lived up to the universal truths of equality, liberty, justice, and government by consent,” the report reads. ”But no nation before America ever dared state those truths as the formal basis for its politics, and none has strived harder, or done more, to achieve them.”U. S. colleges and universities, the report warns, have become “hotbeds of anti-Americanism, libel, and censorship,” with the intention to “manipulate opinions more than educate minds.”The 1776 report specifically calls out historian Howard Zinn and the 1619 Project for preventing students from seeing the humanity, goodness, and benevolence in America’s historical figures. Young readers are instead being presented with a distorted version of U. S. history, according to the 1776 report.“Historical revisionism that tramples honest scholarship and historical truth, shames Americans by highlighting only the sins of their ancestors, and teaches claims of systemic racism that can only be eliminated by more discrimination, is an ideology intended to manipulate opinions more than educate minds,” the report reads.",3,Reliable,0.1754208754208754,0.4526374859708192,478,0,Epoch Times
533,"In South Africa, female ministers have a message: It’s time for equality",-5.0,45.33,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2020/0812/In-South-Africa-female-ministers-have-a-message-It-s-time-for-equality,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-12,25,"Growing up, Purity Malinga’s faith taught her that God was perfect. But the people who believed in Him, she soon realized, were not. This, after all, was apartheid South Africa, and no matter how equally God saw her, she was still a Black woman in a world where both her race and her gender were strikes against her. How should institutions live out their ideals? That’s an especially loaded question in religion. A generation of female leaders in South Africa say they’re pushing their church to practice what it preaches on equality. So when she took the pulpit last September as the first woman elected to lead the Methodist Church of Southern Africa, she addressed members bluntly.“The humanity of women is diminished every day in our society and in churches,” the presiding bishop-elect said. “If indeed we believe as a church we are called to proclaim the gospel that heals and transforms, it is time to act.”Over the last three centuries, churches have played a complicated role in South African history, as they have nearly everywhere in the world. At times, they have been the engines of colonialism and segregation, giving a biblical mandate to human bigotry. But they have also been the instruments of its undoing. The Methodist Church, for instance, was banned in part of the country in the 1970s for its opposition to apartheid. It counted among its members some of the most forceful voices for racial equality, including Nelson Mandela. But in recent years, the Methodist Church here has faced a new reckoning, as its female leadership tries to break the stained-glass ceiling – a struggle mirrored in many other faiths. Like many religious institutions in South Africa after apartheid, the church has struggled to reconcile its lofty ideals around justice and equality with its treatment of women. Now, a generation of women leaders in the Methodist Church of Southern Africa (MCSA) is making a forceful argument. The church must be the change it wants to see in the world.“Religion has to be a moving vehicle for social change,” says the Rev. Mantima Thekiso, a young Black minister in Johannesburg. “Otherwise, it loses its relevance.”For Bishop Malinga, the church’s inner battle was part of its identity for as long as she could remember. As a child growing up in a rural community, she says, her all-Black Methodist congregation was mostly made up of women, and she never second-guessed the idea that they were its natural leaders. Outside those walls, however, MCSA wrestled with whether to ordain women, allowing it only in 1976. In church, she was told that Methodists believed all people were equal. In 1958, the church had become one of the first denominations to forcefully reject apartheid countrywide, promising it would never segregate its churches, because they were “one and undivided” by race. But as a young seminarian, “I came to realize there were still white churches and Black churches, and that in the white churches, I was made to know I was an outsider,” she says. “I’ve always managed that contradiction by trying to differentiate between human frailty and the perfection of God.”But godly ideals and human failings frequently crashed head-on in apartheid South Africa. In her early days as a minister in the 1980s, Ms. Malinga says, male colleagues – Black and white – told her outright that she shouldn’t be there. They quoted biblical verses saying that women should be seen and not heard. In ministry, they assigned her to “women’s tasks” like teaching children.“It was only when I went to study [for my master’s] at Harvard that I was exposed to a feminist theology,” she says. “It made me realize – it’s not me who is crazy, it is the church that’s crazy.”And being at Harvard also taught her something else – that racism was not a uniquely South African affliction.“After growing up under apartheid, I was so excited to experience what it was like to be in a democratic country where I would be seen as a full human being,” she says. But if Boston’s racism was more subtle than South Africa’s, it was no less stinging. “You feel it in the way people talk to you, in the condescending way things are explained to you – that you’re not wanted here.”When she returned home in 1992, however, the South Africa she had known before was giving way to something new. Two years earlier, Mr. Mandela had been released from prison after 27 years, and the country was preparing for its first democratic election. The Methodist Church, too, was trying to find its footing. The church had begun trying to integrate its churches – sending Black ministers to largely white congregations, and white ministers to Black ones. But for women, little changed. In 1999, Ms. Malinga was appointed bishop for a region along South Africa’s east coast. But as the church’s only female bishop, she says she struggled to make her voice heard. “It’s an experience I wouldn’t wish for any woman,” she says. “The men I worked with felt sorry for me. They didn’t take me as their equal. There was no expectation that I would be listened to and respected like any other leader in the church.” She left the post in 2008.“As a woman minister, you sometimes feel like a token,” says Ms. Thekiso. “You’re the example of what female excellence looks like. But if you fail, women as a whole fail too.”By 2016,only 17% of Methodist ministers were women, and they made up just 4% of the regional leaders. But a vocal campaign was underway to elect more female leaders, led by a group within the church called Women in Ministry. “I challenge the [Methodist Church of Southern Africa]to be true to its words,” urged the Rev. Libuseng Lebaka-Ketshabile, another Black female minister, at the church’s annual conference in 2016. “How long shall the church renege on its responsibility of affirming women?”Momentum might have kept building quietly, were it not for a sudden scandal that thrust the issue into the public eye. In January 2019, the Rev. Vukile Mehana, an influential leader with close ties to the country’s ruling party, the African National Congress, was caught on tape dismissing the idea that a man could ever be ordained by a female minister.“I do not care whether you call that patriarchy or whatever rubbish you want to call it, but … this should not be allowed in the church,” he said. The uproar – in and outside the church – was massive.“There was absolute horror within the church. We had to contend with the fact that this is us,” says Dion Forster, a Methodist minister and theologian at Stellenbosch University. “This is one of our most prominent members, who is socially progressive, politically progressive, and this is how he speaks about his female colleagues.”The reaction was swift. Later last year, MCSA elected Ms. Malinga to be its presiding bishop – the church’s highest office – and appointed three other women as regional bishops. For Ms. Malinga and other women, it was a step in the right direction, and a big one at that. But it was far from all that was needed. So when she prepared her first speech as presiding bishop-elect, Ms. Malinga decided she wouldn’t let anyone off the hook.“I wanted to talk about the things that are a disgrace to this church – how we preach change and talk about transformation in society, when in truth transformation is taking a long time in the church itself,” she says. “This was my time to call for the Methodist Church to be true to itself.”",3,Reliable,0.0404073199527745,0.3669224714679261,1655,3,Christian Science Monitor
534,Trump denounces coronavirus evictions after long record of evicting his own tenants,-10.5,43.5,https://americanindependent.com/donald-trump-evictions-coronavirus-trump-organization-rental-properties-covid-19/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-independent-bias-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"Trump has forcefully evicted many elderly, sick, and poor tenants from Trump-owned properties over his career. Trump has forcefully evicted many elderly, sick, and poor tenants from Trump-owned properties over his career. Donald Trump on Monday said he opposed the expiration of an eviction moratorium in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.“I don’t want people to be evicted,” Trump said at a news conference when asked if he was considering signing an executive order to halt evictions. “And, you know, when they’re evicted, when they’re thrown out of there, whatever the place may be, in many cases, they go to big shelters. And if you talk about pandemic, this is a pandemic, and they go to shelters. Number one, they’re thrown out viciously. It’s not their fault — it’s China’s fault. It’s not anybody’s fault — it’s China’s fault.”Trump said he would sign an executive order if Congress didn’t extend the moratorium. But Trump has a long history of evicting tenants from his real estate properties — many of them poor, elderly, or sick. A number of theforceful evictionstook place in the 1980s, when Trump owned rental properties in New York and tried to expand his portfolio of properties, according to American Bridge, a Democratic research group. In 1980, the Trump Organization evicted 74-year-old bedridden stroke victim Mary Filan from her Queens apartment, taking her belongings such as a “sofa, chairs, TV, jewelry, dishes, and silverware” and bringing them to a dump, the Village Voicereportedat the time. Filan’s belongings were broken beyond repair.“They said they’d come to put me on the street because I owed four months’ rent. I don’t owe back rent. The last thing I got from Trump was a bill for $10.20 about two weeks ago, and I sent that. They just want me out because they can get twice as much rent,” Filan said about the incident. Also in the 1980s, Trump tried to force out tenants of 100 Central Park South — which he wanted to revamp — with forceful tactics.“[Trump] brought specious lawsuits against some of them, and judges have thrown these out, charging him with ‘bad faith,’ ‘harassment’ and ‘intimidation’ — in one case ordering young Donald to pay the tenant’s legal fees,” the New York Timeswrote. “Also, he proposed putting some of the city’s homeless people into the dozen or so apartments he has already emptied in the building.”One of those tenants was James Galef, who had lived in the building since he as born.“On Jan. 1, 1982, 10 months after Mr. Trump bought the 15-story building, Mr. Galef received a notice that said he had to restore the apartment to its original condition within 10 days or face immediate eviction,” the New York Timeswroteof Galef’s treatment by Trump. “This meant, [Galef] said, that he had to replace a wall that had been torn down in 1955, before he was born.”And in the early 2000s, Trump tried to evict tenants from a hotel he purchased on Park Avenue in New York so he could renovate it. According to a New York Timesreport, he “sought to evict 3 of the 17 remaining tenants.”“Donald Trump, not China, allowed coronavirus to wreck our country by mismanaging the response. Tragically, the downstream effect of an economy in ruins is housing insecurity,” Kyle Morse, an American Bridge 21st Century spokesperson, said in a statement. “Trump’s history of brutal evictions and his White House’s refusal to seriously negotiate on a coronavirus relief package proves how little he cares about the millions of unemployed Americans and whether they have a roof over their head.”As many as 28 million people may be kicked out of their homes if the current eviction moratorium is not extended, Reutersreported. But an executive order extending the eviction moratorium wouldn’t be necessary if Senate Republicans had considered a bill passed in the House months ago. Led by Democrats, the Housepassed a bill on May 15extending the eviction moratorium as well as extending the $600 weekly unemployment insurance boost, giving more direct payments to Americans, and appropriating aid for state and local governments and food stamps. But Senate Republicans refused to pass House Democrats’ legislation and wouldn’t evenengagein negotiations with Democrats until days before the eviction moratorium wasset to expire on July 25. Democrats are currently negotiating with the White House to try to find terms for a coronavirus relief package that Senate Republicans will agree to. A major hold-up includes a boost to unemployment insurance. Democrats are standing firm in their demand that Congress pass $600 a weekly unemployment insurance boost, while the Trump administration and Senate Republicanswant to drastically cut those payments. Friday’s jobs data showed a strong, resilient U. S. labor market with wages outpacing inflation — welcome news for Americans hoping to have more purchasing power in 2024. The Nevada Republican U. S. Senate hopeful also spoke out against a rail project projected to create thousands of union jobs'This investment will help create jobs in our region, and it’s exactly the kind of funding we need to expand American manufacturing, innovation, and production,' Sen. John Fetterman said.",3,Reliable,0.0339193944457102,0.4257259309890888,1195,2,American Independent
535,Fact-checking Joe Biden on U.S. credibility as military withdraws from Afghanistan,0.67,45.67,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/26/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-biden-us-credibility-military-wi/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-26,25,"Under fire over the plight of Afghans and Americans trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, President Joe Biden has defended the U. S. military’s withdrawal and pushed back against assertions that U. S. credibility is damaged. On Aug. 20, a reporter asked Biden: ""What is your message to America’s partners around the world who have criticized not the withdrawal, but the conduct of that withdrawal and made them question America’s credibility on the world stage?""Biden replied: ""I have seen no question of our credibility from our allies around the world. I've spoken with our NATO allies. … The fact of the matter is I have not seen that. As a matter of fact, the exact opposite I've gotten. The exact opposite thing is we're acting with dispatch. We're committing to what we said we would do.""We can’t fact-check what Biden has seen, but we wondered if his main point is accurate: Is it true that no allies have questioned U. S. credibility in light of the chaos in Afghanistan?Biden’s claim is partly right, but leaves out important details. PolitiFact looked through statements on Afghanistan issued by leaders of NATO members, including those that an expert said contributed most to the International Security Assistance Force mission in the country: Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. The current leaders of those four NATO members have not publicly condemned the U. S. response or questioned its credibility. But some members of foreign governments have challenged the U. S. and NATO on the withdrawal and said that outcomes in Afghanistan weakened the West. And a day after Biden’s claim, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, an ardent defender of U. S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan,wrote: ""The world is now uncertain of where the West stands because it is so obvious that the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan in this way was driven not by grand strategy but by politics.""The White House press office did not comment on the record for this fact-check. On-the-ground reporting has shown chaotic scenes in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, as people try to leave the country, fearing Taliban reprisals against those who worked with allied forces and the U. S.-backed government. The U. S. and other countries have scrambled to arrange evacuation flights on military and commercial planes. The U. S.’ withdrawal came after nearly two decades of war against the Taliban, which ruled in Kabul from 1996 to 2001 and harbored al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, who planned the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the U. S. A coalition of U. S. and allied forces drove out the Taliban in 2001, but the group swiftly regained power in Afghanistan as U. S. troops began withdrawing from the country under the February 2020agreementbetween the Taliban and the Trump administration. When examining the reaction among allies, the most relevant ones to focus on are the biggest NATO contributors to the mission in Afghanistan, said Teresa Eder, a program associate at the Global Europe Program at the Wilson Center.""Obviously, we have not heard from prime ministers, chancellors, or presidents openly questioning the way this withdrawal was and is being conducted,"" Eder said. But some members of parliament from governing parties, and not just opposition leaders, have spoken up. The criticism hasn’t been targeted just at the United States. Some criticism has also been aimed at NATO and the West in general. The scope also has varied: Some have criticized the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, others have condemned the aftermath, and others have broadly said the outcome in Afghanistan was a failure and proposed re-examining their own approaches to foreign policy. In their criticism, some have referenced their own governments’ accountability. Eder said there is ""some weight"" tocomments from Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Germany’s national parliament and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling party.""I say this with a heavy heart and with horror over what is happening, but the early withdrawal was a serious and far-reaching miscalculation by the current administration,""saidRöttgen, according to Politico. ""This does fundamental damage to the political and moral credibility of the West.""On Aug. 15, the day the Afghan president fled the country and Taliban fighters entered Kabul, Röttgentweetedin German: ""Today is an immeasurable catastrophe. It is the result of the fatal wrong decision by the U. S. to rush to leave Afghanistan & our inactivity following this decision. A failure of the West with dramatic consequences for (Afghanistan) & our credibility.""On Aug. 18, Röttgen alsotweetedthat German and European Union foreign policy can no longer consist of ""just trailing behind the Americans.""Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the U. K. Parliament’s foreign affairs committee,tweeted: ""Afghanistan is the biggest foreign policy disaster sinceSuez. We need to think again about how we handle friends, who matters and how we defend our interests. In Kabul we’ve failed our friends and ourselves. We need to think again, fast.""In aspeech, Tugendhat also called for ""reinvigorating our European NATO partners to make sure that we are not dependent on a single ally, on the decision of a single leader.""Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defense committee in the British Parliament, has questioned the sincerity of Biden’s foreign policy messaging.""People are bewildered that after two decades of this big, high-tech power intervening, they are withdrawing and effectively handing the country back to the people we went in to defeat,""Ellwood told the Washington Post. ""This is the irony. How can you say America is back when we're being defeated by an insurgency armed with no more than (rocket-propelled grenades), land mines and AK-47s?""Latvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a radio interview that ""this kind of troop withdrawal caused chaos,"" and that ""unfortunately, the West, and Europe in particular, are showing they are weaker globally,"" the Postreported. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief,calledthe developments a ""catastrophe for the Afghan people, for the Western values and credibility and for the developing of international relations.""Among current leaders of NATO countries, Czech President Milos Zeman took direct aim at the U. S. ""I think that by leaving Afghanistan, the Americans have lost the prestige of a global leader and NATO itself has raised doubts about the legitimacy of its existence,"" Zeman said,according to a Times of India report thatcited Czech media. Public statements fromMerkel,U. K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson,French President Emmanuel MacronandItaly’s prime minister Mario Draghihave emphasized the need to evacuate from Afghanistan their citizens and Afghans who have helped the allied mission, as well as a commitment to the protection of human rights and freedoms in Afghanistan. After the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, Merkelsaidthe developments were ""bitter, dramatic and appalling, especially for the people in Afghanistan."" She also praised international cooperation on evacuations and said that the ""allies and of course the Federal Armed Forces along with numerous civilian organisations had accomplished an enormous amount.""Foreign policy experts told us that it’s important to put some of the criticism in context. There may be a political agenda behind them, or an effort to protect a leader’s legacy, said Sara Bjerg Moller, an assistant professor at the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University. In Germany, for example, ruling-party leaderArmin Laschet, who called the allied withdrawal a ""debacle,"" is running in a close election to succeed Merkel as chancellor, Moller noted. In Europe, ""politicians are having to answer to their own publics about the role their governments played in Afghanistan over the years,"" Moller said, ""as well as trying to head off criticism regarding ​challenges they are facing getting their own people and ​local partners out by shifting attention and blaming Washington.""Zeman’s comments are primarily geared toward a domestic audience and ""have no larger consequences for NATO or the United States,"" Eder said. Zeman, who is head of state, but not head of government, is known for his Russian-friendly stance, experts said. NATO allies have known about the U. S. withdrawal, and many got their own forces out in advance, precisely because they knew Biden's timetable, Moller said.""Telling the media now they are shaken by Biden's withdrawal timetable and would have preferred to maintain the status quo — which wasn't a status quo — is hypocrisy at best and a bald face lie, at worst,"" Moller said. Some members of foreign governments who are speaking out may be using the moment to push for concessions from the United States in future policy discussions, said Joshua Shifrinson, an associate professor of international relations at Boston University.""The fact that we haven’t seen the castigation of U. S. credibility in an overt, dramatic way is a more telling indicator,"" said Shifrinson. Experts said that the U. S. withdrawal in Afghanistan and ensuing events aren’t being interpreted as an indicator that the U. S. won’t live up to its commitments to allies, such ascollective defense obligationsunder NATO principles.""I think we can certainly say that we overrated the U. S. planning to withdraw from Afghanistan in an orderly fashion,"" Eder said, ""but I don’t think we can draw any larger conclusions from this and say the United States would not come to the aid of NATO allies in the event of a Russian military attack.""Said Moller: ""I am dubious of the claim that the U. S. departure from Afghanistan has shaken our allies' confidence about U. S. security guarantees elsewhere in the world.""European leaders have emphasized that they want to continue coordinating and working with the United States on evacuations, humanitarian issues and the future stability of the region, Eder said. She said that European leaders also have an interest in waiting to see how things unfold over the next several weeks rather than risking upsetting trans-Atlantic ties on another front.""Some analysts argue that far from diminishing U. S. credibility, the withdrawal from Afghanistan will free up U. S. resources and capabilities that could enhance deterrence vis-à-vis Russia or China,"" Eder said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Aug. 20saidthat ""NATO remains a strong alliance"" and that North America and Europe must continue to stand together.""The unfolding events in Afghanistan do not change this,"" Stoltenberg said. ""The shifting global balance of power, Russia’s aggressive actions, and the rise of China, make it even more important that we keep a strong trans-Atlantic bond.""Biden said there has been ""no question of our credibility from our allies around the world"" regarding how the U. S. is withdrawing from Afghanistan. Some foreign officials have challenged the U. S. and NATO on the withdrawal from Afghanistan and how it was executed. But experts said that the top leaders of NATO members that most contributed to the NATO mission in Afghanistan have not publicly questioned U. S. credibility. We did not find such criticism from those leaders, either. We rate Biden’s claim Half True.",3,Reliable,0.0629392201472493,0.3721686363109721,2452,3,Politifact

537,Who’s to blame for America’s defeat in Afghanistan?,0.0,44.67,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/aug/13/whos-to-blame-for-americas-defeat-in-afghanistan/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,23,"Under President Joe Biden’s order, all US troops inAfghanistanwill be withdrawn by month’s end except for the hundred or so guarding our embassy inKabul. Coalition troops are withdrawing on the same schedule. TheTaliban’s reconquest ofAfghanistanis proceeding rapidly against the sometimes resistance of Afghan security forces. The fact is that we have been defeated there in almost exactly the same way we were in Vietnam. Politicians and pundits are already trying to blame our defeat on some disfavored person or group. History will soon find that there is plenty of blame to go around for our defeat in the twenty-year Afghanistan War. Presidents, vice presidents, cabinet members, and White House advisors, as well as the generals who ran the war, all must share it. Winning is an accumulation of decisions, and so is defeat. It’s not difficult to identify the people and organizations who made the bad decisions that compounded over twenty years to comprise the reasons for our defeat. Before we do that, it’s necessary to define what comprised our defeat. Then we can identify those responsible for making and carrying out the decisions that led to it. President George W. Bush established the original mission to overthrow theTalibangovernment, punish al-Qaida, bring Usama bin Laden to justice, and then deliver peace and democracy toAfghanistan. We overthrew theTalibangovernment quickly, but they were never truly defeated and have never severed their ties to al-Qaida. It took ten years to kill bin Laden, but peace never came toAfghanistan. Our attempt to implant democracy failed as it inevitably would. Mr. Bush’s nation-building strategy, as I have written since 2003, was fundamentally flawed. Islam prohibits the separation of religion and state and therefore doesn’t permit democracy. It was easy for theTalibanto convince the Afghan people that we were the enemy, trying to steal their religion. By failing to defeat the Islamist ideology, we could not win inAfghanistanor Iraq. Mr. Bush’s strategy and his successors’ actions failed to prevent China, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran from supporting theTaliban, which they have, for years, with funds and arms. The Afghanistan War, named “Operation Enduring Freedom,” began on October 7, 2001, when the first Army Special Forces unit enteredAfghanistan. In November 2001, then-secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld – as he wrote in his memoir - told Mr. Bush, “It’s my view we need to limit our mission to getting the terrorists who find their way toAfghanistan. We ought not to make a career out of transformingAfghanistan.” Mr. Bush decided against that advice. Mr. Bush’s nation-building strategy is the principal reason we lost in bothAfghanistanand Iraq. In his memoir, then-vice president Richard Cheney makes no mention of advising against nation-building, so he must share the blame. So must then-secretary of state Colin Powell whose “Pottery Barn” rule – “if you break it, you bought it” – convinced Mr. Bush to undertake nation-building. Presidents Obama and Trump both must also share the blame, as must PresidentBidenwho, as Mr. Obama’s vice president, stood with him on strategy. Mr. Obama intentionally surrendered the ideological war and supported the nation-building strategy as an afterthought. Mr. Trump never saw the necessity for the ideological war and continued nation-building for lack of a better idea. His 2020 “peace deal” with theTalibanassumed, rather than required that theTalibanwould enter into serious peace negotiations and sever its ties to al-Qaida. It never did either. A great share of the blame must go to the generals and admirals who convinced themselves that nation-building and the counterinsurgency strategy – “COIN,” which meshed with it perfectly — was succeeding inAfghanistanand then Iraq. Generals such as David Petraeus, who authored the COIN strategy, and others whose names became household words — George Casey, Stanley McChrystal, and more – either didn’t understand why nation-building couldn’t succeed or simply drank the COIN Kool-Aid. Even after it became clear that nation-building was failing, they continued to support it. The generals who commanded inAfghanistan, in particular, deluded themselves into believing that twenty years of US training guaranteed that Afghan soldiers would fight rather than desert the Kabul government after US and Coalition troops left. That delusion enabled theTaliban’s ongoing reconquest ofAfghanistan. PresidentBidensent B-52s and AC-130 gunships to target someTalibanon August 7 to cover our retreat. There’s no evidence that the airstrikes even slowed theTaliban’s advance. Mr. Bidenshould have left sufficient airpower, special forces, and intelligence assets inAfghanistanto prevent the creation of terrorist safe havens from which attacks could be mounted against us or our allies. Had he done so, theTaliban’s reconquest ofAfghanistanwould have been rendered almost insignificant. TheTalibanwill soon captureKabuland re-establish their “emirate” inAfghanistan. Whatever rights Afghan men and women had under the US-supported Kabul government will evaporate overnight. Many lessons should be learned from our defeat inAfghanistan, but that is for another day. We first have to ask ourselves whether America is, at this point in history, politically capable of winning any war",3,Reliable,0.1484022556390977,0.4802631578947367,1215,1,Washington Times

But filling Supreme Court seats is just one battle in a war over the judiciary—one that progressives worry they’re losing. Listen to this article00:0024:55Listen to more stories onaudmEvery political coalitionlikes to talk about how its opponents are more organized, more ruthless, and better funded. As progressives plot their response to Donald Trump’s mostly successful project to remake the federal courts, they are reviewing the times they’ve been outworked, outfought, and outsmarted on judicial nominations. One not-so-familiar name jumps out: Before Merrick Garland’s stint in purgatory, before Brett Kavanaugh’s furious denial of assault allegations, before Amy Coney Barrett’s eleventh-hour confirmation, there was Goodwin Liu. In 2010, Democrats comfortably controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. Liu—the son of Taiwanese immigrants, a celebrated academic, the same kind of hyper-driven polymath as a certain former senator from Illinois—was up for a seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. At the time, Liu was also the chair of the American Constitution Society, which had been founded a decade earlier as the progressive answer to the Federalist Society, the group most responsible for the conservative movement’s intellectual takeover of the judiciary. At least on paper, Liu was a top leader of what aspired to be the foremost progressive legal network in the country. He had the enthusiastic backing of the Democratic establishment—“He’s as sharp as they come,” Senator Dianne Feinstein told the—and court watchers considered himpapabileas a Supreme Court justice. If progressives had had a well-oiled judicial-appointments machine likethe one associated with the Federalist Society, Liu’s nomination would have been a cinch. But well-oiled, the progressive machine was not. Republicans set the narrative on Liu: Instead of a bright legal thinker, he was “far outside the mainstream,” then-Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama said. A few years earlier, Liu had harshly criticized soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s permissiveness toward policing, comments that were “vicious and emotionally and racially charged, very intemperate,” then-Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona said. Liu’s nomination languished, held hostage—along with nearly two dozen others—by Republican procedural maneuvers. In the end, it was the Obama administration that sold out its star: With the White House’s blessing, Senate Democrats struck a deal to get most of the hostage nominees through, as long as Liu and a few others got dropped. When Democrats recite the parable of Goodwin Liu, they tell a story about Republican bad faith and foul play, but also one of their own failures. Progressives have largely ceded the judiciary to conservatives. Republicans have long been engaged in total warfare on the courts. They see liberal courts as an existential threat to the conservative project, and they have responded accordingly, building a well-funded machine to get true believers confirmed as judges. For years, Democrats never built an equal and opposite infrastructure for installing progressives on the federal bench. The possible explanations are many: Democratic voters don’t care as much about courts as Republicans do; donors on the left didn’t invest in the courts the same way as those on the right have. But some Democrats are starting to suspect that the story is simpler: They’ve been chumps. They have clung to norms Republicans long ago abandoned. They have championed moderates in order to appeal to their enemies, only to watch those moderates twist in the wind. And they have turned up their nose at the idea that outside groups should run the judicial-nominations process, even when those groups are effective at what they do. Some progressives argue that they have honorably pursued good governance, trying to work within the federal government while their opponents turned the Federalist Society into an HR firm for Republican administrations. But grievances don’t change the facts: The conservative movement has been winning the battle for the federal courts. Read: When conservative justices revoltAfter the past four years, though, some Democrats claim they are finally ready to fight for the third branch of government. They are starting with a number of disadvantages: President Donald Trump favored younger and more ideologically conservative nominees than his predecessors, and those new judgescould dominate the courts for decades. His imprint on the courts is most obvious at the top, where judges’ decisions have the most sway over the definition of the law: Trump seated three Supreme Court justices, and in only one term, he appointed nearly as many influential appeals-court judges as President Barack Obama did in two. Republicans had no trouble persuading former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was nominated by Ronald Reagan, to retire while the GOP held a comfortable margin in the Senate. But Stephen Breyer, whom many Democrats hoped would retire last month, shows no signs of stepping down. The 82-year-old justice embodies an earlier generation of liberal legal minds, who believed that courts could be insulated from partisan battles. The mood among Democrats has changed, though. Over the past few years, progressive groups have set up powerful dark-money networks and advocated for starkly progressive nominees. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden bragged that his administration was “on track to have confirmed the most judges by July of the first year of a president’s first term in over 50 years.” After the long parade of indignities, the Garlands and the Kavanaughs and the Barretts and the Lius, Democrats say they’re ready to stop being chumps. Progressives have theoreticallybeen plotting their judicial takeover for a long time. Two decades ago, a law professor named Peter Rubin decided that progressives needed a counterweight to the conservative legal movement, which was growing in influence and power. Since the early 1980s, wealthy right-wing donors had been pouring money into the Federalist Society, which served as a clearinghouse on law-school campuses for every future scholar, judge, and public servant interested in conservative ideas. Over the course of years, the Federalist Society had come to loom over elite legal thought; it set the terms of legal debates, even for groups that disagreed with conservative principles. After the Supreme Court decided the 2000 election in, the progressive legal world mobilized against what many liberals saw as a shocking decision—and the conservative movement that made it possible. The group they formed, the American Constitution Society, attracted some of the biggest figures—and funders—of the liberal legal world. But from the start, ACS was at a disadvantage. Although FedSoc quickly became the default home for conservative law students, progressive law students had plenty of other options for how to spend their time on mostly left-leaning law-school campuses. ACS’s money never caught up to FedSoc’s: Liberal students at ACS events got pizza dinners while conservative students hobnobbed over steaks with the judges who would soon hire them as clerks. And ACS just wasn’t focused on explicitly influencing who was in the mix for big legal jobs, including on the judiciary, in part because many progressives found the idea of an outside group influencing the president’s nomination process distasteful. Judgeship nominations were “definitely not the focus of progressives for some time,” Dawn Smalls, a former ACS board member, told me. When Obama was elected, a glowing write-up incited Attorney General Eric Holder’s ties to ACS; surely, the reporter implied, this administration would move quickly to counter the conservative judicial takeover that had unfolded under President George W. Bush. Those predictions proved misguided. To be fair, a lot was happening during those early Obama years: The economy was failing, and the president was determined to pass major health-care legislation. Judicial nominations took time to source and vet, and then they took up committee time and floor time in the Senate; in this hectic legislative environment, nominations assumed a back seat. Staffers who served in the White House at the time told me the judicial-nominations process was disorganized, without clear staffing or an urgent mandate. One reason was political: “There was a sense that any time Democrats are talking about judges, they’re losing,” Chris Kang, a special assistant to the president at the time, told me. Judges were a winning talking point for Republicans who wanted to appeal to their pro-life, Christian base. The issue didn’t have as much salience for Democratic voters, who came to the party’s big tent with diverse backgrounds and priorities. Obama’s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, reportedlyconsideredfights over controversial judicial nominees a distraction from the important business of governing. Besides, Democrats were still operating according to an old mode of politics. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democrat who became the head of the Judiciary Committee, decided to reinstate the so-calledblue-slip process—which effectively gives individual senators veto power over judicial nominations from their state—even though Republicans had done away with the tradition when they were in power. For its first circuit-court pick, the Obama administration chose David Hamilton, a centrist judge from Indiana who was a preacher’s son and a widely admired figure in his home state, thinking Republicans wouldn’t be able to find anything objectionable in his record. Instead, Republicans painted Hamilton as a radical, anti-Christian extremist and boycotted his initial hearing. The lesson the administration took away from that experience was not that Republicans were going to oppose anyone Obama nominated; it was that they needed to pick the most moderate, palatable candidates possible if they had any hope of getting nominees through. Meanwhile, Republicans had started filibustering even district-court nominees. By the end of the Obama years, when Democrats no longer held the Senate, confirmations had basically ground to a halt. “The Republicans just decided that whatever President Obama wanted, they were going to be against,” Neil Eggleston, who served as White House counsel from 2014 to 2017, told me. His office still tried to put nominees forward, but Republicans weren’t the only ones holding up the process. “I found that I just wasn’t getting quality names from the [advocacy] groups—and I’m not going to name them, because they’ll all call me and yell at me,” he said. Perhaps ACS once aspired to be FedSoc for progressives, but the organization had nowhere near the influence in Washington of its conservative counterpart. By the time of Merrick Garland’s long and fruitless wait for a Supreme Court hearing, Democrats realized just how far the Republican recriminations went. Eggleston spent many hours prepping Garland for a hearing that would never happen; if by some miracle Republicans changed course, he wanted his nominee to be prepared. When the end of Obama’s term arrived and Garland was still in limbo, “I was disheartened, but not terribly surprised,” Eggleston said. When Trump took office, progressive activists’ judgment against existing liberal legal-advocacy groups was basically universal: They had failed. As the Trump years wore on and Democrats’ panic grew more intense, new groups with urgent-sounding names started to form. Take Back the Court argued for expanding the number of justices on the Supreme Court, because conservatives had “stolen” seats among the nine. Demand Justice targeted senators whom the organization saw as out-of-touch defenders of a bygone era, including Feinstein, the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. After 14 years working in the Senate and the White House, Kang, the former White House staffer and one of Demand Justice’s co-founders, came to believe that Republicans saw courts as a matter of raw power. “As much as you might want the judiciary to not be politicized, you can’t achieve that depoliticization if only one side decides to sit it out, and the other side ramps up,” he said. How were Democrats going to get their base to care about the courts? Money. Democratic donors started funneling cash to organizations such as the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which are managed by an enormous umbrella group called Arabella Advisors. These groups were exactly the kind that Democrats had spent years decrying on the Republican side: With the Sixteen Thirty Fund functioning as a “fiscal sponsor,” groups such as Demand Justice aren’t legally required to disclose basically any information about their funders, budget, or board of directors. Since 2018, Demand Justice has spent $1.8 million on television ads and another $1 million on Facebook ads, according to Anna Massoglia, a researcher at the watchdog group OpenSecrets, and Democrats have generallyoutspentRepublicans with dark money across all areas of politics. Leonard Leo, who helps lead an influential network of groups that work on conservative issues, including judicial advocacy, was so inspired by Democrats’ use of dark money that he restructured his organizations to mirror his opponents’, he said recently. Read: The Supreme Court molded Joe BidenThe explosion of dark money funding progressives’ court advocacy is uncomfortable for progressive activists to talk about. Molly Coleman, a recent Harvard law graduate who leads a group called the People’s Parity Project that pushes to limit the influence of companies and corporate lawyers in the judicial system, is part of a coalition with Demand Justice and several other groups called Unrig the Courts. Although PPP doesn’t take dark money or corporate money, “that’s just us, and we totally understand why people make other decisions,” she told me, carefully. Progressives still perceive conservatives as having the upper hand in terms of funding and infrastructure in the war over the courts, even though that’s less true now than at any time in recent memory. “Until it’s an even playing field,” it’s not worth it to try and “get the left to be ideologically pure,” Coleman said. Demand Justice says that it has recently become independent, but Kang defended its longtime secrecy: His side will not embrace “unilateral transparency,” he told me. The biggest change—even bigger than the money and the sense of urgency—is the universe of ideas that progressives are willing to entertain. Late in the Trump administration, while all the drama over Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination was unfolding, a new idea seemed to suddenly take hold, largely thanks to this network of shadowy, communications-focused advocacy groups: The only way for progressives to regain judicial power was to add seats to the Supreme Court. Progressives justified this position by arguing that core democratic functions, especially voting rights, had been so undermined that drastic action would be necessary to save the country. Biden,a Supreme Court institutionalist, even convened a group of leading lawyers to study this and other issues, although the number of legislators who vocally support extensive court-reform measures is small. But the contrast with an earlier era of progressive legal thought was stark. A generation ago, even progressive Democrats would have seen packing the court as the absolute end of judicial legitimacy. “I, frankly, would have been appalled in the past at the idea of adding Supreme Court seats or term limits for Supreme Court justices,” former Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, who took over the top job at ACS in 2020, told me. Feingold sat on the Judiciary Committee for years. He’s a norms guy, through and through. But after all that happened under Trump, “something has to give,” he said. “The right stole the Supreme Court. And there needs to be reparations for that.”The leaders of the conservative legal movement have little sympathy for the left’s narrative about Republican intransigence. For years, these conservatives argue, the courts were biased toward progressive policy goals, andhundreds of Democratic advocacy groupsunited to bring down the conservative legal hero Robert Bork’s Supreme Court nomination in the 1980s. “Their sense of helplessness and victimization is a joke,” Leo told me, referring to progressives. “We wouldn’t be where we are today as a conservative movement, fighting the judges wars, if they hadn’t polarized the issue in the 1980s.” At this point, it’s not even possible to tell which side of judicial fights is better funded; the arms race of opaque money has continued unabated. But the story progressives tell about being outmatched on the courts is potentially strategic, conservatives pointed out: That narrative is useful for raising money. Members of the conservative legal movement are not impressed by progressives’ arguments for adding seats to the Supreme Court, either. “A lot of their grievances come down to, ‘Well, we didn’t win that one, and that is super outrageous to us,’” Carrie Severino, the president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy organization, told me. “That doesn’t justify the level to which they are proposing to take it.”Each side in the judicial wars is deeply invested in painting the other as a well-funded evil empire. And perhaps progressives are playing up their own helplessness to aid their political aims. Still, it’s striking that so many elite liberal lawyers are willing to say that they botched the past few decades. I asked Feingold about the chump theory of Democrats and the judiciary—whether a reflexive reverence for norms and a naïveté about power led the left to yield too much ground to the right. “It’s completely accurate,” Feingold said. “ACS is declaring, ‘The days of chumpness are over!’”Two hours after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election in November, ACS did something that prior iterations of the organization had apparently never tried: It submitted a list of 400 potential federal judges to the Biden transition team. The staff of the incoming administration clearly had judges on their minds. A month before Biden’s inauguration, the head of counsel’s office, Dana Remus, sent a letter to Democratic senators asking for three names for every open district-court vacancy by the time Biden took office. The candidates they were looking for would be diverse not only in terms of race and gender, the letter said, but also by practice area. Instead of just the ex-federal prosecutors and Big Law partners who typically get tapped for judicial seats, they wanted labor lawyers and public defenders and civil-rights advocates. Not long after the inauguration, a group of senior staff had convened a weekly meeting to check on the progress of nominations. “There is a bone-deep feeling about the importance of the judiciary that comes straight from the top,” Paige Herwig, the White House’s day-to-day point person on nominations, told me. Herwig’s leadership role on judicial nominations is evidence of how much more aligned the progressive legal-advocacy machine has become with this White House; before she joined the administration, Herwig was one of the first hires at Demand Justice. Republicans have noticed: Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa has taken to questioning Biden’s nominees about whether they’ve had any contact with Chris Kang or Russ Feingold during their nomination process. Democrats still fancy themselves to be taking the high road—that none of this is about winning. “The president feels strongly that the courts are a place where ordinary Americans go to vindicate their rights … For litigants to feel heard and like they got a fair shake in a court of law is the most important thing,” Herwig said. When I asked Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the current chair of the Judiciary Committee, whether Democrats have built a judicial-nominations machine to rival Republicans, he scoffed. “No one was going to get to first base with the Trump White House—even considered for an important judgeship—unless they had signed up with the Federalist Society long ago,” he told me. “We’ve not done that on the Democratic side. I hope we don’t do that. We can judge men and women based on their qualifications, without looking through their résumé for some organizational endorsement.”The Biden administration is on the clock: For the next 18 months, while Democrats know they have control of the Senate, their mission is to fill as many vacancies as possible, as quickly as possible. In early June, Biden’s first two judicial nominees were officially confirmed by the Senate. These were not the harbingers of a new mold of progressive judges. Both candidates, Julien X. Neals and Regina Rodriguez, came out of corporate law and had been knocked by activist groups, including Demand Justice. These were revenge nominations: Neals and Rodriguez were both in the cohort of Obama picks whose candidacies withered when Republicans refused to move them through. As senators gathered to vote, Democrats hailed a new era of professional diversity on the federal bench—an aspiration, if not entirely reflected in the day’s work. The long haul is still ahead: A handful of vacancies down, roughly six dozen to fill, and only a few hundred judges to nominate and confirm before Biden can claim a judicial revolution of his own.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0919275315327946,0.4571730754625497,4487,2,The Atlantic
540,‘It’s a toxic-masculinity thing’: Pete Buttigieg faced bitter backlash for taking paternity leave — why it’s time for the stigma to end,-5.33,39.67,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-pete-buttigieg-faces-backlash-for-taking-paternity-leave-some-say-its-important-to-recognize-the-need-for-parents-to-take-time-off-11634326521,https://adfontesmedia.com/marketwatch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-15,25,"Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg is facing criticism over his decision to take paternity leave while the country faces major supply-chain issues. But the controversy is also prompting renewed discussion among parents, parenting experts and others about the need for men to have time off following the birth of a child. Buttigieg, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2020 and former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and his husband, Chasten, recently became parents of twins through adoption. In an early Septembertweet, Buttigieg introduced the couple’s infant twins, saying, “We are delighted to welcome Penelope Rose and Joseph August Buttigieg to our family.”Buttigieg was mostly “offline” from work during the first four weeks of parenting, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation,as reported by Politico. That prompted charges that the transportation secretary was neglecting his duties at a pivotal time, asituation he also navigated when service in the U. S. Navy Reserve required absences from South Bend’s city hall.“‘The pandemic’s siege on mental health is real, with companies reporting that employees’ initial productivity sprints have given way to fatigue.’”Among the most vocal critics was Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who said on his program: “Pete Buttigieg has been on leave from his job since August after adopting a child. Paternity leave, they call it. Trying to figure out how to breastfeed, no word on how that went.”Some critics have accused Carlson of being insensitive and homophobic. But perhaps of equal note are the questions being raised about paternity leave and whether its value and importance is misunderstood by society. For his part, Buttigieg, inan interview late Friday on MSNBC, said Carlson had demonstrated an unfamiliarity with the concepts of both bottle feeding and parental leave. Contrary to Carlson’s biting critique, McKinsey & Co., a management consulting firm, carried out interviews with130 new fathers across 10 countries, and found that paternity leave helps families by strengthening partnerships, supporting women — who overwhelming bear the responsibility for childcare — establishing the sharing of responsibilities from the get-go, and creating a lifelong paternal bond with the child.“The men told us resoundingly that their experience was a positive one, despite some having concerns about what it might mean for their careers,” it found. “While our research focused on heterosexual fathers taking paternity leave, we recognize that there are many other kinds of families (families with two mothers or two fathers, adoptive families, and so on) that face similar challenges and thus can benefit from parental leave.”“Advocates say parental leave ensures that employees are in better shape, physically and mentally, when they return to work and are thus more capable of doing a good job.”In recent years, more companies have offered paid leave to both women and men following the birth or adoption of a child. One survey, from the Society for Human Resource Management and Oxford Economics, found that 55% of employers provide paid maternity leave and 45% provide paid paternity leave. Some states haveeven mandatedsuch leaves, though the U. S. doesn’t have a federal mandate requiring paid parental leave, making it the only industrialized country in the world without one, according tothe Associated Press. Indeed, advocates say these leaves ensure that employees are in better shape, physically and mentally, when they return to work and are thus more capable of doing a good job. But they also say that offering these leaves doesn’t necessarily have to affect a company’s bottom line. If anything, they argue, a leave benefit can serve as an inducement to attract and retain talent. Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian, an advocate of family-leave policies, is among those who say what’s good for parents is also good for businesses. “By introducing better policies, having an open dialogue in the office about parental leave, and finding new solutions to support teams while these new parents are jumping through hurdles at home, business leaders can create a more equitable workplace and, in turn, retain employees,” he toldFast Company. The stakes arguably become higher when the employee taking leave is a chief executive of a company or, in the case of Buttigieg, a prominent government official. But examples abound of those who have done so without issue. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, tooka six-week maternity leavein 2018. And Ohanian,married to tennis star Serena Williams, took a four-month paternity leave from Reddit. Other CEOs and high-ranking executives have done so, as well, be they the leaders ofa small software companyor aone-time managerof FacebookFB. Still, many men and parenting advocates say there is a broader stigma attached to paternity leave, rooted in the traditional ideas that child rearing is a woman’s job and that men must continue to work and provide for their families. That may explain why men hesitate to take extended leaves: A United State Department of Laborreportfound that 70% of men take off 10 days or fewer in connection with the birth or adoption of a child. On top of that, some parents — men and women alike — fear that taking any leave could affect their job security. Ina 2016 Deloitte survey, 54% of respondents said they would be perceived as lacking commitment to their job if they took parental leave. The paternity-leave situation is unsettling to men like Marley Jay, a Brooklyn, N. Y., father of two sons. He took time off after the birth of both of his boys — in the case of his younger son, an eight-week paid leave that Jay much appreciated.“It’s a toxic-masculinity thing,” he said of the backlash to paternity leave. “It’s sad that people can’t conceive why people would want to spend time with their newborn children.”Similarly, Tim Anderson, an Austin, Texas, father, said he was grateful even for the two-week paid leave he got after the birth of his son seven years ago. For him, the leave was especially critical because he had to tend to his wife, who was recovering from an emergency C-section.“‘It’s sad that people can’t conceive why people would want to spend time with their newborn children.’”But Anderson also said the bonding time with his child proved invaluable. “I did feel more connected [to the baby]. I wasn’t just this person coming home at the end of the day,” he said. Some men, however, are responding to the issue by not only asserting the need for paternity leave, but also fighting for the legal right to take such time off. Derek Rotondo sued his employer, JPMorgan ChaseJPM,+0.58%,for its alleged refusal to grant a 16-week leave. The case resulted in a $5 millionclass-action settlement. And the pandemic has also raised the stakes men who want or need to take paternity leave. “While the challenge of getting men to take paternity leave is long-standing, the COVID-19 crisis has created fresh urgency for companies grappling with how to support employee well-being.” the McKinsey report found.“The pandemic’s siege on mental health is real, with companies reporting that employees’ initial productivity sprints have given way to fatigue,” it added. “Diverse employees have been hit especially hard — including working parents, who continue to feel the stresses of balancing work and childcare.”What’s more, McKinsey found that many of the 130 fathers the company interviewed “said that they felt more motivated after taking leave and that they were considering staying in their organization longer. They also said that the leave led them to change the way they work, becoming more productive and prioritizing their time better.”To be sure, many women note that the need for paid maternity leave is still not as widely recognized as it should be. They speak to the fact that such leavesare often falsely seen as some kind of “vacation”rather than a critical time to tend to and bond with a newborn.“I can’t imagine anyone thinking this is a vacation,” said Emily M. Dickens, chief of staff and head of government affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management. Dickens balked at the idea that a top government official like Buttigieg can’t take some time off for a newborn.“No one is not replaceable. … Federal employees are talented and trained to step in,” she said, when such needs arise.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1855274550011391,0.4957346016556541,1861,3,MarketWatch

Year-round, there’s about an hour of partial light before sunrise and after sunset. To find sunrise and sunset times for your area, check an astronomical table, such as that attimeanddate.com. On spring-forward day — March 14 this year — sunrise in the San Francisco Bay Area is around 7:15 a.m. and sunset around 7:15 p.m. Three stages of twilight, each about half an hour long, are delineated by the angle of the sun in relation to the horizon. The darkest of the twilights is; to an astronomer, it’s not the same as night, but to the layman it’s close enough. Nautical twilightis a deep dusk — dim bluish sky, bright planets visible. Incivil twilight, the sky is light all over though the sun is not visible. Following are some observations of those stages, with an eye toward how they look to pedestrians and cyclists.: Half an hour in which it goes from dark to some lightening of the sky and pale or reddish at the eastern edge. Trees and buildings can be seen sharply against the sky, but it’s still very dim on the ground — it would be easy to step into a hole, and pedestrians would probably want a flashlight or headlamp. Bicyclists on the street definitely would want the full complement of lights.: Half an hour in which the sky lightens all over. At the start of civil twilight, the sky is light blue and colors of objects are easier to detect. By the midpoint, you can read a newspaper outside under open sky. Pedestrians no longer need a light but would probably want reflectors or bright clothing if they’re near traffic, especially on an overcast day. Technically, the end of civil twilight coincides with. In much of the Bay Area, though, the sun is not visible until about 10 minutes after official sunrise time, because of the hills to the east. And in much of the Bay Area, the sun disappears behind the western hills 10 minutes or more before officialtime. That starts the progression of the twilight stages, the reverse of the morning’s.: The sky after sunset is pale but dusky, often pinkish. Streetlights come on. Good visibility for exercising outside, but you wouldn’t want to be wearing dark glasses, and toward the end of the half-hour you’d want reflectors if you’re near vehicle traffic. The brightest planets become visible, all but the most vibrant colors are muted to shades of gray. Trail running is dicey without a headlamp, particularly if you’re in the trees. By the end of nautical twilight, about an hour after sunset, it is night for most purposes.",3,Reliable,0.110037037037037,0.4229999999999998,626,3,Mercury News

Rather, he said, he was advocating for parents to have the option of sending their children back to in-person classes.“I think parents ought to have that option,” Ashcroft said. “I’ve always been someone in political and personal life that thinks that we need to do things to give parents more ability to be in control of their kids’ education and to make the best decisions for their kids.”Ashcroft’s Democratic opponent, St. Louis attorney and non-profit executive Yinka Faleti, blasted him in a statement released a statement Wednesday.“It is shocking that Jay Ashcroft would make such an abhorrently callous, insensitive and irresponsible statement, suggesting he is willing to risk the lives of parents, children, teachers and school staff so that children can be sent back to school,” Faleti said in a statement. Citing the risks outlined by the CDC and WHO guidelines, Faleti said the schools issue should be left to health professionals.“He just needs to leave it to the scientists,” Faleti said. “Unless he’s an infectious disease expert, I think he’s completely out of his lane.”Ashcroft said the school-opening debate has been completely politicized.“I think only in partisan politics does wanting your children to be the best that they can be, to wanting future generations to be more successful than prior generations, does that somehow become controversial,”he said. Ashcroft said people need to consider ways to make attending school in person risk-free, rather than cancelling it altogether. He highlighted the recent election as an example of safe in-person gatherings.“I think we have a real problem of how people are looking at COVID right now,” Ashcroft said. “Because what people are doing is they’re saying, what is the risk of doing A. And they’re saying, oh, there’s a risk to doing ‘A’ we can’t do it... You have to look at not only what is the risk of A, but what is the risk of not doing A.”",3,Reliable,0.2028373015873016,0.4623511904761904,704,3,Kansas City Star
545,Local ‘Nonpartisan’ Elections Aren’t Really Nonpartisan,21.0,23.33,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2021/05/local_nonpartisan_elections_arent_really_nonpartisan.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-thinker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-23,25,"Unless you’ve been hiding in a basement like Joe Biden, most everything these days is partisan. This is especially true of “nonpartisan” school boards and city councils. Over the last few decades, while Republicans focused their patriotic American flag-waving enthusiasm on state and national elections, Democrats were busy filling school boards and city councils with members who embrace Marxist agendas. With Democrats and Republicans having completely opposing views on vital issues, it is imperative that conservatives know the political party of everyone running for local office. That’s the first step. If the candidate is a Republican, the next step is learning whether that candidate will stand up for conservative principles even if he or she is the minority voice on the council or board. As witnessed too many times, having an “R” after your name offers no guarantees. (For more information, google “Mitt Romney,” “David Valadao” and “Liz Cheney.”)City council and school board members make hiring decisions to ensure the day-to-day operations of their cities or school districts. While politics doesn’t affect every decision (such as naming parks, schools or libraries, where to put a statue, budget planning, contract negotiations, etc.), a candidate’s party affiliation cues voters as tocandidates might possibly vote on crucial issues. For example:– Most city councils determine police department budgets and hire chiefs of police. A Democrat city council member might want to “defund or abolish the police” while a Republican city council member is more likely to support law enforcement and its “serve and protect” mantra. School Boards– Progressives on many school boards want to indoctrinate students with racist social justice/ethnic studies curriculum (aka critical race theory). School boards are also determining what to teach students about American history. Should the curriculum have a positive focus with the Republican-supported “1776 Unites” that features African American historians, academics and advocates who promote founding American values like entrepreneurship, self-determination, and mutual social support? Or should the course be the Democrat-supported “1619 Project” that claims America remains racist to its core due to white privilege?Political parties’ matterThe argument for keeping city councils, school boards, and other local elections out of partisan glare is to ensure that only the best-qualified candidate servesallthe residents. But isn’t that the goal foreveryelected office? Whether it’s state legislatures, U. S. Congress, governor, attorney general, secretary of state, vice president, or president, shouldn’t citizensalwayswant the best-qualified candidate?But what happens when you vote for a Republican who then supports the Democrat agenda that you believe has Marxist undertones? This recently happened to Republicans in a small California city located about 25 miles south of Los Angeles. Following several raucous school board meetings with overflowing crowds, a privately organized community town hall event, and several rallies that generated local and national media coverage, conservatives were dismayed that the Los Alamitos Unified School District unanimously passed the racist social justice/ethnic studies program (designed by the Soros-funded, left-leaning Southern Poverty Law Center). Daniel Pipes, of the respected Middle East Policy Forum,said of SPLC,The SPLC has turned into a left-wing hatchet group, using its accumulated prestige to go after legitimate organizations and individuals. Along the way, ironically, SPLC itself acquired some of the reprehensible characteristics it was created to fight…Many Republicans felt betrayed by Diana Hill, the board’s lone Republican. With national media covering events in the small city, Hill could have introduced the conservative reasons against the social justice/ethnic studies curriculum, which many Americans see as critical race theory glossed over with pleasant-sounding names. MassResistance Organization Director Arthur Schapper, who spoke at the community town hall meeting and attended the May 11 rally in front of the school district said in an email,The fact that the lone Republican on the Los Alamitos Unified School board caved and voted for the corrupt, deceptive, and immoral “Social Justice Standards” demonstrates how political affiliation alone is not enough to ensure that elected officials will do what the people want. It is never enough to elect the “right people”. You must pressure them to ensure that they do the right things. What is needed now more than ever is a MassResistance of parents and outraged citizens in general not just in Los Alamitos but throughout the country to push back on their elected officials and demand that they do the right thing for the students in the schools and the community as a whole. Constant pressure through emails, phone calls, confrontations with the elected officials outside of the school board meeting hall are essential. Local parents need to organize and spread the word throughout their communities about the damaging, sickening programs that their local school boards are promoting. These elected officials need to re-learn the fact that they work for the people, not the other way around. What is the answer? Americans who believe in faith, family, and country must become politically active so that conservative-leaning Republicans are elected, especially in “nonpartisan” local elections. Active means doing whatever you can – from writing letters to the editor and calling and emailing elected officials to joining politically active organizations and attending peaceful rallies. Even running for public office!Founded on Judeo-Christian principles, the United States of America strives for perfection and opportunity for all. The challenge in 2021 and into next year’s midterm election is to keep America free by having conservatives focus on their own neighborhoods. This starts with electing conservative Republicans to school boards and city councils who will push back at Marxist members camouflaged as Democrats. As former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Tip O’Neill famously said, “All politics is local.”",0,Problematic,0.060644623575658,0.3665049509877096,1223,0,American Thinker

549,Here’s what Republicans and billionaires really mean when they talk about ‘freedom’,-23.0,27.0,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/heres-what-republicans-and-billionaires-really-mean-when-they-talk-about-freedom/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,25,"America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word. We’d be better served if, instead, we were debating the meaning offreedom. TheOregonianreported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our small-population state. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has any savings; one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and they’re on the streets. While socialism may or may not solve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem, but as a symptom of a “free” society. The wordsandlibertyare iconic in American culture—probably more so than with any other nation because they’re so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nation’s founding. The irony—of the nation founded on the world’s greatest known genocide (the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native Americans) and over three centuries of legalized slavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slaves—is extraordinary. It presses us all to bringfreedom and liberty toallAmericans. But what do those words mean?If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddies—who slap those words on pretty much everything they do—you’d get a definition that largely has to do with being “free” from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if you’re morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behavior’s impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function. On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty that’s been embraced by so-called “democratic socialist” countries—from Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australia—you’d hear a definition that’s closer to that articulated by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a “second Bill of Rights” to be added to our Constitution. FDR’s proposed amendments included theto a job, and therightto be paid enough to live comfortably; therightto “adequate food and clothing and recreation”; therightto start a business and run it without worrying about “unfair competition and domination by monopolies”; theright“of every family to a decent home”; therightto “adequate medical care... to achieve and enjoy good health”; therightto government-based “protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment”; and theright“to a good education.”Roosevelt pointed out that, “All of these rights spell security.”He added, “America’s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelt’s advice to heart. Progressive “social democracy” has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a century—a mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since the 1500s. Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for today’s GOP. In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of “more industry in government, less government in industry”—privatize and deregulate—and a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent. He kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called the Roaring ’20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like “the right to work” to describe a union-free nation. In the end, the result of the “horses and sparrows” economics advocated by Harding (“feed more oats to the horses and there’ll be more oats in the horse poop to fatten the sparrows”—that generation’s version of trickle-down economics) was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II). Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popular—the only president to be elected four times—the right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called “socialist” programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others. The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwide—nearly 30,000 inMadison Square Gardenalone—encouraged by wealthy and powerful “economic royalists” preaching “freedom” and “liberty.” Like the Kochs’Freedomworks, that generation’s huge and well-funded (principally by the DuPonts’ chemical fortune) organization was theLiberty League. Roosevelt’s generation had seen the results of this kind of hard-right “freedom” rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were then at war. Speaking of “the grave dangers of ‘rightist reaction’ in this Nation,”Roosevelt told Americain that same speech that: “[I]f history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called ‘normalcy’ of the 1920s—then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.”Although right-wingers are still working hard to disassemble FDR’s New Deal—the GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid—we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the United States:The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that “freedom” means the government doesn’t provideof the things listed above. Instead, they tell us (as Ron Paulfamously didin a GOP primary debate years ago) that, if we’re broke and sick, we’re “free” to die like a feral dog in the gutter. Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP. Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society, they tell us, which is why America’s lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest payare almost all in GOP-controlled states. America—particularly the Democratic Party—is engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the wordsfreedomandliberty.

In October 2018, Ulrich was calling his former doctor three times a day, threatening a mass shooting, to blow things up and other revenge scenarios, according to a Buffalo, Minn., Police Department report.""I believe Mr. Ulrich is a high threat to society and himself,"" the doctor told police at the time. More than two years later, Ulrich, 67, was arrested after five people were shot at the Allina Health clinic in Buffalo. Whether he obtained his gun legally was unclear Tuesday. After the 2018 threats, Ulrich was taken to an emergency room for a mental health evaluation. His complaints appeared to stem from a series of back surgeries and medications he took afterward, police said. He threatened four Allina facilities, with Buffalo first on the list, and said he wanted to do something ""big and sensational so that it makes an impact,"" the report said. Allina medical staff believed Ulrich could act on the threats and filed paperwork barring him from the property, which police delivered to his home. Ulrich was charged with violating the restraining order at the Buffalo clinic in November 2018. That case was dismissed last year after he was found mentally incompetent, records show. Neighbor Bob Taylor described Ulrich as a heavy drinker and marijuana smoker who spent most of his time fishing at a nearby lake, and perturbed his neighbors by throwing fish innards in the water after he cleaned his catch. Taylor said he'd lived at the Pulaski Mobile Home Park for about eight years, and Ulrich had been there before him. The park was like a family, he said, ""and he didn't fit in.""""I still can't believe it,"" Taylor said. At a news conference Tuesday, Wright County Sheriff Sean Deringer said Ulrich was ""no stranger"" to law enforcement, saying his office and Buffalo police have been responding to 911 calls related to Ulrich dating to 2003. Court records indicate a history of substance abuse and mental health issues, though Ulrich has never been convicted of a violent or gun-related crime. Ulrich was convicted of two DWIs, an open bottle offense and several crimes related to possessing illegal drugs, according to court records. As Ulrich's case for violating Allina's restraining order wound through the courts, an official wrote in 2019 that Ulrich had previously applied for and been denied a permit to buy a firearm. A court official argued that it was ""highly recommended that [Ulrich] not be allowed to have use or possession of any dangerous weapons or firearms as a condition of his probation.""Raymond Zandstra, who had rented a room in Ulrich's trailer and left on bad terms, said in an interview that he saw Ulrich with a gun last summer, a Smith & Wesson that was new and still in the box. He didn't know where Ulrich got it. In 2019, the Zion Lutheran Church called 911 after receiving a ""disturbing letter"" from Ulrich. Members of the church did not return calls Tuesday, but according to notes from a newsletter on the church website: ""The Buffalo Police Department was called and informed Pastor Ted that Mr. Ulrich is well known to them and recommended that a no trespassing order be issued so that if he ever did appear at Zion the police could take action."" The order was issued the following day and church staff were given a picture of Ulrich and told to call 911 if he trespassed. Walter Rohde, another neighbor, said he was shocked to hear that Ulrich was the man believed to have shot several people at the Allina clinic. ""I just knew him as a kindly old man,"" said Rohde, who lives just a few doors down from Ulrich's trailer. ""He liked to drink, I can tell you that much.""Staff writers Libor Jany, Matt McKinney and Paul Walsh and staff photographer Mark Vancleave contributed to this report.

551,Firing Actors for Being Conservative Is Another Hollywood Blacklist,3.0,40.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/gina-carano-mandalorian-fired-hollywood-blacklist-mccarthyism.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-04-12,25,"In the late 1940s and 1950s, Hollywood studios — under pressure from the right — promised they would not “knowingly employ a communist.” This blacklist eventually became notorious, especially in Hollywood, which came to lionize its victims in several films. And yet it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish the blacklist policy from the emerging current treatment of right-wingers. Earlier this week, Gina Carano, an actor in, was fired from her job after a controversy over an allegedly anti-Semitic social-media post. In short order, UTSA, her talent agency, dropped her as a client. Many media accounts have taken the anti-Semitism charge at face value (: “… an anti-Semitic Instagram Story that she shared from another user.”) The post in question, which triggered a social-media firestorm that quickly led to her firing and loss of representation, was not anti-Semitic by any reasonable definition. The post simply argued (uncontroversially) that the Holocaust grew out of a hate campaign against Jews, which it then likened (controversially) to hatred of fellow Americans for their political views:“Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors … even by children. Because history is edited, most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views”I don’t find this post especially insightful. But overheated comparisons to Nazi Germany are quite common, and, more to the point,. There is no hint anywhere in this post of sympathy for Nazis or blame for their victims. Many of the reports of Carano’s termination string together the trumped-up offense of her post about Nazism with a series of controversial posts. The worst of them is apostinsinuating elections are rife with voter fraud and should impose photo ID — a claim that, while provablyfalse, is also a standard-issue Republican belief. The second-most controversial post in her history is a very small joke, in which she added “boop/bop/beep” to her Twitter profile, before apologizing for the insensitivity of seeming to mock the practice of including pronouns in social-media biographies. The remainder of her case history seems to consist of commonly held beliefs.solemnly reports, “Other posts, including a quote saying ‘Expecting everyone you encounter to agree with every belief or view you hold is fucking wild’ and one saying ‘Jeff Epstein didn’t kill himself,’ remained.” The suspicion that Epstein was murdered is hardly unusual. And Carano’s belief that we should not expect everybody we encounter to share all our beliefs is not only widespread but utterly sensible. Indeed this seems to be the central point of disagreement between Carano and her former employer and client. What’s most striking about the news coverage of Carano’s defenestration is the utter absence of any scrutiny of her employer or her (now-former) agency. The tone of the reporting simply conveys her posts as though they were a series of petty crimes, the punishment of which is inevitable and self-evidently justified. The principle that an actor ought to be fired for expressing unsound political views has simply faded into the background. If you think blacklisting is only bad if its targets have sensible views, I have some bad news for you about communism. While some victims of the McCarthy-era blacklist were liberals or progressives who refused to turn in the names of their colleagues, others were bona fide communists. Dalton Trumbo — a Hollywood writer who was blacklisted, then wrote under front names, and whose story was told in a recent hagiographic movie starring Bryan Cranston — followed the Communist Party line in the Stalin era. When many fellow communists dropped out of the movement after Stalin formed an alliance with Hitler, Trumbofollowedthe new party line. Trumbo gained some martyrdom when he was hauled to Washington to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. “This is the beginning of the American concentration camp,” he warned. (Fortunately for Trumbo, his antagonists, unlike Carano’s, were not witless enough to confuse hyperbolic Nazi comparisons with anti-Semitism.)Of course the point with Trumbo and other blacklist victims was never the soundness of their thinking. Technically, the studios had the legal right to refuse to associate themselves with people who had abhorrent beliefs. But a fairer and more liberal society is able to create some space between an individual’s political views and the position of their employer. A Dalton Trumbo ought to have been able to hold onto his screenwriting job even though he supported a murderous dictator like Stalin. And actors ought to be able to work even if they support an authoritarian bigot like Donald Trump.",3,Reliable,0.0606144442412048,0.5558621425522834,1052,3,New York Magazine
552,Read new Michael Cohen court documents that may offer clues on Mueller probe,-2.67,48.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-michael-cohen-court-documents-that-offer-clues-on-mueller-probe,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"A federal judge in New York dropped a few more breadcrumbs Tuesday around special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, unsealing nearly 900 pages of court documents surrounding Michael Cohen, the former attorney and fixer to President Donald Trump. These are the affidavits and search warrants which gave officers the legal authority to search Cohen’s homes and offices in 2018. In them, officials in the Southern District of New York laid out their suspicions about Cohen, how they planned to investigate and why those warrants were needed. Released months after they were first requested by news organizations, the documents are an early outline of the cases against Cohen, which played out in two separate investigations, one by Mueller’s team and another by federal prosecutors in New York. They also point to the cache of evidence the special counsel’s office has from Cohen and raise questions about who else may be tainted by it. The filings reveal that in July 2017, when Cohen was stillreferring to himselfas the “personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump,” the FBI obtained search warrants for Cohen’s email. Investigators specifically gained permission to search emails dating back to January 2016. That period included the first few months of Trump’s presidency, as well as much of the 2016 campaign. Those are also key, disputed months in terms of Trump’s personal interest in Russia. Michael Cohen recently testified before Congress that Trump continued discussing a possible hotel deal in Russia through the first half of 2016. Cohen had previously testified that the discussions had stopped in early 2016, but later said that was a lie. The White House has repeatedly claimed that Cohen is now an unreliable witness who is inventing stories about Trump in order to gain sympathy in court and reduce his prison time. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and to several counts of campaign and finance violations. Also of interest in the documents: nearly 20 pages devoted to Cohen’s “illegal campaign contribution scheme,” which were entirely redacted by the judge. That is likely a reference to the case in which Cohen pleaded guilty to paying off two women to keep their alleged affairs with Trump silent during Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen has said Trump personally approved of and repaid him as part of that scheme, including making some payments as president in 2017. The White House has repeatedly said Cohen’s account is untrue. According to the court papers, authorities were eyeing Cohen for multiple crimes, including bank fraud and making illegal campaign contributions in the 2016 cycle. A judge approved searches of Cohen’s Park Avenue apartment, downtown Manhattan office, a safe deposit box, hotel room and two Apple iPhones — leading to FBI raids that received significant media coverage last year. But the documents include some interesting details about the searches, such as a note that specifically gave investigators permission to “depress the fingerprints and/or thumbprints of Michael Cohen onto [his iPhone] or hold [the iPhone] in front of Cohen’s face … in order to gain access”. While these are high-profile court papers, they do not substantially add to what we already know about the actions of Cohen or anyone else in the Trump campaign or Trump Organization. But the court filings underline one key aspect of Mueller’s investigation: The special counsel appears to have far more documents than the public knows about — and his team has had those documents for a significant amount of time.",3,Reliable,0.0562362166135751,0.3925079637343788,707,3,PBS
553,"To combat surging COVID-19 cases elsewhere, Connecticut requiring quarantine for travelers from 31 states",0.0,51.0,https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-quarantine-travel-31-states-20200721-hcpnxwig7ncwrdzky47dqjgwd4-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/hartford-courant-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-21,20,"Taking new action to restrict travel from regions of the country with surging COVID-19 cases, Connecticut has added 10 more states to itstravel advisory listand removed one, for a total of 31 states from which travelers are required to either test negative for coronavirus or self-quarantine for 14 days. The growing list means that travelers from much of the country are restricted upon entry into Connecticut. The decision also raises new questions about the ability of sports teams to travel to and from Connecticut. As states across the country see spikes in COVID-19 cases, the number of states on the list has grown larger. Because of this, Connecticut’s advisory list is “a fast-moving target,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday.“Unfortunately it’s not going down, it’s going up,” Lamont said. “I worry.”Thestate’s websitesays the 14-day self-quarantine “is the best option to prevent spread of disease,” but those who cannot quarantine can also enter the state by testing negative for coronavirus within 72 hours before they cross the state line. The self-quarantine measure applies to anyone traveling into Connecticut, whether they’re entering the state by car, train or plane.“You go to a hot spot, you come back to this state, you either have a test that shows you tested negative or you must quarantine for 14 days,” Gov. Ned Lamont said at a Monday news conference when he announced the state would track all arrivals from states on its advisory list. Although the advisory list has been in place since late June, Lamont’s Monday announcement outlined new guidelines that also require travelers to fill out an online form in order to enter the state. That form requires travelers to self-certify that they’re following the self-quarantine guidelines. Travelers who refuse to fill out the questionnaire may face a fine of up to $1,000. Lamont said Monday that the state has “no plans” to begin issuing fines yet. The state “wanted to make sure that people knew how seriously we are taking the quarantine,” Lamont said Tuesday. The governor formalized the new guidelines inan executive order, which the state released late Tuesday evening. The new guidelines take effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday, meaning that travelers entering the state after then will be required to fill out the health questionnaire and follow the self-quarantine protocol. Thequestionnairewas also posted online late Tuesday evening. With well over half the states in the U. S. now on Connecticut’s advisory list, the state is increasingly closing itself off from visitors — and, potentially, from danger. The travel advisory aims to reduce COVID-19 spread from hot spot states, defined as places with a new daily positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents or a 10% or higher positivity rate over a 7-day period. In addition to the 22 statespreviously on the list, Connecticut has now added Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Virginia and Washington state. Minnesota, which was on the list as of Monday, has now been removed. The list also includes Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. Connecticut has coordinated its travel advisory with neighboring states New York and New Jersey, which also expanded their lists and stepped up enforcement in recent days. Lamont said the specter of a fine, and the travel advisory itself, is meant to safeguard the progress that Connecticut has made in fighting back the coronavirus.“The numbers are all trending, blessedly, in the right direction, still,” he said Monday. The new rules are “one more way we can remind people we’re taking this seriously.”The fulltravel advisory listand thehealth questionnairecan be found on the state’s website.

554,Facebook Is Not the Town Square,7.33,31.0,https://www.thebulwark.com/facebook-is-not-the-town-square/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-04,17,"Thecavalcadeofevidencethat Facebook is amonstrosityis hard to keep up with these days. It’s not even shocking anymore. Okay, maybe it can still bealittleshocking. But what can we do? We tried nothing and now we’re all out of ideas!Besides, everyone knows that Facebook is just our new, digital Town Square, right? You can’t blame Facebook if it’s just a distillation of all our worst and best impulses. Except that it’s not. Look, I hear this “Town Square” analogy all the time and it always rubs me wrong. Have you ever been to an actual town and visited its square?Let’s compare them:In a real town square, you can fit, at most, a few hundred people. If you’re in the square of a giant, world-historic city in Russia or China, you might be able to squeeze in 600,000 people. On Facebook, you have . . . everyone on planet Earth!In a real town square, you can see people’s faces and usually you know them already. You can also hear their voices and utilize hundreds of thousands of years of human social evolution to understand the nuanced, non-verbal indicators that contextualize what people are saying. On Facebook, you’re dumped into a group of “friends” you’ve never met, or interacted with—many of whom might not even be actual human beings. And the only help you get in determining social context is a combination of text, emojis, and gifs. If a real town square were suddenly overrun with Adidas tracksuit-wearing strangers who said all sorts of provocative bullshit with heavy Russian accents—well, you’d probably suspect something was amiss. On Facebook, you may be arguing withhired Russian trollswho are actively employed by Vladimir Putin to sow discord in the world. In a real town square, if someone claims they plan to assault you and your family you can punch their physical face with your physical fist. This potential physical consequence greatly reduces the number of times that most normal folk venture such threats. On Facebook, you have to endure anonymous abuse of this nature with absolutely no recourse other than to hit the “report” button and hope that some community standards drone, somewhere, suspends the offending account for a couple days. In a real town square, people who insist that COVID vaccines are filled with mind control nanobots and that the Jews are enslaving children are relegated to the fringes. On Facebook, they are brought together into powerful collectives, afforded megaphones, and algorithmically ushered into everyone’s sphere of influence to corrupt otherwise rational and healthy discourse. In a real town square, if the entire town became convinced that their mayor is the Christ risen and decided that they needed to stockpile AK-47s in preparation for the apocalypse then visitors to the town would quietly leave (and warn the authorities). On Facebook, those folks get a guest pass to every other Town Square—againin the world—and are free to go around preaching their lunacy to others without being constrained by space, time, or economics. In a real town square, the town doesn’t benefit financially by attracting the stupidest/craziest/most pernicious townfolk to the soapbox and then doing everything in their power to make sure the residents of the town are afraid to leave the square for fear of missing something truly terrible. Facebook makes approximately all its money by getting you to rubber-neck through your day as you slow-roll past trainwreck after trainwreck. In the real world, the Town Square stays (as the name suggests) inTOWN!It’s not something that you have to keep track of while you’re putting your kids to bed. Or sitting on the toilet. Or relaxing on the beach. Facebook follows you everywhere—like a psychotic ex. It’s always hiding in the bushes and you have no choice but to wonder what the heck it’s up toright now, even though you know it’s nothing good. You have to stay vigilant and pay attention because that’s how mother nature made you and it’s how Mark Zuckerberg exploits you. But in fairness, there is one aspect of the town square metaphor where Facebook is a pretty decent facsimile of the real thing. It’s the one where we used to drag innocent people to a gallows, accuse them of something completely insane, like “witchcraft,” and then either ruin or end their lives. Facebook is pretty good at that because its fortunes are made by making sure that you keep coming back—it doesn’t matter if you’re sharing pics of kitties, contributing to a genocide, or part of an angry mob that’s destroying someone’s livelihood or reputation on some fanciful whim. What’s another real-world concept where a private unregulated enterprise gets to make a fortune running psychological experiments on the population of the world, which leads to a slow collapse of civil and civic order and drives everyone insane? I’m actually drawing a blank—but it sure as hell isn’t a “town square.”",1,Questionable,0.022463474025974,0.4957041396103896,1114,2,The Bulwark
555,International Monitors Found No Fraud in US Election,-7.33,46.0,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/ranjani-iyer-mohanty-international-monitors-osce-observers-us-election-2020-results-report-10882/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-26,21,"This month’s election was no doubt the most dramatic in recent US history. Given the highly bipartisan political atmosphere, at 67%, voter turnout was the highest since 1900. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there were20% fewer polling stationsopen across the country. An unprecedented 65 million voters opted formail-in ballots, raising fears that the US Postal Service may not be able to handle the amount of traffic in a timely manner. President Donald Trump had already laid the groundwork in the preceding months to claim that the election will be stolen from him and, true to his brand, his team promptly filed36 legal challengesto contest the results; to date, 29 of these have been unsuccessful. More than three weeks after the election, Trump has not officially conceded. The president and his supporters are vociferously and aggressively claiming voter fraud. President-elect Joe Biden and his camp, alongside US election and security officials, are unequivocal that there is no evidence of foul play. At this time of bitter impasse, it would be invaluable to refer to a truly objective, unbiased third party. Fortunately, there is one. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) was founded in 1975. It consists of 57 member countries, and the United States is one of them. A key raison d’être of the OSCE is election monitoring. It assesses whetherelectionsare “characterized by equality, universality, political pluralism, confidence, transparency and accountability.” The OSCE has observed over 300 elections globally, both in established democracies like Canada and the UK as well as in countries like Croatia and Ukraine, where the democratic tradition is still tenuous. A multinational team of experts is on hand before, during and after the vote. Themethodologyis thorough and transparent. The organization has been observing every general and midterm election in the US since the 2000 disputed contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Its presence is particularly relevant at this moment in US history. The OSCE planned to deploy some 500 observers in the 2020 election, but the number was reduced due to the pandemic. By early October, the International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) to the US had some 130international election monitorsfrom 39 member nations on the ground. While some states did not allow international observers full access, most did. And even in states where the observers were not allowed in the polling stations, they at least examined the mail-in process. On the night of November 3, the OSCE delivered a detailed,23-page report, the entirety of which is openly available on the internet. The report covers a lot of ground: the political context and the legal framework of the electoral system; election administration and observation; voter rights, registration and identification; candidate registration (no room for birther controversy here); campaign environment and finance; the role of the media; legal complaints and appeals; as well as new voting technologies and the conduct of the election itself. It also explains IEOM’s process, observations, analysis, conclusions and recommendations. Anyone with any doubt about possible voter fraud and whether the election was legal will be assuaged by the report’s conclusion that “The 3 November general elections were competitive and well managed” and that, “In general, IEOM interlocutors expressed a high level of confidence in the work of the election administration at all levels.”The report also offers two chilling warnings. First, it states that “Baseless allegations of systematic deficiencies, notably by the incumbent president, including on election night, harm public trust in democratic institutions.” Second, it surmises that “Numerous ODIHR interlocutors noted that the judiciary has become highly politicized and indicated that this would have an impact on the rules governing the holding of these elections and possibly the outcome.” This report is preliminary. The IEOM remains on the task and will release a final report in early January. Interestingly, the presence of international election monitors in this United States has been virtually ignored by the media, the public and the politicians themselves. On the one hand, it’s understandable. Given the US-centric focus of many Americans, they may not even be aware of the role international observers play in US elections. Those who claim that the election was stolen from Donald Trump are certainly not going to point out that there is an objective assessment of the validity of the voting process. In fact, President Trumpfiredthe director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Chris Krebs, for stating that this election was “the most secure in American history.”But why are the Democrats, the left-wing media and indeed anyone interested in proving beyond doubt that the election was fair ignoring the OSCE findings? Perhaps they don’t want to rely on any outside institutions to determine the validity of their election. Or maybe they feel that international monitors are only for banana republics, not for established democracies — and certainly not for the world’soldest democracy. Pride goes before the fall.[newsletter_template]Susan Hyde, a professor of political science at the University of Berkeley, California, and an experienced international election monitor,saysthat “In countries that are very divided, it can be hard for citizens to know which sources of information are objective because it seems like every domestic audience has a dog in the fight.” Sheexplainsthat international observers can “act as an external but credible resource for voters and for political parties.” International monitoring missions do not stand for Democrats or for Republicans — they stand for democracy. On the one hand, it may be ironic that the United States should be in need of the services of international election monitors. But it would be even more tragic if the US did not use their essential, objective and readily available expertise and their vital findings at this critical juncture in its democracy.

""We opposed this shocking violation of privacy, alongside many victims’ rights advocates.""Uber disclosed the existence of thousands of sexual assaults nationwide in its2019 safety report. Afterward, the CPUC demanded detailed information about cases that occurred in California—including the time and place where assaults happened and names and contact information of witnesses. The CPUC order doesn't specifically ask for the names of victims. However, in many cases the victim would be the only witness, so CPUC was essentially seeking to unmask hundreds of sexual assault victims. Uber objected, noting that most of the victims had not consented to have their identities or stories shared with third parties. Even if the records were kept confidential, Uber argued, a CPUC investigation of these cases could force victims to revisit one of the most traumatic moments in their lives. In a revised order, the CPUC allowed Uber to submit the information under seal to ensure that the data did not become public. But beyond that, the CPUC refused to budge, issuing a second order in January demanding that Uber turn over the data. Victims' rights groups like the Rape Abuse Incest National Network (RAINN) rallied to Uber's defense. ""RAINN is exceedingly concerned that the Commission's ruling"" directs Uber to ""share a list of victim names, contact information, and additional incident details with the Commission, without the consent of the victims,"" the group wrote in an August filing with the CPUC.""The vast majority of sexual assault victims choose not to report to police,"" RAINN added. ""Surely, they never envisioned that a state regulatory commission would require disclosure of information that they, themselves, have explicitly decided to not share with the state.""RAINN argued that enforcement of the CPUC's demands would ""nullify each victim's right to decide when, and to whom, to disclose their assault"" and would ""risk re-traumatization of victims.""But the CPUC seemed unmoved by these arguments, whether they came from Uber or from groups like RAINN. In aMonday ruling, the agency held that ""this decision does not require thedisclosure of such information that could potentially traumatize the victims a second time."" Instead, the agency reasoned, the rules ""require only that the information regarding sexual assaults and sexual harassment be submitted to the Commission under seal.""The CPUC concluded that Uber had ""refused, without any legitimate legal or factual grounds, to comply"" with the data request. The agency held that Uber's actions were particularly severe because they had ""harmed the regulatory process.""In setting a fine, the CPUC is supposed to consider whether a party's actions were in the public interest. But in Uber's case, the agency concluded that ""there are no facts to mitigate the degree of Uber's wrongdoing."" So the CPUC slapped Uber with a harsh $59 million penalty. Ironically, after hitting Uber with a massive fine for refusing to name sexual assault victims, the ruling allows Uber to submit its data in anonymized form.""Uber shall work with the Commission's staff to develop a code or numbering system as a substitute for the actual names and other personally identifiable information"" of victims and witnesses to assault cases, the ruling said.

BREAKING: The Chicago Teachers Union has released a list of demands it wants met before members return to schools, including lower COVID-19 test positivity rates, testing and vaccination protocols and changes to both hybrid and remote learning.— Chicago Sun-Times (@Suntimes)December 10, 20201,000 of the new employees will be categorized as “cadre substitute teachers.” This means that they possess a license to teach in the State of Illinois. They will also receive benefits and be eligible as prey for CTU membership. The additional 1,000 new hires will be considered part-time employees. They will be ineligible for benefits and will not be paid for their 45-minute lunch breaks. They willbe eligible prey for the CTU. One of the primary tasks for the lower-tier 1,000 hires will be student supervision, including supervising “students who are learning in person if [the] classroom teacher is teaching remotely.”Of course, this verbiage calls into question myriad issues including what that in-person instruction entails and how that will square with the CTU contract with CPS.“Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Stacy Davis Gates said, “CPS can try to exploit low-wage temporary workers to fill in for staff who are not willing to sacrifice their lives for their livelihoods, when they must instead come to the table and bargain collaboratively to land what we need to return to our school buildings and our students safely – enforceable safety standards and real equity for Black and Brown school communities starved of equity for years before this pandemic.”Prior to the move, CPS mandated mask requirements, social distancing between students’ desks, student temperature sampling, the installation of new air purifiers, upgraded ventilation, and a sea of COVID-based upgrades in line with other major school systems around the United States. CTU blusters about “staff who are not willing to sacrifice their lives for their livelihoods” in the face of a virus that has a 98.18 percent survival rate among those who have been diagnosed with COVID and a 99.905 percent survival rate national, and two vaccines have been deployed against the “dreaded” virus.

It is part of The Democratic Squad's effort to put increasing pressure on Biden in his response in dealing the violence which has lasted 10 days and killed more than 200 people. An early draft of the joint resolution of disapproval (JRD) was obtained by Jewish Currents and is co-sponsored by Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, the two other squad members Ilhan Omarand Ayanna Pressley, as well as Representatives Mark Pocan, Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Pramila Jayapal and Betty McCollum.'At a time when so many, including our President, support a ceasefire, we should not be sending 'direct attack' weaponry to Prime Minister Netanyahu to prolong this violence. It is long past time to end the US policy of unconditional military arms sales, particularly to governments that have violated human rights,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote in an email calling on her congressional colleagues to support her bill. The squad-backed resolution would halt the transfer and sale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Small Diameter Bombs from the U. S. to Israel. Both bombs are outfitted with special guidance systems intended to hit specific targets. They announced their move on the day Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he wanted a 'significant de-escalation' and said he wanted an eventual ceasefire. But Netanyahu defied Biden's request and said he would continue attacking Hamas. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (right) and other Democrats will introduce a resolution that would block Joe Biden's $735 million sale of bombs to Israel in the midst of their growing conflict with HamasBiden held an intense, nearly eight-minute conversation with Tlaib on the tarmac in Dearborn, Michigan on Tuesday. She criticized Biden's response to the conflict and said US-bought explosives shouldn't be used on schoolsOn Tuesday, Tlaib confronted Biden when he landed in Dearborn, Michigan for a tour of a Ford plant.'Palestinian human rights are not a bargaining chip and must be protected, not negotiated,' Tlaib told him, according to her congressional office.'The U. S. cannot continue to give the right-wing Netanyahu government billions each year to commit crimes against Palestinians,' she continued, an aide told NPR. Israel used JDAMs and Small Diameter Bombs in its recent attack on Gaza. It's unlikely, however, that the resolution will pass the 51-member committee, which includes a number of pro-Israel legislators on both sides of the political aisle. On Monday, a report from unnamed sources revealed the U. S. approved a week before the conflict broke out a $735 million weapons deal that included the precision-guided missiles. Omar, the first Muslim woman elected to Congress and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, blasted the deal with Israel, who is a top recipient of U. S. military aid.'It would be appalling for the Biden administration to go through with $735 million in precision-guided weaponry to Netanyahu without any strings attached in the wake of escalating violence and attacks on civilians,' the Minnesota representative in a statement.'If this goes through this will be seen as a green light for continued escalation and will undercut any attempts at brokering a ceasefire,' she continued. A report revealed the deal was approved a week before the conflict in the Middle East broke out, but the sale of the weapons produced by Boeing in the U. S. still needs congressional approvalOmar said Washington shouldn't 'stand idly by while crimes against humanity are being committed with our backing.'The arms deal has to make it through congressional review before it is finalized. A group of 28 Democratic lawmakers, led by Jewish Congressman Jon Ossoff of Georgia are calling for a ceasefire to 'prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence'. The conflict so far, which has seen a barge of bombs between the two nations, has killed over 200 people and sparked a humanitarian crisis. After reports emerged of the sale and as the conflict with Israel and Hamas escalated, Biden held a phone call Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to a readout of the call, Biden justified Israel's actions as self defense.'The President reiterated his firm support for Israel's right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks. The President welcomed efforts to address intercommunal violence and to bring calm to Jerusalem,' the readout states.'He encouraged Israel to make every effort to ensure the protection of innocent civilians. The two leaders discussed progress in Israel's military operations against Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza. The President expressed his support for a ceasefire and discussed U. S. engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end.'Israel argues it has only sent bombs into Palestinian territories where it feels it has evidence Hamas is operating – including in a media building leveled by an Israeli airstrike.

According to the call, Biden stopped short of calling for an 'immediate' cease-fire. The readout concluded 'the two leaders agreed that they and their teams would remain in close touch.'Biden's statement came the same day Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell mocked efforts to apply equal pressure on Israel and Hamas.'To say that 'both sides' need to de-escalate downplays the responsibility the terrorists have for initiating this conflict in the first place, and suggests Israelis are not entitled to defend themselves against on-going rocket barrages. I completely reject this obscene moral equivalence,' McConnell said. IfNotNow, Center for Constitutional Rights, Friends Committee on National Legislation, Jewish Voice for Peace, Churches for Middle East Peace, and Defense for Children International–Palestine are all backing the progressive lawmakers' attempt to block the bomb sale.",3,Reliable,0.0122344322344322,0.3783516483516483,1462,1,Daily Mail

Charlie Baker to stick with a Democrat if Sen. Elizabeth Warren lands a Cabinet post hours after the Republican governor vowed to veto it and others slammed the idea. A budget amendment by Amherst Democrat Rep. Mindy Domb — backed by a handful of members from the liberal side of the delegation — would have changed the way vacancies are filled. It would require successors from “the same political party as the person vacating the office” until a special election is held, 145-160 days after the vacancy occurs. Domb’s reasoning for the amendment, she said, is to “keep the voters’ faith” and protect the tight “balance of power in the US Senate.”“I don’t think it should have to be part of President-elect (Joe) Biden’s calculus in creating the most effective administration he can assemble. The MA Congressional delegation is filled with rock stars. They all happen to be Democrats. So I guess in that way it protects our delegation and the choices that the commonwealth’s voters have made,” Domb told the Herald. Former Warren challenger Republican Geoff Diehl accused Democrats of “playing king of the hill.”Boston University professor and political historian Thomas Whelan said, “This comes down to a raw power grab.”The amendment was the “latest shining example” of rewriting of election laws that have become somewhat of a pastime for Democrats in recent Massachusetts history. Democrats began to tinker with election laws in 2004 — over then-Gov. Mitt Romney’s veto — blocking appointment power to stop a potential vacancy from then-Sen. John Kerry who was running for president from falling into Republican hands. Kerry lost his presidential bid, but the rule change endured. It came into play again in 2009 upon the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy when Democrats moved to allow then-Gov. Deval Patrick to appoint a temporary senator until a special election could be held 145 to 160 days after the vacancy arose. He tapped former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk. State Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons was quick to point out the “hypocrisy” in the law changes. Whelan said the flip “spectacularly backfired” on Democrats when Republican Scott Brown beat then-Attorney General Martha Coakley to finish out Kennedy’s turn. Democratic strategist Scott Ferson called the change “needless” this time around.",3,Reliable,0.1242146742146742,0.4933635808635809,508,3,Boston Herald
562,Danielle Campoamor : New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation. But more heads need to roll.,-6.0,33.67,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo-announced-his-resignation-more-heads-ncna1276494,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"After an independent investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James concluded thatGov. Andrew Cuomo had sexually harassedat least 11 women, Cuomo announced Tuesday thathe was resigning. “The best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing, and therefore, that’s what I’ll do,” Cuomo said during a news conference. “I work for you, and doing the right thing is doing the right thing for you.”In so many instances, big and small, progressive organizations, institutions and people want to avoid the messiness of holding their own accountable in the name of the “greater good.”While Cuomo resigning is the right thing to do, it is far from enough. Continued focus and pressure on those who enabled Cuomo is just as vital if we are to truly hold abusers, those who validate them and the institutions built specifically to protect them accountable. Which is why the resignation that preceded Cuomo’s by one day carried its own special significance: that ofRoberta Kaplan, who had legal ties to Cuomo and, according to James’ report,assisted in trying to discreditat least one of his accusers. Kaplan stepped down as chairwoman of Time’s Up amid public criticism, including anopen lettersigned by myself and 29 others affiliated with the organization, which was founded inresponse to the #MeToo movement. Time’s Upraises money to support victims of sexual assault and, per its website, “fights for a future where no one is harassed, assaulted, or discriminated against at work,” making her involvement in Cuomo’s legal troubles a clear violation of all the organization claims to care about. The revelations about her behavior underscore how enablers work to prop up those at the top, how widespread they are among the circles of those in power — and how they are just as likely to come dressed in sheep’s clothing as in a wolf’s. (Cuomo has deniedthat he sexually harassed anyone, andKaplan has cited her workas a practicing lawyer in staying mum.)Kaplan’s resignation, like Cuomo’s, was a right and necessary step, but it’s merely a balm on the open wound of pervasive gender-based violence and harassment that has long penetrated progressive institutions and organizations. Yes, those who actively caused harm must resign or be removed from office — but that is the bare minimum. Until we remove those who value adjacent power over people, the status quo over systemic change and their own voices over the voices of those they claim to support, cycles of abuse will continue. I joined with other sexual assault victims and survivors, current and former Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund clients and former Time’s Up staffers insigning the open letteraccusing the organization of being “complicit in enabling abuse” by prioritizing a “proximity to power” over victims, for many reasons. I am a victim of sexual assault and will always stand behind and beside victims and survivors as we all work together to create a safer, more equitable society free from gender-based violence. And I believe in accountability, not just when it’s easy to wield but especially when it’s painful to execute. But the main reason I signed the letter is because a singular focus on powerful, predatory men is, simply put, not enough. I watched people try to deflect attention from Cuomo by comparing him to GOP transgressors who haven't been held accountable, the “What about the Republicans?” tweets that turn acts of harm into partisan talking points. I listened to people lament the fact thatMelissa DeRosa, a top aide to Cuomo, resigned before her boss — as if women cannot perpetuate wrongdoing by cozying up to influential predatory men so they can wield some modicum of influence, too. I could see the mental math done by some who truly believe keeping harmful people in positions of power is worth it as long as it’s their people. This has happened before — a hesitancy to hold supposed allies accountable for fear the optics are less than ideal and a belief that a person’s professed ideology is more important than their actual behavior. New YorkSen. Kirsten Gillibrand was chastisedfor calling on then-Minnesota Sen. Al Franken to resign afterphotos surfaced of him apparently groping a sleeping woman. Abortion rights and other reproductive justice organizations werefractured by infighting over how to react to sexual assault allegationsagainst prominent abortion provider Dr. Willie Parker. In so many instances, big and small, progressive organizations, institutions and people want to avoid the messiness of holding their own accountable in the name of the “greater good.”Which is why it’s hardly a coincidence that in theTime's Up response to the open letter, the organization urged its “sisters and allies” not to “lose sight of the broader work or let a man’s treachery overshadow it in any way.” It went on to say that while it does not “ask for a pass,” it does “ask for perspective.” The message was clear: We know what’s best, and we need you to prioritize our so-called mission over the harm we have caused. It’s an ask we survivors have heard time and time again. Be patient. Think of the bigger picture. There is honor in martyrdom, after all. But as sexual assault victims and survivors, we are the authority, which is why these messages discrediting both survivors’ stories and our abilities are perhaps the most detrimental: They uphold the notion that survivors and victims are powerless. We’re told we cannot advocate for ourselves but must instead trust someone else to be the expert in our own lived experiences; that we are not powerful enough, connected enough, credible enough — or, simply, enough.“I sometimes see advocates say, ‘We’re a voice for the voiceless,’ and it enrages me,” Alison Turkos, a multiple-assault survivor who organized the open letter, said about those who shroud themselves in allyship as they pursue their own self-interests.“Survivors have a voice, and when you operate from the belief that survivors are voiceless, then you participate in actively silencing us,” she told me. “Survivors can speak for ourselves. That was proven yesterday with this letter and is proven time and time again when survivors share their stories and break the world open.”The bar for holding powerful men accountable is low — that Cuomo managed to lift his pinky toe in order to clear it is worth acknowledging. But it is just one of the many steps we as a society must take to truly hold everyone accountable.

564,New search launched for meth sobering center site – The San Francisco Examiner,-1.33,47.67,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/new-search-launched-for-meth-sobering-center-site/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-24,19,"NualaIn February 2020, San Francisco was gearing up to open the nation’sfirst sobering centerspecifically for people who use methamphetamine. The center — which would take people who are high on the drug off the streets, providing them safety, medical care, and resources — was the primary recommendation of theMethamphetamine TaskForce, created in 2019. With the blessing of the mayor, plans were developed speedily to erect a tent in a parking lot of 180 Jones St. in the Tenderloin, with the goal of opening in spring of 2020. Then, the pandemic hit. Health organizations scrambled, redirecting resources to battling the virus. The opening of the meth sobering center, which was designed to include a large congregate room, was postponed, and 180 Jones St. became a pop-up safe sleeping site. Now, nearly a year after plans for the sobering center were put on hold, the project has been relaunched. But instead of a tent in a parking lot, The City is looking for a brick and mortar location. And the facility won’t just house the meth sobering center, but also a future safe consumption site — if and when California legalizes a pilot program to open one. Sobering centers are not a new idea. Since 2003, San Francisco has run an alcohol sobering center, located on Mission Street in SoMa. It takes in more than 5,000 people each year, many of whom are brought in via paramedics. In addition to providing medical support and care, the center makes direct referrals to Joe Healy, an alcohol detox program. The alcohol sobering center’s design is very intentional. The room can be seen in its entirety through windows in the staff office. Its 12 beds are low to the ground, with mats next to them, so that if someone falls out of one, they won’t sustain serious injuries. Showers and bathrooms are ADA accessible. Nurses are on hand to monitor visitors’ vital signs. All told, most people who are admitted stay six to 12 hours, before being transferred to a detox center or discharged back to the streets.“When those folks were developing their model [for the methamphetamine sobering center] they asked our in-house experts about what they need to know,” said Alice Moughamian, the alcohol sobering center’s director, noting that many people involved stopped through for tours. “Thinking about what substance people are intoxicated on really impacts how you want to physically lay out your sobering center to make sure people are safe and succeed.”On Feb. 11, HealthRIGHT 360 CEO Vitka Eisen spoke at a community meeting in the Tenderloin with San Francisco Director of Public Health Dr. Grant Colfax, left, and Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, director of Mental Health Reform at San Francisco Department of Public Health, center. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)People who are intoxicated by alcohol have very different needs from people who are high on methamphetamine. In 2019, Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, San Francisco’s director of Mental Health Reform, toured drug sobering centers in Houston, Texas, Portland, Ore. and Los Angeles for inspiration on design.“Methamphetamine is what we call a stimulant,” Nigusse Bland explains. “It’s very similar to cocaine, and it tends to cause people to have really erratic behavior. They often feel overheated. And they can be really, really confused and disoriented. On the street, you may see a person that’s pacing, engaging in repetitive motions, talking to someone that’s not really there, maybe yelling at someone because they’re having a surge of emotions. And they’re having delusions that something’s happening to them or that they might be in danger.”With that in mind, the methamphetamine sobering center being designed in San Francisco will have room for people to pace, and be active. But once they come down, they may feel exhausted, requiring a bed to sleep in for up to a day. Kathleen Silk is the managing director of behavioral health at HealthRIGHT 360, which will operate the sobering center once it opens. She helped design the first model for the tent at 180 Jones St.“The plan was a really simple one in terms of having a space for people to be quiet and sleeping, as well as active and having some tactile stimulation and an outdoor area,” she said. Storage would be built for people’s belongings, and bathrooms with showers would be installed. But plans were abandoned when the pandemic hit.“Because of the affordable housing development slated for 180 Jones St., that location for the drug sobering center was always going to be temporary,” explained Jenna Lane, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Health. “When the pandemic forced us to postpone opening a new congregate setting and to redesign it with COVID-19 distancing in mind, that shortened the amount of time we could use the space at 180 Jones St. enough that it became wiser to look for alternatives. That search continues, and SFDPH looks forward to opening a site that can serve the community for the long term.”Now, Silk is working with The City to identify a brick and mortar space, and a new design, somewhere in SoMa or the Tenderloin.“We do still want the model of a larger indoor space where we can have eyes on everybody, and a combination of different levels of activity,” Silk said. At the same time, there are new concerns about air flow and safety during the pandemic. “With COVID, there’s a ton of other implications, like what type of AC or HVAC system we’ve got going, or the capacity of people,” Silk said. “We had been playing with around 12 to 15 people for beds, or upwards of 20. We’re not trying to overextend ourselves. We run some programs that are like 60 or 70 people. That’s not what this is going to be.”The pandemic provided the time to pursue a more permanent location, but it also gave HealthRIGHT 360 the opportunity to launch its Street Crisis Response Team, which will be a key component in bringing people to the sobering center. The team, which began operating in November, consists of a paramedic, a peer support counselor and mental health therapists. Currently, it only takes calls in the Tenderloin, but the pilot program will eventually be expanded citywide. According to Silk, “They cannot wait for this to open.”Intake to the sobering center is being carefully strategized. In addition to the Street Crisis Response Team, HealthRIGHT 360 plans to launch a dedicated outreach team specifically to find people having a hard time with their methamphetamine experience, and a van to transport them to the center. Referrals will also be accepted from EMS-6, The City’s paramedic team dedicated to working with people experiencing homelessness.“Coerced involvement in this project is not what we’re going for whatsoever,” Silk said. “This has to be totally voluntary. When people are forced or given an ultimatum by law enforcement, their presence in the milieu is really disruptive and not what we’re going for here. We did not want a situation where it’s like ‘this or jail.’”And, once word gets out, Silk expects people to walk in on their own.“At its best, this is a program where if I use drugs, I can go there myself,” she said. “I know I can knock on the door, I’m going to be invited in, and I’m going to get the resources I need, and I am not going to be told I have to stay there forever. And if I do want to sleep it off and stay there a little bit, it’s a welcoming community.”Kathleen Silk of HealthRIGHT 360 appeared before the San Francisco Health Commission on March 3, 2020, days before plans for the methamphetamine sobering center were paused due to COVID. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)^The creation of a space for people to safely ride out their methamphetamine high is one thing, but creating a route to care is an entirely different beast. People who use opioids — like heroin or fentanyl — have a variety of medications they can choose from to help withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. But despite its rapid rise in San Francisco, there are no government-approved medications to treat methamphetamine use, making treating people who are addicted to the drug tricky. What is available are treatment centers. In San Francisco, many of them are run by HealthRIGHT 360. By operating the Street Crisis Intervention Team, the methamphetamine sobering center, and both inpatient and outpatient addiction services, HealthRIGHT 360 will soon be able to move people through its systems of care fairly seamlessly.“I think one of our huge strengths for this is that not only do we have those robust programs in the area, but we also know 24-hour treatment,” Silk said. “It’s our bread and butter, and we do it well.”This means that people who come into the methamphetamine sobering center will not just receive a respite from the streets, but opportunities to receive care — from doctors who specialize in addiction medicine, to residential treatment centers, or even just an appointment with a dentist. For Silk, it’s also important that staff are trained at every level, from janitors to medical professionals. It’s her goal to make sure that every interaction with people who come in off the streets is as positive as possible. “Wherever people are willing to engage with us, we will do it,” she said. That commitment to meeting people where they’re at, and addressing their needs in the moment, is a vital key to recovery. Moughamian, from the alcohol sobering center, says they have people who come in 150 to 200 times a year. “The top 1% of our utilizers are actually 30% of our visits,” she said. Those high-utilizing visitors receive a high level of case management, and are also able to walk in without referrals. In other words, recovering from addiction requires patience. “It’s important that we acknowledge that recovery is not a linear kind of path,” Nigusse Bland said. “It takes some time. We expect people to want to return here when they’re under the influence, because the other consequences are far worse. We want them to feel this is a safe place to be.”Opening the first methamphetamine-specific sobering center in the nation is groundbreaking in itself, but San Francisco is already looking ahead. In December, state Sen. Scott Wiener reintroduced legislation to establish a safe consumption site. While it still has to clear the California legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, plans are already developing to combine a future site with the methamphetamine sobering center. In 2020, 699 people died of drug overdoses citywide. Silk said a safe consumption site is desperately needed, particularly in the wake of 699 overdose deaths that occurred across the city in 2020. “When people use in secret, they die, and when they use alone, they die,” she said. But for her, the safe consumption site and the methamphetamine sobering center are just two more resources for people who use drugs to receive the support they need. “I think one of the biggest barriers for people getting into substance use treatment is shame, and stigma,” she said. “If we are showing compassionate, non-judgmental service, we will see a higher rate of people saying, ‘you know, if HealthRIGHT can do this with me, or if Glide can allow me to do this, I can trust them a little bit further and potentially see what recovery could be like.’”There is no clear timeline on when either facility will open, but the hunt is active. And as for a name? The verdict is out. When the sobering center was slated to open at 180 Jones, HealthRIGHT 360 was toying with the name “Project 180.” Now, the organization plans to open up name ideas for the site to the community it will serve. That might come sooner than anticipated.“I have a feeling that a week from now, if we’re able to find the right space, it’ll all be happening very quickly,” Silk said.",3,Reliable,0.0699420486920487,0.4244952269952272,2706,3,SF Examiner
565,"How Hurricane Ida’s path, climate change, and Covid-19 made the Gulf vulnerable",-8.33,42.67,https://www.vox.com/22648189/hurricane-ida-new-orleans-louisiana-flood-climate-change-covid,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-30,25,"Hurricane Idamade landfall in Louisiana on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, as an enormousCategory 4storm with sustained winds of 150 miles per hour and gustsup to 172 mph. The storm tore roofs off buildings, flooded homes, and left the entire city ofNew Orleans in the dark. Ida will likely be one of the worst extreme weather events of 2021, a year already swelling with heat waves, wildfires, droughts, and storms. “Hurricane Ida is one of the strongest storms to ever hit Louisiana,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a statement on Sunday. The storm is still churning and turning east through Mississippi. Though Ida has been downgraded to a tropical storm, more devastation is likely in store. The nation will learn more about local impacts as communities regain access to electricity and spotty communications. Even after the winds die down, the towering storm surge will likely linger for days and impede rescue and recovery efforts. So will the coronavirus pandemic: Less than half of Louisiana’s population is vaccinated, and 2,600 patients were hospitalized for Covid-19 as Ida made landfall. The size and uncanny timing of Hurricane Ida makes it impossible to avoid comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm thatkilled at least 1,170 people and tied 2017’s Hurricane Harvey as the costliest disaster in US history. While levees appear tohave protectedmuch of the state from Katrina-level flooding so far, some similarities are likely to emerge: Structural inequities and vulnerabilities remain, and communities of color are still at high risk from hurricanes like this. But much of Katrina’s toll in human suffering and devastation became visible in the days and weeks after the storm, in part due to a botched relief effort. It will take time to figure out whether Louisiana, the city of New Orleans, and the US as a whole learned the lessons of Katrina in advance of Ida. Related“People think of a few common themes when they think about hurricanes in New Orleans,” including levees and the legacy of Hurricane Katrina, Lamar Gardere, executive director of the Louisiana nonprofit the Data Center, wrote to Vox on Sunday, shortly after evacuating the city. “But every hurricane boils down to a story about infrastructure, inequity, and climate change/coastal land loss.”“These are the same stories that affect much of our country, but they come into acute focus with immediate and dramatic effect during these events,” Gardere added. Cities along the Gulf Coast have spent billions over the past decade and a half building up their defenses — levees, sea wall, flood control mechanisms. But populations have grown, the oceans have risen, and the planet has warmed. The threat of extreme weather is growing, and it’s becoming harder to adapt. Millions of people live in the US Gulf Coast, which is one of the country’s fastest-growing regions and stretches across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Between 2000 and 2016, the population in the regiongrew by 25.4 percent, compared to 14.8 percent across the US as a whole. That in turn has fueled a construction boom of homes, businesses, infrastructure, and industrial facilities, particularly for the oil and gas sector. Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, an oil and gas hub that experienced some of the storm’s most extreme winds and storm surges. Much of the new construction is in low-lying areas prone to coastal inundation, with someplaces lying below sea level. Parts of theGulf Coast are sinkingas the soft ground settles beneath heavy construction and changes in land use, a phenomenon known as subsidence. The coastline itself, which can serve as a barrier against storms, iswearing awayas rising seas erode the shore. Changes to waterways like the Mississippi River have also diminished vital sources of sediments for replenishing the coast. All this means that lots of people and property are in harm’s way when disasters occur. And Ida took an especially destructive course through major population centers. The risks, however, are not distributed equally. Many lower-income communities and those populated by people of color have less protective infrastructure like levees and sea walls, leaving them vulnerable to storms and rising water. The people in these communities also often have themost difficulty getting out of the path of the stormas they struggle to find adequate money and shelter to evacuate. In May, the NOAA forecasted that the US Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from late May until the end of November, had a 60 percent chance of being “above normal.”So far, that prediction has come to pass. “After a record-setting start, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season does not show any signs of relenting as it enters the peak months ahead,” said Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator, in anAugust statement. This year’s season is below the record-breaking season last year, which was thebusiest on record. But there are several factors this year that are fueling a more active year for tropical cyclones. Ordinarily, a key factor is sea surface temperature. Hurricanes need water to be at least 26 degrees Celsius, or 79 degrees Fahrenheit, and the warmer water gets, the more energy is available to form storms. Water temperatures in the Gulfspiked ahead of Hurricane Ida, but sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic this year have generally beennear average levels. Still, forecasters are anticipating a strongerWest African monsoon, which helpsbirth hurricanes. Meteorologists are also expecting less vertical wind shear in the atmosphere, which are changes in wind speed and direction that can rip apart hurricanes before they form. Another factor that favors more active hurricane seasons: Since 1995, the Atlantic Ocean has been in the warm phase of a decades-long ebb and flow in ocean temperatures, known as the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation. The planet is warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. That amplifies the raw ingredients of hurricanes and can worsen storms. While researchers are still parsing the climate signals in Hurricane Ida, scientists have known for decades that climate change worsens hurricanes for several reasons. Sea surface temperatures are rising, which infuses storms with more energy and can increase their intensity.“As the climate warms, we expect that the upper bound of how intense a hurricane can get ... goes up at a certain rate with warming and that’s been known for 33 years,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Vox last year. Another way climate change makes hurricanes more destructive is by increasing their rainfall. Air soaks up about 7 percent more water for every degree Celsius the air warms, so warmer air means more moisture is available for precipitation. Extreme rainfall events are on the rise, and Ida drenched parts of Louisiana with as much as24 inches of rain. Rising sea levels due to the melting ofice caps and the thermal expansion of waterare leading to largerstorm surges, too. This coastal flooding, driven by a storm’s winds pushing water inland, is often the deadliest and most destructive element of hurricanes. Ida created a storm surge as high as16 feet. Climate change is also causing the rapid intensification of more hurricanes. NOAA definesrapid intensificationas a gain of 35 mph or more in wind speed over 24 hours. Ida strengthenedfrom category 2 strength (with winds up to 110 miles per hour) to category 4 strength (with winds topping 150 mph) in less than a day. Hurricanes tend to rapidly intensify when they pass over a patch of water that is warm, deep, and calm. These changes in wind speed can make the difference between a building surviving a hurricane and being obliterated by it. Experts have been warning for more than a year that ahurricane striking during a pandemicwould pose unique challenges, and health officials are worried more difficulties may arise in the wake of Hurricane Ida.“We’re having a situation where even when you’re stretched to the limit — to superimpose upon it what will likely be a historic weather environmental catastrophe — is going to do nothing but make things much, much worse,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, toldCNN on Sunday. Hospitals are contending with power outages, and many are unable to relocate their patients because othermedical facilities in the region are already full of Covid-19 patients. For evacuees in shelters, it’s proving hard to maintain social distance. The risk of further transmission is high, given relatively low vaccination rates across the Gulf Coast and the spread of the more-transmissible delta variant. Hurricane Katrina took a devastating toll on communities of color, and advocates fear these communities will again suffer some of the worstimpacts of Hurricane Ida. Indigenous communities in the bayou have been hit by catastrophic flooding, said Donny Verdin, a member of the tribal council of the United Houma Nation. “We have people who stayed behind whose houses were flooding and roofs were blown off as they were in them,” Verdin, who evacuated to Texas on Saturday, told Vox on Monday. The United Houma Nation is typically overlooked by federal relief, Verdin said, because it’s not a federally recognized tribe. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he said, his community relied on donations and nonprofit organizations instead of support from the federal government. “We’re just left to fend for ourselves,” he said. “The community usually pulls together and we build back. It’s what we’ve done forever.”Storms and sea-level rise fueled by climate changehave been pushing tribes further inland, away from their traditional territories. The majority of Verdin’s community used to live right on the coast: “We are people of the water,” he said. After Katrina, three-quarters of them moved inland, Verdin told Vox.“The community is not as close as it once was because people are more scattered,” he said. “The best-case scenario is that we are able to relocate our communities. The worst-case scenario is that they wash away.”Relocating communities who have lived in coastal Louisiana for generations comes at a steep cost. “Our access to the natural resources and food security has been everything for our sovereignty,” said Monique Verdin (no direct relation to Donny Verdin), another member of the United Houma Nation who works with the community group Another Gulf is Possible. “When you take the people away from the bayou you’re literally taking them away from their ability to feed themselves.” Plus, at the end of the day, she told Vox, “you can’t run from climate change.”It’s hard not to draw ties between Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Katrina, one of themost expensive storms in US history. The storms landed on the same day of the year and in roughly the same spot. They had similar wind speeds. They even gained strength by passing over a similar patch of warm ocean water in the Gulf that fuels hurricanes,the AP reported. There are some important differences in the storms themselves — Ida caused a weaker storm surge but had stronger winds, for example. But even if all things were considered equal, Ida is likely to be far less devastating than the 2005 storm. Katrina was destructive in part because of structural issues with the region’s system of levees — many of which failed — and a botched government response to the crisis, as Vox’s German Lopezpreviously reported. Here’s how Lopez put it:The government response was so wildly incompetent that it allowed the worst of the catastrophe to continue and sometimes created entirely new, unnecessary problems. People will always have to deal with unavoidable natural disasters, but a poor government reaction and preparation can lead to many more deaths and untold costs. The US government also failed to evacuate tens of thousands of people who couldn’t afford to leave Louisiana before the storm hit, Lopez reported. The levee system is much stronger today, after a $14.5 billion investment in storm protection authorized by Congress in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers has since constructed hundreds of miles of levees around New Orleans,Reuters reported, some of which are30 feet tall. They appear to be working, with onlya small numberof levee failures reported outside of the city. The governorsaid on Mondaythat the state’s storm protection system performed “extremely well,” afterstating earlierthat they were “built for this moment.” (His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)The details of Hurricane Ida’s devastation will trickle out for days to come, as officials survey the damage and conduct search-and-rescue operations. “I fully expect [the] death count will go up considerably throughout the day,” the governor told MSNBC on Monday. And if past hurricanes are any guide, the government’s ongoing response to the storm — including its long-term follow-through — will shape the region’s recovery and its resilience to future hurricanes. There will be more storms, and in a warming world, they’ll get worse. At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

566,China: America’s hidden target in Trump’s ‘historic’ Israel-UAE deal?,-3.33,44.0,https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3098838/china-americas-hidden-target-trumps-historic-israel-uae-deal,https://adfontesmedia.com/south-china-morning-post-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-29,25,"The framework of the trilateral agreement, announced on August 13 by the UAE’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash and lauded as historic by the Trump administration that brokered it, contained plans for a maritime security alliance, analysts and commentators told.“It’s too early to see how this plays out, but already there are concerns in Beijing about what this means for the Belt and Road Initiative,” Ramani said.“It may be understood by all parties that the US is promising trilateral economic cooperation at the expense of China,” said Kelsey Broderick, China analyst for the Eurasia Group, a New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy.“However, it seems unlikely that the US asked for a list of specific anti-China measures from Israel and the UAE as a component of the deal,” she said. Ramani said the agreement was also greatly influenced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who since 2018 has ratcheted up pressure on Washington’s Middle East allies to pick sides in its diplomatic and economic confrontation with China.“The US certainly is paying more attention to the China-UAE relationship than ever before,” Ramani said. The US State Department has been “especially vocal about the need for countries in the Gulf to choose between the US and China,” he said. China is a major trading partner of the UAE and Israel. Emirati ports transship about 60 per cent of all westbound Chinese maritime trade, and the UAE accounts for 28 per cent of China’s non-oil trade with the Middle East, the principal source of oil for the world’s biggest importer. The UAE is home to more than 4,000 Chinese companies doing business throughout the Arab world and Africa, and to some 200,000 Chinese nationals, earning Dubai the nickname “Hong Kong east”. Most Chinese firms are based at the Jebel Ali free zone operated by Dubai’s state-owned DP World, the leading container terminal operator in the Arabian Peninsula and South Asia. In neighbouring Abu Dhabi, the largest of the UAE’s seven emirates and its seat of political power, Cosco Shipping Ports has established its Middle East hub at Khalifa Port – 25km south of DP World’s mother hub of Jebel Ali. Leveraging its joint venture there with the leading European shipping line Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC), the Chinese maritime industry leader boosted cargo volume at Khalifa Port by 82 per cent within six months. Kamran Bokhari, director of analytical development at the Centre for Global Policy (CGP), said Abu Dhabi’s recent actions had much less to do with Israel specifically than they did with the UAE’s “efforts to try and manage a precarious regional security vacuum”.“It has to do with the Emirates’ efforts to assume charge of Arab diplomacy in order to manage regional security interests at a time of uncertain American intentions and when Turkey is pressing ahead with its efforts to become the hegemon in the Middle East,” Bokhari said in a recent analysis published by the CGP, a think tank based in Washington. Thus far, the UAE has enjoyed the US security umbrella, but “that umbrella is becoming increasingly unreliable as Washington has been moving away from heavy lifting vis-a-vis regional security needs”, he said.“Abu Dhabi knows that the US strategy for the Middle East increasingly relies on regional players to take the lead, and this is driving Emirati behaviour,” Bokhari said. Ben Scott, director of Australia’s Security and the Rules-Based Order Project at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, said Abu Dhabi’s growing doubts about Washington’s resolve and staying power had accelerated its growing ties with China. This has further deepened the divergence of interests in the region between the US and the UAE. Abu Dhabi has distanced itself from Washington’s policy of sanctions-based “maximum pressure” towards Iran, which it fears could provoke a devastating war in which its oil-production facilities, ports and free zones would be targeted. It has also parted ways with the US in Syria, which the UAE has worked to bring back into the fold of the Arab League, both to counter Turkey’s military intervention and to reduce President Bashar al-Assad’s economic dependence on Iran.“Abu Dhabi needs to realign with the US foreign policy consensus. But there are few foreign policy issues on which Republicans and Democrats still agree. The fact that one of those points of agreement is opposition to China has only added to the UAE’s problems,” said Scott, in a report published by the Lowy Institute. He said the UAE’s decision to “normalise” relations with Israel was driven by its need to strengthen bipartisan support in the US Congress and improve its image with the administration that will take power after presidential elections in November.“The UAE has gone a long way to restoring its standing in Washington and probably given itself more room to move with China. But managing US-China rivalry will remain a daunting challenge, even for the shrewd and capable Emiratis,” Scott said. As for Israel, its exports to China almost quadrupled between 2009 and 2018, hitting US$4.79 billion, according to World Bank data. Its imports more than doubled to US$10.46 billion in 2018, making China its second-largest trading partner behind the US. Meanwhile, the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Co (CHEC) is developing Israel’s second commercial port at the town of Ashdod. The Chinese investments have taken place as part of Israeli government reforms to expand and privatise its ports. Chinese firms are expected to be leading contenders for stakes in Haifa and Ashdod ports. China’s concerns have been fuelled by Pompeo’s recent ultimatum to Israel and the fallout. During a visit to Jerusalem in May – his first overseas trip since the coronavirus pandemic – Pompeo reiterated warnings that Washington would reduce intelligence sharing with Israel if it allowed large-scale Chinese participation in infrastructure projects. But the US, which is in the process of withdrawing combat forces from the Middle East, has demanded a more exorbitant price for buttressing Israel and the UAE against their regional competitors Iran and Turkey: it wants Abu Dhabi and Jerusalem to act in concert with it against Beijing.“It definitely seems that Washington is trying to convince some Middle East countries to choose between aligning with either China or the US, likely with an eye on China’s expanding investments in the region,” said Broderick. Washington is seeking to belatedly avert Beijing’s fait accompli of building a vast network of ports and industrial free zones stretching from South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa. China is very close to connecting its “string of pearls” network of military and commercial facilities in the Indian Ocean with the one it is building along the eastern Mediterranean seaboard. Shanghai International Port Group is due to launch operations next year at a new container terminal it is developing at Israel’s sole commercial port of Haifa, under a 25-year lease signed last year. Despite Pompeo’s claims that China could use it to spy on the US Navy, which frequents the port, Israel has rejected Pompeo’s demands to cancel the Chinese lease for Haifa. Israel had faced the most US pressure, Broderick said, “but I doubt Israel will act against the belt and road to the same extent as the US, unless China-Iran security cooperation significantly ramps up”. China and Russia recently led opposition to a failed US attempt to indefinitely extend the UN Security Council’s embargo on arms sales to Iran, which will now expire on October 18. Since 2012, CHEC has also worked to rehabilitate the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli, which markets itself as a logistical hub for Syria. Cosco and its partner shipping lines would add them to service loops meeting at the Greek port of Piraeus, which it has majority owned since 2016. Working primarily with MSC, which has since become its partner at Khalifa Port in Abu Dhabi, Cosco has transformed Piraeus from a backwater into the Mediterranean’s second-busiest maritime trade hub. This connection “would align very well with China’s strategy for the belt and road”, Broderick said.“An early focus on investing in critical assets has given way to a new focus on connecting these assets in [belt and road] participating countries,” she said. China had been working with members to sign trade facilitation, port, and customs agreements to reduce trade costs for Chinese exporters and importers, she said.“China has one unique advantage over other lenders, which is quick and ready capital,” Broderick said.“The question for Lebanon would be the availability of other countries and companies to compete with China: concerns over Chinese influence and debt will be void if the US or other regional players do not step in and offer to help,” she said. However, to make any further inroads against the belt and road, the US would first have to persuade Israel and the UAE to deny Chinese exports access to the shipping services that will soon be established between the two new diplomatic partners – a situation that seems highly implausible. In any case, Israel’s trade with the UAE will be centred at Haifa’s Chinese-operated container terminal.“Beijing may hope to leverage its goodwill in the UAE to boost the relationship with Israel at a time when the US is pushing back on Chinese investment in the country,” Eurasia Group analyst Broderick said. Emirati enthusiasm is driven, in part, by its need to avoid competing with the belt and road, which mirrors Dubai’s model of creating state-of-the-art sea-air logistics hubs and industrial zones like the one at Jebel Ali. Before the unveiling of the belt-and-road plan, DP World had already established its own global network of ports, including four in China – one of them in Hong Kong. China has already established an alternative hub for its export trades at Gwadar, the focal point of the US$60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The largest country-specific programme of the belt-and-road plan, CPEC has vastly improved connectivity along China’s sole overland access route to the Indian Ocean first established in 1978. China is also invested heavily in Oman’s industrial free zone at the Arabian Sea port of Duqm. Valued at US$10.7 billion upon completion, it is the single largest belt-and-road project in the Middle East and represents a means of bypassing the Strait of Hormuz – and DP World’s mother hub at Jebel Ali – especially in the event of a conflict in the Gulf. As a much smaller state and major trading partner of China, the UAE in 2015 took the prudent decision of promoting DP World’s ports and free zones as a pre-existing facilitator of China’s commercial belt-and-road objectives when it was launched. Both sides have benefited from this commercial collaboration, with their bilateral trade rising by about 10 per cent a year since 2015 to reach US$50 billion last year. However, because of the UAE’s long-standing enmity with Iran, it is determined to secure its commercial shipping through the Bab El-Mandeb Strait. As a major participant in the Saudi-led coalition which has fought the Houthis in Yemen since 2015, the UAE has gained “privileged access” to Aden port. At its behest, southern Yemeni separatists have also seized the Socotra Archipelago, strategically located at the mouth of the Bab El-Mandeb Strait. Djibouti hosts China’s sole overseas military base, along with naval facilities used by the US, France and five other nations. Chinese port operators and DP World are also at odds in fragmented neighbouring Somalia. Like in Djibouti, a 2017 agreement between the administration of the breakaway Puntland region and P&O Ports, a DP World subsidiary, to develop the port of Bosaso has fallen into dispute. Again, China was the beneficiary – despite being an ally of the central Somalia government in Mogadishu. Soon after being elected president of Puntland last year, Said Abdullahi Deni travelled to Beijing, where he awarded a contract to develop the Red Sea port of Eyl to state-owned China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation.“Djibouti-style disputes and rivalries are likely in the near future,” Ramani said. Alan Abbey, a veteran commentator based in Jerusalem, said Israel – like its new diplomatic partner the UAE – wanted to placate the US, their key security and diplomatic partner, but not at the cost of antagonising China and damaging their economies.“Israel and the UAE share the delicate and difficult tasks of managing relations with both the US and China, whose conflicts are out in the open and growing daily. This is a long-term challenge both countries face,” said Abbey, who is a research fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem.“Despite their strengths – oil and capital in the UAE and military smarts in Israel – each are small fish needing to swim with, yet dodge the sharp teeth of, two giant sharks,” he said. Like the US, Israel is closely monitoring China’s moves in Lebanon because it has been encouraged to prop up the economy and redevelop Beirut by the Iran-backed Hezbollah political party and militia, with which Israel fought a 34-day war in 2006. Hezbollah forces have been a key component of the foreign military coalition, spearheaded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, that turned the war in Syria in favour of the Assad regime with the aid of Russian air power. Israel frequently launches missile attacks on Hezbollah and Revolutionary Guard bases in Syria located near Damascus.01:36China’s ambassador to Israel Du Wei found dead in his Tel Aviv home“Israel is no stranger to the axiom ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’,” Abbey said. “I suspect that Israeli leaders are smart enough to understand the iron fist inside the Chinese-made velvet glove of investment, cultural exchanges and joint ventures,” he said. “Yet even a love tap from such a hard hand can be dangerous to one’s health.”China, too, has been characteristically cautious about trumpeting its potential investments in Lebanon and Syria. “We’ve seen that it’s usually others who talk up the China option,” said Guy Burton, author of. Assad had called China a “friend” and encouraged it to become a more active reconstruction partner, he said, “yet the Chinese have not said anything specific on the matter, just warm words”. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah did the same in Lebanon and the recent talk about the China-Iran deal last month were “other examples of supposed pariahs pointing out that they have options that don’t rely on the West”, Burton said.“But where are the Chinese in all this?” he asked. “You don’t hear them saying anything, which only adds to their allure while also increasing their stature.”■",3,Reliable,0.0429482829904178,0.3512151612432512,3221,3,South China Morning Post
567,The cost of applying for U.S. citizenship is dramatically increasing,1.33,45.67,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2020/08/05/cost-applying-u-s-citizenship-dramatically-increasing/3291246001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/az-central-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"It's going to cost more to apply for U. S. citizenship. A lot more. Starting Oct. 2, legal immigrants eligible to apply for citizenship willpay $1,160if they submit their application online, or $1,170 if submitting a paper application. Under the new fee, immigrants will pay at least $520 more to apply for citizenship. That is more than 80% higher than the current application fee of $640. It's also the second biggest jump in the naturalization application fee in history, analysts say. Most of the fee waivers that allowed lower income immigrants to apply for naturalization for free are also being eliminated. And for the first time, people fleeing persecution in their home countries will have to pay a $50 fee to apply for asylum if they are not in deportation proceedings. In the past, there has been no cost to apply for asylum. The new fees and elimination of many fee waivers are part of an overall adjustment of immigration benefit fees that will increase by 20% on average and generate an estimated $1 billion in revenue. The new fees were finalized Monday. U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that processes immigration benefits, says the fee increases are needed to offset the higher cost of processing applications for immigration benefits, including the Trump administration's attempt to crack down on fraud and increase the vetting of immigrants applying for benefits.“USCIS is required to examine incoming and outgoing expenditures and make adjustments based on that analysis,"" Joseph Edlow, USCIS deputy director for policy, said in a statement to The Arizona Republic. ""These overdue adjustments in fees are necessary to efficiently and fairly administer our nation's lawful immigration system, secure the homeland and protect Americans.""The agency relies almost entirely on fees. The agency is facing a huge budget shortfall this year and has asked Congress for $1.2 billion to cover the gap. Fees are reviewed every two years. Some fees will decrease under the new changes. The agency last adjusted fees in December 2016 under the Obama administration on average overall by a 21% increase. Supporters say the fee increases are long overdue, and will help make the agency financially solvent again without having to rely on tax dollars. However, analysts said the fee increase will result in fewer legal permanent residents, especially lower-income immigrants, applying for citizenship, limiting their political power because only U. S. citizens can vote. In the past, the Obamaadministration intentionally kept the cost of applying for naturalization low to encourage immigrants to apply for citizenship, said Jessica Bolter, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Only immigrants over 18 who have been legal permanent residents for at least five years, or three years if married to a U. S. citizen, can apply for citizenship. Until now, the lower citizenship application fee was ""in recognition of the value of citizenship and the belief that those who qualify should be able to access citizenship,"" Bolter said. ""So this naturalization fee is increasing more than other (fees) because this administration is trying to make up for the fact that it was held artificially lower in the past.""The large increase in the naturalize fee comes as USCIS is trying to work through a large backlog of citizenship applications exacerbated by the new coronavirus pandemic, whichforced USCIS to shut down in-person naturalization interviews and naturalization oath ceremonies for several months.""So it just adds another obstacle to naturalization for people who might be eligible,"" she said. The 81% increase in the online naturalization application fee (83% increase for paper applications) is the second highest increase ever, Bolter said. The highest increase was in 1999, when under the Clinton administration the fee to apply for citizenship increase from $95 to $225, a 137% increase. Combined with the fee increase, the elimination of fee waivers will result in fewer immigrants applying for citizenship, especially lower-income immigrants, Bolter said. Under the Trump administration, USCIS is eliminating fee waivers for all immigrants, with the exception of a few categories, including victims of domestic violence, crime and human trafficking victims, Afghani and Iraqi nationals who assisted the U. S. government and minors applying for special immigrant visas who still are under supervision of a juvenile court or child welfare agency, Bolter said. USCIS is eliminating most fee waivers for immigrants applying for green cards and for work authorization, she said.""So this is also going to be really impactful,"" Bolter said. ""Not only are these fees increasing but the mitigation measures to ensure that"" immigrants who are eligible but ""simply didn't have the resources to apply"" are also being eliminated. There were about 9.1 million legal permanent residents in the United States in 2019 eligible to naturalize but hadn't, according toDepartment of Homeland Security's most recent data. Of those, the largest share, about 2.5 million, were from Mexico, followed by China, with about 490,000, and the Philippines, with 370,000, according to DHS data. About 810,000 legal permanent residents applied for citizenship in 2018, according to the most recentUSCIS data. Of those, 761,901 became citizens. David Bier, immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that supports higher levels of immigration and foreign workers, believes the combination of the naturalization fee increase and elimination of fee waivers will result in more immigrants deciding not to become citizens.""I would expect you will see more people foregoing that opportunity"" to become full Americans, Bier said. ""Especially when you already know it's not a quick process. It might take over a year or maybe even longer as a result of the"" backlogs of immigrants waiting for their citizenship applications to be processed. He said the fee increases are part of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to restrict legal immigrants to the U. S. USICIS is raising the fees on many other categories of immigration benefits, including for H-1B high-skilled workers, H-2A seasonal agriculture workers and several other temporary worker categories. USCIS is raising fees to cover the increased cost of processing applications for many benefits after the Trump administration implemented many ""onerous"" new regulations that have made applying for certain benefits unnecessarily more difficult, Bier said. For example, the length of some immigration forms are ""double or triple"" than what they were under the Obama administration, and many new questions have been added, Bier said.""All of that requires significantly more staff time,"" Bier said. ""Now we are seeing that reflected in the fees that are going to be charged to sponsors and immigrants.""Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors less overall immigration, supports the fees increases, calling them ""long overdue.""""We need to have fees that are high enough to keep USCIS fiscally stable, and we can’t run our immigration system on the cheap, because there are security considerations and too much fraud,"" Vaughan said in an email. ""Most people agree that US taxpayers should not have to subsidize the cost of adjudicating applications in the legal immigration system, especially when there are also other costs for welfare benefits that they end up subsidizing.""She also supports eliminating many of the fee waivers, which she said have been ""a major fiscal drag on USCIS.""Fee waivers increased under the Obama administration, adding to their costs, she saidIn 2018, USCIS waived fees for 350,000 applicants. These waivers were valued at $368 million, averaging about $1,051 apiece, she said.""That’s a pretty big chunk of the $1.2 billion deficit that they are facing,"" Vaughan said. ""These waivers were expanded significantly after a policy change implemented in the Obama administration. Now Trump is rolling that back a little bit, so that legal immigrants don’t have to subsidize the applications of so many others.""She doesn't believe the fee increases will lead to a decrease in immigrants applying for citizenship. In the short term, the increases may result in a spike in immigrants applying for citizenship before the fees go up in October, she said.""Despite the higher fees, immigrants will still want to become citizens because they love this country and because they want to sponsor family members. I don’t see that changing much,"" Vaughan said. Many fees to apply for immigration benefits are increasing on Oct. 2.* Adjustment of status applicants will pay for their employment authorization application separately as of Oct. 2. So although the base cost is decreasing, costs will actually increase for most applicants.",3,Reliable,0.1276024472365935,0.4202783643637303,1831,3,AZ Central
568,A Brief History of the Flu Vaccine,0.0,52.33,https://weather.com/health/cold-flu/news/2019-12-23-a-brief-history-of-the-flu-vaccine,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-02,25,"desktop or mobile phone. Every year, three to five million people catch a severe flu, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and between290,000 and 650,000 people diefrom it worldwide. Still, thanks to the flu vaccine, this is only a fraction of how many people it used to kill. During thelast major flu pandemic of 1918-1919, it killed between50 and 100 million peoplearound the world. For a long time, scientists had thought that the flu wascaused by a bacteriacalled, but after the 1918-19 pandemic, they started to suspect it wascaused by a virus instead. However, it wouldn’t be until the 1930s that they would confirm that. In 1933, three scientistsisolated the Influenza A virus in ferrets— one of the three types of flu — and in 1936, it was discovered that the virus could begrown inside embryonated chicken eggs, a key step towards making a vaccine. Just two years later, in 1938, Jonas Salk (who would later go on to developthe Polio vaccine) and Thomas Francis developed the first vaccine using fertilized chicken eggs andan inactivated strain of the Influenza A virus. This new vaccine was first used to help protectsoldiers fighting in World War II; it wouldn’t be approved for civilians until 1946. According to a1944 studyof the new vaccine, it helped reduce illness that was accompanied by a temperature above 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Vaccines at this time weren’t as purified as today’s vaccines though, and those impurities could cause side effects, including fever, aches, and fatigue, leading many people toincorrectly assumethey caught the flu from the vaccine. Also, this early flu vaccine only protected against one of the three flu types, Influenza A. There are three types of flu — Influenza A, B and C — and each one has its own viral strain that replicates and changes independently of the others every season. Influenza A and B are the most common. A vaccine against Influenza A did nothing to protect people from Influenza B or C. It wasn’t until 1942 that thefirst bivalent vaccinewas developed, meaning it worked for both an Influenza type A and type B strain. In 1976, a swine flu outbreak hit New Jersey, which incited fears of a new pandemic, soPresident Gerald Fordannounced that the federal government would vaccinate all Americans. Congress approved $137 million for producing a vaccine for this purpose before flu season started. Unfortunately, hundreds of people developedGuillain-Barré syndrome(which causes nerve damage and paralysis) after receiving this vaccine, making many people fear it. The Ford family tried to alleviate fears by televising getting their flu shots, but ultimately theswine flu vaccination programwas cancelled. Despite this setback, production of seasonal flu vaccines continued. Seasonal strains of each type of influenza mutate and change very quickly, so the flu shot is the only vaccine that needs to be continually updated. In 1973, WHO developed amore rigorous process for targeting the strainsthat affect people, and in 1978, the first trivalent vaccine was developed, protecting people against two different strains of Influenza A and one strain of Influenza B. In 2003, the first live attenuated influenza vaccine —FluMist— was approved by the FDA, which contained a weaker, live strain of the virus. It is administered as a nasal spray. Today’s vaccines are much more effective than the early vaccines because a global network of scientists monitor the various strains of the virus. Each year, they determine how they've mutated over the past year, how they are spreading, and try to predict which strains might be most prevalent in the coming year in both hemispheres. They then announce which influenza subtypes should be targeted by vaccines so medical labs can start working on them. The FDA approves the vaccines by the spring, production begins in the summer and it is available at your pharmacy come fall, aka the start of flu season. Of course, flu vaccines are never 100% effective, but they're the best defense we have today. The good news is that they are also widely available and free with most insurance providers.",3,Reliable,0.1632225028058361,0.4866021324354658,916,3,The Weather Channel
569,Crowded Field of Mayoral Candidates Zooming Toward Primary Day,-4.33,47.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/18/crowded-field-of-mayoral-candidates-zooming-toward-primary-day/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-18,17,"“Zoom is not our friend. I just want to be very clear.”Andrew Yang was reflecting on the joy of campaigning, even during a pandemic. He was getting to know his city so well. People were thrilled to see him in the streets. The front-running mayoral candidate, speaking to reporters in Harlem on a frigid March day, seemed also to be growing aware of all he would probably miss: the teeming block parties, the raucous parades, the subway platforms thronged at rush hour.“Most New Yorkers are sick and tired of Zoom,” Yang added. “I think a lot of the country is sick and tired of Zoom.”Though relatively few New Yorkers may be aware of this fact, they will probably be choosingtheir mayor for the next eight yearsthree months from now, on June 22. In heavily Democratic New York City, the primary winner will steamroll over nominal GOP opposition. Incumbents usually get re-elected — Bill de Blasio, for all his challenges, easily did. But this mayoral race, for many reasons, is unlike any other. The vaccination pace is heating up, but COVID-19 still lingers as a threat, shrinking crowds and keeping commuters at home. Mass death rates, along with job losses, have taken a significant toll. In 2013, the last time there was an open Democratic primary, candidates jostled for attention for many months, the race culminating in an election at the close of a turbulent summer. Hundreds of town halls, street festivals, parades, and rallies built to a satisfying crescendo. There were no fewer than three front-runners — City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, thescandalous Anthony Weiner, and, finally, de Blasio — plus a city comptroller’s race that featuredEliot Spitzer, the governor who resigned after he was caught soliciting a prostitute. These days, the primary is in June, not September. After a federal judge ruled that congressional primaries be moved to June to allow sufficient time to get absentee ballots to military voters for the general election, the state legislature eventually decided to set all primaries in June, including the mayoral race. This year, such a condensed contest will probably benefit those who’ve already built up support bases around the city. Yang is well-known to most New Yorkers from his long-shot presidential bid, but the rest of the field is not. The parades and parties aren’t yet materializing. There will be relatively few opportunities to meet voters face-to-face. The race, many campaigns believe, may be decided wholly on screens — traditional cable television, digital advertising, and whatever online chatter can be generated.“In this race right now, it’s really hard to do any level of retail campaigning,” says Peter Ragone, a former senior adviser to de Blasio and a veteran Democratic operative. “It’s really going to be, number one, are you on television? And are you creating any content yourself that has huge levels of engagement?”A traditional Democratic primary in New York City is arrayed around huge parades, captivating stunts for television, and other mass events. All the candidates in 2013 pressed the flesh at the famous West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, with Weinerblaring musicand shouting through a bullhorn on his blue and orange float. The Democratsall staged a sleepoverat a public housing development with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Bill Thompson, the runner-up in the race, dragged reporters on a 24-hour tour of New York City,bringing them to a frozen meat lockerin the pre-dawn hours. Top candidates would routinely invite reporters along for trips to the subway and door-knocking expeditions. Every day promised another debate, a rally with supporters, or a visit to a community center, synagogue, or nursing home. Everywhere were the voters — it was an imperfect system, but ordinary people, on a given afternoon on Broadway or in the South Bronx, could run into the future mayor and strike up a conversation. For the campaigns themselves, there was a feedback loop that is clearly missing now. A campaign event, if well-attended or interesting enough, could draw journalists and end up on the nightly news. This footage could be used for paid television ads a month later. Journalists, meanwhile, could attempt to gauge how well a candidate might be connecting with New Yorkers. Were they becoming increasingly recognizable? Did they have notable interactions with voters?“In every other campaign I’ve worked on, the retail campaigning is front and center. Not only do you get to meet voters, reporters have something to cover, television news stories have rallies to get pictures of, and there’s this whole ecosystem of political communication that goes on apart from paid advertising,” says a top ad maker attached to one of the current mayoral campaigns.“This time around, because we have so little capacity to do old-fashioned handshakes and hugs and big rallies, there’s going to be a greater reliance on paid communication to reach voters — radio, digital, and direct mail.”This isn’t the first campaign to be run during the pandemic. Last year, numerous candidates for state office in New York had to suspend operations and recalibrate for a June primary that came right after the peak number of coronavirus deaths in the city. Door-knocking was ditched and campaigns turned to glossy mailers, digital ads, and phone calls to reach as many voters as they could. But these were all small-scale campaigns, operating in districts where fewer than 20,000 people could vote. The mayoral primary is expected to draw anywhere from 700,000 to a million voters, with many campaigns planning for a spike from the middling 2013 turnout. To make matters more challenging, voters have other pressing concerns. The pandemic is on the wane but remains a concrete, unsettling reality. Then there are thescandals surrounding Governor Andrew Cuomo, all-consuming online, in the newspapers, and on cable television. Granular, daily coverage of the mayoral race — the type seen in 2013 — has been far less evident.“All of our attention is drawn to stuff that isn’t the mayoral race,” said Micah Lasher, campaign manager for Scott Stringer, the city comptroller and one of the leading candidates. The top campaigns are gearing up for heavy cable TV expenditures in the months to come in the hope of breaking through. Most of the campaigns expect to dedicate a far larger share of their spending on television than they would have in a more ordinary year. Others, like the progressive Dianne Morales, who reported that she just qualified for public matching funds, are leaning heavily into digital campaigning, rapidly accruing online followings. One of the mayoral candidates, the financial executive Ray McGuire, is not participating in the public matching funds system at all, a move that will allow him to spend as much as he wants — those abiding by the Campaign Finance Board’s regulations receive generous matching funds in return for adhering to a strict spending cap — but also permit his rivals to spend more as well. A spokesman for the CFB said a determination on whether to raise the cap in the race will be made after April 26, the final deadline for candidates to join the matching funds program. The system is designed to incentivize small-donor giving. While a mayoral campaign can receive a $2,000 check, only donations up to $250 are eligible to be matched, amplifying the power of a $25 or $50 donation. Based on the CFB’s criteria, all participating campaigns will be able to spend at least several million more. The current cap, at about $7.3 million, rises to $10,929,000 if a nonparticipating candidate spends at least $3,643,000. (Surpassing $21,858,000, which the billionaire Michael Bloomberg routinely did, would mean lifting the cap entirely.)McGuire is no billionaire, but he has already spent more than $3.7 million. Raising the cap would most benefit the candidates who have raised enough to take advantage of it: Yang, Stringer, Eric Adams, and former de Blasio counsel Maya Wiley, whose campaign has recently reached the matching threshhold. Stringer and Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, have already banked more than $6 and $7 million respectively. For campaigns, TV advertising is the least efficient but most effective way of reaching a broad swath of voters. Enough older Democrats are still watching CNN and MSNBC every day, as well as local stations like NY1. The ads cannot be perfectly tailored or targeted like digital solicitations on Facebook — a resident of New Jersey can end up seeing a 30-second spot for a mayoral candidate — but they can reach, on a given day, hundreds of thousands or millions of people. It is all exceedingly expensive: a strong ad buy can easily run $1 million a week. With multiple candidates spending millions to purchase ads, there’s a fear of being drowned out. At the same time,notbeing there carries great risk, with a rival hogging precious airtime. A Democrat attempting to break into the top tier, Shaun Donovan, a veteran of the Obama and Bloomberg administrations, has already beenspending on weekly TV ads. (Outside Super PACs arealso stepping upfor Donovan and McGuire.)To complicate the picture in 2021, well-funded candidates will be targeting popular connected TV services such as Roku, Hulu, and Apple TV, which were barely part of the mix in 2013. De Blasio won that race eight years ago for many reasons, including Weiner’s implosion and de Blasio’s own disciplined, anti-Bloomberg messaging, but television played a decisive role. De Blasio was prescient, dedicating a larger share of his campaign spending to television advertising than his rivals and foregoing direct mail. Years later, the“Dante” adis still discussed in mythic terms: how 30 seconds of de Blasio’s biracial son talking about his father’s promise to “really break from the Bloomberg years” captivated Democratic voters and entered the popular culture. Most ads don’t carry such emotional impact — at best, they may introduce a candidate, make an argument, or attack a rival. Yang is thepublic polling leader,and could be, in the weeks to come, the focus of negative advertising, particularly if a wealthy interest group or labor union aligned with a rival decides to spend against him.“It’s not a paper endorsement,” says Kyle Bragg, the president of the influential building workers’ union, 32BJ SEIU.“Our members are super engaged voters.” 32BJ, like several other large unions in the city, is backing Adams, who is shaping up to be Yang’s top rival. Yang has shunned negative campaigning thus far, while Adams has criticized Yang forleaving the cityin the early stages of the pandemic. Some of the Adams-supporting unions could train their fire at Yang if they view him as a durable threat. To drive media coverage, Yang has relied on his Twitter feed, with 2 million followers, and, unlike most of his rivals, frequent in-person campaign stops. Recently, he has started appearing with opponents at events, like thepress conference in Harlemto promote an app for small businesses envisioned by Kathryn Garcia, a Democratic contender and the former Department of Sanitation Commissioner. These sorts of team-ups have grown more common as candidates vie to be second choices for voters whocan now rankup to five candidates. According to Yang’s campaign, media turnout was much higher than a typical press conference, thanks to the unusual nature of a multi-candidate appearance. In 2013, one of de Blasio’s fiercest rivals in the early months was John Liu, the city comptroller at the time. Liu was renowned for hisvigorous campaign schedule, appearing at as many as a dozen rallies, block parties, and subway stops a day. Now a state senator, and happily watching the race from the sidelines, Liu says the candidates must learn to adapt to the new normal: lots of Zoom, lots of TV, and a lot of time online. And get used to not being the center of attention.“It’s New York City. At what given moment is there not a whole lot of shit going down?” Liu asks. “In 2013, we had months of the Weiner circus. I think candidates can be thankful they don’t have to deal with that.”❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

570,House Democrats make their case to Senate Republicans: Trump duped his rioters — and he'll dump you,-20.0,35.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/02/11/house-democrats-make-their-case-to-senate-republicans-trump-duped-his-rioters--and-hell-dump-you/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-11,25,"""His directive is Trump first,"" House impeachment manager and Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island reminded the Senate during the second day of arguments in support of the singular article of impeachment filed against the former president. It's a crucial takeaway that should be heeded by the Senate Republicans who plan to acquit Trump, caring not one bit about the overwhelming evidence of his guilt in inciting an insurrection on January 6. Senate Republicans are putting their loyalty to and fear of the sociopathic man-child from Mar-A-Lago over their patriotism and basic sense of decency. But as Cicilline pointed out, no matter what you do for Trump, no matter how much you debase yourself for Trump, no matter what risks you take for Trump, he will not hesitate to throw you under the bus. The impeachment trial of Donald Trump has been overshadowed by the fact that the majority of Senate Republicans plan to acquit Trump. So the only real question is whether or not the House Democrats who are arguing the case against Trump can maximally expose the cowardice and complicity of the Republicans. House Democrats kicked off arguments on Thursday with a compelling presentation by Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, focused on how the insurrectionists believed they were there on Trump's orders. ""They actually believed they would face no punishment,"" DeGette explained, noting that the ""mob screamed at officers that they were listening to President Trump"" and ""believed the commander-in-chief ordered this.""The rioters were so dead certain that they were safe from consequences, DeGette pointed out, that they didn't bother to hide their identities. On the contrary, as most commentators remarked on in the days after the attack, they were so unafraid that huge numbers of them livestreamed, photographed, or otherwise advertised their participation in the insurrection. The reason these insurrectionists were sure that they'd be free of consequences isn't mysterious. It's because Trump promised them that they'd be safe. In the speech he gave sending the mob to storm the Capitol, Trump literally said, ""When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.""Even as the House managers argued their case, more evidence emerged proving it. New court documents from the Department of Justice revealed, CNN reported, that the leader of the Ohio Oath Keepers, Jessica Watkins, ""believed she was responding to the call from then-President Donald Trump himself."" The documents show that Watkins was deeply concerned ""about taking action without his backing."" As federal prosecutors argued, this was ""evident in a November 9, 2020, text in which she stated, 'I am concerned this is an elaborate trap. Unless the POTUS himself activates us, it's not legit.'""Trump gave the order to ""march"" on the Capitol and instructed that there is ""not going to be cheering so much for some of them."" The insurrectionists felt like they were shielded from consequences and free to ransack the building. After all, Trump promised the rules were now ""very different.""But they were not safe, as DeGette laid out. Over 200 people have been arrested and charged so far, some on very serious charges. Some of the rioters, DeGette noted, have since said they were ""duped"" by Trump,including Jacob Chansley, the ""QAnon shaman"" who became the face of the riot withhis weird buffalo headdress. On Wednesday,a lawyer for another one of the riotersreleased a statementcomplaining that his client, like many who heeded Trump's call, ""will be spending substantial portions if not the remainder of their lives in prison as a consequence. Meanwhile Donald Trump resumes his life of luxury and privilege.""The evidence does point to the long-standing truth grifters like Trump understand: The best marks are people who think they're part of the conspiracy. That's how Trump gets people. He lures them in by appealing to their ugliest impulses — like the growing Republican desire to unfairly seize power by undermining democracy — and then leaves his co-conspirators, who clearly followed Trump because they liked the idea of a fascist insurrection, holding the bag.""He lied to his base, saying this was all okay,"" Rep Ted Lieu of California said during his argument on Thursday. Democrats finished their case against Trump in a way that was just as impressive as they began it, meticulously laying out the facts while not shying away from the emotions brought on by these terrible events. Lieu was particularly hard-hitting, pointing out that, ""When you or I make a mistake and something very bad happens, we would show remorse,"" but Trump's reaction to January 6 was to brag about how perfect his behavior was, showing how intentional this was from the beginning. The Senate Republicans who are lining up to shield Trump should really think long and hard about why on Earth they want to protect a man who wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire. A man who always repays loyalty with spit in the face. A man who thanked his vice president, Mike Pence, for years of loyal service by sending a mob to kill him. A man who, as the House managers amply demonstrated with court documents, didn't care who he killed by inciting an insurrection, even if the victims were his most sycophantic supporters in Congress. But ultimately, the real question isn't whether Trump is guilty. Everyone knows he is. The only question is whether Senate Republicans want to be complicit with an insurrection that directly threatened their own lives. Presumably, they think they're playing 11th-level chess and will get some political advantage out of it. But in the end, they're no better than the morons who stormed the Capitol because Trump told them it was ""allowed."" And if they believe otherwise, it's because Trump has successfully exploited their own overblown egos against them — as he does to all of his marks.",2,Generally Reliable,0.134619521103896,0.6134093163780663,1319,2,Salon

572,4 ex-Minneapolis cops indicted on civil rights charges in George Floyd death,-3.33,47.33,https://www.startribune.com/4-ex-minneapolis-cops-indicted-on-civil-rights-charges-in-george-floyd-death/600054594/,https://adfontesmedia.com/minnesota-star-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-08,25,"A federal grand juryhas indicted four ex-Minneapolis police officerson charges of abusing their positions of authority to detain George Floyd, leading to his death last May. The new charges, unsealed Friday morning, allege Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao used the ""color of the law"" to deprive Floyd of his constitutional rights to be ""free from the use of unreasonable force"" when Chauvin pinned Floyd down with a knee on his neck for more than nine minutes, and the other three did nothing to stop him. ""This offense resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of George Floyd,"" the charges state. Kueng, Lane and Thao appeared at a virtual hearing in U. S. District Court on Friday morning on the charges. They are not in custody. Chauvin is being held in Oak Park Heights prison awaiting sentencing on the state's murder and manslaughter convictions related to the incident. Chauvin also faces a separate two-count indictment alleging he willfully deprived a 14-year-old Minneapolis boy of his civil rights during a 2017 arrest. Chauvin pinned the teenager down and struck him on the head with his flashlight, then grabbed him by the throat and hit him again, according to court documents. Prosecutors tried to introduce the incident in Chauvin's murder trial as evidence of his policing style; a judge deemed it inadmissible. The Justice Department charges come 11 months after the U. S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota announced it was opening a federal investigation, and just weeks after a Hennepin Countyjury found Chauvin guiltyin a livestreamed trial viewed worldwide. The other three former officers are scheduled for trial in August in state court for aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. The federal charges come in addition to the state's cases, meaning all four former officers could face new trials in federal court. The Justice Department investigationhas run parallelto the state's cases. Leading up to Chauvin's murder trial, federal prosecutors believed they had enough evidence to charge him with civil rights violations, but they feared publicity around new indictments would disrupt the state's trial. If Chauvin were found not guilty on all counts or the case ended in a mistrial, the Justice Department planned to arrest him at the courthouse on the federal charges, according to sources who were not authorized to speak publicly. The plan would turn out not to be necessary when Chauvin was found guilty on all charges. The new charges also run in addition to the Justice Department's civil investigation into whether Minneapolis police engage in a pattern and practice of unlawful behavior. Justice officials announced this investigationthe day after Chauvin's guilty verdict. Eric Nelson, Chauvin's attorney in state court, declined to comment. Messages seeking comment were left for the attorneys representing the other three former officers in state court.""The federal government has a responsibility to protect the civil rights of every American and to pursue justice to the fullest extent of federal law,"" said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is serving as special prosecutor on the state's cases.""Federal prosecution for the violation of George Floyd's civil rights is entirely appropriate, particularly now that Derek Chauvin has been convicted of murder under Minnesota law for the death of George Floyd. The State is planning to present our case against the other three defendants to another jury in Hennepin County later this summer,"" Ellison said. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which is providing legal representation for the four officers in their state cases, said it will be doing the same in federal court with the same attorneys. The association otherwise declined to comment on the indictments. Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, whose legal team negotiated a $27 million legal settlement from the city of Minneapolis for Floyd's survivors, said in a statement, ""Today's federal indictment for criminal civil rights violations associated with the murder of George Floyd reinforces the strength and wisdom of the United States Constitution. The Constitution claims to be committed to life, liberty, and justice, and we are seeing this realized in the justice George Floyd continues to receive. … We are encouraged by these charges and eager to see continued justice in this historic case that will impact Black citizens and all Americans for generations to come.""The Rev. Al Sharpton, a longtime civil rights figure who eulogized Floyd at his funeral last year and has been a visible supporter of the family, said in a statement that the news ""shows we have a Justice Department that deals with police criminality and does not excuse it nor allow police to act as though what they do is acceptable behavior in the line of duty.""Referencing earlier instances of Blacks around the country dying in recent years after encounters with police, Sharpton said, ""What we couldn't get [federal authorities] to do in the case of Eric Garner, Michael Brown in Ferguson, and countless others, we are finally seeing them do today. … This is a significant development for those of us who have been engaged in the struggle and police reform movement.""Derrick Johnson, national president of the NAACP, called the indictments a ""step in the right direction"" but said the case highlights the need for police reforms, including implementing a national registry of police misconduct data.""While Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd over 9 minutes and 29 seconds, no other police officer on the scene acted to save his life,"" Johnson said. ""The horrifying actions and inactions of all four police officers resulted in the preventable death of a loving father, son and brother. No police officer is above the law, nor should they ever be shielded from accountability. We need urgent reforms now.""Over the past decade, federal prosecutors have brought civil rights charges against officers in the U. S. 41 times per year on average, according to a report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The most recent federal civil rights trial against a Minnesota officer took place in 2019, for St. Paul officer Brett Palkowitsch. Palkowitsch kicked an unarmed 52-year-old Black man who was handcuffed and being attacked by a police K-9, leaving him with seven broken ribs and two collapsed lungs. The jury found the officer guilty, by a standard of using ""more force than a reasonable officer would use under the circumstances.""The stand-alone indictment of Chauvin relates to a violent arrest captured on body-camera footage, whichprosecutors for the state's case described in court documents, citing it as evidence of Chauvin's brand of violent policing when dealing with suspects who refuse to bend to his will. On Sept. 4, 2017, Chauvin and another officer responded to a domestic assault, in which a mother said her juvenile son and daughter assaulted her. The officers arrived to find the 14-year-old son lying on the floor in the back of the house, on his phone, and ordered him to get up because he was under arrest. When the boy refused to comply, Chauvin grabbed him and wordlessly struck the teen in the head with his flashlight multiple times. The video shows Chauvin using a neck restraint, choking the boy unconscious, then placing him in a prone position with a knee in his back for about 17 minutes until paramedics arrived, according to court documents. In a scene reminiscent of the Floyd arrest, Chauvin held the position even after the child told him that he was in pain and couldn't breathe, and after the mother tried to intervene, prosecutors said. At one point, the boy started bleeding from his ear — from getting hit with the flashlight, he later told paramedics — and he asked to be flipped on his back. He then began crying and again asked to be flipped over, prompting Chauvin to ask if the boy would be ""flopping around at all.""""No,"" the boy responded.""Better not,"" Chauvin said. He kept his knee on the child's back. According to prosecutors, Chauvin's report from the incident suggested that the boy ""then displayed active resistance to efforts to take him into custody"" by ""flailing his arms around."" He went on to write that the boy, whom he described as ""approximately 6'2"" and at least 240 pounds,"" would ""escalate his efforts to not be arrested,"" and because of the boy's large size, Chauvin ""deliver[ed] a few strikes to [the juvenile male] to impact his shoulders and hopefully allow control to be obtained.""Chauvin's sentencing is scheduled for June 25. The state's trial for the other three officers is set to begin Aug. 23.

573,Nominalism: The Engine of Lies,16.0,26.0,https://www.theepochtimes.com/nominalism-the-engine-of-lies_3915215.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/epoch-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"How did we get here? How did we arrive at a place where an individual’s worth depends on their race, gender, or class? How did we come to believe that “equity” has moral precedent over freedom? How have we been led to accept that gender has no meaning outside that given to it by each individual, regardless of sex?The vehicle driving us to the edge of this abyss is nominalism. Nominalism is the philosophical assertion that identity obtains only in the words we use. In technical language, we say that nominalism rejects the existence of universals, which amounts to saying the same thing: Things have no identity outside the words we apply to them. It contrasts with philosophical realism, which recognizes identity as existing inside our pre-verbal experiences of objects, physical and mental. The nominalist doesn’t call something X because it’s X; it’s X because he calls it X. The realist calls a thing X because X is the conventional tag we use for the concept of the real-world thing to which is being referred. Nominalism is a game of pin-the-word on the concept. Nominalists don’t search for truth, they closet it inside a labyrinth of verbiage. A word means whatever is meant by the majority of people using it. It doesn’t even have to be a majority. “Racism is white people” is a belief in ascendancy because those in cultural power insist on it. A word “means” whatever those in power say it means, and by “those in power” I’m referring, in this case, to the media and the academy. They'll tell you that racism means being white, and there isn’t a thing you can do about it, so long as one capitulates to the nominalist thesis that nothing is real outside of the words we use. Most people will, because nominalism is as common as a cold. One might wonder what difference it makes to a transgendered person if society declines to call him a “woman.” Why does a transgendered person insist on outside approval? Because a world in which reality is indifferent to the progressive’s wishes and feelings is a dangerous place, where things, people, thoughts, and emotions have inherent natures that can’t be controlled. Biology means nothing to the true progressive, because the real world, as opposed to the world of words, is empty for them. Only a person’s feelings matter, and these are embodied in the application of appropriate pronouns. The concept of words over nature is nominalism on stilts. In “A Conflict of Visions,” Thomas Sowell wrote of two ways of viewing existence: the constrained vision and the unconstrained vision. In the constrained vision, humans are inherently limited by their nature, while the unconstrained vision admits no natural limits to human activity. The former leads to a conservative mode of governance, taking into account both human freedom and human flaws, while the latter unleashes the power of anyone with a utopian plan to shape a population according to his wishes. This nominal indication of left and right is due to the association of a king with authoritarianism. Only, why did the assembly members who sat on the right favor the king? Because King Louis XVI was the first French king to take seriously the 17th-century French merchants’ cry, “Laissez-faire et laissez-passer; le monde va de lui meme” (“Let things be made and pass without assistance; the world goes by itself”). Even today, Louis XVI is referred to as “the restorer of French liberty.”Orwell pointed out that “freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.” Freedom isn’t the freedom to say the answer to that equation is five if that suits one’s ethnic or gender identity. Freedom isn’t subjectivism—it’s individualism, which is the obligation of every human to discern the real world from his or her perspective, rather than manufacture it according to political ideology or personal feelings. Nominalism postures as “freedom,” but is in actuality ungrounded subjectivism. Realism opens the door to experiencing true freedom, and its most profound issue, beauty. This was the point made by the late U. S. poet laureate Richard Wilbur, when he wrote:“Let dreamers dream what worlds they please,Those Edens can’t be found.The sweetest flow’rs, the fairest treesAre grown in solid ground.”",1,Questionable,0.0130739795918367,0.3212372448979593,968,0,Epoch Times

The Chinese drone giant was named to the blacklist on Friday for “enabl[ing] wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance” — most likely a reference to how DJI provideddrones and other technology to the Chinese government to be used in its Muslim detention camps in the Xinjiang province.“DJI is disappointed in the U. S. Department of Commerce’s decision. Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally,” the company said in a statement to. “DJI remains committed to developing the industry’s most innovative products that define our company and benefit the world.”The company declined to provide any more information about what it thinks will happen as a result of being named to the Entity List. Being on the list typically means US companies are banned from exporting technology to blacklisted companies. DJI not only sells products to consumers, but since it is far and away the market leader, its technology is used by all sorts of companies that need drones or handheld cameras. This is not the first time that access to Chinese drones has been targeted by the US government, usually due to security concerns. The Department of Justicebannedthe buying of foreign-made drones with agency funds in October, and the Department of the Interior said it wouldground its drone fleetwhile it looks into claims of spying and cyberattacks.

The biggest issue we are currently facing is the Colonial Pipeline hack and the subsequent issues that may come of it. Yet despite the natural consequences of limiting one of the biggest supplies of oil on the East Coast, we should be grateful that we have the Biden Administration to calm our fears. As reported yesterday by my colleague, Nick Arama,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm got up in front of the White House Press Corps to do her best impersonation of the love child of Baghdad Bob and Marie Antoinette. Secretary Granholm was quick to tell people that they would not be dealing with any issues if they were driving an electric car and that we are not facing any gas shortages. Certainly, the vast majority of our country does not have the ability to spend $40,000 on a new car, along with all of the required hardware (like home charging stations), to “free” themselves from fossil fuel dependence. I should know. I drive an electric car and paid $5,000 to upgrade my electrical panel and install a car charger to support that decision. Still, those drivers face the limitations associated with mileage limits and the time-intensive charging requirements. Secretary Granholm’s statements regarding shortages also seemed quite out-of-touch (including her condescending smirk the entire time), as we have seen numerous videos of miles-long lines to get gas along the Eastern Seaboard.

578,How COVID-19 affected suburbs' minority communities,-4.17,43.5,https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20201223/how-covid-19-affected-suburbs-minority-communities,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-herald-chicago-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-23,17,"From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, health officials warned that every American was vulnerable to infection and the virus would not discriminate. But that's exactly what it did. Black and Hispanic residents were infected and died from COVID-19 at higher rates than other races and ethnicities in Illinois and throughout the country, provisional data from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. That's the case in Chicago and many suburbs as well. According to data available from the Illinois Department of Public Health and local public health departments:• Deaths of Hispanic residents of Chicago and the suburbs from COVID-19 occurred at a rate two times higher than deaths of Hispanic residents from all causes in 2019.• That disparity is greatest in Kane County, where the rate of death from COVID-19 is almost three times the 2019 death rate of Hispanics from all causes.• Black residents account for 9.8% of the COVID-19 deaths in suburban DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will counties, but for just 6.9% of all deaths in those counties in 2019.“It's unfortunately not unexpected,” said Dr. Kiran Joshi, medical co-leader at the Cook County Public Health Department. “It mirrors what we've seen in public health for decades. COVID just made it worse.”Tracking the disparityWithin weeks of the pandemic taking off in Illinois, Black residents already were experiencing a higher death rate compared to other racial and ethnic groups, IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike noted. Soon after, cases and deaths among the state's Hispanic population exploded, too.“If you know the disparities exist in terms of health outcomes, you can imagine that overlaying a new disease is only going to exacerbate whatever inequities already exist,” Ezike said on April 5. At year's end, the trend hasn't abated. The state's Hispanic population represented just 5.6% of the 108,937 Illinois residents who died in 2019, according to IDPH records. However, a Dec. 12 report from the National Center for Health Statistics shows Hispanics in Illinois account for 17.8% of the state's 12,397 COVID-19 deaths listed in the report. Non-Hispanic Black residents made up 16.4% of the deaths in 2019, but they are 19.5% of all COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, the report shows. Both figures are higher than population figures would suggest, with Black residents making up 13.9% of the state and a much smaller portion of the suburban population — 10.3% of the suburbs overall and 6.3% in the five collar counties outside Cook County, according to census figures. Similarly, Hispanic residents make up 17.8% of the state's population but account for 27.4% of the state's COVID-19 caseload since the beginning of the pandemic, according to recent IDPH figures. And those are only the cases where the race or ethnicity of the infected person is known. Racial and ethnic demographic information is missing from nearly a third of the state's 911,308 cases, according to IDPH. Joshi said fear of drawing the attention of federal immigration authorities has increased the likelihood some residents of Hispanic descent not only will limit the amount of information they give medical workers but also put themselves at risk by not seeking medical attention at all.“You have people who are really afraid to leave their homes to take care of themselves,” Joshi said. History of distrustAbout 76 in every 1,000 Hispanic residents in the state has contracted the virus, according to IDPH and census figures. The rate is 47 in 1,000 non-Hispanic Black residents of Illinois. Among non-Hispanic whites in Illinois, 41 in 1,000 have contracted the virus. Although white Illinoisans constitute nearly 61% of the state's population, they account for less than 51% of the state's COVID-19 cases and 58% of the state's deaths from the respiratory disease. One hurdle for public health officials is overcoming distrust in minority communities stemming in part from unethical practices in the past, most notoriously the Tuskegee syphilis study. Black men were recruited in 1932 into the study, which lacked informed consent and continued without subjects being given penicillin even after the drug emerged as an effective treatment in 1947,according to the CDC. Public health officials are reckoning with the aftereffects today as they attempt to assuage the doubts of millions of Americans over the COVID-19 vaccine.“There's a lot of work to be done there, and there are very valid reasons why that skepticism exists,” Ezike said recently. “Public health has not always done right by communities of color.”Joshi has seen firsthand the suspicion from some of his patients.“Over my career I've experienced many patients who've said, ‘I don't want you experimenting on me,'” he said. “It's part of the narrative and I get it.”Public health experts also point to circumstances that existed long before the pandemic that helped spur the racial and ethnic disparity of this virus's effects. The lack of access to health care, because of geography or inability to pay, is one of the most significant, they said. Minorities are also more apt to live in densely populated areas and in congregate settings, experts said, which increases the possibility of transmitting the virus. Employment also plays a large role as many lower-wage “essential” jobs that can't be done from home are held by minorities, placing them at greater risk.“We will be doing analysis on this pandemic for years to come,” said Kara Murphy, president of the DuPage Health Coalition. “But certainly one of the contributing factors to a person's — and their family's — risk to exposure and to be able to best preserve their safety is the ability to stay at home during this.”Suburban outcomesIDPH officials did not respond to a public records request for racial and ethnic demographic information for COVID-19 cases and deaths by county. The agency collects that information daily but reports it only on a statewide basis on its website. But there are ways to analyze the effects of the pandemic on suburban minority communities. By comparing IDPH countywide demographic data on all deaths in 2019 and the CDC's data on COVID-19 deaths, a pattern of racial and ethnic disparity emerges. In 2019, people identified as Hispanic made up just 9% of the combined deaths in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will counties, according to IDPH data. When it comes to COVID-19, Hispanic residents have accounted for 17.8% of deaths from the virus in those counties, according to CDC figures. The largest gap is in Kane County, where Hispanic residents were 10.9% of 2019's total deaths but are 30.6% of the COVID-19 deaths. Elsewhere, Cook County reported 10.2% of all deaths in 2019 were Hispanic residents, compared to 26.2% of COVID-19 deaths. In DuPage County, Hispanic residents represented 4% of all 2019 deaths but 11.1% of deaths from the virus. In Lake County, Hispanic residents were 6.9% of all 2019 deaths but are 22.5% of the county's COVID-19 deaths. In Will County, Hispanic residents accounted for 6.1% of deaths in 2019, but 14.4% of the county's COVID-19 deaths. McHenry County figures couldn't be analyzed because the CDC's COVID-19 death records were incomplete. For Black residents in Chicago and the suburbs, the COVID-19 death rate isn't as stark, in part because Black Illinoisans already were experiencing a disparate mortality rate, public health officials said. In 2019, the deaths of non-Hispanic Black residents represented 24.4% of all deaths in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will counties. Today, 24.7% of COVID-19 deaths in those counties are Black residents, according to the data from IDPH and the CDC. In Will County, Black residents make up 17.7% of the COVID-19 deaths, compared to 10.6% of all 2019 deaths. Black residents in DuPage County represent 7.7% of the county's COVID-19 deaths but were only 3.8% of all deaths in 2019. In Lake County, Black residents are 10.3% of the COVID-19 deaths, compared to 7.9% of the county's 2019 deaths. In Cook and Kane counties Black residents are dying of COVID-19 at slightly lower rates compared to 2019 deaths from all causes. But in the suburban portion of Cook County, Black residents represent 19.8% of COVID-19 deaths compared to 17.6% of all 2019 deaths, according to data on COVID-19 deaths supplied by the Cook County medical examiner's office and IDPH mortality data for 2019. In Kane County, Black residents represented 4% of COVID-19 deaths, lower than the 5.7% of all deaths in 2019. Kane County also has the fewest COVID-19 deaths among the five counties. The non-Hispanic white population represented 63% of all 2019 deaths in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will counties, according to IDPH records. However, just 45.1% of the COVID-19 deaths were white residents of those counties, according to the CDC. In an effort to combat the health disparities seen during the pandemic, IDPH launched a number of outreach initiatives and made a point of establishing testing sites in communities “disproportionately impacted” by the virus, IDPH officials said. Unfortunately, the potential to understand how well those efforts worked might never be known, particularly when it comes to the demographic details on testing.

It doesn’t.,0.0,45.0,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/21/marjorie-taylor-greene/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-hipaa-shields-her-vacc/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,25,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has been an outspoken critic of vaccines and masks to stop the spread of COVID-19. After she tweeted that the disease was a threat only to people who are obese or over 65 — very inaccurate medical guidance — Twitter banned her for 12 hours. Greene held a news conference and was promptly asked if she herself was vaccinated.""Your first question is a violation of my HIPAA rights,"" Greene saidJuly 20. ""You see, with HIPAA rights, we don’t have to reveal our medical records, and that also involves our vaccine records.""HIPAA is theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and it contains rules governing the privacy of medical information. But the law has no bearing on whether Greene can be asked about her medical history, according to both legal experts and official HIPAA guidelines. Whether she answers is a matter of personal choice, not the law. TheU. S. Health and Human Service Departmentsummarizes HIPAA as setting ""rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information."" This mainly targets insurance companies and health care providers, which are among the parties the law calls ""covered entities."" These entities can’t share your health records without your permission. If they do, they face stiff penalties. Notably, employers are not on the list of covered entities. Greene described HIPAA as though it conferred a special protection against being asked about her medical history. Mark Rothstein, a University of Louisville law professor specializing in HIPAA, said Greene is mistaken.""It is not a general shield that permits individuals to avoid disclosing their own health information,"" Rothstein said.""Individuals often must disclose their health information, or authorize the disclosure by a HIPAA covered entity, when applying for employment, life insurance, etc.,"" Rothstein said. ""The individual does not have to release the health information, but then they may not be hired or offered insurance.""On the specific matter of vaccination status, employers arefree to askworkers if they have gotten the shot. That means any member of the public, including the media, can ask the question of a government official who works for them.""That is not a HIPAA violation, and employees may decide whether to provide that information to their employer,"" theHHS said. Greene’s director of communications, Nick Dyer, told us, ""Congresswoman Greene’s medical records, including her vaccination status, are none of the media’s business.""Greene said questions from reporters about whether she’s been vaccinated violate her HIPAA rights. That’s not true. HIPAA gives people the right to control how hospitals and insurance companies share their medical records, but it gives no blanket protection against being asked health questions, or having to answer them. Employers may ask employees if they are vaccinated, without running afoul of HIPAA, according to federal guidelines. Greene can sidestep the question as a matter of personal choice, but not because of HIPAA. We rate this claim False.",3,Reliable,0.0671245421245421,0.3198260073260073,679,3,Politifact
580,Britney Spears finally won the right to pick her own lawyer. Here's why that matters,-2.0,35.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/britney-spears-finally-won-right-pick-her-own-lawyer-here-n1274881,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"Britney Spears, superstar,lacks a fundamental right that most adult Americans have. Because she is under a conservatorship, she’s unable to enter into a contract. That means she can’t hire her own lawyer. Instead, for the last 13 years, she’s had a lawyer someone else picked for her. Her earnings paid for the lawyer she didn’t select and couldn’t replace. Finally, last week, aCalifornia superior court judge granted Spears’ requestto let her replace her long-term counsel with someone of her own choosing. We are a country that believes in “procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals.”In a landmark 1963 decision,Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court held that states were required to provide lawyers for defendants in felony criminal cases. The court said having a lawyer in this situation was a fundamental right essential to a fair trial. Citing an earlier case, it admonished, “[The assistance of counsel] is one of the safeguards of the Sixth Amendment deemed necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty.”There is no similar guarantee of counsel in civil cases, no right grounded in the Constitution, as in criminal cases, where liberty is at stake. But state bar associations and other organizations are cognizant of the enhanced protections that people who have a lawyer representing them receive. Increasingly, they’ve focused onaccess to justiceprograms that expand the availability of counsel in civil proceedings, inrecognition that accessto a lawyer provides legal awareness along with legal counsel. Concerns about access to a lawyer focus primarily on people who cannot afford to hire one, but the principle underscores the importance of having counsel. We are a country that believes in “procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals,” the Supreme Court noted in Gideon. People who have had even a passing encounter with the legal system know how important it is to have a navigator, someone who understands both the substance and the process of the law, acting in their best interests. Without that protection, a person could end up, say, in a 13-year conservatorship without knowing how or even whether they were entitled to challenge it. Britney Spears is not a defendant in a criminal case and she is certainly able to afford counsel of her own, but the process she has found herself entangled in prohibited her from accessing basic advice about her situation and her options. She did not have someone at her side who was unambiguously committed to seeing her best interests served. She has experienced significant, substantial loss of liberty even though she’s not in physical custody. In some ways, a defendant in a criminal case enjoys more protection of their rights than Spears has had, even though the conservatorship is supposed to work to her benefit. Spears’ situation hasimportantimplications for people in the disability communityand others who also find themselves in conservatorships. Although in many situations, particularly those that involve people nearing the ends of their lives or people with catastrophic illness, conservatorships can be necessary and useful, they don’t always operate as the law intends. Spears’ case highlights the way conservatorships can create a vicious cycle of inability for the people they are supposed to protect, by isolating them from sound advice. That problem presents itself starkly in the pop star’s case, where her earnings are now supporting a conservatorship cottage industry that seemingly benefits everyone but her. Spears turnedcartwheels on social mediathe day the judge ruled in her favor, permitting her to choose her own lawyer. This decision doesn’t guarantee she’ll be able to win her freedom, but she’ll have a fairer shot. She’ll have a lawyer who is free, one hopes, from outside influence or conflicts of interest. The change in legal strategy was immediate. “We will be filing as quickly as possible to get Mr. Spears removed from the conservatorship,”Spears’ new lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, said. “If he loves his daughter, it is time to step aside and move on so she can have her life back.”We live in a society that doesn’t necessarily venerate lawyers. The butt of jokes and water cooler mockery, when the chips are down, most people want a good lawyer in their corner. It took 13 years for Spears, with her fame, money and access, to secure a lawyer of her choosing. It doesn’t take much imagination to understand how this plays out for people without her celebrity. But there are newer approaches that require a person who legitimately needs some assistance to relinquish less control over their life than a traditional conservatorship.“Supported decision-making,” a new legal approach that permits people who need some assistance but can make decisions on their own when properly advised, is an option. For people in the disability community who face physical and/or mental challenges but are capable of functioning independently with a strong support network, an approach like this permits them to retain control over key decisions in their lives. For instance, because she had a lawyer,Jenny Hatch, a woman with Down syndrome, won the right to make her own decision about where and how she would live. Conservatorships are supposed to work for people who need them. Most often they do. But when they don’t, there needs to be an accessible path to challenge them. Spears' father’s lawyer, Vivian Lee Thoreen, paid for by Spears' money, was able to advocate for him and his wish to stay on as her conservator. ""Jamie is not suggesting that he is the perfect dad or that he would receive any 'father of the year' award,”Thoreen told CNN. “Like any parent, he doesn't always see eye to eye on what Britney may want. But Jamie believes every single decision he has made has been in her best interest.""That perhaps is the ultimate irony: Spears was left without the legal protection she provided others. Spears deserves to have a lawyer so her voice can be heard — as do other people who can’t use their own voices to support themselves. That’s why having a lawyer, your own lawyer, matters so much.

S. Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah has lost his bid to win re-election against former NFL player Burgess Owens. McAdams, the state’s only congressional Democrat, conceded in an online news conference Monday afternoon shortly before The Associated Press determined Owens had won the closely watched race in the suburban Salt Lake City congressional district. Owens is a Republican who has been a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump. He is a frequent Fox News guest who has come under scrutiny for other media appearances linked to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that has increasingly crept into politics. His spokesman has said Owens doesn’t believe in the theory. Trump congratulated Owens over the weekend, saying in a tweet: “Great going Burgess, you continue to be a STAR! ”McAdams is a moderate who was part of the so-called blue wave that won control of the U. S. House for the Democrats in 2018. He has focused on kitchen-table issues and occasionally bucked party leadership, though he did vote to impeach the president. During the Republican primary, Owens handily won a crowded field by running to the right of his opponents. Vote counting in the close general election race continued for days. The district was held until 2018 by Mia Love, another Black conservative who was the first Black Republican woman elected to the House. She was critical of Trump at times, including when he used an expletive to refer to her parents’ home country of Haiti. Owens has backed the president, and Donald Trump Jr. campaigned for him. The former NFL player helped the Oakland Raiders win the 1980 Super Bowl and later converted to the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has disagreed with athletes kneeling during the national anthem in support of Black Lives Matter during appearances on Fox News. McAdams, meanwhile, was a well-known mayor of Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County before he ran for Congress. He defeated Love by less than 700 votes, and the race this year was one of the more closely watched in the country.

582,Shadowproof Launches Marvel Cooke Journalism Fellowship,-31.67,36.0,https://shadowproof.com/2020/11/17/shadowproof-launches-marvel-cooke-journalism-fellowship/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-17,22,"Want to support the Marvel Cooke fellowship and fund journalism on the abolition movement?Make a donationtoday. Shadowproof is thrilled to announce the launch of, which will fund reporting from writers of color on the movement to abolish the prison industrial complex. Over the summer, a historic wave of protests against death-by-policing elevated demands to defund police departments. Unprecedented public curiosity in abolition followed, prompting many media organizations to produce introductory articles on the subject. Shadowproof responded with journalism exploring abolition’s presence in a variety of organizing efforts. We published eight articles from a variety of writers that showed, for example, how abolitionists approach mental health crises and interpersonal violence without involving police. Throughout this project, our goal was to show how communities are manifesting abolition now, and to push back against the perception that it is an idea confined to a distant future. The funding we can provide through the Marvel Cooke Fellowship will carry our abolition series into 2021 and ensure we have dedicated resources for publishing work by a diversity of writers.*Though Marvel Jackson Cooke’s reporting was published a century ago, it remains deeply relevant to the journalism we will fund through this fellowship. Cooke was the only Black child in Mankato, Michigan, born in 1901 to parents she described as “Eugene V. Debs socialists.” She moved to New York City in the 1920s and joined the Harlem Renaissance, engaging in fearless journalism and activism confronting issues of race, class, and gender. She wrote forat the invitation of W. E. B. Du Bois, and was later published inThe Amsterdam News. As the Washington Press Club Foundationnotes, she wasThe Amsterdam News’ first woman journalist and worked in editorial roles as well. While at the paper, Cooke helped organize the first Newspaper Guild unit at a Black-owned newspaperLater, she worked as the assistant managing editor atand as a reporter and feature writer atThe Compass, where she was not just the only woman reporter but the only Black person writing for the organization. Cooke was questioned before Congress for her Communist Party membership, and the FBI harassed her and confiscated her passport as it had other Black radicals of the era like Paul Robeson. In the 1970s, Cooke played a leading role in defense campaigns for Dr. Angela Y. Davis, andcontinued her activismuntil her death in 2000 at age 99. Her groundbreaking reporting on the exploitation of Black women working as domestic day laborers in New York City is exemplary of the journalism Shadowproof strives to fund through the Marvel Cooke Fellowship. The first article Cooke wrote on the subject,“The Slave Market,”was a collaboration with Ella Baker and appeared inin 1935. She returned with a three-part series called“The Bronx Slave Market”in 1950, reporting on her own experiences as part of the “paperbag brigade” in the pages ofThe Compass. In her work, Cooke did not just tabulate the exploitation of working Black women but explored its root causes. She gave readers a sense of time and place, situating these newer forms of abuse within shifting currents of race, labor, gender, and migration following the Great Depression and post-World War II deindustrialization. Cooke demanded more from government responses in her reporting, showing that efforts like free hiring halls dealt with only the most superficial complaints and, in some ways, further entrenched oppression. She told the stories of workers instead of attempting to impose a contrived “objectivity” to show “both sides.” She presented her subjects as human beings with agency instead of silently oppressed objects, chronicling how workers overcame their isolation from one another to share strategies and organize collective resistance to stolen and suppressed wages, and other forms of abuse. It is through this lens that Cooke argued the Slave Markets of the 20th century should not and could not be reasonably reformed. Instead, through labor organizing and struggle to destroy the conditions that enabled their existence, she called for the markets to be abolished altogether. In the 70 years since Cooketraced the survivals of slaveryto New York City’s “paperbag brigade,” Black people and other marginalized populations have encountered new forms of exploitation and coercion as they pursue survival in an increasingly hazardous world. Their efforts to organize against these new forms are not always visible to the general public, especially if they are part of criminalized and stigmatized populations, but these efforts are nonetheless critical to shaping the future. The upheavals and displacement of the the early 21st century by economic, health, and climate crises, an increasingly militarized state, and ever-more precarious working conditions, therefore deserve the same on-the-ground attention as Cooke provided her subjects in the Bronx during the 1930s and 1950s.

In its long-anticipated report, Cyber Ninjas did not find any evidence that votes were changed or that ballots were made out of Chinese bamboo. But the company — whose founder, Doug Logan, had previously claimed the election was ""rigged"" — appears to have tried to save face among its right-wing supporters by intimating that there was still wrongdoing. One of Cyber Ninjas ""critical findings"" was that 23,344 mail-in ballots were cast by people who no longer resided at their address on file. These voters, the company asserted, ""should not have received their ballots by mail because they had moved,"" suggesting that they had been wrongly forwarded to the voters' new address, a claimamplified bythe spokesperson for former President Donald Trump. But that is not true. According to the office of Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer,a Republican elected in November 2020, ""As required by law, all election materials, such as ballots, are marked 'Do Not Forward — Return Service Requested.'"" Returned ballots initiate a process of removing the person from the voter roll. But sometimes people move in the weeks before an election; they are allowed to request that their ballot be sent to atemporary address. According to Maricopa County, 20,933 voters did so in 2020. As for the rest? Former Maricopa County residents who are in the military and deployed overseas — and other Americans who live abroad but previously called the Phoenix metropolitan region home — have to list their ""address in the state in which [they] were last domiciled"" in order to participate in a federal election, according to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, ""Your voting residence is your address in the state in which you were last domiciled, immediately prior to leaving the United States.""""Cyber Ninjas still don't understand this is legal under federal election law,"" the countyposted on its official Twitter account.

585,EPA Whistleblower Who Exposed Pruitt Scandals Sues Over Retaliation,-15.67,41.0,https://shadowproof.com/2020/10/27/epa-whistleblower-exposed-pruitt-scandals-retaliation-sues/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-27,22,"An Environmental Protection Agency whistleblower, whose disclosures ultimately led to former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt’s resignation, filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging his free speech and due process rights were violated. The lawsuit [PDF] says Kevin Chmielewski was a political appointee and worked as Pruitt’s deputy chief of staff for operations. He faced a retaliatory investigation from the EPA’s Office of the Inspector General that “falsely accused” him of “not having a security clearance and covering up a past arrest.”It claims Corey Lewandowski, a former official for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, told the whistleblower that Pruitt “knew about his disclosures.” After Chmielewski refused to “violate laws and federal rules and made disclosures to officials outside of the EPA,” Pruitt assigned his responsibilities to another employee. Furthermore, according to the lawsuit, Charles Munoz, the White House liaison for the EPA, informed Chmielewski on February 12, 2018, “Pruitt wants you to resign effective immediately.” He was urged to “sign a resignation form” because if he was fired he would “lose his clearance and never get another job in the federal government.”The EPA allegedly sent Chmielewski documents on April 20, 2018, that falsely represented he resigned from his job. Helena Wooden-Aguilar, the EPA deputy associate administrator for the Office of Policy, and Justin Fugh, the EPA senior counsel for ethics, both warned “[Pruitt’s] chief of staff Ryan Jackson not to make statements to the effect that plaintiff was removed because he went to Congress, human resources, or other officials.”Oversight of Pruitt’s “compliance with expense, budgetary, personnel use, record keeping, and email policies and regulations” were not duties assigned to Chmielewski. Nor was it part of his job, according to the lawsuit. He simply did not want to be part of this misconduct. He demands that his employment at the EPA be reinstated or that the Energy Department hire him to a position he was promised earlier in 2020. Multiple scandals erupted around Pruitt’s abuse of taxpayer dollars and how he used the position to enrich himself and his family. The disgraced EPA administrator was too much of a liability for the Trump administration and resigned on July 5, 2018. Chmielewski accused Pruitt of violating federal statutes, regulations, and EPA policies when he spent funds on travel, “office improvements,” and used staff for “personal tasks.”“[Pruitt] spent more than $120,000 of public funds during a June 2017 trip to Italy that an EPA lobbyist organized under the guise of a meeting with environmental ministers from G-7 countries,” the lawsuit declares. “This trip included a $30,500 security detail and nearly $90,000 spent on food, hotels, commercial airfare, and an $11,000 military jet used by the Administrator and nine of his staffers.”Although commercial flights were available that were “faster and cheaper,” Pruitt still had the EPA shell out $11,000 for this flight that took him and his staff from Cincinnati to New York for the trip to Italy. Chmielewski “objected that travel logistics or expenditures were not allowed,” and Pruitt allegedly replied, “I don’t care. I’m a Cabinet Secretary. Make it happen.”Pruitt also approved a first-class return trip from Morocco for an EPA official. But Chmielewski insisted that violated regulations and refused to sign paperwork for the trip. While Pruitt ran the EPA, he issued a “blanket waiver” so officials could fly first class. He stayed in some of the “most expensive hotels in violation of the travel policies and regulations. His travel often exceeded the prescribed 150 percent per diem rate without appropriate justification and approval.”Pruitt, who isno longera closeted lobbyist for the fossil fuel industry, rented a condo from the head of Williams & Jensen, a lobbying firm.“One of the firm’s clients in 2017 was Cheniere Energy Inc., which owned an active liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plan at the time, a matter of regulatory concern to the EPA,” the lawsuit recalls. Chmielewski was present for meetings between May 2017 and February 2018, where Pruitt and officials discussed removing meetings with coal, mining, oil industry, and fertilizer businessmen/lobbyists from a “secret calendar.” He changed entries to “staff meeting” on the public to conceal this activity.“EPA staff were directed to falsify the Administrator’s official schedules after the meetings took place so the public, and the EPA would not know of meetings with lobbyists.”Several of the lobbyists involved in fertilizer companies were from Oklahoma, where he was attorney general. In April 2018, Chmielewski provided detailed information to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about what he observed and endured when challenging this conduct. Chmielewski provided details of EPA corruption to NBC News, ABC News, the New York Times, CNN, and the Hill.“I hate to take a credit for a man losing his job, but I guess I’d have to say that I take the credit,” ChmielewskitoldThe Hill. He tried to find work and was informed by the Energy Department that he would be hired on March 31. Yet, a little more than a week after, he was told by the White House Personnel Office there would be no place for him in the Trump administration.*Chmielewski is one of dozens of employees, who have lost their job in the federal government during the Trump presidency because they were not “loyal” enough. They may never work in government again, despite the fact that they seem to care whether rules or regulations are followed. In February, White House spokesperson Hogan Gidleysaidthe administration would “examine” employees who tried to undermine Trump.“It’s not a secret that we want people in positions that work with this president, not against him, and too often we have people in this government—I mean the federal government is massive, with millions of people—and there are a lot people out there taking action against this president and when we find them we will take appropriate action,” Gidley added. On October 21, Trumpissuedan executive order that re-classified numerous federal government positions so the administration would have more authority to fire employees if they speak to the media.“The federal government benefits from career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition but who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing executive branch policy and programs under the laws of the United States,” the order states. “The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) and the American people also entrust these career professionals with non‑public information that must be kept confidential.”Chillingly, it asserts, “Career employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy‑making, and policy-advocating positions wield significant influence over government operations and effectiveness. Agencies need the flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees from these positions without facing extensive delays or litigation.”From loyalty pledges togag orders, what happened with Chmielewski is but one example of what could become increasingly common and unremarkable in government if the free speech rights of federal government employees are not defended.",3,Reliable,0.0420648795648795,0.3988726551226551,1574,2,Shadowproof

The term is still sometimes used in that context. But in culture and politics today, the most prominent uses of “woke” are as a pejorative — Republicansattacking Democrats, more centrist Democratsattacking more liberal onesand supporters of the British monarchyusing the termto criticize people more sympathetic to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Those critical of so-called woke ideas and people often invoke the idea that they are being “canceled” or a victim of “cancel culture.”Aswe explained in a piece earlier this week, ideas cast as woke are often coming from progressives and involve identity and race (like the notion that white people in America have privilege or that Black Americans should get reparations.) Cancel culture is broadly the idea that people advocating more liberal ideas, particularly around identity and race, have too much power and can publicly shame those who don’t agree with them, sometimes leading to those who don’t share these ideas being removed from their jobs or having their speaking invitations withdrawn (so “canceled.”)But there is no agreed-upon definition of “woke” or a formal political organization or movement associated with it. Nor is there an exact definition of what constitutesbeing “canceled” or a victim of “cancel culture.” However, despite their vagueness, you now see conservative activists and Republican politicians constantly using these terms. That’s because that vagueness is a feature, not a bug. Casting a really wide range of ideas and policies as too woke and anyone who is critical of them as being canceled by out-of-control liberals is becoming an important strategy and tool on the right — in fact, this cancel culture/woke discourse could become the organizing idea of the post-Trump-presidency Republican Party. There are at least five reasons why Republicans are likely to keep focusing on the woke and cancel culture over the next few years:First and perhaps most important, focusing on cancel culture and woke people is aFor decades, Republicans have used somewhat vague terms (“dog whistles”) totap into and foment resentmentagainst traditionally marginalized groups like Black Americans who are pushing for more rights and freedoms. This resentment is then used to woo voters (mostly white)wary of cultural, demographic and racial change. In many ways, casting people on the left as too woke and eager to cancel their critics is just the present-day equivalent of attacks from the right against “outside agitators” (civil rights activists in 1960s), the “politically correct” (liberal college students in the 1980s and ’90s) and “activist judges” (liberal judges in the 2000s). Liberals pushing for, say, calling people by the pronoun they prefer or reparations for Black Americans serve as the present-day analogies to aggressive school integration programs and affirmative action. These are ideas that are easy for the GOP to run against, because they offer few direct benefits (the overwhelming majority of Americans aren’t transgender and/or Black) but some costs to the (white) majority of Americans. In many ways, we are just watching an old GOP strategy with new language and different issues.“If we compare the current situation to the ‘PC’ debate of the ’80s and ’90s, I see not only parallels but very much direct continuities and pretty much an identical conflict,” saidThomas Zimmer,a historian at Georgetown University who is writing a book on political divides in America. “Calling something ‘PC’ was an attempt to discredit the claims of traditionally marginalized groups for respect.”AsSeth Cotlar, an American history scholar at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, put it, “Anti-wokeism isn’t a response to anything new happening on the left so much as it is a continuation of a very old politics of reactionary backlash, especially white backlash.”Talking about identity and racial issues in vague terms like cancel culture and woke is particularly important right now for the GOP. In an increasingly diverse country across a number of dimensions (race, religion,sexual identity, etc.), Republicans need to make their cultural appeals to the party’s more conservative voters more subtext than text to avoid turning off too many Americans who wouldn’t want to vote for candidates or a party they perceive as bigoted. Also, talking about race and identity in this way could help the GOP break away from some of the more controversial elements of former President Donald Trump’s approach, particularly his rhetoric aboutMexicansandMuslimsduring his 2016 campaign, and therefore blunt thenotion held by many Americansthat the GOP is dominated by racists. Republicans are already making this shift toward talking about cancel culture and wokeness instead of using rhetoric like Trump’s in 2016. Trump himself in 2020 focused less on attacking immigration broadly and Mexicans and Muslims in particular and instead talked more about culture and race in less controversial ways, such asattackingcritical race theoryandcalling for “law and order.” Other Republicans are moving in this direction too. The recent conference of the Conservative Political Action Committeewas dubbed by its organizers “America Uncanceled.”And former Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanderskicked off her Arkansas gubernatorial campaignlast month witha promise to fight cancel culture.“If you dare to think for yourself, dare to demand the Constitution be followed or dare to question a child choosing their own gender, you will be mocked and canceled,” Sen. Josh Hawley said in a recent fundraising message to his supporters. Second, this, a very useful function in a two-party system in which the parties are in a zero-sum competition. As wewrote about this week, many ideas that are newly ascendant on the left, such as reducing funding for police,divide Democrats(more on that in a bit) but unify Republicans. Moreover, many of these ideas are opposed by a majority of the public. Share of people, by party and overall, who support each position according to pollingSources: Pew Research Center, PRRI, Gallup, YouGovThis unity is particularly important for Republicans right now. The Republican Party’s splits are arguably overstated, butthere are real divisions. Third, this anti-woke posture providesRepublicans totally control the government in many states and are often focused on issues such as tax cuts that maynot galvanize the party’s core activists. But a lot of GOP officials at the state level are now rolling out policies that flow from this woke/cancel culture fight. These include limits onpublic schools’ use of the New York Times’ 1619 Projectthat chronicles the role of slavery in American history and theteaching of critical race theoryat public colleges; thecriminalization of tactics used by protesters last yearafter George Floyd was killed in police custody; provisions to make iteasier to sue social media companiesfor removing people from their platforms, and proposals to allowstate governments to cut fundingfrom cities that reduce their police budgets. Fourth, this anti-woke posture gives conservative activists and Republican officials a way to. Republicans are trying to recast the removal of Trump’s accountsfrom Facebook and Twitteras a narrative ofliberal tech companies silencinga prominent conservative, instead of those platforms punishing Trump for using them toincite violence and encourage overturning the election results. If Republicans suppress Democratic votes or try to overturn election results in future elections, as seems entirely possible, the party is likely to justify that behavior in part by suggesting the Democrats are just too extreme and woke to be allowed to control the government. The argument would be that Democrats would eliminate police departments and allow crime to surge if they have more power, so they must be stopped at all costs. Polls suggest a huge bloc of GOP voters isalready open to such apocalyptic rhetoric.“The term woke has rapidly come to encompass everything and anything conservatives don’t like – anything and anyone they want to discredit,” said Zimmer. For example, here’s the text from a recent fundraising email from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia:When I see the bills we’re voting on, I don’t understand why more “Conservative” Republicans do NOT join me:– Cancelling Religious Freedom through the so-called “Equality” Act.– Cancelling Election Security in HR1,– Cancelling Gender,– Cancelling our Sovereignty,– Cancelling our 2nd Amendment Rights, and– Defunding the Police.”Most of what I described above is basically how this focus on the woke and cancel culture helps unify GOP elites with one another and to the party’s core voters. But there’s a fifth value to this approach:t could help the GOP win over some swing voters and/orpeople who usually don’t vote. Polls suggest that a lot of voters currentlydon’t know what cancel cultureis — and that’s true even among Republicans, despite the party’s elites talking about cancel culture nonstop. But fighting the woke and cancel culture could become more familiar and important to voters outside of the GOP, particularly if some Democrats are raising the same concerns. And that is already happening to some extent. There is a real divide among Democratic elites, with more centrist Democrats arguing that some ideas and behavior on gender, identity and race in particular coming from the party’s leftare going too far. Again, this is nothing new. Some centrist Democrats joined conservatives in previous eras who were worried about thecivil rights movement,busingandidentity politics. But this ideological split in the Democratic Party at the elite level could eventually trickle down to voters. Think about the so-called Reagan Democrats who started voting for GOP presidential candidates in the 1980s in part because they perceived the Democratic Party of that era astoo tied to Black causes, or the bloc of Republicans who voted for Hillary Clinton and/or President Biden because they were wary of how Trump talked about racial issues. A perception that the Democratic Party is too woke that is amplified by prominent Republicans and some prominent Democrats could provide a rationale and a permission structure for those Democrats to back GOP candidates, particularly Republicans who don’t say racist things as Trump did. This may have happened in 2020, in fact. A ton ofnew voters turned outto back Trump and there was amajor swing toward him among Latinos. It’s hard to pin down exactly why this happened, but some Democrats’ embrace of ideas like defunding the police and socialismlikely played some role, combined with conservatives casting those stands as emblematic of the broader Democratic Party (even asBiden distanced himself from them). I’m not trying to predict anything here. I’m not sure Republicans will stay on this message of attacking the woke and cancel culture. Why not? Well, Trump is still the leader of the party and he might not be interested in staying on this or any consistent message. Perhaps voters will view attacking the woke and cancel culture as the latest round of partisan fights around identity and race. Those fights aren’t going that well for Republicans — Democrats have won more votes in recent national elections. Also, amid COVID-19 and other challenges, lots of voters, particularly those who don’t pay much attention to politics, might never really catch up to the woke and cancel culture discourse. But there are a lot of reasons to think the Republicans would benefit from continuing on this course — so it’s likely they will.",3,Reliable,0.1377131688148637,0.4201068799373886,2470,3,FiveThirtyEight

Mammoth Mountain closed on a stormy day in mid-March last season, but this time it was not a weather-hold. Chairlifts stopped spinning and skiers went home. Though she didn’t know it yet, Rachel Rainey had just worked her last shift at the restaurant that has supported her skiing lifestyle for the past 17 years. And that was just the beginning of the economic challenges she would face. The World Health Organization had declared a global pandemic. The NBA canceled their season and Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Places with ski resorts like Blaine County in Idaho and Gunnison County in Colorado were early hotspots. Most North American ski areas closed their operations indefinitely and in the days that followed, residents sheltered-in-place. Ski towns asked visitors to stay away. Small businesses shuttered. Rainey was also in the middle of moving at the time. Her rent increased just as she was filing for unemployment. Now more than nine months later, Rainey still does not have a job and unemployment benefits have run out. The small weightlifting gym she owns has been closed for five of the last nine months. The federal payroll protection program gave her just $500 in July. Debt is piling up.“The situation is getting desperate,” she said, her voice trailing off. Soon after getting laid-off, Rainey found another restaurant job and was expected to start working at the beginning of the winter season, but that restaurant was shut down too. Over the summer she cleaned vacation rentals part-time, but that work has also dried up since the state banned non-essential travel and closed short-term lodging in response to alarmingly low ICU capacities across the state.plenty of challengesover the years — economic inequality and high rent, climate change and drought and wildfires, overtourism and sometimes a lack of tourism. The ski town workforce, who often work multiple jobs to make ends meet, are finding it harder than ever to afford the cost of living.“The pandemic has amplified things that have been ongoing issues in a lot of ski towns.”“The pandemic has amplified things that have been ongoing issues in a lot of ski towns,” said Heather Hansman a former editor atwho is currently writing a book about ski bums. “Everything is getting crunched on all sides.”columnist Marc Peruzzi wrote that pandemic mitigations could be good for ski culture — thinning crowds, preserving powder stashes, and bringing back the brown bag lunch and après ski tailgates. He hopes that skiing could become “a classless luxury” again, but any kind of luxury seems increasingly far from reality for the people who are trying to survive in a ski town. Some small businesses did not survive the spring shutdowns. At least five restaurants in Mammoth Lakes, including the one Rainey worked at, closed permanently. And with reduced capacities in lodging and restaurants, many residents who work in tourism-based economies are unemployed or working fewer hours. For most of the unemployed ski town workforce who were laid off in March, state unemployment benefits have long ago run out and federal pandemic relief programs under the CARES act expire on December 26. At the time of this reporting lawmakers have just agreed on another stimulus bill, but it will be at least a few weeks before the money reaches people and the aid is significantly less than the last round of government financial relief. Even with ski areas currently open for the season and a vaccine rolling out health officials warn the worst is yet to come. With the upcoming holiday season, the U. S may see a “surge upon a surge,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a briefing in early-December. As the ski season begins to ramp up many communities are limping into the time of year that drives the industry’s economy. Mammoth Lakes reported more than $3 million in transient occupancy taxes in its highest grossing month ever in January 2020, but the town is estimating $1 million less in tourism tax revenue for this upcoming January, for example. In early 2020, the majority of U. S. ski areas lost critical spring break visitation that generally accounts for 20% of annual revenue, according to a National Ski Areas Association (NSAA) report. That period is only is surpassed in revenue by the Christmas holiday, which is looking grim. NSAA estimates that the pandemic has already cost the U. S. ski industry at least $2 billion, with projections reaching as high as $5 billion including the 2021 season. Even so, many outdoor destinations had their busiest summer ever and retailers that sell equipment like canoes and kayaks, and hiking, camping, and fishing gear have reported record sales and supply shortages. But it’s the hospitality industry that’s really suffering in states with high cases of the coronavirus and strict mandates like California, which has just gone into lockdown again closing restaurants and tourism lodging among other restrictions — even as ski areas are allowed to operate chairlifts.specific to ski town workforce,but employment in the leisure and hospitality industry is down by 3.4 million jobs nationwide, according to a recent U. S. Department of Labor report. And the restaurant industry, which is a lucrative job for ski town workers, is down 2.1 million jobs since February. In Crested Butte, Colorado, Kyleena Falzone says that when she had to layoff 140 employees from her restaurants the Secret Stash and Bonez, it was one of the hardest days of her life. That night she went home, laid in bed for a few minutes, and then got up and got back to work. She knew her community was hurting, and rather than wait for government assistance, she wanted to feed people. Falzone crowdfunded $100,000 and used the donations to supply out-of-work residents with fresh food from the farmer’s market. She also hired back some of her staff and served free community dinner for 83 nights at the Secret Stash.“We were hit really hard, really fast,” Falzone said. “All the tourists had to leave, all the hotels and restaurants shut down.”In April, counties with ski areas had some of the highest per capita rates of infection in the country. Tourist-facing workplaces like restaurants and bars were considered high risk by the CDC and most closed temporarily. As the curve flattened and businesses slowly reopened for summer, many restaurants moved operations outdoors. But winter presents significant weather challenges for business operations in a ski town. Crested Butte’s restaurants are currently restricted to 50% capacity indoors, but Falzone is watching cases rise nationwide and sees what could be coming.“I feel like I’m in the middle of the island and the lava is slowly coming toward us,” she said. Even after a busy summer, Falzone was only able to rehire about half of her staff. With reduced capacity there is only so much work to go around. Some of her employees were forced to leave in search of work or because they can’t afford the cost of living in Crested Butte anymore. There is, however, a new kind of economic boom in many mountain towns. Popular scenic areas have experienced a staggering increase in demand for housing as pandemic-related migration is doubling growth, according to an Oregon Office of Economics analysis. Mountain towns have become so-called Zoom towns, as people who can work-from-home are fleeing urban environments for the great outdoors. Real estate has reached record highs in many places with ski resorts like Truckee, California; Bend, Oregon; and Missoula, Montana. In Mammoth Lakes, California, sales were so high this summer there’s little inventory left, Mammoth Sierra Properties realtor Danica McCoy said. There are currently just a few condos for sale and no homes listed for less than $1 million. Every property that comes on the market is seeing bidding wars.“There is something that is definitely broken.”“It’s insane,” McCoy said. Those who view the relatively lower prices of rural areas are driving up the market while the people who live and work in Mammoth are going to the food bank. “There is something that is definitely broken,” she said. In Jackson, Wyoming, where the wealth gap is the biggest in the country, real estate has reached record-breaking demand this year, shattering previous year-end volume with $1.5 billion in sales in the first nine months of 2020. Jackson, like most ski towns, already has an affordable housing problem, Clare Stumpf, a board member for the Shelter JH housing advocacy group, said. “The pandemic has laid bare the inequities that exist here.”Wealthy owners who enjoy their tax-free vacation homes in the Jackson Hole Valley have fled to the region to shelter-in-place. Some rental owners are capitalizing on high markets and selling, while others are finding tenants who are willing to pay higher prices.“Evictions have been off the charts,” Stumpf said. “People who can work from home have a higher budget than someone who works in Jackson.”The state has some of the least restrictive coronavirus mandates in the country, so restaurants and bars are open despite the widespread virus and a hospital that is nearly full. There are jobs, yet housing continues to be the biggest problem for people in Teton County who already spend a third of their earnings on housing. Jackson resident Elizabeth Hutchings says she was forced out of her rental unit when the owner increased the rent by 30%. She and her housemates couldn’t afford the rent hike and decide to move out. Now in mid-December, the hardest time of year to find housing in any ski town, Hutchings says the housing crunch feels like “an intense frenzy.” She is working two restaurant jobs and has a few leads on housing, but she still doesn’t know for sure where she will be living when she has to be out of her place at the end of the month.three years agofor a park service job and fell in love with the area. In the past she’s lived in her Subaru and commuted an hour to make it living more affordable. Hutchings says she still finds the skiing and climbing lifestyle fulfilling enough, though she wonders how long the equation will work.“You will have joyful and amazing time here, but when you don’t want to fight any longer you leave. It wears you down.”“Someone told me when I first came to Jackson that, and I think this is true of all ski towns, Jackson is a place you have to fight for,” Hutchings said. “You will have joyful and amazing time here, but when you don’t want to fight any longer you leave. It wears you down.”Back in Mammoth, most of the town is shut down, but the lifts are still spinning and a few early storms have brought just enough snow to keep residents happy. Even with the economic hardship and a virus that is surging, the mountain is always there. Despite everything, Rainey says she’ll wax her skis and slide around, feel the wind in her hair. “Skiing is the best medicine for me,” she said. “At least there is skiing.”High Country Newsat[email protected]or submit aletter to the editor.

593,Nonprofit paid for Whitmer's chartered flight out of state,6.0,43.67,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/14/nonprofit-paid-whitmer-chartered-flight-out-state/5098198001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-14,25,"— A nonprofit organization tied to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration paid to charter the flight that carried her to visit her father, but Whitmer paid for a seat, her administration said Friday. The revelations came in an unaddressedemail memo signed by Whitmer's chief of staff, JoAnne Huls, weeks into a controversy on the out-of-state trip during a pandemic.""Due to ongoing security and public health concerns, we made a decision to use a chartered flight for this trip,"" Huls wrote in the memo. ""The governor's flight was not a gift, not paid for at taxpayer expense and was done in compliance with the law.""The social welfare nonprofit organization Michigan Transition 2019 chartered the private plane, which took Whitmer to Florida on Friday, March 12, and returned her to Lansing, on Monday, March 15. The group spent $27,521 on travel over the first 14 days of May, according to a voluntary disclosure, which apparently covers the March flights. The same disclosure shows Whitmer paid the nonprofit a $855 total for her seat on the flights. Michigan Information & Research Service News (MIRS News) first reported the arrangement Friday. The nonprofit organization was formed in November 2018 to help fund Whitmer's inauguration, according to state business records. In 2019, it reported to the state that it would be using an assumed name: Executive Office Account. It's unclear how a nonprofit that falls under strict federal rules prohibiting the use of funds for personal expenses qualified to fund the travel. The governor has said she performed duties of her office, including participation in meetings, while caring for her father, but didn't specify what she did. Federal tax law prohibits nonprofits from the practice of inurement, which is the use of nonprofit income or assets to excessively benefit an individual who has a close relationship with the tax-exempt organization, according to theLegal Information Institute at the Cornell Law School. The account ""defrays the cost of the governor’s travel when it’s consistent with the account’s purposes,"" Huls said. According to a 2019 tax filing, the group's mission is to promote ""civic action and social welfare.""Whitmer has repeatedly said she took the flight to visit her father. She has said there ""was an important family reason for doing it.""Tori Sachs, a Republican political consultant, called for Whitmer's use of the nonprofit organization to be investigated. She said there is no legal theory where reimbursing $800 for a $27,000 flight ""solves anything.""Ted Goodman, spokesman for the Michigan Republican Party, said there was a reason Whitmer's office released the news on a Friday night.""Tonight's revelations raise additional questions and concerns surrounding the financial arrangements of Gov. Whitmer's secret, unvaccinated trip to Florida on a private jet,"" Goodman said. The governor received her doses of COVID-19 vaccine in mid-April and April 29. A spokesman for Whitmer referred questions about why the nonprofit was able to fund the chartered flight to an attorney, who didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, the Democratic governor said her flight to visit her father was not paid for by taxpayer dollars and wasnot ""a gift,""but she declined to provide additional information about how the trip was funded. She had refused to say which state she traveled or how the flight was arranged since news of the trip broke in April. For the trip, Whitmer took a private plane that's usually shared by three of Michigan's most prominent political donors,The Detroit News reported last week. The Nicholson family of PVS Chemicals, the Moroun family of the trucking company Central Transport and the Cotton family, which formerly ran Meridian Health, are among those who use the Gulfstream G280 flown by Air Eagle LLC. A Gulfstream G280 costs about $2,500 per hour to operate, according to Air Charter Advisors, a boutique jet charter broker based outside Philadelphia. Whitmer's trip to Florida took 2 hours and 10 minutes, while the return flight to Lansing took 2 hours, 24 minutes, according to tracking data from Flight Aware. At more than four and a half hours, the flight operation would have cost at least $11,250, according to Air Charter Advisors. During a Wednesday press conference, Whitmer noted she campaigned on stories regarding the challenge of taking care of her mom at the end of her life while rearing her daughter and serving as state representative.""This is a part of my story,"" she said.

594,The sticky problem of making Facebook go away,-8.0,33.67,https://theweek.com/facebook/1005668/social-media-outage-how-to-make-it-permanent,https://adfontesmedia.com/week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-06,24,"For a few hours on Monday, billions of people across the globe experienced something extraordinary: They got a taste of a world without social media. Well, not all of social media. Twitter was still there, and so was Snapchat, TikTok, Reddit, and lots of other platforms. But Facebook was gone, and so was Instagram, What's App, Messenger, and Oculus. It was a glimpse, for about five hours, of what it would be like to live without constant, instantaneous networked communication through the machines most of us carry around in our pockets and purses, and interact with at work, at home, and everywhere else we go. What if we decided to make it permanent — to greatly curtail or even eliminate these platforms from our lives and societies? Many of us probably wouldn't want to. Others may think doing so would be an improvement but doubt we have the will or the means to make it happen. But I suspect many others would welcome the chance to quiet the digital din in which we now live out our lives, if only we could figure out how. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. Monday's tech glitch — apparently caused by ""configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers,"" as Facebook put it in astatementpublished later that day — coincided exactly with the latest round of toxic press for Facebook. Whistleblower Frances Haugen has beentestifying before Congressabout how, in her capacity as a data scientist at the company, she encountered abundant evidence that Facebook knew that its products and services caused political harm to democracies (through the spreading of misinformation) and emotional harm to teenagers (by encouraging them to share airbrushed images of themselves and compete with each other for ""likes"" and comments). The company knew about the harm and yet did nothing to change because its entire business model is built on users doing the things that cause the harm. That would seem to point toward the need for much more sweeping government regulation of Facebook and possibly other social media companies as well. But how? Is social media like a business that provides a vital product or service but produces negative externalities (like pollution) that can and should be controlled and regulated? Or are the negative externalities the entire point, making social media companies much more like drug dealers who turn users into addicts with few if any positive consequences? If the latter is closer to the truth, then we face the question of whether our approach to hard drugs — prohibition rather than regulation — also makes sense for social media. Although increasing numbers of politicians like to make a show of bashing social media companies, it's unclear whether there's any serious will to act against them, at least in this country. The Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Facebook could potentially force it to sell off Instagram or other holdings, but it wouldn't force a change in the nature of the company's core business practices. The European Union is entertaining more sweeping regulations. But even they would stop far short of banning Facebook, which would probably prove unpopular, let alone trying to break it up, which would go far beyond the power of European regulators. That's because Facebook is an American company. If it's going to be broken up, that's going to have to happen here. But would it? I'd say it's highly unlikely — and not only because Mark Zuckerberg could just pick up and move himself, his fortune, his expertise, his top employees, and (most crucially) his hugely marketable trove of information about his users' preferences to any country in the world willing to host his digital enterprise. After a rocky period of transition, most people would probably notice little difference in their experience on the platform with itoperatingfrom New Zealand, Singapore, or Mauritius. Facebook is also unlikely to face the music because of our tendency to be persuaded bylibertarian argumentsthat tell us the market will save us. Don't worry, we're told — if Facebook and other digital platforms really are bad for us, individuals will eventually choose to disengage from them, driving the companies into the ground or forcing them to change how they do business in order to survive. Allowing that process to run its course is much better than attempting to control it artificially using government power. Too bad that in cases of addiction, the market is more the source of the problem than a solution to it. We choose to participate in these platforms because they warp our preferences by giving each of us a surge of dopamine whenever we receive a ""like"" in response to a photo or see our prejudices conformed by the stories that appear in our individually curated news feeds. Waiting for the market to punish a company in the business of giving us information ever-more perfectly tailored to our likes is like trying to quash the drug trade by telling heroin addicts to ""Just Say No."" It might make us feel like we're doing something useful, but itisn't going to work. Some of government's most crucially important work involves trying tosave us from ourselves, and each other. Regulating or breaking up social media companies would just be the latest example of that. Which doesn't mean we'll do it right — or do it at all. Acting requires overcoming the same resistance that keeps the market from punishing Facebook all on its own. (People complain about these companies, but they also love to use their products.) And like everything these days, polarized partisanship has a way of standing in the way of addressing problems in an intelligent, holistic way. Instead, we get Democrats trying to force social media companies to do things they think will undercut support for their all-too-dangerous opponents and Republicans favoring a different set of responses to accomplish the reverse. It would be vastly better for officials from both parties to do the arduous work of thinking about how adjustments to social media could make public and private life in the 21st-century United States a little bit better overall. At the moment, this doesn't seem especially likely. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep trying and hoping for more. As that work continues, remember how it felt during those fleeting hours when Facebook, Instagram, and the other platforms disappeared — and remember we have it in our power to move our world somewhat closer to that alternative reality.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1246791556526069,0.4644016013485041,1415,2,The Week
595,Biden and Fauci: One million shots a day ‘starts today’,-4.0,42.33,https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2021/biden-and-fauci-one-million-shots-a-day-starts-today/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,24,"On President Joe Biden’s first day in office, he asked all Americans to wear a mask for the next 100 days. He says it would save 50,000 lives. He also invites you toread the 181-page planto fight the coronavirus. Biden says he is launching a “full-scale wartime effort” to fight COVID-19. He signed executive action using theDefense Production Actto accelerate whatever is needed to test and vaccinate and protect the public against the virus. The Defense Production Act is a byproduct of the World War II-era War Powers Act, which gave President Franklin Roosevelt broad authority to influence the economy and manufacturing. The Defense Production Act gives the federal government the authority to get contracts for the U. S. government ahead of everybody else when purchasing essential goods. And yes, President Donald Trump used the Defense Production Act. It is not at all uncommon for presidents to do so. President Trump claimedto have used the Defense Production Act 80 times to accelerate the production of respirators, rubber gloves and masks, for example. Butin fact, The New York Times says, Trumprarely used the actand instead relied on Department of Defense expenditures and executive orders. The Federal Research Service identified six timesTrump used the act. The Times says:U. S. government agencies routinely use the Defense Production Act. It is used thousands of times a year for things like purchasing critical military equipment and speeding up infrastructure repairs following hurricanes. But during the early months of the pandemic, the White House suggested that wielding that authority would have amounted to left-wing overreach. When Biden criticized President Trump for not using the Defense Production Act when Biden was still a candidate for president, Trump began claiming that he did. Using the Defense Production Act may stir images in your head of the president signing an order and factory lines roaring to life. The reality is more like what happened on July 19, when the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services announced a $3.5 million award for surgical mask production. The masks should start coming off production lines in May of this year. One example that you may remember from last spring did involve the Defense Production Act. General Motors and a company called Ventec moved lightning fastto convert a GM parts factory into a facility that produces ventilators. The plan to build the ventilators started with the Defense Production Act,but those involved in the process said the act made it possible to get the parts necessary to build the ventilators. It took only one month from the first phone call for the first ventilator to be produced in a former car parts plant. Six months later, the plant hadproduced 30,000 ventilators. But the Defense Production Actcan put manufacturers in a bindwhen they already have orders that come from other countries to fill and are forced to shove them back to comply with the U. S. government’s needs. The new national COVID-19 plan includes a passage that named 12 immediate supply shortages. They are:The national plan mentions the shortage of“low dead-space needles”a couple of times. Low dead-space needles preserve the amount of vaccine that is wasted in any shot. Look at this diagram and you see that a low dead-space needle saves a tiny bit of vaccine, but multiply that by hundreds of millions of doses and you see why this would matter.(TSK)With each shot, a low dead-space needle saves 4 to 8% of vaccine used. And low dead-space needles also mean that the patient gets the full dose that was intended, without leaving some medicine in the syringe. How bad is the shortage of personal protective gear? One indication might be how many requests come into the nongovernmental group“Get US PPE.”They produce a daily report on what and how much PPE is being requested:(Get Us PPE)One day into his new job, President Biden inherited an economy that is tanking. Last week — and keep in mind, this is one week — 900,000 people filed new unemployment claims. That’s not all. Another 423,000 people in 47 states filed claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. That program helps self-employed and gig-workers whose work has dried up during the pandemic. These are big numbers, so let’s get a comparison. Until now, the single biggest week of unemployment filings was near the beginning of the pandemic in the U. S. — when 695,000 people filed for assistance. The 900,000 last week easily tops the previous high of 695,000. (A note of caution: Sometimes the weekly figures do fluctuate some, so they may not be exact.)The Bureau of Labor Statistics saysabout a fourth of the nation’s unemployed are temporarily out of a job, meaning they expect to be back at work within six months. Residents seeking to receive the COVID-19 vaccine stand in line at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in the Harlem section of New York City on Jan. 17, 2021. (Photo: mpi43/MediaPunch /IPX)Somebody recently told me, or maybe it was posted somewhere, that scoring a COVID-19 vaccine is like trying to score a ticket to a Rihanna concert. Now, even after you get through the clogged website or overloaded phone lines, some states have begun canceling appointments because they are out of vaccines. In New York City, 23,000 appointments were canceled. Mayor Bill de Blasio said a shipment of the Moderna vaccine was delayed but didn’t explain why or how. The city’s commissioner of health, Dr. Dave Chokshi,didn’t offer much insight, saying, “Our best understanding is that this was purely a shipment issue. Whether it was a logistical challenge of making sure there was enough packing material or dry ice for the shipment, we don’t have those details. But it appears that it was a logistical issue from the distributor of the vaccine that the federal government partners with.”I have seen similar stories fromErie County, New York. Michiganis also reporting shortages andvarious cities in Californiaare running out of vaccines. Fox News says:San Francisco’s health departmentsaid it is likely to run out of vaccine this week, in part because the state pulled back on administering a batch of Moderna shots after several health workers suffered what may have been a bad reaction. The county health department received 12,000 doses last week but fewer than 2,000 this week. West Virginia, which has run one of the speediest vaccination drives in the country, in part by using small-town pharmacies, said it didn’t receive an expected increase in doses this week. With 99.6% of first doses on hand already administered, officials are clamoring for the government to send more.“Here we are with no vaccines,” said Republican Gov. Jim Justice, fretting that other states have doses sitting unused. “We’ve got them all in people’s arms and we’ve done exactly what we should have done. … I think performance ought to be rewarded.”He said the state hasn’t received a promised 25,000 additional doses this week on top of its usual weekly allocation of about 23,000. Hawaii leaders complained that the state received 59,000 doses last week but expects only about 32,000 this week. The Oklahoman saysthe Oklahoma City health department sought 25,000 doses last week and got 6,000 doses. The city says it could give four times as many shots per day if it just had the vaccine. The Atlanta Journal-Constitutionreports Georgia is emptying shelves. But people who got their first dose of the vaccine on Jan. 11 will be due for a second shot in early February and there is no assurance that there will be enough vaccine available to provide the booster:Even if they get appointments, it’s not clear if Georgia will have enough doses on hand to administer second shots while still meeting theoverwhelming demandfor first shots. On Tuesday the head of the Georgia Department of Public Health reiterated theuse-’em-up policy, saying local health departments have been told not to hold any doses back. Not all health districts administering first doses have been automatically setting up follow-up appointments, which should be set three weeks later for the Pfizer vaccine and four weeks for the Moderna. Some departments have only been writing the dates on the backs of vaccination cards when patients should return for their booster, leaving it up to them to set the appointments. That’s createdfear and confusionwithin a population desperate to put the pandemic behind them, as a super-spreader variant strain is gaining a foothold and the death tollcontinues to break records. Some states seem to be having more success in scoring vaccines than others, so some states are getting tougher about who gets their shots. Florida just announced that it is requiring proof of state residency for vaccination. It appears seasonal residents (we call them snowbirds) will still have access to shots. This is not just a Florida story. Your state may be seeing this, too, especially if you are in a community near a state line next to a state that has its act together when yours does not. As has been typical of the national vaccine rollout so far, mass confusion has set in as Florida county health departments say they are unclear about what a patient must prove to get a shot. As a result, about 39,000 out-of-staters have gotten the vaccine in Florida. Florida says, in effect, if we are going to be giving vaccines to visitors, we need more supply. Some are taking the philosophical “we are all in this together” approach and, after all, the federal government is paying the tab. The Tampa Bay Times reports:Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, said the state shouldn’t be thinking about geography when it comes to vaccines, but about getting shots to as many people as possible, although she doesn’t like the idea of so-called “vaccine tourism.”“If you’re living here, meet the criteria and willing to get the vaccine, let’s stick it in your arm,” she said. Her own parents are snowbirds from the Midwest who got shots this month in South Florida. Both are in their 80s and have underlying conditions, Rasmussen said.“They pay property taxes, they do spend six months a year,” she said. “They, by all rights, should get a vaccine even though their driver’s license says Minnesota.”And what about foreign visitors? Would states allow a sort of vaccine tourism industry to begin where visitors come for the vaccine and hang around and spend money for 21 days to get the booster?President Biden had until July 6 to cancel America’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization, but it made it one of the first things he did when he got to the Oval Office. President Trump had announced last year that he wanted the U. S. to pull out of the WHO and gave the organization the required one-year notice. But even in saying the country will rejoin the organization, the Biden-Harris campaign threw a little shade on the WHO, saying that “while (the WHO is) not perfect — (it) is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic.”NPR said the relationship damage caused by leaving the WHO will be more difficult to repair than the financial effects of the country’s temporary withdrawal:When the U. S. first announced plans to pull out of WHO, many critics worried about the effects on funding for the organization. The U. S. has historically been its top donor — contributing$893 million to the agency’s budgetfor the budget cycle of 2018 and 2019. While the U. S. stillowes about $90 million to the WHOin outstanding membership dues (known as assessment contributions), other countries have stepped in to fill the gap, saysLawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who is also director of the World Health Organization on Global Health Law. However, he says the loss of U. S. funding would have been “devastating if it were made permanent by U. S. withdrawal.”The Biden administration recently announced that the U. S. would join COVAX, an international cooperative to help get vaccines to poorer countries. President Trump refused to join the group,which involves virtually all of the rest of the world, except Russia.(Axios)Axios reported that COVAX “is expected to be the only source of vaccines for some of the world’s poorest countries, and it needs additional funding to fulfill its goal of vaccinating at least 20% of the population in every country by the end of 2021.”Axios adds:Wealthy countries like the U. S. have secured their access to those vaccines and others and are increasingly confident they’ll begin mass vaccination this spring. But according toresearch from DukeUniversity’s Global Health Institute, there likely won’t be enough doses to cover the entire global population until 2024. With its bulk orders for six vaccines, the U. S. could find itself in control of around one-quarter of the world’s near-term supply, according to the Duke analysis. I have warned about this before and, like clockwork, here come the social media videos claiming that people who took COVID-19 vaccines started shaking and convulsing. While it is true that a small percentage of people who have a history of allergic reactions to vaccines have had mild reactions to this one, too, the videos that claim severe reactions are unproven. WhenPolitiFact tried to get to the root of the videos, the claims had more holes in them than Swiss cheese. There is always the possibility that spending the time and energy dispelling rumors just draws more attention to them, but at some level I suppose we have to trust the public to separate truth from nonsense — if we supply them truth on which to make a decision. A Monarch butterfly pauses in a field of goldenrod. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)Each year,the Xerces Societycounts western monarch butterflies that winter along the coast of California. The researchers announced this week that the 2020 butterfly count was the lowest ever. The count is usually tens of thousands or, looking back to the 1980s, even millions. This year, and it is no typo, they counted 2,000 (to be clear: two-thousand) butterflies. The Xerces Society says, “For every 2,250 monarchs there were 30 years ago, there is only one left flying today.”An Associated Press story explainswhat might be going on and what it means:Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in western states because of destruction to their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change. Along with farming, climate change is one of the main drivers of the monarch’s threatened extinction, disrupting an annual 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) migration synched to springtime and the blossoming of wildflowers. Massive wildfires throughout the U. S. West last year may have influenced their breeding and migration, researchers said. The experts say that, at some point, the species will get so low that it will not survive. In the meantime, the Xerces Society says it is working with farmers to restore habitats. Why should you care about a butterfly?They are pollinators. About 80% of all plants need help pollinating, whether by bees or birds or other critters, including butterflies. Think of it this way: Experts say about one out of every three bites of food you eat is made possible by a pollinator. And it goes beyond what they mean to humans. Pollinators are essential to the global ecosystem. What harms one could be a signal to all. If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It's not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up. But few share Trump’s disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let’s build proper support systems and processes to deal with high levels of stress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I’m sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.’Our working paper found that the tech giants owe publishers billions of dollars. Here’s how we arrived at that conclusion and what it means.",3,Reliable,0.046500393545848,0.3881770423389742,3576,3,Poynter

S., anddeprivedthe United States of doctors, nurses, and other medical workers during the coronavirus pandemic. There was a great sense of joy and relief at the ban's demise. The NO BAN Act Coalition, a broad alliance of 81 national and local civil rights, faith, and community groups fighting for anti-discrimination legislation that isnow includedin Biden's U. S. Citizenship Act, issued astatementbidding ""goodbye to the Muslim and African ban.""The statement continued:Almost four years ago, one of President [Donald] Trump's first acts in office was to ban Muslims from the United States. Three years later, he expanded the ban to include several African countries. Today, it's fitting that one of Biden's first acts is to rescind the Muslim and African Ban. This is a momentous occasion for the millions of Americans who were separated by the ban and those who stood up against this injustice at airports nationwide. Thank you, President Biden for staying true to your promise to repeal this bigoted policy immediately. The Muslim and African Ban was never about national security, it was always rooted in bigotry and called into question what values America stands for. However, just ending the ban through an executive order won't stop this from happening again. That's why we applaud the historic inclusion of the NO BAN Act in the U. S. Citizenship Act of 2021. Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations-San Francisco Bay Area,toldthat Biden's order would ""correct the course"" of the lives disrupted by Trump.""Tens of thousands of impacted individuals will now have the chance to be with their families during cherished and challenging times,"" said Billoo. ""While we know our work is far from over, today we celebrate the heroic efforts undertaken by so many over the last several years in our effort to repeal the Muslim and African bans.""Some of the most poignant reaction to the end of the ban came from people directly affected by it. Ramez Alghazzouli, a Syrian immigrant who had been separated from his wife for a year due to the policy, toldit felt like a boulder had been removed from his chest. But he also said the travel prohibition irreparably damaged his family.""The ban itself will be reversed but no one can reverse our feelings and emotions and the time we lost while being separated from each other,"" said Alghazzouli. ""It'll still be part of our life and history. The Muslim ban is the nuke that we survived but we are still suffering from its collateral damage.""There was no shortage of suggestions on what Biden could do help heal the harm caused by travel ban, from ending Trump-era ""extreme vetting"" of Muslims and others entering the U. S., to increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country, to ending U. S. wars that havekilledat least hundreds of thousands of Muslim men, women, and children since 2001.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1611486486486486,0.3384009009009009,836,2,Common Dreams

Trump spent the entire pandemic negligently, dishonestly, corruptly, and in some instances psychotically getting as many Americans killed as possible. His “Operation Warp Speed” was largely a boondoggle. And he put absolutely no plan of action in place for rolling out the COVID vaccine. Biden had to do all the work.

But Ford, in his op-ed, insisted that the media was exaggerating — and he even described the insurgents as ""concerned Americans.""""Let me be real clear. There was no riot in DC,"" Ford wrote. ""There was no insurrection. There was no 'storming"" of the Capitol Building. There was a peaceful rally. There was a largely peaceful protest that was marred by some bad acts by a very few people. There was and is, absolutely nothing to be traumatized or intimidated by. It's time to tell the press, the politicians and even our pastors, stop the gaslighting.""While Ford was trying to convince RedState readers that the events of Jan. 6 were no big deal, national security experts were saying that Washington, D. C. will require enormous security when Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. Aformer Secret Service agent, following the Jan. 6 siege, told Politico that on Jan. 20, ""There will be barriers in place you didn't have yesterday. And I think instead of having just the Capitol Police there to protect the Capitol (to start), you're going to have thousands of other law enforcement that are going to be standing elbow to elbow.""CNN's Jake Tapper slammed Ford's op-ed, tweeting:",2,Generally Reliable,-0.0515020576131687,0.5124279835390946,691,0,AlterNet
600,N.Y. helps rebuild our tattered political norms,-10.0,40.33,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/08/11/opinion/ny-helps-rebuild-our-tattered-political-norms/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"Andrew Cuomo didn’t want to resign — and only did so because his fellow Democrats had the fortitude to insist on it. That much is clear from the defiant speech the New York governor delivered on Tuesday, attacking the sexual harassment allegations against him even as he said he would step down in 14 days. A week after a devastating report into his conduct, it was the right thing to do. But the praise here should go to women who came forward with the allegations, and to the other political leaders who held firm that Cuomo’s behavior had rendered him unfit for office. That includes not only New York’s legislative leaders, but also thegovernors of neighboring statesand President Biden, all of whom had demanded Cuomo resign. The report, by New York Attorney General Letitia James, corroborated the claims of 11 women who accused Cuomo of a range of behavior, from inappropriate comments to groping. Cuomo denied some of the allegations, said some of his actions had been misinterpreted, and signaled he would put up a fight against a potential impeachment. And then, for the first time in what seems like a long time, the norms that are supposed to constrain American elected officials held up against attack from a bully. Cuomo and his defenders tried to attack the accusers or the fairness of the process, part of the playbook of embattled politicians from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump, but that strategy didn’t work. It’s an encouraging outcome, after the disaster of Donald Trump’s presidency and the ineffective response to his abuses from members of Congress and his fellow Republicans. They could have upheld standards that way New Yorkers did, but chose not to. Ideally, of course, it should never come to this: A sense of personal shame ought to have convinced Cuomo his time was up. In democracies, some sense of personal integrity and a capacity for shame plays an important role in maintaining good governance: It’s a key enforcement tool of anticorruption norms and acts as a check on power. It’s why scandal-plagued governors typically resign instead of putting their states through drawn-out impeachments (think Robert J. Bentley, the governor of Alabama, who resigned in 2017 after using public funds to help cover up an affair, or Oregon governor John Kitzhaber, whoresigned in 2015amid an ethics scandal). AdvertisementBut the backstop has got to be the willingness of the rest of the political system to enforce — and thereby reinforce — norms. That’s not to say every mistake a politician makes should be career-ending. Sometimes they just need to sincerely apologize and commit to righting a wrong, theway Virginia governor Ralph Northam didafter it was revealed he had worn blackface earlier in his life. Trump’s presidency, though, and the feckless response of congressional Republicans to his flagrant abuses of power, seemingly taught politicians and other public officials if they didn’t give an inch, if they attacked their accusers, if they never apologized, they could live down any scandal. Shamelessness worked for Trump, and Cuomo seems to have initially hoped it would work for him, too. It’s also the strategy now being used by, for instance, US Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who continues to serve in Congress despitean investigation into whether he sex-traffickeda minor, which he has denied with bizarre conspiracy theories. The fact that the electorate is so polarized, and that many Americans are prepared to look the other way at the misdeeds of those on their side of the political divide, only makes it harder to hold politicians accountable. AdvertisementNew York is a deeply Democratic state, and by forcing Cuomo out there’s not much chance that Democrats will lose control over the governor’s office in the next election. But the fact remains that at a time when public-corruption laws have been gutted and the ability of the political system to police itself called into question, they showed how it’s possible to hold politicians to the standards Americans deserve in their elected officials.

The Kootenai County board voted 4-3 Thursday to pull back to just a recommendation that residents wear masks to contain the coronavirus, no longer making them subject to fines for not doing so, theHillreports. One board member said he gives up. ""Nobody's wearing the damned mask anyway,"" Walt Kirby said. ""I'm sitting back and watching them catch it and die."" A colleague, Allen Banks, told health care professionals at the hearing that there is no such disease, perCBS. ""Something's making these people sick, and I'm pretty sure that it's not coronavirus,"" he said, ""so the question that you should be asking is, 'What's making them sick?'""Board members are political appointees and aren't required to have medical expertise. The board was told that the Coeur d'Alene hospital, Kootenai Health, is at 99% capacity, even after doubling up patients and adding beds. Other hospitals in the area also stopped taking admissions, and patients might have to be sent to Seattle for care, officials said. The recent surge in new coronavirus cases has hit Idaho, and its hospitals, hard. The state reported 950 new cases Thursday, for a total of 56,600. Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, has left decisions on restrictions up to local officials. A health official told the board that providers are wearing out. ""We're facing staff shortages, and we have a lot of physician fatigue,"" he said. ""This has been going on for seven months—we're tired.""
