0,Biden: Cuba ‘a failed state’ and is ‘repressing their citizens’,-0.33,44.33,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/15/biden-cuba-a-failed-state-and-is-repressing-their-citizens,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"United States President Joe Biden, facing twin crises close to his country’s borders, on Thursday declared Cuba “a failed state” and said sending US forces into Haiti is not on his agenda at the moment. Protesters have beendemonstratingin Cuba since Sunday as anger has grown about shortages of basic goods, electricity and internet outages, curbs on civil liberties and the government’s handling of a surge in COVID-19 infections. The hardships are exacerbated by a decades-old US trade embargo that is being reviewed by Biden’s administration.“Cuba is, unfortunately, a failed state and repressing their citizens,” Biden said Thursday at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House. Amid calls from Republicans and Biden’s fellow Democrats to restore internet services to Cuba, Biden said his administration is looking into it.“They’ve cut off access to the internet. We’re considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access,” Biden said. Meanwhile, there have been calls for the US to send troops to Haiti after President Jovenel Moise wasshot deadearly on July 7 at his Port-au-Prince home by what Haitian authorities describe as a unit of assassins, including 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans. The assassination has pitched the already troubled Caribbean nation into chaos, coming amid a surge in gang violence that has displaced thousands and hampered economic activity in the poorest country in the Americas. Biden made it clear that the US is “only sending American marines to our embassy” for security purposes.“The idea of sending American forces into Haiti is not on the agenda at this moment.”Biden welcomed Merkel to the White House Thursday to discuss disagreements about Russia and China as the two leaders seek to strengthen a relationship that suffered under former President Donald Trump. The US and Germany are key NATO allies. Biden and Merkel have known and worked with each other for years. But their two governments are at odds over a host of tough issues, including theNord Stream 2pipeline being built from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, which Washington fears will hurt Ukraine and increase European reliance on Russian gas. They also disagree about the wisdom of partnering with China on business projects, restrictions on travel to the United States from Europe, and Germany’s opposition to temporary patent waivers aimed at speeding up COVID-19 vaccine production. On the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, “They didn’t resolve their differences, specifically, the United States came into this meeting knowing this was going to be a friction point between the two leaders and it appears they didn’t find any common ground,” Al Jazeera White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett said. Merkel told reporters that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, has different views on the pipeline from the US. But she said Berlin viewed Ukraine as a transit country, evidently meaning she believed that natural gas should still flow through Ukraine, even if the pipeline is completed. Merkel said there are a “number of instruments” that Europe can take, including sanctions, if Russia does not meet commitments to Ukraine on the pipeline. Russia says the $11bn pipeline, led by state energy company Gazprom and its Western partners, will be completed later this year. Biden said that “good friends can disagree” on a project such as Nord Stream 2 and that both leaders have asked their teams to look at practical measures the countries can take on the pipeline if Ukraine’s energy security is weakened. Biden, 78, and Merkel, 66, see eye to eye on a string of broader issues, and both want to strengthen the transatlantic relationship that suffered under Trump’s frequent, withering criticism of close US allies. Merkel, chancellor since 2005, plans to exit Germany’s government after national elections in September, meaning she is likely to be seen as a “lame duck” in her final months in power. Polling shows herChristian Democratsare poised to take the lead in forming a government after the election, but it remains unclear which parties would be included in a coalition. Biden’s Democratic Party has tenuous majorities in the US Congress that could evaporate in the 2022 congressional elections. Merkel’s White House visit – the first by a European leader since Biden took office in January – showed the US was trying to make amends with an ally that had often been attacked during the Trump years.",3,Reliable,-0.0518253968253968,0.3414285714285714,941,3,Al Jazeera
1,Is Russia Un-Losing the Cold War?,10.0,29.33,https://www.thebulwark.com/is-russia-un-losing-the-cold-war/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-06,17,"There’s no ignoring it now: For 30 years, if not longer, the KGB and its successor agencies, affiliates, and allies have been actively and surreptitiously working to destabilize, disintegrate, and corrupt Western societies, economies, institutions, and governments. The recently uncoveredPandora Papersdetailing the gobsmacking wealth of some of Putin’s closest friends add yet more to the pile of evidence of weaponized corruption. For those searching for details, two sources are incomparable. InPutin’s People, Reuters special correspondent Catherine Beltonchronicles the system of strategic corruptionbegun under Yuri Andropov and consummated under Putin. A recent report by the Free Russia Foundation, “The Kremlin’s Malign Influence Inside The U. S.,” explores how Russia is exploiting the weaknesses of America’s open society. The KGB has long been described as a “state within a state.” Behind the Iron Curtain, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union controlled all the levers of power, and the KGB controlled the Communist party. Sensing the weakness of the U. S. S. R. in the 1980s, the KGB began a systematic effort to offshore as much of its money as possible. That effort, of which the then-KGB colonel Vladimir Putin was probably aware, continued after the KGB was formally dismantled in 1991. But, as Belton details, the process of offshoring black money continued through the Yeltsin years, entangling itself in the rise of the oligarchs and Russian organized crime worldwide. But the money-moving operations weren’t merely defensive—at least, not for long. The Free Russia Foundation report explores how Russia is exploiting the weaknesses of America’s open society, specifically the energy sector, critical infrastructure, non-profits, far-right political groups, and social media, especially Twitter. The expertise behind it is impressive: The chapters on energy and critical infrastructure were written by Vladimir Milov, who served as deputy minister of energy in the early Putin years before becoming a leading critic of the regime. Transnational corruption expertCasey Michelassesses the Kremlin’s use of “philanthropic” and political donations to both respectable, establishment U. S. institutions and far-right groups—a two-step dance familiar to Kremlin watchers. A data scientist and a political scientist conclude with the extent of Russia’s success in weaponizing Twitter. Both works seek to reveal how opaque corporate governance helps the Kremlin hide its hands. As a case study, the Free Russia Foundation report details how American Ethane, a multi-billion-dollar shale company, is controlled by a network of Russian companies and oligarchs, such as the Houston-based Amshale LLC. One of the individual shareholders, Konstantin Nikolaev, has been a financier of Maria Butina, the Kremlin operative whoinfiltratedright-wing political groups and was imprisoned briefly in the United States and later released and deported. Another one of those oligarchs is Roman Abramovich, famous for owning the London-based Chelsea Football Club and whois tryingto silence Ms. Belton through a libel lawsuit. Such arrangements are common—not that anyone bothers to look most of the time. Belton gives the example of Irakli Kaveladze, a Russian “illegal” (deep-cover spy) who worked with the FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, “as the vehicle for transferring more than $1.4 billion in Russian and East European black cash into US bank accounts . . . . Kaveladze also registered about two thousand corporations in Delaware for Russian clients he claimed to know little about—not even their true identities.”The detail and research behind both reports is manifest, and yet some important points go unelucidated. Like any secret police organization—or any organized criminal group, for that matter—the organizing principle of Russian influence and weaponized corruption is unjust, unaccountable, unpredictable violence. Inconvenient people who blow the whistle, want too much for themselves, or otherwise get in the way are arrested if they’re lucky, murdered quickly by a bomb or a bullet or poison or defenestration if they’re slightly less lucky, or, in the worst case, die by slow torture. Belton mentions a number of these victims—Anna Politkovskaya, Boris Berezovsky, Alexander Litvinenko, Sergei Magnitskiy—but almost in passing. Yet, it’s hard to read these works without a sense of guilt bordering on shame. As Russia analyst Mark Galeotti hascommented, “weaponized corruption” isn’t just something Putin’s KGB men have done to us, but something we in open, democratic societies have done to ourselves. Surprisingly, one of the clearest enunciations of this point comes from Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who went from Russia’s richest man to its highest-profile prisoner for daring to criticize Putin. Belton quotes him:It was a strategic mistake of some Western institutions to think they could live without principles. They thought it was great—“We will work with Putin, because we can make money from this.” But it turned out to be not such a good idea. This lack of principles has brought the West to the consequences it is experiencing now. Khodorkovsky knows of what he speaks. After his politically motivated imprisonment, one of the international oil companies eager to cozy up to the Kremlin by buying shares of his expropriated company, Yukos, was BP:BP had made no secret of the fact that it was seeking to use the offering to buy its way into the Kremlin’s favour, that it was an exercise in “relationship-building.” “We think it’s a good strategic investment for our position in Russia and our relationship with the Russian oil industry and with the Russian authorities,” said a spokesman for the company. There are plenty more examples of Western self-corruption. American Ethane, the shell shale company owned by Russian oligarchs, has been represented by prominent lobbying firms such as BGR Group, founded by former Mississippi Governor, Republican National Committee chairman, and White House aide Haley Barbour. Tenam Corporation Uranium One, the American subsidiary of the Russian national atomic energy company ROSATOM, has benefited from the lobbying services of BGR and the Podesta Group, founded by John Podesta, former chief of staff and counselor to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, founding president and current chair of the Center for American Progress, and an influential figure in the Biden administration. Gazprom, the state gas monopoly, and Rosneft, the state oil company, have both been represented by former Secretary of State James Baker and his firm, Baker Botts. Baker Botts’s backing for the Kremlin, and for its energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, followed a model it had already honed in many of the world’s autocratic regimes, where for decades it had been a supporter of major U. S. oil company interests. . . Baker had been introduced to Alexei Miller, the close Putin ally who served as Gazprom’s chief executive. . . “I told him Khodorkovsky was a murderer,” said one of the Western intermediaries involved in the process. “Baker is very sophisticated.” He’d immediately understood. A bit of moral relativism had helped win the Texan law firm over. Russians have also infiltrated the debates over U. S. policy. For instance, the Columbia University’s School of International and Public Administration (SIPA) houses a think tank, Center for Global Energy Policy (CEPG). Two of its scholars are sponsored by Russian oil oligarchs, and they have published research making the economic and environmentalist arguments for policies that will favor the Russian energy sector over American competitors. The Atlantic Council, a D. C. think tank dedicated to better trans-Atlantic relations, recently accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from Victor Pinchuk, a pro-Russia Ukrainian oligarch who has carried Putin’s water and been credibly accused of helping with the coverup of the murder of Georgiy Gongadze, a Ukrainian journalist. The Clinton Foundation also took Pinchuk’s money. Other major D. C.-based think tanks that received donations from oligarchs include the Brookings Institution, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Wilson Center (which continue to produce scholarship critical of the Putin regime). Of course, Russian influence isn’t limited to left-leaning think tanks, but extends to organizations such as the NRA and right-wing and/or white nationalist Texas and California secessionists. But a key insight of the report is how the Kremlin exacerbates already existing divides in America by inflaming racial sensitivities—hence the Internet Research Agency’s use of both the @TenGOP (i.e. Tennessee Republican party) and @blackstagram Twitter handles. And then there is the issue of investments in American critical infrastructure. The beneficiaries include household names like Uber, Lyft, and Zoom but also lesser known, yet important, Silicon Valley firms, private equity firms, and—wait for it—cybersecurity firms. What could go wrong?And then there are the cultural and religious donations. The Kennedy Center, New York’s Jewish Museum, Lincoln Center, the Met, the National Gallery of Art, Carnegie Hall, the Guggenheim, and the New Museum have all held and promoted Russian art and culture in return for generous gifts. Andrew Foxall, a Russia expert cited in the Free Russia Foundation report, explains this phenomenon: “When Western publics think about Russia, Putin wants them to think about Pushkin, Tolstoy, Tchaikovsky. What he does not want Western publics to think about is the actions of his regime that goes to war with its near neighbors.” Cultural exchange is great—but not when it’s paid for with stolen money and bought as a cover-up for world-historic crimes. Belton’s book is eye-opening, even for those who followed the squalid details of the Trump-Russia connections with rapt attention. A key insight is that the KGB Russian nationalists, who remain in charge, never walked away from their anti-Westernism. Though they gave up on communism, they adopted state-capitalism as a new way to defeat the West. The Free Russia Foundation report is equally illuminating and contains policy proposals that deserve consideration if not immediate implementation. Reading both, it’s impossible not to be reminded of Lenin’s famous ethos:Who whom?Though it might be time to add a corollary:Who themselves?",1,Questionable,0.0598418942168942,0.3842601842601842,2309,2,The Bulwark
2,"Trump was wrong about the law, Obamacare politics and his judges",-13.33,33.67,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-was-wrong-about-law-obamacare-politics-his-judges-n1271216,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-18,25,"WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trumppromised to repeal Obamacare, thehealth insurance programthat helped fuel the backlash tea party movement and ultimately his own candidacy. If Trump couldn't get Congress to do away with the law — and he couldn't, even with Republicans in control of both chambers — he vowed to chooseSupreme Courtjustices who would declare Obamacare unconstitutional.""If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing, unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on Obamacare,"" Trump tweeted in 2015, referring to the decision Roberts wrote that preserved the law's mandate for Americans to buy health insurance. But two of the three jurists Trump picked for the court — Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — voted with Roberts as part ofa 7-2 majorityThursday to deny standing toa group of conservative statesthat claimed the law harmed them. It was a major blow — perhaps a decisive one — against the political right's long fight against Obamacare and a sign of the limit of Trump's influence on the justices he appointed. In the first hours after the ruling, Trump greeted the news with the deafening silence of defeat. And as President Joe Bidenand Democraticcongressional leadersscrambled to put out statements in praise of the ruling, most Republicans followed Trump's lead by refusing to give it any extra attention. Rather than speak individually, House Republican leaders put out a joint news release. In a break with Trump's style, they refrained from attacking the court or its decision while highlighting their distaste for Obamacare, which is formally titled the Affordable Care Act.""While the Supreme Court ruled today that states do not have standing to challenge the mandate, the ruling does not change the fact that Obamacare failed to meet its promises and is hurting hard-working American families,"" said the statement, issued by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N. Y. ""Now, Congress must work together to improve American health care.""There was no promise to renew the fight to repeal the law or to mount another court battle over its constitutionality. House Republicans remember how Democrats hammered them over the repeal effort in the 2018 midterms and easily won control of the House. Now, as they look to take back power, Republicans aren't at all interested in fighting to take health insurance benefits away from millions of Americans. Former President Barack Obama nodded to the political and legal dynamics Thursday afternoon.""This ruling reaffirms what we have long known to be true: the Affordable Care Act is here to stay,"" he said in a statement. Such an outcome was far from certain last year, when Trump nominated Barrett to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Around the same time, he said repeatedly that the court should overturn Obamacare.""We know what he thinks because he tells us what he thinks, and he made it clear that he wants his Supreme Court and this nominee to join him in eliminating the Affordable Care Act,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said at Barrett's confirmation hearing. ""This is his litmus test.""Barrett steadfastly declined to show her hand at the time, following the past practice of nominees in evading senators' questions about ongoing court cases. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who led off Democratic questioning, asked her directly about the suit that ended up being decided Wednesday.""It's a case that's on the court's docket, and the canons of judicial conduct would prohibit me from expressing a view,"" Barrett told Feinstein. At the time, many Republicans and Democrats believed Barrett would be inclined to side with Trump, particularly because she had been critical of Roberts' previous opinion upholding Obamacare in an unrelated case. But only two justices — Samuel Alito and Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch — departed from the majority's opinion Wednesday, which essentially held that the states had no standing to sue because they wouldn't be harmed by an insurance mandate that the justices said is unenforceable. It's unenforceable becauseTrump and Congress eliminatedthe law's penalty for people who decline to buy health insurance.""Unsurprisingly, the States have not demonstrated that an unenforceable mandate will cause their residents to enroll in valuable benefits programs that they would otherwise forgo,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the majority. Justice Clarence Thomas, siding with the majority, wrote a separate concurring opinion. In the end, Trump was wrong about the law, the politics of trying to kill the Affordable Care Act — and the assumption that he could control the votes of his Supreme Court picks.

3,What should the media do with Donald Trump’s refusal to concede?,-5.0,43.67,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-should-the-media-do-with-donald-trumps-refusal-to-concede/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-11,24,"Scared. Unsettled. Stressed. Angry. Nerve-racked. Nauseous. These are some of the words used to describe how most of us felt in the days leading up to the 2020 election. But the election has passed. Election Day was more than a week ago. A decisive winner was projected over the weekend. So what are the words we can now use to describe how many of us feel today?Scared. Unsettled. Stressed. Angry. Nerve-racked. Nauseous. Despite projections that Joe Biden won the presidential election and despite no proof of fraud or any other improprieties, President Donald Trump has yet to concede. Making matters tenser, Trump is getting support from many of his Republican allies, like Sens. Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And making it even worse, if that’s possible, is that Trump is riling up his followers thanks to help from many in conservative media. That includes several on-air personalities at Fox News and Fox Business, as well as the usual suspects such as radio host Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart. On one hand, you want to tell responsible media to just ignore all this noise, to block out the shenanigans, to not give these baseless claims any oxygen, to trust that democracy is going to work and to show faith in our election process by not even acknowledging those whose intent is to stir up trouble. There is no evidence supporting any of Trump’s claims. To act as if there might be — or to even report that Trump and others are saying this — needlessly creates doubt and frightens citizens. To report on such things might, inadvertently, give credence to these allegations, which is exactly what Trump and his team want. The goal seems to be more about creating doubt in the election than actually winning it. On the other hand, how can one ignore when high-ranking elected officials such as McConnell and Graham, and leading government officials such as Pompeo, are leading these conspiracy theories? How can one just let some of those on a popular network such as Fox News say whatever they want and get away with it even though the suggestion of fraud undermines the country and our democracy? Part of the media’s role in a strong democracy is to be a watchdog, so shouldn’t it be paying close attention to any attempts to weaken that democracy?It’s a fine line, and I don’t claim to know exactly what the answers are. There’s no indication that Trump will concede at any point or that enough Republicans are going to stomp down Trump’s claims to make it all go away sooner rather than later. There’s also little hope that places such as Fox News and Fox Business will crack down on their primetime personalities to keep them from pumping life into all this garbage. The one person who could do this — Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch — so far and as far as we know has chosen to not get involved, perhaps because he is more interested in ratings than doing the right thing. Any advice to the media seems wishy-washy and vague, such as: Pay attention, but not too much attention. Don’t ignore it, but also don’t overdo it. Report on what’s said, but overwhelm audiences with facts. Cover it enough to let people know what’s happening, but not enough to make it seem like the election might be rigged. Like I said, I don’t have the answers. I’m not sure anyone does. But I do know this: The more this junk is reported, the more doubt and angst it creates. Media outlets and consumers need to ask: Who is creating this narrative? Who benefits from all this doubt and angst? Who is hurt by it?The answers are obvious. The ways for the media to fix it are less obvious. Our best hope is to remember that this democracy and the process to elect our leaders have worked for more than 200 years. Maybe it’s naive, but we have to have faith that it will work here, too. On CNN Tuesday,Jake Tapper notedthat many Republican officials are publicly backing the president and not acknowledging that Biden won the election. Tapper said, “This is not just cowardly, but dangerous.”However, Tapper added, “I’ve spent some time today talking to Republican officials on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and what they say is no one out there should worry that our democracy is in actual jeopardy. They say this is all part of walking President Trump through this process emotionally, and that they assume that while he may never concede, he will leave. There will be, they say, a peaceful transition in power to the Biden-Harris administration on Jan. 20. They say that. But they say that on background because they don’t want to upset President Trump and they don’t want to get death threats from his supporters. Now you may or you may not find that reassuring.”Chris Wallace of Fox News. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)Tuesday night was a special one for Poynter and journalism. Chris Wallace — whose five-decade career includes stops at ABC, NBC and Fox News, where he has been for the past 17 years — was honored with the 2020 Poynter Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism. Typically, the medal is awarded at a Bowtie Ball in St. Petersburg, Florida, but this year’s event was held virtually because of COVID-19. In an interview with Poynter president Neil Brown, Wallace talked about the election, working at Fox News and even what it’s like to vacation with George Clooney. As far as the election, Wallace said, so far, there’s no indication of any voter fraud. He said, barring something unforeseen, that he fully expects Joe Biden to be sworn as the next president in January. He called the current situation with Donald Trump refusing to concede “not normal.”When talking about Fox News, Wallace noted the difference between the news side of Fox News and the opinion side.“There’s a firewall there,” Wallace said. “And I would argue more so than the other cable news stations.”As far as the one person he never interviewed, but wants to? Queen Elizabeth, because she has seen most of the news of the past century. And, finally, that vacation with George Clooney. They hung out at Lake Como, drinking Italian wine and talking politics. Wallace called Clooney “the smartest person” he had ever met when it came to talking politics. Previously honored with the Poynter Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism were Katie Couric, Lester Holt, Judy Woodruff, Tom Brokaw and Bob Schieffer. Looking for an expert source?

(Courtesy: CBS News)Media junkies will really enjoy a podcast put out by CBS News that takes listeners behind the scenes with the network’s election coverage. This 30-minute episode of “The Debrief”starts with Election Day morning and runs all the way through to the moment when CBS News projected Biden as the winner. The pod is hosted by CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett and this episode includes reports from all over the country, from Arizona to Atlanta, as well as the White House to where Biden was in Wilmington, Delaware. Garrett said in the episode, “All of us gathered on the New York set. It was silent, electric, full of unspoken anticipation, anxiety, the sense that history was moving beneath you, about to propel you and the nation in a new direction. I felt exactly the same way on election night in 2016. It has nothing to do with partisanship. It has everything to do with the votes and voices of Americans and the clarity when it comes to their judgment, their decision.”A Mexican journalist was shot just as he was about to go on the air Monday, and later died at the hospital. CNN’s Jack Guy, Tatiana Arias, Natalie Gallón and Kiarinna Parisi reported, “Israel Vázquez, who worked for digital news outlet El Salmantino, was covering a ‘discovery of human remains’ in the city of Salamanca, in the central state of Guanajuato, at the time of the attack.” Vázquez was 31. In a statement, El Salmantino said, “Today our colleague, Israel Vázquez, while working as a reporter, was the target of a vile and cowardly attack that took his life. All of us who work at El Salmantino condemn not just this one attack, but all of those that occur daily in the city of Salamanca.”Sadly, attacks on journalists in Mexico are not uncommon. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Mexico as the deadliest country in the world to be a journalist. Vázquez was the third journalist killed in Mexico in less than a month and is believed to be the ninth journalist killed in Mexico this year. Last year, 11 journalists were killed in Mexico, the most of any country. After a summer of reckoning over race, The Los Angeles Times and Tribune Publishing have agreed to pay $3 million to resolve a lawsuit brought on by a group of multiethnic journalists who argued they were paid less than white male staffers. The Los Angeles Times’ Meg James reported that payment could impact nearly 240 current and former reporters and editors who would be eligible for back pay. James wrote, “Under the settlement, all Black and Latino reporters, copy editors and line editors employed by The Times from Feb. 14, 2015 to Oct. 26, 2020, could receive a portion of the award. All women who worked as reporters and editors during that period could be covered.”Ken Dilanian, NBC News’ national security and intelligence reporter, had a hot mic moment on MSNBC on Tuesday. Not realizing he was live on the air, he glanced at his phone and let out a couple of R-rated words. (You can see the cliphere, but again just to give you a heads up, there’s R-rated language.)He later tweeted, “So sorry for the profanity I used on air last hour. I was experiencing some technical difficulties and mistakenly hung up on the control room, though my mic still was on. Perils of playing producer, cameraman and tech support all at the same time from home. #2020” He also included an upside-down smiley face emoji. Normally, this would be the kind of thing that could get a bunch of people up in arms, but with the way this year is going, a couple of muttered curse words is pretty low on the list of things to get fired up about. NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell interviews with Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday. (Courtesy: NBC News)NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell spoke on Tuesday with Dr. Anthony Fauci, who said “help is on the way” following the announcement that Pfizer has an experimental vaccine that shows 90% effectiveness against COVID-19. Fauci told Mitchell that he expects the vaccine to go through the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization process in the next week or two and if authorized, Fauci added, “by the time we get into December, we’ll be able to have doses available for people who are judged to be at the highest priority to get it first.”If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It's not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up. But few share Trump’s disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let’s build proper support systems and processes to deal with high levels of stress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I’m sorry for everything you have all been through.

State corrections officials pronounced Quintin Jones, 41, dead at 6:40 p.m. at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville,The Texas Tribune reported. He was convicted 20 years ago of the 1999 murder of his great-aunt, Berthena Bryant. The lethal injection came hours after the U. S. Supreme Courtdeclineda petitionby Jones' lawyers seeking a stay of execution. The court documents said the state unconstitutionally denied his intellectual disability claim and used now-discredited expert testimony during the sentencing phase of his trial to assess Jones' future danger potential. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Jones' application for a stay on May 12, and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted against clemency on Tuesday, according toThe Texas Tribune.

Jones confessed to killing Bryant, saying he beat her with a baseball bat after she refused to loan him money. He ultimately took $30 from her purse and stole her car, which he later abandoned in a parking lot. He told police another man named James lived in his head and blamed the murder on this other personality. Texas' most recent execution occurred last July whenBilly Joe Wardlowwas put to death. The state executed three people in 2020, thefewest in nearly 25 years. Texas delayed multiple scheduled executions due todisruptionscaused by COVID-19. Gov. Greg Abbott could delay the execution by 30 days without a recommendation from the board, but he's never done so. Jones was the fourth person put to death in the United States in 2021.

The Bethesda man had been found guilty in the fiery 2017 tunnel death of Silver Spring resident Askia Khafra. Beckwitt was also convicted of involuntary manslaughter, which the appeals court did not overturn. He will now face a new sentencing, and the ruling means that he could end up doing less time (he is currently serving a nine-year sentence). The bizarre case was chronicled in anin-depth 2019 Washingtonian story. Khafra died in a fire that broke out in a series of tunnels leading to a bunker underneath Beckwitt’s home. A budding entrepreneur, Khafra was working for Beckwitt at the time, digging tunnels with a pickax and shovel. He would eat, sleep, and use the restroom in the shaft as he clocked long hours. Unlike a straightforward homicide charge, a “depraved heart” murder describes a death that occurs due to an extreme disregard for human life. When the house caught fire, Khafra escaped the burrow network but never emerged from the basement’s rubble. Beckwitt was found guilty in April 2019.

6,"Evers denies clemency to inmates as high heat, COVID risks raise health concerns",-10.33,49.0,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/08/11/wisconsin-rejecting-release-requests-prisoner-health-concerns-rise/3311115001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/milwaukee-journal-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-11,19,"Temperatures in at least one Wisconsin prison have reached at least 87 degrees this summer, intensifying health concerns in prisons, already considered among the most dangerous environments during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Tony Evers has opted not to consider any clemency requests from inmates, and corrections officials have rejected nearly all applications for early release based on health conditions. Already overcrowded, the population in state-run prisons is rising again after months of decline, though still down since the beginning of the year. More than 21,000 adults are held in buildings designed to house fewer than 18,000. Inmates and their family members have reported troubling conditions, including poor ventilation, high temperatures and the impossibility of social distancing. In at least one facility, staff are forcing inmates to keep doors closed to restrict airflow in response to coronavirus risk.“My sister said, 'I am laying still, not moving, and I am soaking wet,'” said Alisha Niedziejko, whose sister is incarcerated at Robert E. Ellsworth Correctional Center in Union Grove. Health experts say air restriction could actually worsen the risk. Stagnant air allows any viral droplets to build up inside shared cells. And stifling heat can weaken the body's ability to fight it off.“There’s no way someone who has COVID should be in a hot environment,” said Dr. Susi Vassallo, a New York University medical school professor who studies effects of heat. “You’re going to get sicker.”The American Civil Liberties Union has called on Evers to reduce the incarcerated population before further spread of the virus. More than 300inmates in state prisons have been infected and 21 cases remain active. Outbreaks have beenworse in other states’ prisons.“Wisconsin could be next if it does not respond with more urgency than it has shown so far,” Sean Wilson, manager of the Wisconsin ACLU's Smart Justice Campaign, said in a statement Wednesday. At least 131 Wisconsin inmates have applied since March 1 for what's known as compassionate release based on their old age or extraordinary health conditions, according to Department of Corrections spokesperson John Beard. A corrections committee has rejected 106 of those cases and forwarded 14 to courts for final decisions. Of those, courts have released two people and denied three while nine await hearings. Another 11 are waiting for consideration by the committee. It’s hard to know exactly how hot it is inside Wisconsin prisons. Staff aren’t required to check air temperatures inside, Beard said. But after several calls from concerned sister Niedziejko, staff did take air temperatures at Ellsworth in Union Grove. At 4 p.m. July 7, temperatures ranged from 81 to 87 degrees in cells and hallways, Beard confirmed. Cells do not have air conditioning, while staff offices have air conditioning units for the windows. Inmates can crack their windows and buy small fans if they can afford them. Niedziejko has drawn more than 300 people to a new Facebook group, “Light in the Dark,” looking to support inmates at the facility and beyond.“They have a right to not undergo extreme heat conditions,” Niedziejko said. “That‘s cruel and unusual punishment in my opinion.”In fact, when inmates at a prison in Boscobel sued the state in 2002 and argued the heat constituted cruel and unusual punishment, officials agreed to keep temperatures below 85 degrees. A judge ordered them to install air conditioning in order to meet that goal, case documents show. Other facilities continued operating without air conditioning. Inother states, medical examiners havedeterminedinmates have died from hyperthermia, or overheating. Vassallo, from NYU, was called upon as an expert in the Boscobel case. She said overheating could aggravate heart problems, asthma and other medical conditions. In a recent interview, Vassallo said a heat index over 80 degrees is a “dangerous range” and the threat of COVID makes overheating an even more concerning issue. Beard said there is no maximum allowable temperature in DOC prisons. When the heat index (factoring in humidity) exceeds 90 degrees, inmates are encouraged to use wet towels, cancel strenuous sports and drink at least six glasses of water per day. If the heat index reaches 104 degrees, they’re encouraged to drink at least 12 8-ounce glasses of water per day and cancel non-essential work involving physical activity. As Niedziejko sought solutions for her sister, she came across Facebook videos by Niki Wilichowski, who was recently released after spending three years at Ellsworth. Wilichowski was also trying to improve conditions at the facility. Wilichowski inspired her church, Fox River Christian Church in Waukesha, to donate 25 fans to go to inmates who weren’t able to purchase their own. She knows how hard it can be to scrape together money; she remembers making 10 cents per hour, working her way up to 45 cents per hour as a meat prep cook.“Not everybody has family that takes care of them,” she said. Wilichowski was especially concerned about the new closed-door policy, making conditions more stifling. Beard said the policy is due in part to security concerns and in part to the pandemic.“Keeping doors closed prevents cross-air flow between rooms and also minimizes chances of persons in our care potentially spreading the virus by lingering or talking at each other’s open doors,” Beard said in an email. It’s not so simple, according to health experts. Dr. Jeff Pothof, chief quality officer at UW Health, said while it’s possible that small particles of the virus could be carried between rooms sharing air, the primary goal is to have enough air flowing that those particles are quickly diluted by cleaner air.“Anything that improves air circulation is better than having it be stagnant,” Pothof said. “The longer the air stays in one place, the higher the potential viral load could become.”Behind closed doors without proper airflow, any exhaled viral particles will continue to linger and add up in the air. That makes it more dangerous for cellmates, or anyone else exposed to the same air, because they’re more likely to breathe in enough of the virus to become infected. It also makes the heat harder to bear, inmates said. A former Ellsworth inmate, Tammy Wieting, said the summer heat was sweltering even when they could open their doors. She said she had to visit health services multiple times, once in a wheelchair, because she was so dizzy. Inmates have reported high temperatures at several other facilities as well. Robert Thibault, part of the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, compiled notes from some. An inmate in Oshkosh said he wanted to start an awareness campaign with the hashtag, “I can't breathe cause our cell is too hot.”“I feel very bad for the elderly and people with health problems ... they are the ones that suffer the most,” the inmate wrote. “I am just sitting in my cell writing a letter doing nothing (and) I get soaked in sweat just sitting there.”Niedziejko and Wilichowski both hope to continue bringing attention to conditions inside the prisons. Niedziejko said she’s been trying to talk with prison officials about a way to provide air conditioning at Ellsworth and other facilities.“At the end of the day we’re all human beings and if I were an inmate undergoing this treatment I would pray that there was somebody out there to do the same for me,” she said. Many inmates have applied for early release due toworrisome health conditions. Health experts have noted that thesafest responseto the pandemic in prisons is to reduce the population of people locked up, allowing those remaining to maintain more distance. Evers and corrections officials havemultiple avenuesavailable for this reduction. This spring, corrections officials did release hundreds of inmates who were locked up, mostly in county jails, not for crimes but for infractions to their parole, probation or supervision agreements. From March 2 to April 27, that population shrank from 3,680 to 1,700. Since then, it has beencrawling back up, reaching 2,153 as of Aug. 3. Inmates and their advocates are disappointed there have been only two “compassionate releases” since March. The 131 applications filed for compassionate release since March is significantly higher than the 13 filed in the same period last year. The department has additional tools it could use to release more inmates in response to the pandemic, which Beard said it has not used. There’s a “special action parole” option to release inmates to parole for the purpose of relieving overcrowding. Individual wardens also have the option to release inmates when they deem someone is in need of emergency release. Similarly, Evers has not used his clemency powers to cut short or delay sentences for any inmates. He has instructed the state pardons board to deny clemency to all who haven’t completed their sentences. Dozens of inmates requested waivers from Evers' criteria, asking that they be considered for clemency in light of the pandemic. Rayshun Woods, at Waupun Correction Institution where over 200 inmates have tested positive, said he was worried for his life due to having asthma, diabetes and cystic fibrosis.""There is a great possibility that I can die from this COVID-19,""Woods wrote. ""I want to see my love ones again, spend time with them. I want to show society that I have changed, I have grown.""At Jackson Correctional Institution, Ryan Lemke also worried about his high risk for complications, noting he has a health condition that requires regular treatments that suppress his immune system.""I'm hoping this finds someone who sees the seriousness of my situation, understands the risk of being in this position at this time, and is able to help,""he wrote. Other governors have released inmates who are particularly medically vulnerable and ordered commutations for thousands of others to reduce overcrowding. InKentucky,New MexicoandWashington, governors ordered mass commutations for inmates not convicted of violent crimes who were due for release in the coming months. A commutation does not erase someone's record but ends their incarceration early. ACLU Wisconsin staff said they met with Evers' staff to discuss such options for reducing the incarcerated population. They still hope to see releases.""We’ll continue to push that because how fast COVID is spreading,"" said Melissa Ludin, regional organizer with the ACLU's Campaign for Smart Justice. ""These are human lives. We want to see our governor act on the solutions given him for how to get some of these people home.""Contact Rory at (414) 801-1525 orrory.linnane@jrn.com.

Make My Day,20.33,29.0,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/10/blue_states_secede_make_my_day.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-thinker-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,25,"It was a bit of a surprise to read tweets from Lanny Davis, the famous attorney and associate of Bill and Hillary Clinton, detailing the possible secession of the blue states from the rest of the country. You can read portions of the sequence of tweetshereorhere. This may be Lanny's way of venting Democrat frustration. Despite every dirty trick the left has employed, Trump is still president and may continue to be through 2024. Okay, if you red-state rubes will not kneel before us, we will pick up our socialist toys and create a country of our own!To be clear, this is not a threat of civil war. It is more like a family law attorney telling the unappreciated wife what she can expect out of the divorce. For example, Davis claims that the new country will get the following states:Hawaii, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and all the Northeast ... including Puerto Rico, the U. S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and Washington D. C. He then claims that his new country will also get the following:We get the vast majority of the major shipping ports ... Costco, Starbucks, and Boeing ... stem cell research and the best beaches ... the Statue of Liberty ... Intel, Apple, and Microsoft...85 percent of America's venture capital and entrepreneurs ... 90 percent of the high tech industry, most of the U. S. low-sulfur coal ... Hollywood and Yosemite, thank you. He also mentions they get:... all the Ivy and Seven Sister schools — Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, the Penn, Princeton, and Yale; and Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Smith, Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, Barnard, and Radcliffe colleges; plus UCLA, UCB, Stanford, Cal Tech, and MIT. He finishes it off by saying:... 61 percent of you crazy bastards believe you are people with higher morals, th[a]n we lefties. Oh, and you can have all the new COVID-19 cases since you're too dumb and self-centered to wear masks. Nice, Lanny. Tell us how you really feel. Clearly, Mr. Davis did not study geography while in college. There are several major ocean ports in the southeastern and gulf states from Norfolk, Virginia to Corpus Christi, Texas, including Charleston, Miami, New Orleans, and Houston. I sort of get his point about Costco, Starbucks, Boeing, Intel, Apple, and Microsoft, due to the location of their corporate offices, but they and the rest of the high-tech industry are not rooted in the ground. I am sure all of them will want to continue doing business with red-state America, and considering how blue states like to raise taxes, many of these businesses may decide they are better off moving to a red state. In fact, this is already happening. Tesla, among others, is moving some of its operations from California to Texas mainly because of taxes. Seriously, dude, the best beaches? Ever heard of Florida?Hate to lose the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite. Maybe the liberals will let all of us deplorables come see them. Sorry to lose Cal Tech and MIT, too. Lanny, you can keep Hollywood and all of the arrogant posturing actors who think pretending to be someone else makes them experts on politics, the attitudes and religious morals of the working class, the Second Amendment, and climate change. You can also keep the Ivy League and all of the other elitist college training centers for the theory and practice of socialism. Oh, and once we get readily available vaccines, the whole mask controversy will die out. The one major flaw in Mr. Davis's plan is that state boundaries are not absolute and inviolable. They are political in nature and can be changed. During the last episode of secession in 1863, the state of Virginia was divided along political lines. The eastern part, old Virginia, remained Confederate until the end of the war, and the western part became West Virginia, a Union state. This same scenario will present itself if blue states decide to secede. Many blue states are already highly polarized politically between the liberal cities and the conservative rural areas. Illinois, for example, has one massive liberal city, Chicago. The rest of the state, which is roughly four times larger in terms of area, is fairly conservative. I cannot imagine rural Illinois would be willing to follow liberal Chicago out of the Union, no matter how the state Legislature votes. Illinois is not the only one. Would the rural areas of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania blindly follow the lead of Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia? What about upstate New York and New York City, California east of the Sierra Nevada mountains versus the western coastal cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco, southern New Jersey outside the Philadelphia sprawl? The list goes on. If we follow the Virginia–West Virginia precedent, there could be anywhere from three to as many as ten new red states created if blue-state secession occurred. This would leave the seceded blue states a lot smaller than Mr. Davis originally envisioned, perhaps the size of several counties each. Red states would be left with most of the farmable land, plus most of the energy and other natural resources. Still, this may be the solution to a lot of our problems. Blue-state secession will solve the issues of who runs the majority of the country; if the government is going to socialist or more traditional center-right; and the ongoing political fights over abortion, policing, immigration, and most of the more recent appointments to the Supreme Court. Many countries have broken apart in the past thirty years. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia all separated into smaller countries, and there are separatist movements in other places, such as Spain and Belgium. Even Britain has devolved some of the central government's power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Will secession occur in the U. S.? Unlikely. The blue states would get a lot more trouble and a lot fewer benefits than they expect. If it does happen, I am perfectly willing to let our blue-state brethren leave, just as long as we do not end up with a Chinese military airbase at LAX and a Russian airbase at LaGuardia.

S. senator from Alabama again, leads other potential Republican candidates in a new poll. In the survey released today byMason-Dixon Polling & Strategy,27 percent of respondents said they'd support Moore if the Republican primary were held now. Three Alabama members of the U. S. House trailed him -- Mo Brooks with 18 percent, Bradley Byrne with 13 percent, and Gary Palmer with 11 percent. State Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh had 4 percent, and businessman Tim Jones had 2 percent. A quarter of respondents were undecided. Moore is well-known for his anti-LGBTQ stances. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he fought marriage equality, claiming that the state didn't have to obey the U. S. Supreme Court's ruling on the matter. In 2017 he was removed from the state's high court for good, due to ethics violations related to his efforts against equal marriage rights. He then ran in a special election for the U. S. Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, ultimatelylosing to Democrat Doug Jones. The race was marked by accusations by several women of pedophilia and other sexual misconduct on Moore's part. Jones's term is up in 2020, and in the poll, 40 percent of respondents said they would vote to reelect him, 50 percent would replace him with a Republican, and 10 percent were undecided. Byrne is the only Republican who has formally declared his candidacy so far, but Moore has said he is thinking about another Senate run. ""I'm seriously considering it,"" he told American Family Radio host Bryan Fischer, whose homophobia matches Moore's, last month. Moore's poll results reflect the fact that he has greater name recognition than others in the Republican field,CBS Newsreports. But his extremism and the accusations will likely put off many voters, the network notes. ""The national Democrats would be happy to have such a controversial candidate opposing Jones,"" according to CBS. ""Jones might not beat a traditional Republican candidate in 2020 -- but Democrats know that he has already beaten Roy Moore once.""",2,Generally Reliable,0.1701915985249318,0.5854681738015071,467,2,Advocate Magazine
9,These South Florida hospitals will be among the first with the COVID-19 vaccine,0.0,51.67,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-coronavirus-covid-vaccine-within-weeks-20201118-7edsoqrye5ccpl2x3bci7ofsau-story.html#nt=pf-double%20chain~homepage-top-heads~recommender~automated~-dont-move-popular-rec~7EDSOQRYE5CCPL2X3BCI7OFSAU~5~5~11~11~art%20no,https://adfontesmedia.com/sun-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,21,"The new COVID-19 vaccine — not yet approved for use — is on its way to two South Florida hospitals. Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami will be among the first five hospitals across Florida to store the vaccine while they wait for final approval to use it, officials said Wednesday. The vaccine stored by hospitals will be whichever the government approves first, possibly Pfizer’s. The other three hospitals are AdventHealth Orlando, formerly Florida Hospital Orlando, as well as Tampa General Hospital and UF Health Jacksonville. The first vaccines would start arriving in mid-December and another shipment is expected in January. The plan to start supplying hospitals with the vaccine comes as a ray of hope as Florida’s COVID-19 infectionscontinue to rise. The number of new cases has followed monthlong trends of increases across the state, based on health department data. Infectious disease specialists warn that a rate over 5% shows the virus is not under control, and all three major South Florida counties have exceeded that level this month. There will be a phased approach to vaccination by creating priority groups.“During the first phase, the vaccine will be available for front-line health care workers in hospitals, long-term-care staff and residents, and first responders,” said Lidia Amoretti, spokeswoman for Jackson Health System. The Florida hospitals were chosen by the state because they’re in heavily populated areas and have the ability to maintain ultra-cold storage. Memorial Regional Hospital has “purchased freezers capable of storing the vaccine at the appropriate temperature,” said hospital spokeswoman Kerting Baldwin.“We put in an order three weeks ago so we would have more capacity. We had a freezer but we ordered another larger one,” said Aurelio Fernandez, the president and chief executive officer of Memorial Healthcare System. “We saw that Pfizer was getting close so we ordered a larger freezer.”The U. S. will get 40 million vials and the governor told him Florida will get about 2 million of those, Fernandez said. The Pfizer vaccine requires two shots so that means about one million people will benefit from the Pfizer vaccine. Jared Moskowitz, the director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Wednesday that the deployment of vaccines to hospitals is part of a plan that kicked off earlier this year. Months ago, the emergency management division started “preparing for the vaccine and procured millions of syringes and gauze so that we would have the supplies ready to help deploy the vaccine,” Moskowitz said. “We’re ready to deploy the vaccine. But while we wait to get it, people need to continue to wear masks and do mitigation measures.”Pfizer recently announced that an early analysis showed its vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. The vaccine, developed with the German company BioNTech, has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius until shortly before it is injected. Pfizer said Wednesdaythat new test results show its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective, is safe and also protects older people who are most at risk of dying. Another company,Moderna, said Mondayits COVID-19 vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective. The news from both companies puts them on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U. S. One of the main goals of the federal government’sOperation Warp Speedwas to work with drug companies to manufacture the vaccines even before clinical trials were completed, so that millions of doses would be ready to go if a vaccine was successful. Lubby Navarro, director of legislative affairs for Memorial Healthcare System, whose flagship hospital is Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, told Broward mayors at a closed-door meeting Monday that they are seeing a “third wave of increases” of new coronavirus patients. Memorial is one of the five hospital locations in Florida designated to have the vaccine, and “we should be receiving it in a couple of weeks,” she told the mayors, according to records obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel.

10,Low-Wage Workers Bear Brunt Of COVID-19 Pandemic As The Rich Profit,-15.0,47.0,https://shadowproof.com/2020/08/12/raging-class-war-poor-working-americans-covid-19/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-12,22,"From the immense pressure placed on workers to return to low-wage jobs to broken social safety nets that have compounded poverty, food and housing insecurity, and inadequate unemployment benefits, America’s poor and working class have borne the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic. Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, income inequality was at itshighest levelssince the U. S. Census Bureau began tracking the widening gap fifty years ago. These gaps are now more stark and pronounced amid job losses inthe millions, which have primarily impacted low-paying industries. Business closures have been extended, and a workforce where40 percentof Americans didn’t have $400 in savings for emergencies before the pandemic has suffered immensely. Coronavirus cases in California soared toward the end of June, with Los Angeles County emerging as ahot spotin the state. Health experts haveattributedsurges in coronavirus cases to several states reopening businesses too soon, with workers recalled to jobs at hotels or restaurants, where they are in constant contact with other people. Nubia Calderon, a housekeeper at a hotel chain, returned to work at the end of June after she was furloughed when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U. S. and “non-essential” businesses were ordered to shut down. (Note: The hotel chain will remain unnamed to protect Calderon from potential retaliation.)She feared she would catch the coronavirus, and though she was provided with masks and disinfectant, Calderon recently tested positive along with her daughter and husband.“Living with COVID-19 is something I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I’m really hoping there will be a pause in reopening these hotels,” Calderon said. The U. S. Census published asurveyconducted from July 16 to July 21, 2020, in which nearly 30 million Americans reported not having enough food to eat that week. Food banks around the U. S. havestruggledto meet the demand created by the pandemic and this food insecurity among Americans isexpectedto increase over the next few months. Eviction moratoriums have expired in states throughout the U. S., withup to 40 millionAmericans at risk of facing eviction from their homes over the next few months. Nearly 27 million Americans lost their employer-based health insurance during the first two months of the pandemic in the U. S., according to a May 2020reportby the Kaiser Family Foundation, while health insurance companies have maderecord profits. Eighty-seven million Americans were uninsured or underinsuredprior to the pandemic, and 42.4 percent of Americans weremaking lessthan $15 an hour. According to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute,10.7 percentof the workforce in the U. S. had no reasonable chance of being recalled to their job prior to the pandemic. That’s 17.6 million Americans forced to find new jobs in a job market where there are currently14 million more Americans out of workthan current job openingsEmployerscontinue to fire workersin response toprolonged closuresandrevenue declines. Worse, federal relief for Americans who need it most has come to an abrupt halt. Unemployment benefits—$600 per week—expiredon July 26, and action toextend reduced benefitsis still in limbo. Over 25 million people and their families were impacted by the loss of these benefits, while thousands of Americans arestrugglingto obtain any benefits at all due to outdated systems and immense backlogs atstate unemployment agencies. Teresa Reeves, a school bus driver in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, applied for unemployment on June 1. She still hasn’t received any benefits.“We are struggling without my pay as my fiancé is working seven days a week to keep us from getting utilities cut off and the mortgage paid. My mother and sister have helped with food and afew other things,” Reeves shared. Retailers employing “essential workers” initially rolled out bonuses or hazard pay bumps for such workers during the first few months of the pandemic, but these raises werecancelledover the past weeks, despite most states in the U. S.still experiencinga surge in COVID-19 cases. Republicans object to extending expanded unemployment benefits,claimingpeople should not make more on unemployment than they would on the job, and that such benefitsdisincentivizereturning to work. However, a July 2020reportconducted by Yale economists found there is no evidence of expanded unemployment benefits disincentivizing Americans returning to work. Arguments against extending unemployment benefits have relied on disparaging the motives of out-of-work individuals while Americans with wealth and power have benefitted from additional tax breaks and experienced soaring net worth after taking advantage of economic conditions and demands created by the coronavirus pandemic. Entirely eliminating the $600 per week expanded unemployment benefits will result in the loss of an estimated 5.1 million jobsand 3.7 percent in gross domestic product. If expanded benefits are cut to $200 per week as proposed by Senate Republicans, it would result in the loss of an estimated3.4 million jobsover the next year, according to analyses conducted by the Economic Policy Institute. Unemployment filings are still wellabove 1 million workersevery week. For 20 straight weeks, unemployment claims have been more than twice the worst week of the 2008 economic recession. While coronavirus cases and deathsdisproportionately impactBlack and Hispanic individuals throughout the U. S., Black and Hispanic workers experiencehigherunemployment rates. Workers in jobs deemed “essential” during the pandemic fell ill as outbreaks spread through their workplaces inmeat processing plants,WalmartandTargetstores,Amazonwarehouses,grocery stores,hospitals, throughout thetransportation industry, andfast foodrestaurants. Thousands of workers took on jobs at essential employers that hired en masse to meet surging demands, such asAmazonandInstacart. When workers organize and protest for improvements in safety protections, they are fired after doing so. This happened at companies likeTrader Joe’s,Amazon,McDonald’s,Dollar General, andUPS. In contrast, wealthy Americans benefited from provisions in the CARES Act, including a$135 billion tax breakfor individuals who make at least half a million dollars annually. Multi-million dollar federal contracts were awarded for supplies like masks that were eithernever deliveredor fundeddefective products. Wall Street’s profits have soared tonear-record highsin the stock market during the pandemic. Goldman Sachsreporteda 41 percent increase in its revenue in the second quarter compared to 2019. Supplyagreementsbetween pharmaceutical corporations and the federal government for coronavirus vaccines currently in development with help of federal subsidieshave sentpharmaceutical stocks, such as Pfizer, soaring. Before the pandemic, the average corporate CEOmade278 times more than the average worker, a gap that has widened significantly over the past few decades. During the first two months of the pandemic, U. S. billionairesboostedtheir wealth by $434 billion according to a report by Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezosset a recordwhen his net worth jumped by $13 billion in a single day. According to Bloomberg’s billionaire index, Bezos’ net worth hasincreasedby $72.6 billion in 2020. Elon Musk’s net worth has increased by over $40 billion during the pandemic. Mark Zuckerberg’s by $17.8 billion. The Walton Family, the controlling owners of Walmart,added $25 billionto their net worth in the past year, totaling $215 billion. Corporations and their executives have issued public relation announcements and campaigns praising essential workers as “heroes,” with unifying rhetoric, while only a small percentage of corporations cut salaries of CEOs and executives, and two-thirds of the corporations that did enact pay cuts for executives were only ten percent reductions of 2019 salaries, according to asurveyof about 3,000 public companies conducted by compensation analytics firm, CGLytics. Health care corporationsreceivedbillions in federal bailout money, but furloughed thousands of workers while paying executives millions of dollars. Corporations that filed for bankruptcy protection during the pandemic, including JC Penney, Hertz, and Neiman Marcus,approvedmulti-million dollar payouts and bonuses to corporate executives leading up to the filings. Nearly 700 companiesviolatedpaid sick leave laws for workers who tested positive for coronavirus, and workers still often find themselveswithout paywhile waiting days to receive test results to see if they have to continue quarantining or are to return to work after being exposed to the virus. For workers who have jobs that are calling them back, many arefaced withreduced hours, pay cuts, and a high pressure work environment that includes enacting safety protocols, working full shifts while wearing a mask, with the constant fear of catching it on the job.“At times the six-feet social distancing in the kitchen is hard because we have to cross paths. With masks on, we’re working in kitchens over 100 degrees. We’re sweating through our clothes the second we walk into our kitchen,” shared Alison Rozer, a cook at a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, who returned to work when reopenings began in June 2020. “It’s been really tough for me because I’m at high risk. (Note: The casino will remain unnamed to protect Rozer from potential retaliation.)“I have asthma, I have cancer, I have heart issues and it makes it really hard to protect myself.”",3,Reliable,0.024408122741456,0.3781547464880798,2125,2,Shadowproof
11,What Should We Call the Sixth of January?,-6.67,39.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-we-call-the-sixth-of-january,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"“Big protest in D. C. on January 6th,”Donald Trumptweeted before Christmas. “Be there, will be wild!” On New Year’s Day, he tweeted again: “The BIG Protest Rally in Washington, D. C. will take place at 11:00 A. M. on January 6th.” On January 5th: “I will be speaking at the SAVE AMERICA RALLY tomorrow on the Ellipse at 11AM Eastern. Arrive early—doors open at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS!” The posters called it the “Save America March.” What happened that day was big, and it was wild. If it began as a protest and a rally and a march, it ended assomething altogether different. But what? Sedition, treason, a failed revolution, an attempted coup? And what will it be called, looking back? A day of anarchy? The end of America?Trump called the people who violently attacked and briefly seized the U. S. Capitol building in order to overturn a Presidential election “patriots”; President-electJoe Bidencalled them “terrorists.” In a section of “Leviathan” called “Inconstant Names,” Thomas Hobbes, in 1651, remarked that the names of things are variable, “For one man calleth Wisdome, what another calleth Feare; and one Cruelty, what another Justice.” On the other hand, sometimes one man is right (those peopleterrorists). And, sometimes, what to call a thing seems plain. “This is what the President has caused today, this insurrection,” Mitt Romney, fleeing the Senate chamber, told aTimesreporter. By any reasonable definition of the word (including the Oxford English Dictionary’s: “The action of rising in arms or open resistance against established authority”), what happened on January 6th was an insurrection. An insurrection is, generally, damnable: calling a political action an insurrection is a way of denouncing what its participants mean to be a revolution. “There hath been in Rome strange insurrections,” Shakespeare wrote, in “Coriolanus.” “The people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.” Insurrection, in Shakespeare, is “foul,” “base and bloody.” In the United States, the language of insurrection has a vexed racial history. “Insurrection” was the term favored by slaveowners for the political actions taken by people held in human bondage seeking their freedom. Thomas Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, charged the king with having “excited domestic insurrections amongst us.” The English lexicographer Samuel Johnson, an opponent of slavery, once offered a toast “To the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies.” And Benjamin Franklin, wryly objecting to Southern politicians’ conception of human beings as animals, offered this rule to tell the difference between them: “sheep will never make any insurrections.”The term’s racial inflection lasted well beyond the end of slavery. In the nineteen-sixties, law-and-order Republicans used that language to demean civil-rights protests, to describe a political movement as rampant criminality. “We have seen the gathering hate, we have heard the threats to burn and bomb and destroy,” Richard Nixon said, in 1968. “In Watts and Harlem and Detroit and Newark, we have had a foretaste of what the organizations of insurrection are planning for the summer ahead.” In that era, though, “riot” replaced “insurrection” as the go-to racial code word: “riots” were Black, “protests” were white, as Elizabeth Hinton argues in an essential, forthcoming book, “America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s.” “Yet historically,” Hinton observes, “most instances of mass criminality have been perpetrated by white vigilantes hostile to integration and who joined together into roving mobs that took ‘justice’ in their own hands.” This remains an apt description of what happened on January 6th. One possibility, then, is to call the Sixth of January a “race riot.” Its participants were overwhelmingly white; many were avowedly white supremacists. A lot of journalists described the attack on the legislature as a “storming” of the Capitol, language that white-supremacist groups must have found thrilling. Hitler’s paramilitary called itself the, the Storm detachment; Nazis published a newspaper calledDer Stürmer, the stormer. QAnon awaits a “Storm” in which the satanic cabal that controls the United States will be finally defeated. So one good idea would be never, ever to call the Sixth of January “the Storming of the Capitol.”What words will historians use in textbooks? Any formulation is a non-starter if it diminishes the culpability of people in positions of power who perpetrated the lie that the election was stolen. It’s not a coup d’etat because it didn’t succeed. It’s not even a failed coup, because a coup involves the military. And, as Naunihal Singh, the author of “Seizing Power: The Strategic Logic of Military Coups,”told, the word “coup” lets too many people off the hook. “The people who you want to point fingers at are the president, the party leaders, and the street thugs,” Singh said. “And we lose that if we start talking about a coup; it gives a pass to all of the Republican politicians who have been endorsing what Trump’s saying.”In truth, the language of the coop seems more appropriate than the language of the coup. I mean chickens. “Coming home to roost” quite aptly describes the arrival of armed terrorists in the hall where, moments before, Senator Ted Cruz had summoned that very flock as he stood on the floor and urged the legislature to overturn the election. Derrick Evans, the West Virginia Republican lawmaker who joined the mob and, as he breached the doors of the Capitol, cried out, “We’re in! We’re in!” acted with more honesty and consistency than the hundred and forty-seven members of the House and Senate who, later that night, voted to overturn the results of the election after having hidden, for hours, from the very people they’d been inciting for months and even years.“Sedition” is too weak. Noah Webster, in his American Dictionary of the English Language, from 1828, offered this handy way to distinguish “sedition” from “insurrection”: “sedition expresses a less extensive rising of citizens.” In any case, sedition in the sense of a political rebellion, is obsolete. “Treason,” an attempt to overthrow the government, seems fair, though it almost risks elevating what looked to be a shambles: a shabby, clownish, idiotic, and aimless act of mass vandalism. If I were picking the words, I’d want to steer very clear of ennobling it, so I’d be inclined to call it something blandly descriptive, like “The Attack on the U. S. Capitol,” or “The Sixth of January.”“Remember this day forever!” Trump tweeted at one minute past six on Wednesday night. There’s no danger that anyone will forget it, by whatever name. The harder question is not what to call the events of that day, but what to make of the maddening four years and more that led up to it: the long, slow rot of the Republican Party; the perfidy of Republicans in the House and Senate since January, 2017; the wantonness of a conservative media willing to incite violence; the fecklessness of Twitter and Facebook; and, not least, the venality, criminality, and derangement of the President. Whether that story belongs under a chapter titled “The Rise and Fall of Donald J. Trump” or “The End of America” awaits the outcome of events.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0309838298955945,0.388479246243952,1776,3,The New Yorker
12,The Democratic Party Is Setting the Stage for a Letdown,-19.0,34.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democratic-convention-sanders-virtual/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"During the week of August 17, thousands of Democrats elected to serve as delegates to their party’s national convention will log on to their computers to view the proceedings. They will cast electronic votes on the party platform and for their party’s nominee to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency. About one-quarter of this year’s delegates are Bernie Sanders supporters. Most of them are progressive political activists—and many are first-time participants in a national convention. This virtual event will not be the experience they expected. And while all of those with whom I’ve spoken are supportive of the precautions being taken in this era of pandemic, most remain in the dark about the convention plans and whether their participation is valued. Months ago, when the 2020 Summer Olympics and a host of professional sporting events were canceled, it should have been clear that we were going to have problems bringing tens of thousands of delegates, supporters, and press to Milwaukee. I fully recognize the political calculations that had to be made, the problems of disappointing the host city, the need to have an event that would serve as a launching pad for the presidential election season. And I have no doubt that the convention planning team and DNC staffers were working round the clock weighing all these problems and exploring options. Nevertheless, what was missing was a recognition that the convention wasn’t just the concern of the planning staff or the Biden campaign. It was personal for the delegates—especially first-timers, many of whom worked hard to earn their posts, felt empowered when they won, and were looking forward to playing their part in this quadrennial drama. Given this, it was troubling how little communication there was with prospective delegates and how little engagement there was with DNC members while deliberations were ongoing. I should be clear that I am not faulting the convention or DNC staff that delegates were left in the dark. This was a political call that should have come from the leadership of the party. With this in mind, the Bernie Delegates Network (BDN) conducted a national survey of Sanders delegates. We wanted to get their assessment of the planning process, whether they felt respected as delegates, and ideas they might have shared had they been consulted. Their responses should be seen as troubling both for the party and the Biden campaign. More than 80 percent of those who responded said they felt disrespected or ignored. And their comments made clear why. Common refrains were that as delegates they “felt left out” and that the process was “lacking in transparency and input.” Some went further, cautioning that this year’s “organizing, like the 2016 DNC convention, seems to minimize participation by Sanders delegates.”Two others summed up the views of many: “It should have been anticipated much earlier that the convention would be online and things planned with that in mind ahead of time. [There were] a lot of missed opportunities…” And there was “too little communication with stakeholders, that is, delegates and DNC members. It has been a closed affair— not seeking input…” Frequently, the Sanders delegates also complained that they had no idea how this convention will allow their voices to be heard. They expressed the desire to participate but said they “don’t know how.” And a number of first-time delegates were unsure whether their participation was even valued by the party. Some may dismiss these complaints as coming from the disgruntled losing side, but there is a risk in doing so. Young and old progressives are an important constituency. They make up a respectable share of Democratic voters, and many are activists who represent communities Democrats will need to win. As Jesse Jackson famously noted at the 1988 Democratic convention, “It takes two wings to fly.” In party-building, there can be no victor/vanquished. The role of a successful convention is to heal internal divisions and create unity of purpose among the various component groups of the party. In 2016, too little attention was paid to this critical undertaking. Bernie Sanders, personally, tried to soothe the disappointment felt by his delegation. But the message they received from the establishment was “We won, and you lost.” They felt shut out of the proceedings and left the convention demoralized. This year could have been different. So far, it has not been. There isn’t the same degree of rancor as there was four years ago; the Biden/Sanders task forces formed to create a unified approach to writing the platform, while producing a document not wholly satisfying to progressives, was still a good-faith effort to bridge differences. But leaving grassroots delegates in the dark as to how the convention will work—and reducing their role to passive online viewers—runs the risk of producing a massive letdown that could leave hundreds of delegates alienated. What this may mean is that at the conclusion of the party confab, many first-time Sanders delegates (and some old-timers, as well), instead of being energized and engaged, may turn off their computers feeling deflated and dejected. The unity so necessary for victory will not have been achieved. This can still be addressed. If there is a will, creative solutions can still be found to give us the “two wings” we need to fly. But time is running out.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1107638888888888,0.4817361111111111,1105,2,The Nation

The action is part of a blitz of executive orders Biden has issued during his first few days in office.“We’ve already identified suppliers and are working with them to move the plan forward,” Biden said in a briefing today. The administration hopes the DPA can accelerate vaccine production. The planhighlights the need for more vials that hold the vaccine doses, syringes to deliver it, and dry ice critical to their transport.“We’ll do whatever we need to do to ensure that we have an adequate supply of vaccine,”saidTim Manning, Biden’s COVID-19 supply coordinator. The administration will also direct the act to target masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Shortages of these products aren’t quite as dire as they were early on in the pandemic, but health care workers are still in need of more N95 masks, which protect the wearer in high-risk situations like when treating COVID-19 patients. Increasing production of masks could also improve protection for the general public. Most Americans are still wearing cloth masks. Those types of masks can help blunt the spread of the virus, but they aren’t as effective as surgical or N95s. Other countries are making medical-grade masksmandatory. As the more contagious coronavirus strain starts to spread in the US, experts worry cloth masks won’t offer enough protection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websitestill saysmembers of the general public should not buy surgical masks or N95s to conserve supply for health care workers. “Hopefully this gets utilized to bring better personal protection to the general public,”tweetedAbraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School working on the COVID-19 response, in response to news about the DPA. Nurses and doctors have been calling for the White House to invoke the DPA to improve the supply of masks since early on in the pandemic. The American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Nurses Association wrote to former President Donald Trump in Marchasking for him to use the act. The nursesasked againin September after surveys found continued shortages. Trump invoked the DPA a handful of times while in office, but experts and industry leaders say he didn’t use it to a degree sufficient enough to make a dent in the supply needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Trump administration’s use of the DPA has been sporadic, vindictive and too late,” Scott Paul, president of the industry group the Alliance for American Manufacturing,toldthis fall. “They have not wielded the tool very effectively.”",3,Reliable,0.1195045045045045,0.3308558558558558,604,3,The Verge

Republicans have been trying to blame impeachment for the federal government’s slow response to the coronavirus, but Trump just contradicted them. Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed thespreading Republican excusethat impeachment led to a slow andbotchedresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.“I don’t think I would have done any better had I not been impeached,” Trump said at his daily coronavirus news conference from the White House. “And I think that’s a great tribute to something — maybe it’s a tribute to me — but I don’t think I would’ve acted any differently, or I don’t think I would’ve acted any faster.”A handful of GOP lawmakers have blamed the impeachment proceedings for the Trump administration’s failure to take swift action as the coronavirus spread in the United States — an admission that the Trump administration was slow to respond in and of itself. As news of a potential outbreak surfaced in China last year, the administration ignored guidelines from a National Security Councilplaybookcompiled in 2016 by former President Barack Obama’s administration, which laid out steps Trump could have taken to stop a pandemic in its tracks, including ensuring proper diagnostic capability, stockpiling personal protective equipment and other critical tools, and delivering a “unified message” from the beginning. Following a slow initial response, the Trump administration has facedcriticismover theshortage of testing kits, thelack of personal protective equipmentfor front-line medical workers, andmixed messagesfrom Trump, includinghow seriouslyto take the virus. As that criticism grew, GOP lawmakers unveiled a new strategy to divert attention from Trump’s shortcomings. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner was one of the first Republicans toblame impeachmentfor the slow response, saying on March 23: “I had said, ‘We have to have a hearing. This sounds very serious. We have to have a hearing. We have to have a briefing.’ And guess what was going on in the middle of all this? Impeachment was going on.”Sen. John Cornyn of Texas alsosaidimpeachment slowed Trump’s response,tweetingon March 24 that Trump “did lose ‘precious weeks’ forced to defend himself against bogus impeachment charges.”Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pinned the bungled response on impeachment,tellingright-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday that impeachment “diverted the attention of the government because everything, every day was all about impeachment.”But as soon as that message appeared to solidify among the GOP rank and file, Trump knocked it down.“Did it divert my attention? I think I’m getting A-plusses for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment,” Trump said Tuesday. More than 16,000 babies were born in Texas in 2022 than in 2021, a new study from the University of Houston shows. A bipartisan package of bills in Michigan signed by Gov.

16,"In Dramatic Policy Shift, Biden Withdraws U.S. Support for Saudi “Offensive Operations” in Yemen",-7.0,47.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/02/04/biden-saudi-yemen-arms/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,25,"In his firstmajor foreign policy address, President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that he would end American support for Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led “offensive operations” in Yemen, echoing apromisehe made on the campaign trail in 2019. Speaking at the State Department, Biden told diplomats that he would prioritize diplomatic solutions to the conflict and appointed, as a special envoy, one of the department’s top Middle East experts. He also announced support for a cease-fire and an effort to restart long-stalled peace talks.“This war has to end,” Biden said. “And to underscore our commitment, we are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.”The move signaled a dramatic shift in U. S. support for Saudi Arabia, a move that has long been urged by progressive activists. Under President Donald Trump, Congresspassedresolutions blocking certain arms sales and directing the U. S. to end its role in the hostilities, but Trumpvetoedthem. One of the primary backers of the vetoed resolutions, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told The Intercept by phone that Biden’s announcement was a victory. “This is now a decisive step and really what the war powers resolution was calling for, so I’m very pleased,” Khanna said. Asked if Congress’s job was done, Khanna said he thought the legislature still had a role to play in supporting diplomatic efforts and reversing last-minutepolicy changesby the Trump administration. The Biden administration had previously placed a temporary freeze on billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as saying that it would review the transfer of advanced military hardware, including air-ground munitions, that the Trump administration sought to advance over the objections of Congress. Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched their intervention in Yemen in March 2015, after an Iranian-backed rebel group known as the Houthis took over the capital and forced out Yemen’s internationally backed president. The U. S. has supported the intervention, first under President Barack Obama and then under Trump, with weapons sales, intelligence, and logistical support, even after Saudi airstrikes increasingly targeted civilian sites like hospitals and schools. The Biden administration has not yet announced operational details of the move or clarified what they meant by “offensive operations.” In his address, Biden said that the U. S. would continue to help defend Saudi Arabia from drone and missile attacks, some of which have come from Yemen and have led the Saudis to claim that they are pursuing the war in self-defense. An administration official declined to share operational details of what the cutoff meant but pointed to the fact that the Biden administration had previously announced they were “reviewing several arms sales to ensure they are in line with our strategic goals, including ending the war.”Briefing reporters on Thursday morning, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the prohibition would extend “to the types of offensive operations that have perpetuated a civil war in Yemen that has led to a humanitarian crisis,” but would not result in the U. S. halting its own operations against Al Qaeda in the country. Kate Kizer — policy director with the progressive group Win Without War, which has lobbied to end U. S. support for the intervention — told The Intercept by phone that understanding the details of the distinction are important because the Saudis have frequently claimed that they were acting defensively.“The coalition has tried repeatedly in the past to say that airstrikes in residential areas in Yemen have been ‘defensive’ operations because they were responding to a ballistic missile strike,” Kizer said. “So it’s really important to define what that means.”Biden’s call is a hard won-victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, much of which had urged Obama and Trump to end U. S. support for the war. Khanna, along with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had repeatedly introduced various measures to stop U. S. support for the war, all of which initially failed in Congress. Khanna told The Intercept that a turning point on Capitol Hill was the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a U. S.-based Saudi dissident who was brutally killed by Saudi agents, likelyon the ordersof Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — who is also a key architect behind the Yemen war.“When we started, there was such a strong U. S. relationship with the Saudis that it was very hard to break through,” Khanna said. “And it took a lot of work in the House; we were taking on our own leadership in the beginning. But then after Khashoggi’s murder,things changed.”Kizer told The Intercept that building support for ending the war has been a long process among progressive activists, and that it was important to move the discussion beyond a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “I think what really has been the gamechanger over the years is building a public education campaign that really changed the terms of the debate about what’s happening in Yemen,” Kizer said. “When we started in 2015, it was totally framed through the lens of Iran, and the détente with Saudi Arabia and the Iran nuclear deal. Very little was said about Yemen.”",3,Reliable,0.0958023313492063,0.4287574404761904,1144,3,The Intercept
17,"If Democrats Can, Should They Pack US Supreme Court?",-1.0,44.33,https://www.voanews.com/usa/all-about-america/if-democrats-can-should-they-pack-us-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-20,24,"As Republicans rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump’s pick to replace the late-Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U. S. Supreme Court before Election Day, some liberal Democrats are floating the idea of adding more seats to the court — beyond the current nine. The number of justices has changed over time, from six to as many as 10, but the number has remained steady at nine since 1869. In the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to pack the court to preserve his New Deal legislation, which kept getting struck down by the high court. He failed. If Democrats capture the White House and Senate, while retaining majority control of the House of Representatives, there is no constitutional impediment to following through on the idea.“There's nothing in the Constitution that says that the Supreme Court has to have one or two or five or 10 members,” says Calvin Schermerhorn, professor of history at Arizona State University. “It’s silent on how many members there are on the Supreme Court. It only says that there shall be a chief justice, and Congress will have the power to shape the court and configure them in the best interest of justice.”Democrats would have to change filibuster rules in the Senate to lower the threshold for passing legislation from 60 votes to a simple majority of the 100-member chamber to change the number of justices on the high court. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has declined to say whether he would support an expansion of the Supreme Court if he wins election and the Democrats take back control of the Senate, but has promised to reveal his position before Election Day. Expanding the court for political reasons could damage the integrity of the Supreme Court, says Nicole Huberfeld, professor of law at Boston University.“People worry already about whether the Supreme Court is a political actor, rather than apolitical. I do think that adding justices so that one president can appoint a whole bunch of justices could affect the institutional integrity, or at least the perception of institutional integrity,” she says.“The authority of the court largely comes from respecting the decisions of the justices, and the court of itself doesn't actually have any way to ensure that its decisions are implemented,” Huberfeld adds. “If people stop thinking that's the law of the land, then the court has an institutional integrity problem.”Most Americans trust the U. S. Supreme Court to act in the best interests of the nation, according topublic surveys, but an increasing number of people do worry justices are becoming too mixed up with politics. Although a politicized Supreme Court might be alarming to some today, the scenario would be familiar to the nation’s Founding Fathers, because the court was viewed as an extension of party politics in the 19th century.“The first generation of American leaders, by the so-called founders, used the courts as a creature of the legislature. And so, the federal judiciary, especially, was supposed to be subordinate to the will of democratically elected representatives,” Schermerhorn says. The Republican effort to fast-track Barrett’s confirmation is particularly galling to Democrats still steaming because Republicans successfully blocked the 2016 confirmation of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, early in an election year. Now, the Republicans are rushing to confirm Barrett just days before another presidential election, which would create a solid 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. But again, Schermerhorn says, none of that would have fazed the nation’s founders.“They would have understood this is as partisan combat and not as a matter of constitutional principle,” he says. “There would have been no hesitation for the party in power in doing exactly what Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has done in his tenure as leader of the Republican-controlled Senate. That's not to say that this is a model that ought to be followed, that just because the founders thought or did something means that it’s worthy of emulation.”Huberfeld says it is important to remember that there is more to the high court’s work than the few cases that draw the most attention and controversy, such as those dealing with health care, abortion or LGBTQ rights..“The way that the court decides cases is much more than the handful of cases that people tend to talk about in political conversation. There are many cases the court hears that are just basic statutory interpretation. There are many cases the court hears that are criminal procedure cases,” she says. “Typically, at least in the modern era, once people are appointed, they tend to take that appointment quite seriously and to sort of put politics behind them.”She points out that justices don’t always rule as expected. For example, conservative Scalia’s interpretation of the Constitution led him to be protective of the rights of criminal defendants. While Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion that gay and transgender workers are protected by the Civil Rights Act.“So, I think the question before the court isn't always a matter of this political ideology that people ascribe to the justices. It's much more a matter of what the question is before the court and how the judges interpret it,” Huberfeld says.",3,Reliable,0.1500015632515632,0.4165135882635882,1098,3,Voice of America
18,Loeffler’s Husband Entangled in Secret Gov’t Surveillance Operation,-9.33,40.0,https://www.thedailybeast.com/loefflers-husband-jeffrey-sprecher-entangled-in-usmarshals-service-domestic-surveillance-operation,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-beast-bias-reliability/,2021-01-05,25,"The feds are renting an airport hangar from him for planes linked to a U. S. Marshals Service domestic spying program. Senior ResearcherSen. Kelly Loeffler’s husband is renting out an airport hangar to the U. S. Marshals Service for what appears to be a domestic surveillance operation—at a very nice profit—in a deal shrouded in secrecy. That operation, anationwide cell phone monitoring campaignfirst reported byin 2014,provoked an outcryfrom Loeffler’s colleagues from Oregon last year afterlocal media discoveredthat a Marshals Service plane had circled for hours over an anti-racist protest in Portland on June 13. Three days later,flight records showthat exact plane touched down at Fulton County Airport in Atlanta, Georgia—where the Marshals Service leases space from Fulton County Hangar Services, part of the vast business empire run by Loeffler’s husband, Jeffrey Sprecher. The federal government renewed its rental relationship with the company the same month. The hangar at 4165 South Airport Rd. Northwest, which Loeffler identified as one of her husband’s holdings in her firstfinancial disclosureafter her appointment to the Senate last year, sits along a scarred service route at the Fulton County Airport, off the main artery of Martin Luther King Drive. The General Services Administration, which rents space on behalf of other federal agencies, confirmed to The Daily Beast that it has paid Fulton County Hangar Services almost $250,000 a year for the location since 2014 when Loeffler was still an executive at her husband’s company, Intercontinental Exchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. The GSA added that it extended the lease for another three years last summer. But the details of the arrangement are enveloped in layers of government and corporate opacity. Fulton County Hangar Services is a registeredfederal contractor, but its contracts are not available to view in any public database. TheSystem for Award Management, a government search engine for tracking the federal government’s business dealings, classifies the information on the company as “restricted.” When pressed by The Daily Beast, the GSA declined to answer what agencies are stationed at the hangar and for what purpose, citing the “mission sensitivities of the federal tenants at this facility.”The Federal Aviation Administration operated out of the hangar until November 2019 but told The Daily Beast that it is now a U. S. Marshals installation. The Marshals Service refused to answer questions about its presence and activities at the hangar, and neither Loeffler, Sprecher, Intercontinental Exchange, nor Fulton County—which owns Fulton County Airport and leases hangars there to private tenants—responded to repeated requests for comment. Public records yield a few clues. The Daily Beast found that several small Cessna aircraft registeredeither to the MarshalsService or toEarly Detection Alarm Services, acompany Buzzfeed exposed in 2017as a front for the law enforcement agency’s aerial cell phone surveillance activities, have flown into or out of Fulton County Airport. One such craft is the Cessna Caravan thenewspaper spotted in the skies over unrest-rocked Portland last June, and which riled Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, along with several other congressional Democrats from Oregon. The tracking website FlightRadar24.com identified at least eight flights that this plane, with the tail number N1789M, made to or from the municipal airfield in 2020. On three occasions, FlightRadar24.com shows the propeller-powered Cessna making prolonged loops around Atlanta or other portions of Georgia similar to those observed on the West Coast, though The Daily Beast could not correlate these trips with specific events on the ground. Finally, Fulton County remits asmall tax billeach year for personal property at the Marshals-occupied hangar to L3Harris Technologies. One of the federal government’s largest contractors, L3Harris famously manufacturesthe Stingrayfor theMarshals Service and other government agencies. The Stingray collects information by imitating a cell phone tower and fooling mobile devices into revealing their whereabouts and other sensitive data, which law enforcement officials can use to track their owners. L3Harris did not answer repeated questions about their receipt of the tax bill, or about their assets at or access to 4165 South Airport Road Northwest. The contract between the federal government and Fulton County Hangar Services preceded Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s appointment of Loeffler to the Senate seat by roughly six years, and there is no evidence she played any role in its original negotiation or in its renewal last year. The Daily Beast found records of aircraft belonging to Early Detection Alarm Systems flying into Fulton County Airportas far back as 2009—when the GSA says it was renting the same hangar from a North Carolina-based real estate company—andFAA directoriesdate that agency’s presence at the site to 1990. However, Fulton County Hangar Services is registered with the federal government in Loeffler's husband’s name and with his personal contact information, and at the address of thelavish home they sharein Atlanta. The Daily Beast also could not find any record of a financial arrangement directly between Fulton County itself, which appears to own the hangar along with the rest of the airport, and Fulton County Hangar Services, even though documents of the previous arrangement with the North Carolina real estate firm are accessible on its website. Rather, onlinerecords show a leasebetween the county and an Intercontinental Exchange affiliate called ICE 4165 LLC for one-and-a-half acres of land at the airport from 2016, two years after the contract between GSA and Fulton County Hangar Services began. The ground lease from the county grants ICE 4165 use of the space for 20 years with two automatic five-year renewals, at an annual rent of $20,597.16, plus a 3 percent increase every half-decade. This is approximately 1/12th of what the GSA pays annually to Fulton County Hangar Services for the use of 4165 South Airport Northwest. The lease shows no history of a bidding process, but cites the need to ensure “the continuation of rental revenue to the county.” The rate is, however, comparable to what the North Carolina company paid the county during the previous decade. Transparency experts marveled at the strangeness and inscrutability of the arrangements between Sprecher’s companies, Fulton County, and the federal government.“Weird and secretive, which is a bad mix!” remarked Scott Amey, general counsel to the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight. “It would be big news if they are involved in violating people’s privacy or civil rights and the senator is making money from those activities.”“I think that Loeffler and the U. S. Marshals Service should answer some questions about the lease and what is happening out of that space,” Amey added. Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, suggested the tangle of public-private relationships resembles the sort of “cover” the U. S. has used to conceal covert military and espionage operations. What makes this particular situation unusual, he asserted, is that the arm of the federal government involved is the Marshals Service.“This is a security measure employed mainly by intelligence agencies. It's not something one would immediately associate with the U. S. Marshals,” Aftergood said. “It may be that the primary use of the facility is to support clandestine surveillance operations, which could explain the extraordinary secrecy.”Senior ResearcherGot a tip?

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has included 41 of Iowa’s 99 counties in her state disaster declaration, according to the Associated Press. Several rivers in the region — including the Missouri and the Mississippi — have swelled to dangerous levels, flooding small towns and breaching more than a dozen levees. Three people have died as a result of the floodwaters and two men in Nebraska have been missing since Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Emergencies have been declared in 74 cities and 65 counties according to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, and water levels are expected to rise with more rain expected and snow continuing to melt. According to the National Weather Service, 9 million people across 14 states are still under flood warnings. Vice President Mike Pence is traveling to the Midwest Tuesday to survey the damage in Omaha, Nebraska, where hundreds of homes have been damaged and tens of thousands of acres covered in water, according to the Associated Press. Devastation has been particularly concentrated in eastern Nebraska. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency described the flooding as one of“the most devastating disasters in recent history.”Towns like Fremont have been completely surrounded by water, making relief and rescue efforts particularly challenging. Pilots have been flying supplies in to people who are stranded,according to local media. Video footage from an airplane show fields and roads in the area completely submerged. Roads and highways have also been severely damaged in areas surrounding the city of Omaha. The flooding has so far had an estimated cost of$550 million on the public sector in Nebraskaand $90 million on private infrastructure.

(NewsNation Now) — The coronavirus pandemic led leaders from many companies to announce employees will continue to work from home this year. Thanks to technology, many people can work almost anywhere, and now city leaders in Tulsa, Oklahoma, are trying to capitalize on that trend. City leaders are offering people $10,000 to relocate to Tulsa. Nestled between the Osage Hills and the Ozark Mountains, about 100 miles northeast of Oklahoma City, lies Tulsa. It’s the state’s second-largest city, and it bears a storied past, from its Native American settling and the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 to the drilling boom that made it the “oil capital of the world.” It’s a utopia for those torn between wanting big-city splendors and the charms of small-town life. “We’ve got a top 10 opera in the nation, we’ve got a beautiful ballet, we’ve got museums,” said Grant Bumgarner, Tulsa Remote’s community manager. “We’ve got incredible amenities; the only difference is they’re cheaper and easier to get to, and there’s a stronger community built around them. In the language of the Creek Tribe, Tulsa means “old town,” and in an effort to bring new life, diversity, and perspective to the energy-sector city, Tulsa visionaries created Tulsa Remote. “We basically pay people $10,000 to do the job they’re already doing, just from Tulsa, for one year,” Bumgarner explained. That’s right, Tulsa Remote will pay people $10,000 to move to the city and continue to work remotely. The program quickly became appealing to candidates like Obum Ukabam and Bobby Reyes.“It did seem too good to be true, and one day when I was going to work on the bus, it was like six o’clock, I was like, why not. So, I filled out the application, did everything, and sent it off,” said Reyes. “It was destiny, I was destined to find it—because I found it on a Facebook post that I could have just missed,” said Obum. Both men got accepted. Ukabam moved from California two years ago; he’s one of the original Tulsa Remote members. He worked his remote gig for about a year before landing a job at Tulsa’s Holberton School for aspiring software engineers who dream of making it big in Silicon Valley. “I remember looking over at my wife, and I said, ‘This city looks pretty cool, this program looks pretty cool; if I get in would you consider uprooting our lives and moving to Oklahoma? Is that okay?’ and she was like ‘yeah,’” said Ukabam. Reyes is a new member and software designer. He and his partner moved in November, uprooting a comfortable life in Chicago to take a chance on Tulsa. He says he’s been pleasantly surprised by the city’s people, opportunities, and Tulsa’s food scene. “Except for like deep dish (pizza), that’s a really big thing for me. I had to deliver Lou Malnati’s here, so for pizza Friday that’s like what we do,” Reyes said. Reyes and Ukabam are two of more than 400 Tulsa remotes. Bumgarner helps choose applicants; he says the program has exploded. “We were surprised, we thought maybe the first year we’d bring in 20-25 people. We ended up bringing in 70 people out of 10,000 applicants the first year, and the second year we brought in over 350 individuals from those 25,000 applications,” Bumgarner said. In its third year, Tulsa Remote now has a lower acceptance rate than any college in the country, with less than 2% of applicants getting accepted. “We have people from bankers to software engineers to opera singers from Japan,” Bumgarner said. Although there have been restrictions due to the COVID1-19 pandemic, Ukabam and Reyes are finding new and individual ways of getting involved and expanding Tulsa’s horizons. In return, they’re taking advantage of all that’s at their fingertips. “The things that you would think you would miss in other cities are here, that’s the misconception. We went to concerts, sports engagements, ballet, things we didn’t even get to do in California because of the cost of living,” Ukabam said. Both are now planting new roots in Oklahoma soil.

When homicides spiked in the second half of 2020, President Donald Trump wielded it as a campaign issue, saying Republicans would restore order to crime-ridden Democratic-led cities. He lost his race, but the GOP attacks continue. In a recent tweet, the Republican National Committee blamed rising crime on Democrats.""Crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies,"" Republicanstweeted June 29. Crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies. We asked the RNC for the data behind the claims in the tweet. Their response included nothing on the link to police defunding. On the open border part, they pointed to news coverage about an increase infentanyl seizuresat the border,high-speed chasesin South Texas, and FBI directorChristopher Wraytalking about an epidemic of drug smuggling and other illegal activity at the border. The RNC tweet is rife with inaccuracies. But its biggest flaw is the unfounded assertion that crime rate trends were a ""direct result"" of Democratic policies. Homicides increased in 2020. It’s possible that the toll could have topped 19,000 last year. But the RNC tweet is not narrowly about rising homicides. It encompasses several other claims that are flawed:Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah noted that when murders began to increase rapidly in mid-2020, immigration was stable or declining.""And, obviously, Democrats did not control immigration policy in May 2020,"" Cassell said. ""So any linkage between the 2020 homicide increase and immigration policies seems quite dubious.""Some Democratic-led cities did cut police budgets last year, but not many. Among the50 largest cities, police spending as a percentage of general expenditures went up an average of 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021. The RNC tweet speaks of crime broadly, but it’s homicides in particular that have caused alarm since a sharp rise in the summer of 2020. That coincided with the anti-police-violence protests that spread across the country in June following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The calls to defund the police gained prominence the same month. One problem in talking about crime at this moment is that no one yet has a national picture of crime for 2020, let alone the first half of 2021. The FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report is the most comprehensive data set, and the FBI hasn’t published the 2020 edition yet. Other data sets lack the scope of the FBI’s full assessment, but they all point in the same direction: Homicides are up. Apreliminary FBI crime report for 154 cities says murders rose 10% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. TheMajor Cities Chiefs Associationfound a 29% rise in homicides for 63 cities in the first quarter of 2021. And the latest report fromCouncil on Criminal Justice, an independent source of crime data, looked at 24 cities and found homicides rose by 24% in the first quarter. The topline numbers don’t tell the whole story, however. For example, in the first-quarter FBI release on 154 cities, the increase in homicides was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same. As for violent crime generally — including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault — the number remained just about the same across the full group of cities, undercutting the RNC’s broad-brush claim about escalating crime. The Council on Criminal Justice’s data on weekly police reports found that homicide rates generally fell after October 2020 — from a bit over 5 deaths per 100,000 to about 3 per 100,000 by March 2021. That could reflect seasonal changes; homicides tend to fall in the cooler months. But the report’s authors say other unknown factors could be at work. The RNC’s claim that rising crime was a ""direct result"" of Democratic policies lacks evidence, and experts say it ignores some of the major events of 2020 that also likely had an effect on crime.""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,"" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. ""Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.""Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the economic downturn also mattered.""Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,"" Ahlin said. ""Last year we saw both at play.""On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the death of George Floyd. Cassell at the University of Utah said that played a role, because it made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.""Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressive steps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,"" Cassell said. Cassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect. Regardless, Cassell called the GOP link between crime and a defund policy ""dubious.""Even the pandemic and the protests might not fully explain the trend in homicides. As the Council on Criminal Justice report noted, the ""homicide increase actually began in 2019, prior to the pandemic and well before protests against police violence spread across the country.""Looking at the first three months of 2020, murders rose 20% from a year earlier. The pandemic shutdown didn’t take place until mid-March, and the protests didn’t begin until late May. The Republican National Committee tweeted that ""crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.""It’s not true that crime is rising to a level we haven’t seen in decades. Homicides are up, but there’s no evidence that the trend is tied to a police defunding policy or Democrats’ border policies, let alone that it’s a ""direct result.""Experts say many other factors may have played a role, including racial-justice protests and disruptions caused by the pandemic.

A reportcommissioned by Lego surveyed nearly 7,000 parents and children in China, the Czech Republic, Japan, Poland, Russia, the U. K. and the U. S. and found the “need for society to rebuild perceptions, actions and words to support the creative empowerment of all children.”The research found that71%of boys worried they would be made fun of if they played with a toy typically associated with the opposite gender, compared to only 42% of girls. While 76% of the parents surveyed said they would encourage their son to play with Legos, only 24% of parents would recommend it to a daughter. Lego stated it is committed to making more inclusive toys and ensuring that children’s creative ambitions are not restricted. The companyno longer labelsits products “for girls” or “for boys,” and its website does not allow searches by gender. The announcement, and the launch of Lego’s “Ready for Girls” campaign, was made on Monday to coincide with the United Nations’ International Day of The Girl. Despite disruptions to worldwide supply chains, Lego reported a 46% increase in first-half sales in 2021, strengthening its position as the world’s largest toymaker,according tothe.“Parents are more worried that their sons will be teased than their daughters for playing with toys associated with the other gender,”Madeline Di Nonno, chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, told the. “But it’s also that behaviors associated with men are valued more highly in society. Until societies recognize that behaviors and activities typically associated with women are as valuable or important, parents and children will be tentative to embrace them.”Several toymakers have recently made efforts to remove gender bias from their products. In February, Hasbro, the company that makes Potato Head,made the brand gender-neutralby dropping the “Mr.” from its name. Hasbro’s announcement came the same week the U. S.

25,Liz Cheney's heresy,-22.67,29.67,https://theweek.com/articles/981319/liz-cheneys-heresy,https://adfontesmedia.com/week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-07,24,"For years now, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has been one of the most influential Republicans in Washington. Scion of one of the most powerful families in conservative politics, she served in several positions in the Bush administration and was elected as the House representative from Wyoming in 2016 — the same seat her father held for many years. She then moved up to the third-ranking position in the House Republican caucus, and waswidely assumedto have a bright future. But now her political career is coming to an end. She faces aprimary challenge from the extreme right, and anupcoming votebacked by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to kick her out of her leadership position. She is expected to lose in both cases, but even if she doesn't, it's clear her upward trajectory in Republican politics is over. Completely unscrupulous will to power and toadying fealty to Donald Trump are now mandatory preconditions for participating in conservative politics. It's important to be clear up front that Cheney has had an exceptionally monstrous career thus far. Her domestic policy record is the usual Bush-era mix of social conservatism and total deference to the oligarch class, but her real passion is foreign policy. Just like her father, she is abloodthirsty imperialist warmonger. After working in support of the Bush administration's wars of aggression inside the administration, she founded a think tank to advocate for an invasion of Iran, and was constantly on conservative mediastoking frenzied bigotry against Muslims.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. In office she has advocated relentless violence — indeed, one of her few quarrels with Trump' foreign policy was that hewasn't belligerent enough, despite himhugely ramping up drone strikes(and attendant civilian casualties) and his illegalassassination of a top Iranian official. She has also been apassionate defender of torture. A toll of800,000-plus deadin America's bungling, pointless imperialist crusade in the Middle East is apparently not enough for her. AsJohn Nichols points outat The Nation, prior to January 6 Cheney was a bitter partisan, known for telling hysterical lies about Democrats; while campaigning for Trump in 2019, she said Democrats were ""the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party of socialism."" She is more responsible than most for inflaming right-wing extremism. That said, when Trump attempted to overthrow the government and install himself as president-for-life with a putsch, Cheney turned against him. Shevoted to impeach him afterwards, and continued attacking his lie that the election had been stolen. For a brief time after the putsch — when, let us remember, numerous GOPmembers of CongressandVice President Pencewere nearly lynched by the mob — that was an acceptable opinion for a Republican to have. It is no longer. Trump hasreasserted complete controlover the Republican Party, demanding (and receiving) slavish obedience to his will. In this he has the backing of the vast majority of the Republican base, some70 percent of whombelieve his lie that Biden stole the election. Cheney's stubborn refusal to submit to Trump is therefore heresy that must be stamped out. Now as her career goes down in flames, Cheney haswritten an op-edfor The Washington Post urging her fellow Republicans not to abandon democracy. ""Trump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work — confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this,"" she writes. ""The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution.""The effect of this argument on her fellow Republicans is a foregone conclusion. It will be angrily rejected — indeed, it likely increases the chances she will be purged from the party. One reason is that she is needed as a scapegoat to deflect from other Republicans' betrayal of Trump after the putsch. As she notes, McCarthy himself said on January 13: ""The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding."" What's more, McCarthy isreportedly worriedhe would be called to testify before theproposedJanuary 6 Commission about how he called Trump that day begging him to call off the mob. He would rather that episode be forgotten. Another reason is the character of Republican elites. They are ruthless in their quest for total power, but they can also be counted on to be utter cowards when it comes to confronting Trump or the right's other deranged media personalities. As oneRepublican official toldThe Washington Post in November after Trump refused to concede his loss, ""What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?"" (AskCapitol Police officer Mike Fanoneabout that.) Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, after briefly criticizing Trump for the putsch, has thereafter clammed up about the former president to the point of studiously pretending not to hear Trump's constant personal insults — herefused to commentThursday on a Trump statement calling him ""gutless and clueless.""There was a moment, probably lasting no more than a few hours after the putsch, when Trump critics might have rounded up enough Republican votes in the Senate to convict Trump and prevent him from holding federal office ever again. This might have even been a smart political move — Cheney is likely calculating that given Trump'sabysmal approval rating, the GOP would be better off ditching him and pretending his whole presidency never happened, as they did with Richard Nixon. But almost all the critics (including Democrats) chose todither and procrastinate, which allowed Republicans to dose themselves up with right-wing propaganda and get back on the low road. Conservative media has gradually pivoted fromdownplayingor denying the Capitol putsch tooutright defending it. The putschist strategy of winning at any cost, regardless of votes, has become theovert GOP plan for upcoming elections. As my colleagueJoel Mathis writes, ""The insurrectionists have taken over the Republican Party.""So the choice Cheney outlines in her article has already been made. Republicans have chosen Trump over the Constitution, which they are plotting to overturn to set up one-party rule. If he runs in 2024, he almost certainly will get the nomination. Previous conservative policy dogma no longer matters in the slightest. As the conservative Club for Growthpoints out, Cheney's probable successor, Elise Stefanik, has a much less orthodox voting record. But when it comes to licking Trump's wingtips, her record (like Trump's shoes)is spotless. Her political future, unlike Cheney's, is bright.",1,Questionable,0.0737484737484737,0.45136926565498,1556,2,The Week
26,"Under President Biden, Vatican-US Relations Are Poised to Shift Dramatically",0.0,48.0,https://www.ncregister.com/news/under-president-biden-vatican-us-relations-are-poised-to-shift-dramatically,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,16,"VATICAN CITY — When President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated today to become only the second Catholic to hold the highest office in the land, a new set of challenges will face the Holy See in its relations with the United States, ones likely to be greater and more complex than those of the past four years. On the surface, relations seem to be expected to run more smoothly: Pope Francis and senior Vatican officials hadimplicitly favoreda Biden victory in November over President Donald Trump with whom there were clear differences. Francis was one of the first leaders tocongratulatethe new president by phone, before Trump had conceded, and in December the Holy Fatheradopteda popular slogan also used by the Biden campaign to “build back better” — read as a further endorsement of the result. Some commentatorsaccusethe political left of being chiefly responsible for fomenting current divisions, yet Vatican officials close to the Pope principally see Biden as a unifier, someone who will “build bridges” in contrast to how they saw his predecessor. In an interview published soon after the election, Jesuit Father Antonio Spadaro, a close aide to Pope Francis andstrong criticof the U. S. conservative-religious right, said he believed Biden has the desire to “hold together” a “strongly polarized” U. S. society and that the diversity of his party will help to achieve “unity and reconciliation.”Biden has invited outgoing Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, among others, to achurch serviceon Wednesday just before the inauguration, although how much these gestures are precursors to concrete efforts to reach across the political aisle remains to be seen. Beyond the Vatican’s generally favorable perception of Biden, he is a proponent of a number of social policies that this pontificate also supports, the most significant being combating climate change, multilateralism, immigration reform, opposition to capital punishment, welfare for the poor, and a softer approach to China. Cardinal Peter Turkson, prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Development, told the Register Jan. 20 that he has found Biden “outstanding” on these issues, and believes he was possibly “inspired by the Church’s social thought.”Areas of AlignmentA number of these aligning positions, including a clear disdain for Trump’s populist politics, were plainly expressed in Pope Francis’ social encyclicalFratelli Tutti(“Brothers All”),published just a month before the Nov. 3 election and to which Biden favorablyreferredduring his campaign. One of the clearest positions concerns migrant policy. The administration reportedly plans tounveila sweeping immigration bill on the first day of office that would propose an eight-year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants — a policy closely aligning with the position of Pope Francis, who has often argued for looser immigration policies, including theregularizingof undocumented migrants as well as his frequent castigation of President Trump’s border wall. The Pope also called inFratelli Tuttifor “full citizenship” of migrants. Another policy the Pope and senior Vatican officials applaud is Biden’s environmental agenda (he hasappointeda member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences to be director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy), and in particular that he pledged on Day One of his administration torejointhe 2015 Paris climate accords (Father Spadaro called the pledge “important” as it would be “in line” with the Pope’s 2015 environmental encyclical,Laudato Si). In a further nod to multilateralism that the Vatican supports, he will have the U. S. rejoin the World Health Organization, which Trump said the U. S. would leave last July. The decisions to leave both were part of Trump’s aggressive approach to China, one which Biden opposed, preferring that the communist country be cajoled to “play by the rules” rather than having sanctions placed upon it. Again, such a line is congruent with the Vatican’s accommodating approach to the People’s Republic, an approach that, despite China’s persecution of Christians and its much-criticized human rights record, prefers controversially to engage the nation rather than isolate it. In Biden, the Holy See sees a more willing partner than Trump to support its agreements with Beijing, although new Secretary of State Antony Blinken has recentlyexpresseda willingness to maintain Trump’s approach to trade and human rights in China. Biden opposes the death penalty but only since June 2019, months after Pope Francis amended the catechism to declare capital punishment “inadmissible.” In 1994, then-Sen. Biden hadsponsoreda bill to expand the death penalty to cover 60 crimes. Now his position configures closely with that of Pope Francis, who said inFratelli Tutti“there can be no stepping back” from opposition to the death penalty and the wish to abolish it. Vatican officials are expected to also welcome the appointments of some perceived “moderates” in the administration, such as Jake Sullivan, a Catholic who will become national security adviser, and Secretary of State Blinken, who is Jewish and married to Evan Ryan, an Irish American Catholic, whom Biden has chosen to serve as White House cabinet secretary. Areas of DisagreementBut a number of areas are expected to pose significant challenges to Holy See-U. S. relations, particularly regarding life issues. From defunding Planned Parenthood and expanding theMexico City Policyto appointing pro-life justices on the Supreme Court and becoming the first sitting president to take part in the March for Life, Trump was regarded by many as the most pro-life president in U. S. history. By contrast, President-elect Biden, whose campaign was heavily backed by abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood, is viewed as the polar opposite and is expected torollbackseveral of the Trump administration’s policies in this area. In 2019, Biden suddenlyreversedhis support for the Hyde Amendment that bans federal funding for most abortion. He is also an unapologetic proponent of LGBT rights (in 2016 as vice president heofficiateda “wedding” for a same-sex couple who had worked as longtime White House staffers) and a supporter of gender ideology. On Tuesday it wasannouncedhe had tapped Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine, a biological man who identifies as a transgender woman to be his assistant secretary of health.“Despite the common ground between the Holy See and the Biden administration on issues like immigration, climate change, and relations with China, I am not hopeful about relations,” said Father John Wauck , a Rome-based priest who once wrote speeches for Democratic and Republican politicians. Recalling how USCCB president Archbishop Jose Gomeznotedlast November that Biden’s election placed the bishops’ in a very complicated position, Father Wauck told the Register that he believed “the same could be said for the Holy See.”He highlighted in particular the Pope’s public opposition to abortion, citing a recentinterviewin which he compared abortionists to hired assassins.“Now the president of the United States will be a baptized Catholic who not only works to ensure that the work of those assassins — the brutal killing of the most defenseless members of the human family — is legal, but also wants to force all Americans to help pay for those killings, both at home and abroad, with their taxes,” Father Wauck said. Father Wauck also noted that Francis, who hasdescribed“gay marriage” as a ploy of the devil to destroy God’s plan for the family, will now have to deal with the new U. S. Catholic president “who not only works in favor of that diabolical ploy, but, as vice president, actually performed a ‘marriage’ of two men.”He added that Biden potentially also threatens religious freedom,pledging, for example, to fight hard to roll back conscience protections for the Little Sisters of the Poor and other religious employers who object to providing contraceptives. Church leaders in Africa have alsoexpressedconcern about the appointment of Samantha Power, an ardent supporter of “LGBT” rights, as the new head of USAID, and believe it will lead to a cultural, ideological and Christian onslaught on the continent.“On issues such as these, the Biden administration will aggressively promote the world-wide ‘ideological colonization’ that Pope Francis has frequently criticized, and — in the international forum — that will inevitably put a strain on relations,” Father Wauck said. Biden’s CatholicismBut inside sources believe Biden’s Catholicism may temper these policies. The senator’s faith has been formed through suffering: the deaths of his wife and two of his children, his stuttering disability, and a wayward son. His political views on key non-negotiable issues clearly depart from the magisterium, and he separates his faith, which is evidently very personal to him, from his politics. The Churchteachesthat a politician who publicly supports legal protection for abortion and receives Holy Communion places his and other souls in danger, but his supporters insist Biden is unmistakably devout, reputedly attending daily Mass since he lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident in 1972, and wearing a wrist rosary that he prays regularly. He is particularly close to the Society of Jesus: Jesuit Father Leo O'Donovan, a former president of Georgetown University, will deliver the invocation at the inauguration (Biden wrote the foreword to Father O’Donovan’s 2018 book,Blessed Are the Refugees: Beatitudes of Immigrant Children) and prominent Jesuits were also publiclysupportiveof his campaign. This close alliance, together with his eventual choice to be his ambassador to the Holy See, is likely to influence his dealings with the Church’s first Jesuit pontiff and a Holy See where Jesuits take leading roles behind the scenes. Cardinal Turkson acknowledged the concern over Biden’s pro-abortion views, but said he could see Biden, on account of his Catholicism, “not wanting to engage” in pro-abortion politics and believes the Church “can work with him to probably find a middle way.” That means the Church “evangelizing the Democratic position,” he said, while at the same “recognizing what a lot of people are calling for.”He added that Biden's positions on abortion and other policies contrary to Church teaching are rooted in “not having done our work as a Church.” This has allowed “certain tendencies to become main features of our societies” and enabled a leader to emerge who represents them. He said, “This is the challenge we see happening.”",3,Reliable,0.076950857784191,0.4042124418791087,2292,2,National Catholic Register

29,Why a $15 Federal Minimum Wage Would Be a Terrible Policy,13.33,29.33,https://thelibertyloft.com/why-a-15-federal-minimum-wage-would-be-a-terrible-policy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-loft-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,15,"Charlotte, NC — Thetwo-thirdsof Americans who support a minimum wage hike to $15 per hour now have anallyin the White House. And, President Joe Biden is already acting on his support by trying toincludea $15 per hour minimum wage in his COVID-19 relief plan. This action would mark the first federal minimum wage increase since2009. While this is bound to be celebrated without a second guess by many, it is now more important than ever to carefully examine the minimum wage as policy, not merely as rhetoric. This must be an examination of its underlying economic theory, its consonance with American principles of self-ownership, and its empirical success (or lack thereof). Then, these ideas should be applied to the present circumstances the U. S. finds itself in to help find the correct policy. In discussing wages, we are truly discussing prices—as a wage is nothing more than the price of labor. At the heart of a market economy is the price system, which uses supply and demand to determine prices. Because we live in a world characterized by scarcity, being able to efficiently allocate resources is paramount. However, some advocate interventions in the market to artificially adjust prices. Minimum wagelaws would be considered one of these interventions in the price system. The two main ways governments can distort prices are throughandprice ceilings. The former mandates that prices must not go below a certain level, and the latter mandates that prices must not go above a certain level. Minimum wage laws are a floor on the price of labor. While it may seem desirable to ensure that low-skilled workers get paid “fairly” or that businesses cannot “price-gouge,” these interventions do not come without consequences. By setting prices artificially low through price ceilings, shortages are created, because quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied at that price. Conversely, setting prices artificially high through price floors result in surpluses because quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded at that price. In the case of minimum wage laws, two things happen. First, the quantity of labor supplied by workers increases due to the higher wage. Second, the quantity of labor demanded decreases due to the costs of higher wages. In consequence, this creates unemployment. Minimum wage laws also price those with low skills, and thus low productivity, out of the market. By making it illegal to pay workers below the prevailing wage, it relegates workers without adequate skills to unemployment. After all, no rational business owner would pay a worker who generates $5.00 per hour of economic value a wage of $15 an hour. They’d pay him nothing at all and not hire him. At its most fundamental juncture, the promise of government to protect life, liberty, and property is truly a promise of self-ownership. Economist and professor Walter E. Williamsdescribesthis, writing “I am my private property, and you are yours.” Williams goes on to explain that by starting from a premise of self-ownership, it becomes quite easy to determine policy. If a policy violates an individual’s right to self-ownership, it is immoral and should not be instituted. Minimum wage laws are an explicit violation of one’s right to self-ownership and free association. The job of the government is to secure our pre-existing rights, not violate them. If party A agrees with party B on a contract—and this contract does not negatively affect anybody else—there is little reason for the government to intervene. Moreover, it is an act of tremendous arrogance on the part of the government, which is a third party in the transaction between partyand partyB, to suggest that it knows more about the best interests of the parties involved in the agreement than the parties involved in the agreement. In reality, the best people to make decisions about consensual agreements are those in the agreements, as they actually have a stake in its success. While the case against minimum wage laws based in economic theory may be well-founded, advocates of increasing the minimum wage argue that this is an issue not only of economics, but of humanity. However, theempirical evidenceunambiguously suggests that basing our policy on economics—not what sounds good on the surface level—is the best way to ensure the fullest humanity of our fellow-citizens. Areview of the history of minimum wage lawswill reveal the fundamental flaw with such policies: they create unemployment among those with low skills. The most obvious example of low-skilled workers are teenagers. In January of 1948, theunemployment rateamong those aged 16-19 was 8.5%. This was nothing extraordinary, as low unemployment rates among teenagers were common at that time. However, this was also around the time when the government started to institute harsh wage regulation. After minimum wage increases in both1950 and 1956, the 8.5% teenage unemployment rate of 1948 could only be dreamt of. Since September of 1956, the teenage unemployment rate hasagain dropped below 10%. Even during the years of record economic growth in the 1980s, teenage unemployment wasregularlyabove 17%. The adverse effects of the minimum wage impact different communities to different extents. Low-income minorities, for example, are disproportionately harmed by minimum wage laws. In 1948, the black teenage unemployment rate was actuallythan that of their white counterparts. However, in the subsequent seven decades, the unemployment rate among white and black people has sharply diverged. While teenage unemployment rose—and remained high—among both black and white people, it has been consistently higher among black teens for some time. While initially instituting a minimum wage did tremendous harm, that harm has been exacerbated in cities across the country which have increased their minimum wage. In 2016, the minimum wage in Seattle, Washington became $13 per hour. Subsequentstudies by the University of Washingtonhave demonstrated its negative effects. While low-wage workers saw a 3% increase in hourly wages, it corresponded with a 9% decrease in hours worked. This meant that there was “a reduction of over $100 million per year in total payroll for low-wage jobs.” This came out to a loss of about $125 per job per month. Moreover, there was also a “significant reduction in the rate of new entries into the workforce.” What this means is that while there was a modest pay increase, it was offset by reduced hours. It also prevented new workers from entering the workforce. In considering the perverse consequences to low-skilled teenagers who are simply trying to grasp onto the first rung of the economic ladder, it should be concluded that minimum wage laws act as barriers to progress. Rather than providing an opportunity for teenagers to begin their development, minimum wage laws break off the bottom rungs of the ladder, making it impossible to climb. Some suggestthat in a time of economic downturn—as we are currently in—it is in the best interest of both individual workers and the economy as a whole to increase the minimum wage. They argue that because the downturn is a consequence of decreased demand, putting more money in the pockets of those who are likely to spend it is an easy way to stimulate the economy. This, however, is a specious argument. The COVID-19 pandemic has alreadyeliminated over 100,000 businessesand, with them, livelihoods. For the businesses which have been lucky enough to weather the storm up to this point, profits are razor-thin. The question must become what a minimum wage hike would do to the hundreds of thousands of businesses which are on the edge of going defunct forever. Common sense tells us that it would suck that last bit of air out of innumerable businesses. If those in power truly cared about the workers, then they would be instituting policies which grant them the freedom to work. As a result, minimum wage policy during an economic downturn should be the same as when there is no downturn. Even as more and more Americans embrace a $15 minimum wage, it will be important to stay grounded in economic realities andempirical data. No amount of rhetoric, virtue signaling, or false claims about the nature of prices can change those things. Our best hope to get out of this pandemic still standing, and then achieve prosperity in its aftermath, is to allow people to work and earn a living. Making it illegal for those without adequate skills to work at a wage which matches their productivity is bad policy, as is continuing to make it illegal for hard working business owners to make a living as a result of the pandemic. There are real concerns regarding public health, but the evidenceconsistently showsthat most people who become infected with COVID did not contract it at restaurants, but rather in theirown homes. The same people who advocate minimum wage laws and restaurant closures also endlessly bemoan “inequality.” What they fail to realize is that it is their policies which are creating the wider inequality they lament. In the end, we should be championing people’s ability to work, to make a living, and to live free from excessive government interference. Jack Elbaum is a freshman at George Washington University.

30,Where Can Vaccinated Americans Travel Right Now?,-3.67,41.33,https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgv7k/where-can-americans-travel-right-now,https://adfontesmedia.com/vice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-14,21,"It’s happening. Travel! Glorious, but cautious, travel. Brain breaks depend on it. Economies depend on it. It used to be so normal, yet stepping back into it feels exciting, weird, scary, and so very healing if done with care. ICYMI, some countries around the world are opening up again. It’s a lot of info to digest, so have a sit on the oldBritney Spears blow-up chair(a safe space, if ever there was one), and let’s talk about what all these announcements mean for your summer travels and beyond—from what countries are opening up and what guidelines are in place, to what post-lockdown travel will actually look like when you show up with yourStone Island backpack. The good news for those of us stateside is thatthe United States is one of the leading countries in vaccinations. As of mid-May 2021, more than 58 percent of US adults have received at least one shot, according to the most recent numbers from the. But in many countries, far fewer citizens have had access to the vax, andas the CDC states, “even fully vaccinated travelers are at increased risk for getting and possibly spreading new COVID-19 variants,” sodotake the safety precautions of your destination seriously, and don’t board that plane, train, or zeppelin for domestic or international travel until you are fully vaccinated. Peep those CDC notes, and know thatreentry to the US requires a negative COVID testno more than three days before departure. Then, after doing the homework, you can give yourself the thumbs up to surprise mom with a fresh ticket for that formerly “pandemic-postponed” trip to Iceland, where theynow really want vaccinated touriststo show up and spend some money. Again, while it may belegal to travel to many countries that are still dealing with a crisis situation—do not go there (no!!!) unless you have a crazy family emergency or other ridiculously important reason to do so. The following are spots that are saying it's now totally cool for vaccinated American tourists to show up just to hang out and vacay; we'll give you the rules and even a couple of ideas of where you might wanna stay. Fellow responsible people, let’s gooo. This Caribbean country is made up of one main island, offshore islets, and has one of the best-named beach stretches. Can you imagine saying, “Meet me atRendezvous Bay?” Fully vaccinated Americans can apply for entryhere. Whether you’re vaccinated or not, as part of the Bahamas Travel Health Visa application,it was announced that“travelers will be required to opt-in to COVID-19 health insurance that covers them for the duration of their stay.” The cost of the insurance is included in the Bahamas Travel Health Visa application fee. Fully vaccinated Americans can bypass the country’s testing requirements, but still have to apply for a Travel Health Visa and provide proof of vaccination upon entry (with at least two weeks time after their final dose.)The Barbados Ministry of Tourismannounced that, as of May 8, vaccinated tourists with a negative COVID test taken no more than three days before arrival can visit, and will be subject to take a PCR test upon arrival during a five-day window. After that, your quarantine time ends. Read more in their official booklet(then start getting excited aboutOistin’s Friday Night Fish Fry; afavorite of Rihanna’s.)Can you imagine finishing your novel atthis oceanfront beach cabana? According to theBelize Tourism Board, everyone can travel to the country, but must: “Bring along an Official Vaccine Card reflecting the receipt of the dual or single-dose vaccine at least two weeks prior to arrival,” or a negative test taken within 96 hours of travel, or a “Rapid Antigen, Sofia, SD Biosensor, ABBOTT (Panbio) test taken no more than 48 hours prior to travel.” If you don’t do any of that, you can still take a test upon arrival. While tourists visiting Belize can go wherever, it is recommended that they remain within what’s being called the “Tourism Safe Corridor” (i.e. certified hotels and tourist attractions). Bermuda requires that all travelers, no matter their vaccination status, provide a negative COVID-19 test before traveling, take another test upon arrival, quarantine for about 24 hours or until they receive a negative result, and apply for a Bermuda Travel Authorization, according to the US Embassy inBermuda. Per the country’sgovernment website, masks are not required outdoors, and “immunized persons are not required to wear a mask when indoors with other immunized persons, except for in certain settings—e.g. spas, restaurants/bars (when not eating/drinking or standing at a bar), schools, shops, etc.”If you’re fully vaccinated, the British Virgin Islands’ government hasannouncedthat you can visit as soon as May 15 (we suggest stopping inAnegada). You’re still required to provide a negative PCR test within five days of travel, as well as “provide satisfactory evidence of being fully vaccinated, and will be subject to a PCR test upon arrival (day zero).”U. S. citizens are allowed to enter this southeastern European country, provided they show proof of vaccination and it has been at least 14 days since their final dose, according to the US Embassy in Bulgaria. Enjoy Ancient Roman history, but already done the Eternal City/had youradventure? Welcome to Croatia. Land of gladiator amphitheaters, Windex-blue waterfalls, cuttlefish risotto,Game of Thrones, and an underwater winery (yes, lil wino,it is exactly what it sounds like). Croatia’s Ministry of the Interiorhas stated that you will be able to travel to the country without the need to self-isolate or get tested upon arrival (although you will still have to show proof of a paid accommodation). While Croatia is generally an extremely safe and friendly country, it's important to note that there has been a recent rash of homophobic crime in some areas, including Zagreb. While the likelihood of experiencing violence while traveling there is still relatively rare, it's wise to keep up on the news and exercise caution. (But that, of course, is true of traveling pretty much anywhere.) Two of the most popular tourist destinations areDubrovnik(a.k.a King's Landing fromGOT) andPula, for its Roman ruins and warm-water beaches. First-timers, consider staying in Split to seeDiocletian’s Palace. This quaint Airbnb is one gladiator’s spear away from the epic ruins:Photo: AirbnbIf writing the Great American Novel is on pause—for now—and you’re long overdue for a brain break, this cute two-person apartment in Split is the move for you. Plus, if you book the place but can’t travel due to COVID, they give you the option to use your reservation as a voucher within, the description reads. Or this nice terraced Airbnb, also in Split:Photo: AirbnbKopiaste! Welcome! The Cyprus tourism board hasannouncedthat fully vaxxed tourists can forgo the testing and quarantine requirements that would otherwise be needed to visit the Republic of Cyprus, an island in the east Mediterranean. You’ll still need to fill out theCyprus Flight Pass, though, at 24 hours before departure. Don’t forget thewater bootiesbefore exploring the beaches. Per the US Embassy in Denmark, “Fully vaccinated travelers from the United States are also exempt from testing and quarantine requirements upon arrival in Denmark,” provided they show the proper documentation and proof of vaccination. (PSA: This small, northern European country’s soccer team just lost to England in the UEFA semi final, so if you see a sad Dane, consider buying them a pint of Carlsberg.)Ah, Ecuador. It’s home to some of the most beautiful volcanic landscapes, rafting, and general outdoor bliss on earth. While vaccinated and unvaccinated tourists can visit, the US Embassy in Ecuadorannouncedthat there are still confirmed positive cases of COVID in all 24 provinces. If you must go to Ecuador, fully vaccinated travelers are exempt from providing a negative test (taken no more than three days) prior to arrival, and unvaccinated tourists must quarantine for 10 days. They’ve also said that “there are PCR and/or antigen tests available for U. S. citizens in Ecuador [...] with test results reliably available within 72 hours.”… Is lovely this time of year, and lucky for you, fully vaccinated Americans can visit the nation, provided they have written proof of vaccination and no more than six months can have passed since they were vaxxed. You’ll also need to show the proper documentation, which can be found on the country’stourism site. You’ve had a rough year. Time to galavant through the French countryside and hammer baguettes and local vin until you’re deported. “Fully vaccinated travelers coming from these countries can enter with proof of vaccination,” the US Embassy in Francestates. “France has not yet officially announced what acceptable proof of vaccination will be for travelers vaccinated in the United States, but a tweet from the French Consulate General in Washington said the CDC card would be acceptable.”Got vaxxed already? Congrats, you can go to Georgia. Fully vaccinated travelers from any country are allowed to enter, provided they present documentation confirming their COVID-19 vaccination status. Hot tip: The wine is good. Like, really good—this is where wine may have been invented, after all. Forunvaccinated travelers, a negative COVID-19 PCR test result conducted within 72 hours prior to travel must be submitted to cross the Georgian border. Three days later, while in Georgia, you’ll need to submit a second PCR test. (If you can't make it to Georgia, you can still buy its glorious wine online atTotal Wine,Drizly, orWine.com.)“Willkommen in Deutschland!” is what we imagine the Germans will say to vaccinated Americans when they arrive, but more likely they’ll say something along the lines of “provide either proof that you’re vaccinated, or show a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. (Vaccinated Americans can also skip the country’s usual quarantine requirements.)Vaccinated Americans can now enjoy beautiful beaches and anise-flavored liquor in the country of the classics when they provide a vaccination card that shows it has been at least two weeks since they received their final dose, per the US Embassy & Consulate in Greece. All travelers to Grenada must present a negative PCR test result taken within three days prior to travel, according tothe US Embassy in Barbados, Eastern Caribbean, and the OECS. “Travelers who are not fully vaccinated must enter quarantine in a government-approved facility and can only leave quarantine after undergoing another COVID test, usually on the fourth or fifth day after arrival in Grenada.” Additionally,fully vaccinated folks must provide proof of vaccination and will be required to quarantine for 48 hours pending a negative result from a PCR test administered on arrival. Fully vaccinated persons are still required to provide a negative PCR test taken within three days prior to travel. “All travelers to Grenada are also required to pay a one-time ($150 USD) COVID-19 test fee, which will cover their day-four test or any test taken while on island to leave quarantine,” they add. Guat do you mean, you haven’t been to this beautiful country in Central America? Anyway, now’s your chance, since you can enter Guatemala provided you can present either a COVID-19 vaccine certificate completed at least two weeks prior to arrival, a valid negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of arrival, or proof or having tested positive and recovered from COVID-19 within three months of arrival, according tothe U. S. Embassy in Guatemala. Note: Entry into Guatemala is restricted (with limited exceptions) for individuals who have visited Brazil, the U. K., and South Africa within the previous 14 days. The ridiculously scenic, Nordic island countryrecently announced that it is opening its elfen borders to vaccinated tourists. We’ve created adetailed itineraryfor first-time, second-time, and seasoned visitors alike (if you belong to the latter, it’stime to take a course atthe Reykjavik Elfschool), and highly suggest booking a roundtrip flight fromAgoda, which is slinging trips from New York City to Reykjavik (again: roundtrip) for around $300. Then, since renting a car abroad can be tricky, we recommend using a company with stateside customer care likeExpedia, and most importantly, don't forget tobook your spot at the iconic Blue Lagoon(right by the airport, and a must for first-timers) in advance. All roads lead to Rome—as long as you have a “Green Pass,” which is a document compliant with Italian and EU regulations that allows travelers from the United States to enter Italy without having to self-isolate/quarantine upon arrival and undergo testing after quarantine. Find out if you qualify for one at the US Embassy & Consulates in Italy’s website. According to the US Embassy in Lithuania, the Baltic nation is opening its doors to fully vaccinated Americans, who are exempt from the testing and quarantine requirements, provided they show proof of vaccination. The South Asian island nation of Maldives is going above and beyond to offer vaccine vacations—yes, that’s a thing—to all its tourists. “Dr. Abdulla Mausoom, the country’s tourism minister, announced last week that the country was initiating a ‘3V’ strategy to encourage holiday-goers to ‘visit, vaccinate and vacation,’” Shamani Joshirecently reported for VICE. Joshi points out that “the country is offering tourists both doses of the vaccine,” so those who sign up will end up having a sejour of several weeks on the island nation. Getting the vaccine by any means is a privilege, of course, but this definitely wins for one of the most enticing paths to getting juiced. Consider staying by popular cities likeMale(don’t missthe epic fish market),Hulhumale(sign up for atraditional cooking class),Bodufolhudhoo(home ofAtoll Scuba), andMaafushi Town(where you canfulfill your submarine fantasies). Overall, the Maldives is where you can kayak, snorkel, hike, repeat, and become best friends with a whale shark (we *just* watched) in between doses. (FYI, there wasa recent assassination attempt on the former president, which may or may not have ramifications that affect future travel.)This little archipelago in the central Mediterranean will actually pay you to visit. We repeat:the land of crystalline beaches, medieval streets, and a storybook,waterfront duck village. The island’s livelihood depends on tourism, and they recently announced an “Incentives for Free Independent Travellers” program, starting in June, that will compensate you up to around $140 if you book a stay throughselect partner lodgings, likethe Pergola Hotel & Spa in MelliehaandThe George, a boutique hotel in the middle of Paceville, St. Julians, the heart of the entertainment and leisure spots on the island. There’sso much to doin Montenegro besides fawn over the beautiful landscapes of mountains, lakes, and coastline—but we suggest doing some fawning anyway. The country is accepting travelers that can present either a negative PCR test from the previous 72 hours or proof that they received the second dose of a vaccine more than seven days before their arrival, but it’s important to note thatrental accommodations are limitedto two people or one family. Nepal, home of some of thebest hiking and mountaineering in the world(see: Mt. Everest), is now accepting vaccinated travelers. All tourists entering Nepal must have the following documents,according to the US Embassy In Nepal, “1) PCR negative report taken before 72 hours of boarding OR document showing complete vaccination against COVID-19; 2) Visa to Nepal OR recommendation letter from the Department of Tourism or Nepal Tourism Board to participate in tourism activities within Nepal; 3) Hotel booking confirmation or guarantee of accommodation; 4) Proof of Travel Insurance which covers emergency search, rescue, treatment, among others, for the duration of their travel; and 5) Barcode generated from the online application of the Online International Travel Arrival Form.”Cześć! Per the US Embassy & Consulate in Poland, “Citizens or legal residents of the United Statesare permitted to enter Poland.” (However, it’s important to note that it’s a whole different story if you’re arriving by land or sea—the qualifications are totally different and are available on the embassy website.) If you provide proof of vaccination, you’ll be able to bypass the usual quarantine. Disclaimer: Not the kid fromVaccinated Americans can now enjoy a stay on the island provided they show proof of vaccination and a negative PCR test result for COVID-19, taken within two days of their arrival.

It’s also themost vaccinated country in the world, and is welcoming all visitors—regardless of vaccination status—provided they have a valid negative PCR test result of not more than 72 hours prior to travel, according to the US Embassy in Mauritius and Seychelles. “All visitors require a valid Health Travel Authorization (HTA) for entry into Seychelles. This must be done through the online portal atseychelles.govtas.com. Visitors who have been to South Africa, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Brazil, within the 14 days preceding arrival to Seychelles are not permitted.”Fully vaxxed US citizens can now visit España, so long as they show proof of vaccination (with at least two weeks after their final shot) before entering the nation. You’ll also need to get a QR code from theSpain Travel Health portal, according to the US Embassy & Consulate in Spain and Andorra. There’s a lot more to Switzerland than loose banking laws and cheese, and now vaccinated Americans will be able to enjoy all the landlocked country has to offer, provided you can show proof of vaccination. Fully vaccinated people can skip the usual quarantine requirements. Check if you’re eligible for entry at thisgovernment website. Have you ever been to a black sand beach? NO? Well, Tahiti hasloads of them, and they’re open for business to vaccinated travelers. Non-vaccinated or immune travelers must quarantine for 10 days, and valid negative PCR tests are still required on arrival within 72 hours of departure. Most importantly, do NOT lose your vaccination card—it can mean the difference between an easy airport experience or getting stranded abroad.

31,Symbols and Words from the Pope in Iraq,1.67,38.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/symbols-and-words-from-the-pope-in-iraq/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-09,25,"It was the clumps of beard hair on the ground that stay in my memory, even more than the destroyed buildings. Walking around the Old City of Mosul in May 2018, accompanied by an Iraqi police general and armed guards, we were guided along the paths that had been cleared of ISIS booby-traps and unexploded coalition bombs. Several of the churches had only been cleared of bodies in the previous days, and the unpleasant sludge of remains was still visible on the floors. The Islamic State had used many of the churches in the Old City, all now destroyed or severely damaged, as headquarters, prisons, and torture chambers. My friend—a journalist and fellow Englishman traveling with me—remarked that there was human hair on the floor; I told him it was just carpet. Yet as we looked into a room where another body had been, I realized that ithuman hair, facial hair. The general told us that ISIS fighters had shaved their beards in the last days of fighting in order to avoid capture. During their brutal control of Mosul, where Abu Al-Baghdadi had proclaimed the caliphate, from 2014 to 2017, men of the Islamic State were expected to grow their beards long, and could face 20 lashes if they shaved. Destruction was all around: cars riddled with bullet holes or upside down, and so many buildings destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A year later I was back. The situation had improved somewhat, with some of the rubble cleared and many buildings, including the building where ISIS threw homosexuals from the roof, fully demolished. However, the churches were still in wreckage, and the only church due to reopen was a prefabricated building that had been in a refugee camp in Erbil, which was being moved to Mosul. Virtually no Christian families had returned, and there was no resident priest or bishop. This last Sunday, Pope Francis became not only the first pope in history to visit Iraq, but one of the very few international figures to venture into the Old City of Mosul. His short visit, to the same square, surrounded by the destroyed churches of the different denominations that had once thrived in this ancient city, was a remarkable moment, perhaps the most remarkable picture of the three-day visit to Iraq. It was not so much what he said—he recited a prayer for all the victims of war and violence and called for peace and toleration—but the symbolism of his presence. There is still no resident bishop, only one resident priest, and that pre-fabricated building is now the Church of the Annunciation, the only functioning church in the city. Very few Christian families have returned. Mosul has not been rebuilt and many residents feel that the Iraqi government has greatly neglected the city. It is still considered dangerous, with ISIS cells re-emerging and, more importantly, the different Shia militias (who are the real powerbrokers) vying for control. Add to that the story that was barely touched on by the world media—the desire of an expansionist Turkey to claim back Mosul, a city it once controlled under the Ottoman empire—and the full import of the moment becomes apparent: The pope of Rome came when so many fear to return. Iraq’s beleaguered Christian population, and other religious minorities, especially the Yazidis, hoped that the pope’s visit will bring the world’s attention to their plight, and that the civil powers in both Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government would fully recognize their civil rights. Christians specifically wanted Pope Francis to encourage them, acknowledge the martyrdom that many suffered, and be a voice for their future. His words to Iraqi civic leaders on his arrival, apart from the usual niceties, had two direct challenges that the precarious minority groups wanted to hear: He challenged corruption and “disregard for law” in Iraqi society, and he asked that “no one be considered a second-class citizen.” The Iraqi Constitution treats all non-Muslims as second-class citizens, not equal under the law, so this statement was essential, but not as forceful as many had hoped it would be. Perhaps the most powerful words addressing the suffering Christians had endured were uttered in the Syriac Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Salvation, after the meeting with civil leadership. That was the church where, in 2010, Islamist terrorists had attacked the congregation during mass, detonating suicide vests to kill two priests and more than 40 men, women, and children. The pope described the cathedral as a place “hallowed by the blood of our brothers and sisters who here paid the ultimate price for their fidelity to the Lord and His Church.” He reminded the Christians, and more importantly those who deny the Christian population a place in Iraq, that Iraq is a “land so closely linked to the history of salvation, and you are a part of that history.”Many Christians in Iraq had worried that the emphasis of the Vatican would be on religious dialogue and “Human Fraternity.” And that was certainly a major feature of the visit, referred to in almost every speech. The key moment, joint prayers with other religious groups at the birthplace of Abraham in Ur, was certainly a striking spectacle, but noticeably absent and unmentioned was the former Jewish community of Iraq. The great fear of Christians is that what happened to the Jews will happen to them. Francis strongly condemned the persecution of the Yazidi community, something to be welcomed, and particularly drew the world’s attention to the thousands of Yazidi women and children still missing. The courtesy visit to the Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraq’s Shiite Muslims, did not bring his signature to the Abu-Dhabi agreement on “Human Fraternity,” signed in February 2019 that the Vatican had hoped for, but Sistani’s words on the right of Christians to equality in Iraqi society were very valuable. Apart from the hugely symbolic moments in Mosul on Sunday, the last two events of the trip were meant to be entirely devoted to the Christian communities of the Nineveh Plain who have suffered so much at the hands of ISIS. Undoubtably the pope’s presence was the cause of the greatest joy. Perhaps his rather understated words both in Qaraqosh, the largest Christian town on the Nineveh Plain, and in the final mass in Erbil will not be remembered for their lack of emphasis on the sufferings the communities had endured. While encouraging Christians to “not give up,” and “not lose hope,” peculiar phrases in the last homily at the soccer stadium in Erbil warned that “hearts must be cleansed from the temptations of power and money,” which caused a degree of confusion, given that most of the Christians on the Nineveh Plain have neither. Some are speculating that the influence of Fr. Antonio Spadaro, one of the Pope’s closest advisors, could be seen in many of the speeches and homilies. The long-term success of the visit will be judged on two factors: firstly, whether Christians and other religious minorities are given equal rights under the Iraqi Constitution; and secondly, whether the dangerous level of emigration of Christian families and young people can be reversed, which may depend on economic stability and the hope of employment. The fact that the pope came, in a time of pandemic and danger, is something all Iraqis, and certainly the indigenous Christian community, welcomed and appreciated with great joy. Whether the visit will be remembered as a beautiful symbol, and not much else, remains to be seen.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1353855336172409,0.4097761001419539,1579,2,The American Conservative

33,"'Imminent' Collapse at Florida Phosphate Plant Wastewater Pond Threatens Tampa Bay, Surrounding Neighborhoods",0.0,49.67,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-04-03-leak-at-florida-phosphate-plant-tampa-bay-manatee-county-piney-point,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-05,25,"click here. A 20-foot-tall wall of water could be unleashed in minutes if the wall surrounding a phosphate wastewater pond breaches, a Manatee County government official said Sunday. About 306 million gallons of polluted saltwater remain in the reservoir that began leaking last week, Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes said. At a news conference on Sunday morning, Hope said up to a 20-foot wall of water could form in less than an hour, based on models, if the pond breached. The pond was once used to store waste from a plant at the site that turned phosphate into fertilizer. Officials in Manatee County on Florida's Gulf Coast ordered residents of more than 300 homes near the site to evacuate immediately Saturday.""What we're looking at now is trying to prevent — and respond to if need be — a catastrophic flood issue,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at the Sunday morning briefing. DeSantis said the water is not radioactive, even though the gypsum stack that the pond sits on is mildly radioactive. The governor said the water is mostly saltwater from a dredging project years ago and the ""process water"" from the old fertilizer plant. That process water is high in phosphorus and nitrogen, nutrients that can cause algae blooms in rivers and bays. Much of the water has already been drained into Port Manatee, which sits at the mouth of Tampa Bay. DeSantis said pumps are sending 33 million gallons a day from the pond to the bay. He also said the Florida National Guard is flying more pumps to the top of the gypsum berm around the pond to pump more water. DeSantis and Noah Valenstein, the secretary of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection, said flooding is the biggest danger to the public now. Valenstein the primary focus is on directing a controlled discharge to an area where it will have the least impact. At a county news conference at 2 p.m. Sunday, Vanessa Baugh, chairman of the Manatee County Commission, said, ""Steady draw down of the process water has continued at Piney Point, and we have thankfully avoided uncontrolled breach that would have endangered people and property in the evacuation zone around the stacks.""Baugh also said drinking water in Manatee County and the town of Palmetto remained unaffected by the breach at the pond. She said the county utility system was a closed system and water from the pond could not enter it. She also said the county's main source of drinking water, Lake Manatee, was not affected. She added that private wells near Piney Point also should remain safe. Hopes, the county administrator, said at the afternoon news conference that the additional pumps should double the amount of water that can be pumped from the pond. He said if the work continues as it's going now, the danger might be over by Tuesday. On Saturday, Hopes said attempts to plug the breach overnight with dirt and stone failed.""Evacuate area NOW. Collapse of Piney Point Stack Imminent!"" read the alert from county officials about 11 a.m. Saturday.“There has beenfurther motion with the wall,” Manatee County Public Safety Director Jacob Saur told the Bradenton Herald. “We’ve ordered further evacuations and closed U. S. 41.”2020 Hurricane Season Had One Fewer Landfall Than Previously Thought)Hopes said officials think the water would flow to the north of the pond across low-lying areas and down into Tampa Bay. The collapse could also threaten other retention ponds on the site, Hopes said. DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Manatee County about 1:45 p.m. Saturday. He later expanded it to include neighboring Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Officials first discovered a tear Thursday in the reservoir, which contained about 800 million gallons of water and waste productsfrom the manufacture of fertilizer from phosphate, according to the Bradenton Herald. The pond breached about 4 p.m. Friday, leaking water that contains phosphorus and nitrogen. Residents within a half mile of the reservoir, which is owned by HRK Holdings, were warned to evacuate. The evacuation order was expanded to residents living within 1 mile of the old plant about 7:20 p.m. Friday. Saturday evening, officialsadded another 316 homes and several more businessesto the evacuation area, according to WTVT.“What has been occurring in the past 12 hours is there are a number of small breaches in addition to what we believe is a significant leak at the bottom of the retention pond,” Hopes said earlier in the day. Officials tried to reduce the risk of a collapse by draining the wastewater. DeSantis said Sunday those pumps were pumping 23,500 gallons a minute, into nearby Tampa Bay. Hopes said additional pumps were pumping about 1,500 gallons a minute into the bay. The pond sits in large mound that is known as a gypsum stack that is made of phosphogypsum, a byproduct of the fertilizer made at the plant from the 1966 until 2001. Most of the naturally occurring radioactive uranium, thorium and radium in phosphate rockends up in the phosphogypsum, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The uranium and thorium decay to radium, and radium decays to radon, a radioactive gas. The wastewater inside the pond at the top of the stack is a mixture of seawater from an old dredging project, rainwater and the leftovers from fertilizer manufacturingthat can carry phosphorus and nitrogen, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Hopes said Saturday afternoon that snook live in the pond that is in danger of collapsing and he has seen ducks swimming on top of it. Two other ponds on the site have higher levels of the byproducts, he said.""The risk factor is the potential release of nearly 1 billion gallons of water,"" Hopes said. Wastewater from previous leaks at other gypsum stacks have caused fish kills and algae blooms. Phosphorus and nitrogen are nutrients that feed algae blooms and red tide. Matthew Pasek, a geoscience professor at the University of South Florida, told Axios that releasing the water would affect Tampa Bay.""Algae blooms followed byfish killsare the most likely thing,"" Pasek said. ""It’s going to impact the food chain further down the line too. It’s unlikely to cause human damage, but there’s going to be a pretty stinky bay for a while.""The old Piney Point phosphate plant has threatened Tampa Bay before when polluted discharges flowed from the property, the Times reported.“We’ve certainly had similar concerns in the past but I think that this one is magnified because now we have the owners of the stack admitting that there’s a real possibility of a total collapse,” Glenn Compton, who leads the local environmental advocacy organization ManaSota-88, told the Times. “Hopefully they’ll be able to contain as much of the wastewater coming off the site as possible.”Florida has about 25 gypsum stacks that altogether hold about1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, according to E&E News. In 2016, a sinkhole opened in a stack in Mulberry, Florida, dumping 215 million gallons of wastewater into the Floridan Aquifer, a source of much of the state's drinking water. Mosaic, the owner of the gypsum stack, pumped as much of the wastewater back out of the ground as possible. After taking thousands of samples, the company declared there was no off-site contamination. In 2004, Hurricane Frances ripped open a gypsum stack in Riverview, Florida, and 65 million gallons of wastewater flowed into a creek leading to Tampa Bay. In 1997, a heavy rainstorm unleashed a spill at a gypsum stack near Mulberry, Florida, that spilled 56 million gallon of wastewater into the Alafia River,killing everything in its path for 42 miles, according to the Florida Phoenix. More than 1 million baitfish and shellfish, 72,900 gamefish and a number of alligators were killed.",3,Reliable,0.0793164867261252,0.366144578313253,1774,3,The Weather Channel

S. biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on the project. “This is clearly part of the answer for the world, not the answer. Hopefully we’ll have vaccines and other therapeutics.”The partners will probably be able to make as many as 2 million doses per year by the end of next March if the drug cocktail obtains regulatory approval, Anderson said. That’s about the number of new Covid-19 cases identified worldwide in the past week. The necessity for a multipronged approach to treat Covid-19 has come into focus as potential safety issues emerge in late-stage trials of some promising vaccines and treatments. Eli Lilly this week paused a study of its own Covid-19 antibody to investigate such a concern. The U. S. has already secured hundreds of thousands of doses of experimental Covid antibody treatments, federal health officials said earlier this month, before the Lilly trial was paused. At that point they expected to have 1 million doses on hand by the end of the year. Trump touted Regeneron’s antibody cocktail as a cure, saying he’d make the drugs he took available for free to Americans. Read more from Naomi Kresge. Medicare to Pay Labs More for Fast Tests Turnaround:Medicare is adding performance bonuses to its Covid-19 lab payment policy. Beginning next year, Medicare will pay $100 only to labs that process high throughput Covid-19 diagnostic tests within two days of specimen collection. Labs that take longer will be paid a rate of $75. The goal is to ensure that patients are alerted quickly to a positive test so they can self-isolate and get treatment, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Pfizer, BioNTech Vaccine Trial Remains on Track:Side effects that have emerged in a large late-stage trial of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate from Pfizer and BioNTech are in line with those seen in smaller early studies, a positive sign for one of the front-runners in the race for a shot. The partners haven’t had to stop their late-stage study over safety fears, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said in an interview.

Instead, ABC’sactually ALLOWED Cuomo on Tuesday’s show to slam Donald Trump. The entire program was devoted to corona, yet there was not a single mention (in 16 minutes and 40 seconds) of the New York Governor’s fateful decision. Host Bryon Pitts opened the show by promising an exhaustive look at who is to blame: “Tonight, America in catastrophe. COVID-19 killing more than 149,000 people. Now piecing together what went wrong. Insights from government insiders.....”Who might some of these experts be? Why, Democrats of course. This included former Joe Biden chief of staff Ron Klain and Andrew Cuomo. Pitts actually mentioned New York, saying, “New York City quickly became the new epicenter for the virus.” He then featured Cuomo:The President's position was the states were in charge. States. The governors, the governors, the governors. I'm calling China to buy PPE. Every governor is calling China to buy masks. It made no sense. Not mentioned?

ADM. BRETT GIROIR (Asst. Secretary for Health): We always knew that there were a lot more cases out there than we were diagnosing. 23% of people in New York City have anti-bodies, so a quarter of New York City was infected with this virus. DR. MARY BASSETT (Former NYC Health Commissioner): It was inevitable that this novel coronavirus would show up in New York City. What they didn't expect was that it would be transmitted silently in the population and they have no tests. GIROIR: It had been decided at some point in time, not in this administration, that test supplies were not going to be part of the stockpile. So when I looked to see what was there, there was nothing there. There's no game plan. There was nothing.... ANDREW CUOMO: The President's position was the states were in charge. States.

36,Bernard Kerik: Black Lives Matter's roots are showing,27.67,15.67,https://www.lifezette.com/2020/07/bernard-kerik-black-lives-matters-roots-are-showing,https://adfontesmedia.com/lifezette-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-27,22,"Unlike so many other commentators and public officials, I have never been under any illusions as to the true nature of the “Black Lives Matter” (BLM) movement. Hiding behind an innocuous-sounding moral truism, BLM is an avowedly “revolutionary” group rooted in terrorist violence, unrepentant Marxism, latent racism and anti-Semitism, and committed to the “dismantling” of America as we know it. Ever since its emergence in 2014 and 2015, BLM’s primary target has been law enforcement officers like the brave men and women I served with throughout my career, a fact that has perhaps immunized me from the propaganda that portrays BLM as a legitimate organization concerned with justice—a lie that has successfully convinced hundreds of major corporations to ply BLM with millions of dollars in donations, mainly as an act of virtue signaling. Finally, however, people are beginning to wake up to the grim reality of what we’re really dealing with here. I was happy torelatethe current state of play on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” recently. In case you missed it, here’s the recap:BLM was never a mainstream or moderate movement. From the very beginning, it trafficked in violent rhetoric aboutkillingpolice officers, which the establishment Left eitherignored or excused. We police officers, of course, knew that we were dealing with a genuine threat. The first cracks in BLM’s façade began to show in 2016, when the group couldn’t help but include anti-Semitic talking points about Jews committing “genocide” in Palestine as part of an ideological manifesto. It was widelycondemnedin the Jewish press at thetime, but swept under the rug by the rest of the mainstream media. Now, of course, we can all see the truth: BLM was founded and is to this day held together by communists. Last month, a video emerged, showing BLM co-founderPatrisse Cullorsdescribingherself and another co-founder as “trained Marxists.”It shouldn’t have been a surprise to anyone familiar with BLM’s history and background. Cullors has long been open about her ties to communists —including terrorists— while the co-founder she referenced, Alicia Garza, has been equally open about heraffinityfor cop-killing communist Joanne “Assata Shakur” Chesimard. Then, we learned that BLM’s fundraising operation —the tax-exempt “charity” raking in millions in corporate guilt checks— isrunin part by none other than Susan Rosenberg, the convicted “May 19th Communist Organization” terrorist. Rosenberg is free to raise millions for BLM only because President Bill Clinton, in the final hours of his presidency, commuted her 58-year sentence for hoarding weapons and explosives for a group that killed several police officers and civilians while engaging in a years-long campaign of bombings and armed robberies. I personally escorted Rosenberg to and from her trial in Newark, New Jersey in 1985, carrying my sidearm at all times. The extreme security was necessary because her terror cell was known for staging violent prison breaks. Who do you think would win the Presidency?It should be clear by now that BLM’s leadership is driven by a dangerous ideology rooted in race hatred and committed to violent revolution. The group’s ugly side poked through yet again when BLM’s Toronto chapter founder posted a lengthy screed describing white people as “sub-human” and “recessive genetic defects.” Black people are superior, according to this BLM leader, because “melanin directly communicates with cosmic energy.”Once again, astute observers could see this coming. Back in 2018, BLM darling Tamika Mallory landed in hot water over her unapologeticsupportfor Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a man whose cult preaches that white people are not true humans but, rather, “devils” genetically “grafted” by a mad scientist named Yakoob. The evidence is out there and freely available—BLM is not run by well-meaning “social justice warriors”; it’s run by people who practice a racial brand of revolutionary communism.

37,The Air Force wanted to mothball over 100 planes. Here’s what Congress says it will permit.,0.67,46.33,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/04/the-air-force-wanted-to-mothball-more-than-100-planes-in-its-inventory-heres-what-congress-says-it-will-permit/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-04,24,"WASHINGTON — Congress is seeking toblock the Air Force from retiringany of its A-10 Warthog attack planes, KC-135 refueling tankers and RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones this fiscal year. On Dec. 3, the House and Senate Armed Services committees put forward the conference report of the fiscal 2021National Defense Authorization Act— a final version of the defense bill that includes input from both chambers. The bill is expected to be approved by Congress sometime next week and will then move to the desk of President Donald Trump, who hasthreatened to veto it. This year’s NDAA contained policy provisions on everything fromthe Pentagon’s organizational structureto military bases named for Confederate officers. For the Air Force, the biggest concern was whether Congress would greenlight the divestment of more than 100 aircraft, which service leaders said would free up funding for modernization priorities that include space technologies and the Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept (which was recently updated to Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control). Lawmakers have opted to let the Air Force retire some bombers, tankers and cargo planes, but they stridently protected others like the A-10 and Global Hawk from any reductions. Here is a breakdown of what the Air Force wanted to send to the boneyard, and how Congress responded:A-10:Congress’ battles with the Air Forceover the venerable A-10have been legion over the past decade, with the service seeking to retire the entire fleet in the mid-2010s. In FY21, the Air Force sought a more modest adjustment — the retirement of 44 A-10s, or about three squadrons worth of aircraft,leaving about 237 Warthogsto fly close-air support missions in the next decade. But Congress put the kibosh on that as well, stipulating in the NDAA that no funding be used to divest or retire any of the 281 A-10s currently in the Air Force’s inventory. Bombers:The Air Force hoped to retire 17 of its oldest B-1s, which leaders said were putting strain on the fleet due to the manpower needed to keep them running. In the defense bill, Congress repealed an existing law that requires the Air Force to maintain at least 36 combat coded B-1 aircraft — essentially agreeing to a reduction to the B-1 fleet. However, lawmakers put several new stipulations in place: The Air Force must maintain 92 bombers of any kind in its primary mission aircraft inventory. The service must place four retired B-1s in storage so that they can be reclaimed if necessary. And it cannot remove any B-1 maintenance billets, ensuring that the B-1s that stick around will get the time and attention needed to keep them flying. ISR fleet:Congress also rejected the Air Force’s plan to retire all the Global Hawk Block 20 and 30 surveillance drones — a total of 24 aircraft — which would have left RQ-4 Block 40s and the U-2 spy plane around to conduct the high-altitude surveillance mission. Over the past decade, the Air Force has tried multiple times to divest its Global Hawks and U-2s, with Congress refusing to permit the retirement of either aircraft. In response, Congress has stipulated a list of requirements the Air Force must meet before lawmakers consider that request. Specifically, lawmakers have asked for certifications from the Defense Department that the Air Force is developing a cost-effective way to replace the RQ-4 or U-2, or a waiver from the defense secretary stating that a better but more expensive capability is in development. Neither has been received, lawmakers wrote in the conference report.“The conferees understand and acknowledge that modernizing airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities will necessitate divestment of legacy systems,” the conference report stated. “However, the conferees remain concerned about the Air Force’s continued inability to execute an ISR acquisition and replacement plan that appropriately manages operational risk to the global combatant commanders, as well as the service’s failure to comply with current public law.”Tankers:The Air Force wanted to divest 13 KC-135s and 16 KC-10s in FY21, but the NDAA sketches out an alternative plan — one that forbidsany KC-135 retirementsover the next three years. Congress will allow the Air Force to move down to 50 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY21, 38 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY22, and 26 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY23. The Air Force currently has 56 KC-10s that are considered primary mission aircraft, so the language would allow the service to retire six aircraft in FY21 and a total of 30 tankers over the next three years, a source familiar with the bill told Defense News in June, when the House Armed Services Committee released identical language. Cargo planes:The service hoped to retire 24 C-130Hs, most of which would be directly replaced by 19 C-130Js that are set to be delivered in FY21. While the NDAA does not address the issue directly, it sets a minimum airlift aircraft inventory at 287 aircraft, including 230 combat-coded cargo planes. The report also included a provision that would prohibit the Air Force from retiring only Air National Guard airlift assets. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

It sounds a lot like the independent commission that Comer, a Kentucky House Republican,voted against in the House. And that Senate Republicans –led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell – blocked in the Senate. In fact, it’s not a lot like that proposal. Itthat proposal. Go to the language of the legislation, which passed the House in May with 35 Republican votes (as well as every Democratic vote). It makes clear that the commission would have 10 members, with Democratic leaders in Congress appointing five people and Republican leaders appointing five. The commission would be helmed by two co-chairs – one each selected by the speaker of the House and the House minority leader. As for who these members would be? Well, the legislation is pretty specific about that too. (Bolding is mine.)“An individual appointed to the Commissionbe an officer or employee ofany instrumentality of government,”reads the texts of the bill.“It is the sense of Congress that individuals appointed to the Commission should be prominent United States citizens, with national recognition.”THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics.

St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner filed the charges against Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who became nationally known because of a viral video of them holding firearms outside their home as protesters marched past.“It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in nonviolent protest, and while we are fortunate this situation did not escalate into deadly force, this type of conduct is unacceptable in St. Louis,” Gardner, a Democrat, said in a statement. The McCloskeys both were charged Monday with a single felony count ofexhibitinga firearm in an angry or threatening manner.

Full statement below:pic.twitter.com/zPucQ3MHs5The couple has said that protesters tore down a gate to gain entry to their property June 28. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that she discussed the case with President Donald Trump that morning.“The president, I asked him about that this morning. He said it is absolutely absurd what is happening to the McCloskeys. McEnany added of Gardner:There have been many cases brought to her attention of violent rioters that she has failed to charge. But instead, she’s charging the individuals who are defending themselves from violent protesters. You have 300 to 500 protesters who stormed the gates, tore down the gates, and trespassed on their property. The White House press secretary noted that Patricia McCloskey said some trespassers threatened to kill the couple and occupy the house, while others shouted threats to burn down the house.“They were completely within their right, and it is an egregious abuse of power,” McEnany said. In a video announcement, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, the state’s top law enforcement official, said he would seek to dismiss the case.

If it goes to trial, the case likely will boil down to whether a jury believes the couple reasonably believed they were acting in self-defense, said Amy Swearer, a legal fellow at the Institute for Constitutional Government at The Heritage Foundation.“The burden is on the state to prove it wasn’t reasonable self-defense,” Swearer told The Daily Signal. “There are so many questions to piece together for the facts and the timeline, I don’t envy lawyers from either side of this case. But it is good to have so much video, so it’s not just a he said/she said.”Although there may be a legitimate question whether protesters were on the McCloskeys’ property, the couple asserted that some in the crowd were armed and shouting threats, Swearer said. The broader context includes the violent unrest that was happening in the area, she added.

Mike Parson, a Republican, tweeted Tuesday: “Every Missourian has the right to protect their family and their personal property.”Every Missourian has the right to protect their family and their personal property.#CastleDoctrine previous day, Parson also was critical of Gardner on Twitter, noting that “the Circuit Attorney’s office has admitted there is a backlog of cases and dozens of homicides that haven’t been prosecuted, yet she has accelerated this case forward.”Kim Gardner’s action toward the McCloskeys is outrageous. Even worse, the Circuit Attorney’s office has admitted there is a backlog of cases and dozens of homicides that haven’t been prosecuted, yet she has accelerated this case forward. We must prioritize laws that keep our citizens safe over political motivations. Kim Gardner owes every single family who has had a loved one murdered an explanation on why she has acted on the McCloskey case instead of theirs. Mark McCloskey, 63, and his wife Patricia, 61, are both lawyers. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called the prosecution an abuse of power and last week asked the U. S. Justice Department to investigate the prosecution by Gardner as a possible civil rights violation.“This is an unacceptable abuse of power and threat to the Second Amendment, and I urge you to consider a federal civil rights investigation into the St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office to determine whether this investigation and impending prosecution violates this family’s constitutional rights,” Hawley’sJuly 16 letterto Attorney General William Barr says, adding:There is no question under Missouri law that the McCloskeys had the right to own and use their firearms to protect themselves from threatened violence, and that any criminal prosecution for these actions is legally unsound. The only possible motivation for the investigation, then, is a politically motivated attempt to punish this family for exercising their Second Amendment rights. Indeed, this is part of a troubling pattern of politically motivated prosecutorial decisions by the St. Louis Circuit Attorney, who has not seen fit to prosecute many violent offenders, and who has expressed hostility to gun rights in the past.

41,California just hit 95% renewable energy. Will other states come along for the ride?,-5.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-04-29/solar-power-water-canals-california-climate-change-boiling-point,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"This is the April 29, 2021, edition of Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment in California and the American West. Sign up hereto get it in your inbox. Something remarkable happened over the weekend: California hit nearly 95% renewable energy. I’ll say it again: 95% renewables. For all the time we spend talking about how to reach 100% clean power, it sometimes seems like a faraway proposition, whether the timeframe is California’s 2045 target or President Biden’smore aggressive 2035 goal. But on Saturday just before 2:30 p.m., one of the world’s largest economies came within a stone’s throw of getting there. There are several caveats. For one thing, Saturday’s 94.5% figure — a record, as confirmed to me by the California Independent System Operator — was fleeting, lasting just four seconds. It was specific to the state’s main power grid, which covers four-fifths of California but doesn’t include Los Angeles, Sacramento and several other regions. It came at a time of year defined by abundant sunshine and relatively cool weather, meaning it’s easier for renewable power to do the job traditionally done by fossil fuels. And fossil fuels actually were doing part of the job — more than the 94.5% figure might suggest. California was producing enough clean power to supply nearly 95% of its in-state needs, but it was also burning a bunch of natural gas and exporting electricity to its Western neighbors. It’s impossible to say exactly how much of the Golden State’s own supply was coming from renewables. That said, what happened on Saturday is definitely a big deal.“It sends chills down my spine. It’s amazing,” said Elliot Mainzer, president and CEO of the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s main power grid. “These types of transitions aren’t always pretty. But we’re getting a lot of renewable generation online, making a real dent in the state’s carbon emissions.”I’ll get to the bit about the transition not always being pretty in a minute. For now, here’s a chart based on data from the grid operator’swebsite, showing how various sources of power supply changed hour by hour on Saturday:That green line at the top is renewables; you can see how it jumps up in the morning and falls in the evening, reflecting sunrise and sunset. The orange line under that is natural gas. The red line at the bottom is out-of-state imports. It sinks into negative territory in the middle of the day because California has so much solar power that it’s selling some to other states. The 94.5% record may have been fleeting, but it wasn’t some isolated spike. Most of Saturday afternoon, the renewables number topped 90%, with solar and wind farms doing the bulk of the work and geothermal, biomass and hydropower facilities making smaller contributions. Add in the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant — which isn’t counted toward California’s renewables mandate — and there was enough climate-friendly power at times Saturday to account for more than 100% of the state’s electricity needs. So California has lots of clean power. The important thing now is making sure the puzzle pieces of the grid fit together on hot summer evenings, like the ones last August when insufficient supplies after sundown led to rolling blackouts. State officials are taking many steps to avoid a repeat of last summer’s emergency, some of which aremore controversial than others. They’re also beginning to focus on the longer term. Mainzer’s grid operator recentlyurgedthe California Public Utilities Commission to order electric companies to add 10,000 megawatts of power by 2026 — about one-eighth of the state’s entire generating capacity! — in part to make sure there’s enough supply on the grid when the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant closes.“That’s not an inconsequential investment,” Mainzer said. No, it’s most definitely not. But while some of theclean energy solutionsCalifornia is almost certain to need will carry a high upfront price tag, others are much less expensive. In fact, some produce immediate savings. Case in point: the Western Energy Imbalance Market. I’ve avoided writing too much about theWestern EIM(acronym alert!) because it gets very wonky, very fast. But it’s absolutely worth knowing about. It’s a unique program that makes it easier for utility companies across the American West to share extra electricity, with a goal of saving money for ratepayers (i.e. you and me) and reducing planet-warming emissions. How does it work? As I explained in a 2017 deep dive for the Desert Sun, the program allows out-of-state utilities to participate in California’s real-time electricity market, where they can buy power to fill in last-minute gaps between supply and demand. So if California has more solar power than it can use on a sunny afternoon — agrowing trend each spring— it can send some of that cheap electricity to Arizona, which then might be able to burn less coal. Or if the wind is ripping in Wyoming — home to some of the country’sstrongest, most consistent gusts— California can tap into that clean power rather than firing up a gas plant. A key barrier to this type of cooperation in the past was mistrust: Red states worried about blue states shoving renewable energy down their throats, and blue states worried about red states forcing them to buy dirty energy. And nobody wanted to risk finding themselves short on electricity in a pinch because some out-of-state utility made a higher bid for their power. But in the seven years since California launched the Western EIM, that mistrust has started to fade. There are now14 electric grid operatorsparticipating in the imbalance market, from Arizona Public Service in the Southwest to Idaho Power in the Northwest to Warren Buffett-owned Rocky Mountain Power in the Intermountain West. Several utilities joined this month,includingthe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which has long zealously guarded its independence. Several more are preparing to join, as far from California as NorthWestern Energy in Montana and El Paso Electric in Texas. By 2023, the market will cover 83% of electricity demand in the West. Here’s a map of the current and planned participants:The program is growing so fast in part because of the measurable economic benefits. Through the end of 2020, participantscollectively saved nearly $1.2 billion. Mainzer told me another $101 million in savings accrued in the first quarter of this year.“California has seen about $300 million of those benefits, and the state hasn’t had to pay a penny to see that market get up and running,” he said. “It’s just been a smashing success.”At the same time, political obstacles still stand in the way of a fully integrated Western power grid that could do a whole lot more to limit costs, reduce climate pollution and ultimately prevent power outages — “one grid to rule them all,” to borrow a phrase Ifirst saw usedby Utility Dive journalist Herman K. Trabish. Three years of discussion overexpandingthe EIM, for instance, have not yet resulted in an agreement among the participants. A proposal from then-Gov. Jerry Brown that would have transitioned California’s grid operator to a truly regional power authority — again, see my2017 deep dive— was defeated several times in the state Legislature, amid opposition from lawmakers who worried the plan would result in fewer in-state jobs and cede too much power over California’s energy mix to other states. Some of those other states are similarly wary of Mainzer’s Independent System Operator, which is led by appointees of the California governor. The agency’s primary responsibility is serving Californians, even as it runs the EIM for the whole region. Those tensions came to a head last week when the grid operator’s leaders voted toprioritize California’s electricity needsduring crunch times on the grid this summer, to the possible detriment of out-of-state utilities that typically have been able to send energy through California’s power lines without much trouble. Arizona and Nevada’s major utilitieswrotethat the plan was “not equitable or fair.” Mainzer’s former employer, the Portland-based Bonneville Power Administration,wasn’t happy either.“We take our obligations to California dead seriously,” Mainzer said. At the same time, he added, “we definitely are very motivated to help the broader West.” As California should be. The state won’t make much of a difference on climate change unless it can bring the rest of the country and world along for the ride. At the moment, Mainzer is focused on keeping the lights on this summer. He’s also happy to celebrate the 95% renewable energy record, even if only for a moment.“We have to remember the positives of the story as well,” he said. And now, here’s what else is happening around the West:There’s a growing recognition in California’s Central Valley that the farm economy will shrink as droughts worsen and farmers face the consequences of pumping too much groundwater. That’s one takeaway fromthis story by my colleague Louis Sahagún, who wrote about how farmers and farmworkers are affected by increasingly scarce (and often polluted) water supplies, including many Latino families who face the risk of their drinking-water wells running dry. Columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, writes that westernersmust come to termswith what John Wesley Powell told a Los Angeles irrigation conference in 1893: “You are piling up a heritage of conflict and litigation over water rights, for there is not sufficient water to supply the land.”President Biden’s new climate target is more ambitious than California’s. Biden pledged that the United States will slash its planet-warming pollution at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, compared to the 47% the Golden State is aiming for, as Tony Barbozareports for The Times. (Tony also compiled abrief historyof U. S. climate pledges.) America’s new goal is roughlydouble what President Obama had sought to achieve, per The Times’ Chris Megerian. Biden ended his climate summit last week by making the case that global warming isa challenge but also an economic opportunity, my colleague Anna M. Phillips reports. Lest he be one-upped by Biden, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that California would study phasing out all oil production by 2045. He also said the state willstop issuing new fracking permits by 2024, Phil Willon and Taryn Luna report for The Times. By way of context, fracking accounts for a tiny fraction of oil and gas extraction in California; ending oil production would be a much bigger deal. See alsomy story from last weekon scientists who say the state is falling behind on climate leadership. At this point, it seems like almost a given that California will see another historic fire season. So writes our new wildfire reporter, Alex Wigglesworth, inthis piece previewing what we might facein a few short months. The short version: Nobody knows exactly how bad things will be, but a combination of meager rainfall, depleted snowpack and dry vegetation spells trouble. A stunning DDT dump site off the coast of Los Angeles is much bigger than scientists expected. My colleague Rosanna Xia writes that scientists aboard the research vessel Sally Ridewere so overwhelmed by the images sent up by deep-sea robotsthat it was like “trying to count stars in the Milky Way.” The research mission waspromptedby Rosanna’sincredible reportingon the hidden history of the country’s largest DDT manufacturer dumping its pesticide waste into the Pacific Ocean. California officials are poised to order Nestlé to stop bottling and selling millions of gallons of water from San Bernardino National Forest. The proposed order comes six years after reporter Ian Jamesrevealedthat the company was taking water from the national forest under a permit that was supposed to expire in 1988. Here’s the latest on what happens nextfrom Ian and Janet Wilson at the Desert Sun. (Ian also has a scary piece for the Arizona Republic on thestate of play on the Colorado River, including the fact that Lake Powell could dip low enough in the next few years that it stops being able to generate hydropower.)Water regulators continue to debate a proposed desalination plant in Huntington Beach. The facility faces all the usual tensions: It would generate clean drinking water whileusing lots of energy and harming marine life, as Bettina Boxall reports for The Times. One outstanding question is whether the developer, Poseidon Water, shouldn’t be allowed to sell water until it’s ready to start its environmental mitigation work, which includes wetlands restoration at the nearby Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. A Texas-based group is pushing county governments in Colorado and other states to pass resolutions opposing Biden’s goal of protecting 30% of U. S. lands and waters by 2030. The hard-right American Stewards of Liberty was founded by the daughter of some of the original Sagebrush Rebels. She argues that the “30 by 30” goal — which was also endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom — is “anti-capitalism,” “anti-individual liberty” and “anti-American,” as Nancy Lofholmreports for the Colorado Sun. President Biden’s climate summit did not yield new commitments from most of the world’s major polluters. One exception was South Korea, which pledged tostop financing new overseas coal plants, as Chris Megerian and Anna M. Phillips report for The Times. Anna also put together ahelpful rundownon how the world’s biggest emitters are doing on their existing climate pledges. Back at home, the White House bolstered its own climate pledge by announcing it would push for a law requiring 80% clean electricity nationwide by 2030. A new analysis from researchers at Energy Innovation and UC Berkeleyconcludes that target is feasible, per Reuters’ Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom. Reuters’ Timothy Gardner also reports that the Biden administration will offermore than $8 billion in loansto support clean energy by expanding and upgrading the power grid. The Biden administration is also proposing to once again allow California to set its own tailpipe pollution rules. This was expected, but it’s still a big deal forgetting America’s largest source of climate pollution under control, Anna M. Phillips reports. L. A. Times columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, explores a new report from the Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general finding the Trump administrationdeliberately locked out EPA scientistsas it weakened tailpipe emissions rules.“Too many people drive like demons because they think they won’t get caught. Knowing they might be on camera could help reduce the carnage.”That’s Times columnist Steve Lopezmaking the case for two bills in Sacramentothat would seek to slow down drivers by allowing automated speeding enforcement. You’ll remember myrecent piece about my friend Jim Pagels, who was killed in a car crash after years of advocating for safer streets that work for cyclists and pedestrians, not just drivers. REI says climate change is an existential threat — but it spent Earth Month helping Ford market a gas-guzzling SUV. The outdoor recreation company has made environmental stewardship a core part of its branding, but that didn’t stop it from making ads promoting the Bronco Sport, and alerting its members with the email subject line “Load Up. Gas Up. Get Out,”per my story for The Times. I also learned that REI’s director of sustainability said he was “not aware of the advertisement before its release.”A new United Nations report says reducing methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure is one of the best ways to keep the planet from heating up too quickly. More details herefrom Hiroko Tabuchi at the New York Times. In related news, the U. S. Senatevoted 52-42 to reinstate Obama-era methane restrictions, per my colleagues Sarah D. Wire and Anna M. Phillips. Natural gas utilities are happy to slash methane emissions, but they’ve fought efforts to phase out gas in favor of clean electricity, arguing they can be part of the long-term climate solution. San Diego Gas & Electric justpledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, joining its corporate sibling, Southern California Gas, as Rob Nikolewski reports for the San Diego Union-Tribune. It’s not yet clear how either utility will reach that target. In the meantime, parent company Sempra Energy continues to seek Biden administration approval for anatural gas export terminal in Mexico, as I reported earlier this year. Here in Southern California, a natural gas leak in Downey prompted a small evacuation Thursday after a SoCalGas pipeline was cut by a contractor in a residential area. Read more here, from The Times’ Priscella Vega and me. Further south, L. A. City Council member Joe Buscaino isurging the owner of a liquid butane storage facility in San Pedro to sell the site, my colleague Emily Alpert Reyes reports.

Master Sgt. Brian K. Tolliver, 46, died in Largo, Florida, after testing positive for COVID-19 on July 10, according to an Army Reserve Medical Command press release.“We feel a tremendous loss in our military family with the passing of Master Sgt. Tolliver,” said the command’s ranking officer, Maj. Gen. Jonathan Woodson, in an emailed statement. “COVID-19 has taken a dedicated soldier from our formation, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.”Tolliver, who is from Memphis, Tennessee, was admitted to the Largo Medical Center the day after he tested positive and he remained there until the time of his death, the command’s release stated. As of Thursday morning, there have been a total of 34,584 COVID-19 cases among service members, with 11,915 of those in the Army,accordingto Pentagon data. More than 19,000 service members have recovered from the illness so far. The Defense Department does not break out those numbers to specify whether those troops are active duty or reservists. Tolliver served in the Army for 25 years, more than a decade of which was spent in the reserve component. In his last assignment, Tolliver served as the command paralegal for Army Reserve Medical Command in Pinellas Park, Florida. He is survived by his three children, who reside in Louisville, Kentucky.“Master Sgt. Tolliver was a tremendous mentor, leader, soldier, and one of the finest human beings I have ever met,” said Lt. Col. T. Scott Randall, the deceased soldier’s immediate supervisor. “He will be sorely missed by all.”Four of the military’s five deaths have been soldiers from the Army’s reserve components. ANew Jersey National Guard captaindied of the illness in March at the age of 57. Then in April, a 41-year-oldNavy chief aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Rooseveltdied. A34-year-old Illinois-based Army Reserve soldierdied in May, and a61-year-old Army reservistdied earlier this August. The Army Reserve suspended in-person drill in March and shifted to virtual formations and instruction whenever possible, according to apolicy memo. The Pentagon’s figures show that there have been a total of 75 deaths among DoD personnel, with 47 among civilian employees, seven among dependents, 16 among contractors and the five among uniformed service members. The infection rate in the military has been roughly on par with that of the general U. S. population, but the rates of hospitalization and death are much lower, likely due to the younger demographics within the service branches. Fewer than 2 percent of military cases have required hospitalization, and the death rate is 0.0001 percent, compared to 3 percent nationwide, Military Timesreportedin early August.

A reader asked Curious Texas: Did the Campisi family ever have ties to organized crime?The Campisis are well-known for the family’s Italian restaurant chain. David Campisi, the great-grandson of the first family members to move to the U. S., toldD Magazinein 2016 thatthe rumors are simply rumors. Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond. “Mysteries just add to that nostalgia and iconic nature of our brand,” he told the publication. So why do people wonder?The question traces as far back as President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, decades after the family arrived in Dallas. According to thecompany’s website, Carlo Campisi and his wife Antonia, immigrated to New Orleans from Sicily in 1904. Later, a cousin sent a telegram about a grocery store for sale for $800 in the Dallas area. The Campisis made their way here, worked in the grocery industry, and then bought a bar with a small kitchen at the corner of Knox St. and McKinney Ave. After a relative visiting from New York described the success of New York Italian pizzas, Carlo began a pizzeria. After Carlo and his brother died, Carlo’s son Joseph Campisi continued to expand the family business, the restaurant’s site says. Today, Campisi’s runs nine restaurants in the D-FW area. Joseph Campisi’s possible ties to organized crime came up after Jack Ruby’s shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald just two days after Oswald assassinated President Kennedy in downtown Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. According to areportfrom the U. S. House Select Committee on Assassinations, Ruby had eaten at Campisi’s restaurant the night before Oswald shot Kennedy. In its report, the committee noted that law enforcement files contained information suggesting that Joseph Campisi “occupied a position in organized crime.” But the committee said it “did not confirm or refute” Campisi’s alleged connection to the mob. In 1978,The News reported on the subpoena of Campisi by the house committee. Campisi had visited Ruby in jail, and investigators were interested in conflicting reports Campisi gave before and after that visit. According to The News, in a Nov. 25, 1963, interview, Campisi told FBI agents he had known Ruby since 1948 and had attended a number of sporting events with him. In Campisi’s second interview, on Dec. 7, 1963, he said he knew nothing of Ruby’s background or associates, and never socialized with him. The News’ 1978 story said Campisi had refused to comment about the house committee’s interest in him. As the company’s websitetells the tale, it’s unknown why Ruby requested the visit and what was discussed. The Campisi family did not respond to The News’ request for comment.

The NCLA urged GMU to reexamine the policy “to deem natural immunity at least equivalent to that achieved through vaccination, and to confirm that Professor Zywicki will not lose eligibility for future pay raises (merit or otherwise) if he does not wish to share his vaccination status.”“George Mason is forcing me to choose between serving my students on one hand and undergoing an unnecessary and potentially risky medical procedure on the other.

46,Charter Schools Have Failed (And We Need to Stop Funding Them),-11.33,45.33,https://progressive.org/public-school-shakedown/charter-schools-have-failed-bryant-200817/,https://adfontesmedia.com/progressive-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-17,17,"Parents frustrated with how their children’s public schools have responded to the COVID-19 crisis—whether they opted for in-person instruction, remote learning, or a blend of both—may see charter schools, with their free tuition and flexibility in reopening, as an attractive alternative. The report crunched nearly two decades of data and discovered that more than one in four charter schools closed after just five years. Buta new report from the Network for Public Education reveals that sending students to charter schools comes with a considerable downside: the schools may not stay open for very long. The report crunched nearly two decades of data and discovered that more than one in four charter schools closed after just five years. That’s less than the number of years it takes for a typical kindergartner to complete elementary school. After ten years, 40 percent of charter schools were shuttered; after fifteen years, that rate rose to about 50 percent. And the number of students impacted by charter school closures is considerable. According to the report, from 1999 to 2017, more than 867,000 students were displaced when their charter school closed. That figure is likely closer to one million students, if data from charter school closures between 1995 and 1998, as well as 2017 to 2019, were added to the analysis. So what happens to students when they’re booted from a charter school that fails?For one, they face a broad range of negative consequences. As studies haveshown, students whose education is disrupted are more likely to experience lower engagement, poorer grades, and higher dropout rates. Learning outcomes for younger students, in particular, are often deeply affected when they’re forced to switch schools. Charter school closures, the Network for Public Education report highlights, are especially disruptive when they occur midyear, which is frequently the case. Also, the newer the charter school, the riskier it can be, as 36 percent of charter school closures studied by the group occurred within the first two years after opening (and 23 percent occurred during their third and fourth years). Parents who live in Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Michigan should be especially wary. At the ten-year mark, charter school failure rates in Wisconsin were at 55 percent; in Arizona, 48 percent; in Florida, 42 percent; and in Michigan, 41 percent. Three of those states—Wisconsin, Arizona, and Florida—are joined by Ohio at the top of charter closures at the five-year mark. Because of the risks posed by charter schools, it is a mistake for federal, state, and local governments to continue to funnel public money into a system that has so clearly failed. Families living in low-income communities of color are the most at risk of getting jilted by their charter schools. The Network for Public Education report, for example, found that charter school closures in three of the poorest cities in America—Detroit, Tucson, and Milwaukee—were higher in neighborhoods where the poverty rate was above 30 percent of households, and significantly lower in more affluent areas. Because of the risks posed by charter schools, and the current financial constraints caused by the pandemic, it is a mistake for federal, state, and local governments to continue to funnel public money into a system that has so clearly failed.",3,Reliable,0.0676982323232323,0.3899229797979798,677,2,The Progressive

48,What Are Debris Flows and Why Are They Dangerous?,0.0,47.33,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-10-22-debris-flow-threat-california-rain,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,25,"A​ newer version of this article appearshere. California is bracing for dangerous and potentially deadly landslides in the coming days, as much-needed rain moves in amid historic drought conditions. Terrain left barren by wildfires is most vulnerable to an especially dangerous and fast-moving type of landslide that scientists call ""debris flows."" Known less formally as mudslides, these flows are typically triggered by short, intense rainstorms and can send a wall of water, soil, ash, vegetation, rocks and other debris careening downhill, sweeping away or burying everything in its path.""A debris flow is kind of a flood on steroids,"" Jason Kean, a debris flow expert with the U. S. Geological Survey, told weather.com in an interview. ""It’s all bulked up with rocks, mud, even boulders – and boulders can be the size of cars.""Latest Forecast for Western Storms)The threat of landslides usually increases in the fall as wetter weather typically starts to move across the West Coast. A parade of storms forecast into next week has parts of both California and Oregon on alert for debris flows. The USGS and other agencies work together to assess the debris flow threat in burn scars each year. So far they've completed assessments for about 60 fires in nine western states. The public can read themhere. Among the areas of highest concern in California this year are the Dixie, Monument and Alisal fire burn footprints, Jaime Kostelnik, also a geologist on the assessment team, told weather.com in a recent interview. In Oregon, areas with high risk include parts of the Devils Knob, Jack and Bootleg burn areas. But any burn scar can potentially be at risk, and conditions can change over time depending on the weather and other factors. The cumulative effects of extreme wildfires in recent years make the situation even more hazardous, especially in California. Many of the areas impacted by wildfires have burned more than once in recent years. Besides destroying vegetation that would normally hold soil and debris in place, wildfires change certain characteristics of the soil itself. It becomes less likely to absorb water, which creates conditions ripe for flash flooding and debris flows, according to Kean and Kostelnik.""As (the water) runs off, it picks up all these loose soil particles that no longer have vegetation to hold them in place and then it bulks up into that debris flow that can move really fast and start actually within minutes of intense rainfall,"" said Kean. Debris can rush down a hillside at a rate over 35 mph and then flatten out and spread even farther when it reaches the bottom of a slope. California Faces Third Year of Extreme Drought)At least 20 people were killed when mudslides with walls of debris as tall as 30 feetstruck the Santa Barbara County community of Montecitoin 2018. On average, 25 to 50 people arekilled by landslidesevery year in the United States, according to the USGS. This week, emergency crews worked to prepare areas scarred by the Alisal Fire before the wet weather moved in. That includedinstalling barriersto keep mud and debris from washing over roadways, the Santa Barbara News-Press reported. Storm prep was also underway along the Caldor Fire burn scar in Sacramento, where work included placing fallen trees across bulldozer lines to hold soil in place.“The heavy predicted rains this week has us concerned, but we're going tokeep working as long as we can,” Paul Naman, a service repair supervisor at the site, told KOVR-TV. The elevated risk of debris flows in a burn scar can last up to five years after a fire. Officials in Santa Cruz County, for example, are warning people who live in the area of the 2018 CZU Complex Fire to be on alert for debris flow danger. The threat for California as a whole will increase as the rainy season moves in, usually at its peak from November through February.""California has a distinct wet season that lasts from late fall into early spring, and a dry season with little to no rainfall from late spring to early fall,"" said weather.com meteorologistChris Dolce. ""That extreme variance is related to an area of high pressure that sets up off the West Coast in summer and prevents any significant moisture from reaching the state. Conversely, in winter, that high weakens and shifts farther south, which opens the door for Pacific storms to affect California with heavy rain and mountain snow.""The state is in the clutches of a historic two-year drought. While the rain in the coming days will bring some relief, it remains to be seen how wet this year's winter will be. And experts say it could take years to catch up from the precipitation deficit. Wildfire danger, meanwhile, peaks in the fall because that's when vegetation is completely dried out prior to the arrival of the first significant Pacific storms of the season, Dolce said. Research has linked California's progressively more extreme fire seasons to climate change, and a study published last year by the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies found that the risk of post-wildfire debris flowsis also likely to go up. Experts say people in areas under threat should be alert if any rain develops, and don't wait for an evacuation order to leave if heavy rains develop.""They should take it seriously,"" Kostelnik said.",3,Reliable,-0.0133058346881876,0.4751907634848811,1132,3,The Weather Channel

One piece would provide $748 billion for support for small businesses, including Payroll Protection Program loans, added unemployment benefits, and vaccine development and distribution. The other would provide $160 billion for state and local government as well as temporary liability protection from coronavirus related-lawsuits. Those two issue have been major sticking points in reaching a deal as the clock ticks on the current Congress. The bipartisan group plans to hold a news conference Monday to announce the modified proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has long called for a liability shield from coronavirus litigation, while congressional Democrats have made money for states and cities their top priority. Breaking the proposal in two parts might give a relief package a greater chance to pass. Romney is among a group of lawmakers who have vowed to stay in Washington through the holidays to get a deal done as businesses across the country shut down, especially in the restaurant and hospitality industry, and Americans struggle to stay employed amid another COVID-19 surge. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., one of the leaders of the effort, said the bipartisan group and their staffs have met regularly the past month, including a call Saturday and another call later Sunday to “finish things up.”“The bottom line is there’s a lot of parts to this bill, and in the spirit of compromise, you have to work through all of that,” Manchin told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “But at the end, you can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”Romney expressed optimism earlier this month that Congress could get a relief bill passed before Christmas.“I think it would send a terrible message if we’re home celebrating Christmas and people’s unemployment has run out and businesses are being closed,” he said.",3,Reliable,0.0462191358024691,0.4383784425451091,428,3,Deseret News

Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in his majority opinion that the “plaintiffs do not have standing,” that is, a legal right to sue, to challenge Obamacare’s individual mandate “because they have not shown a past or future injury fairly traceable to defendants’ conduct enforcing the specific statutory provision they attack as unconstitutional.” Alito and Gorsuch dissented.

51,"With Violence And Unrest Soaring, Support For Gun Control Plummets",21.0,24.4,https://bearingarms.com/cam-e/2020/08/13/poll-support-gun-control-plummets/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,18,"Actually,this is only shockingto gun control advocates, who I’m sure are stunned that Americans aren’t responding to looting, riots, and skyrocketing violent crime by demanding a ban on scary black guns and waiting periods for gun purchases. For the rest of us, it probably doesn’t come as much of a surprise that as violent crime (including both politically-motivated violence and street crime) is on the upswing, Americans don’t find the idea of more gun control laws nearly as compelling as they did just a few months ago. Rasmussen’s survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Aug. 5 had a margin of error of 3 percentage points and showed 52% still support stricter gun regulations, but that was down from 64% in 2019. Forty-two percent oppose stricter gun regulations. Thepoll also showedthat 47% of those questioned own a gun or had someone in their household that did. Among those households, 27% said they or someone in the home has purchased a firearm in the past six months. That last bit is worth noting. We know for a fact that a record number of firearms have been sold every month since March of this year, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation estimates thattwo million Americanshave purchased a gun for the first time between January and June of this year. The Rasmussen poll didn’t ask specifically how many of those who had purchased a firearm in the past six months were new gun owners, but with support for gun control dropping by 12-points in the past year, it stands to reason that a healthy number of respondents are relatively new to exercising their Second Amendment rights. Given the poll’s margin of error, support for gun control could actually be well below 50%, and with violence continuing to escalate, I suspect that gun control’s popularity will continue to crater. In Democrat-controlled cities across the country, the Left is showing us their vision for the future: fewer police and more violence. Is it any wonder that more Americans are responding by choosing to protect themselves and their loved ones with a firearm? Absolutely not. Maybe the really shocking thing about this poll is that gun control still managed to get the approval of 52% of likely voters. I don’t think it’s going to be that high come Election Day, and that will pose increasing problems for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who are running as the most anti-gun ticket in American history. They’re campaigning on a platform that would turn the right of the people to keep and bear arms into a privilege for a chosen few, and they’re doing so at a time of record-setting gun sales and plummeting support for more gun laws. Their anti-gun agenda may be bringing in big bucks from the likes of Michael Bloomberg, but as we get closer to November it’s likely to turn off more and more voters, and not just on the Right. Gun control lawsgun crimes out of thin air, and at a time when the Left is demanding defunding law enforcement and “re-imagining” policing, the Biden/Harris campaign is going old school; more gun control laws and a strategy that amounts to arresting our way to safety through enforcement of those new laws. That’s antithetical to the ideology of Black Lives Matter, but it’s a fundamental part of the Democrats’ platform. The more Joe Biden and Kamala Harris talk up their “common sense gun safety” agenda, gun owners need to be reminding voters of the real world consequences of those laws. Even if you despise guns with every fiber of your being, you should know that enactment of the Biden/Harris gun control agenda means far more young black men in big cities will arrested for violating an “assault weapons ban” or possessing a “large capacity magazine” than 40-something rural white guys like me. Old school gun control is in direct conflict with the ideas of de-policing, and conservative gun owners aren’t the only ones who should be opposed to the regressive and repressive agenda of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.",1,Questionable,0.0812382756132756,0.4704127209595959,853,1,Bearing Arms

S. President Donald Trump and his supporters alleging mass-scale voter fraud incited a violent attack on the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlsontook to his showto again promote similar claims. In the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump and his supporters falsely claimed the election was ""stolen"" by means of a massive voter fraud conspiracy, but never presented evidence for these claims that withstood scrutiny. Trump's own Department of Homeland Securitystatedthat the 2020 election, which took place during a pandemic, was, in fact, ""the most secure in American history."" Georgia's ballots have been counted three times. None of the lawsuits put forward by Trump or his supporters were successful in court and in fact, Trump's attorney in the matter, Rudy Giuliani, had his law licensesuspendedfor spreading election lies. Despite the fact that there is no evidence for claims of mass voter fraud and even though those claims have led to deadly violence, Carlson persisted in promoting them. The segment that aired on July 14, 2021, contained various claims that have either been already debunked, or are statements based on supposition and lack evidence. (We note that Carlson's employer, Fox News,arguedin a court case that Carlson's show shouldn't be viewed as factual.)During his July 14 primetime show, Carlson stated, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November."" He later added, ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""Carlson's July 14 segment cited the findings of an activist group called VoterGA. The group supports Trump's false claims of massive election fraud and hasembarkedon a search for evidence of said fraud. Here's how Georgia Public Broadcastingdescribedthe group:The primary plaintiff is Garland Favorito of the group VoterGA, who has fought against Georgia's elections infrastructure for more than a decade, including a failed lawsuit against Georgia's old direct-recording electronic machines. Favorito has alsoquestionedthe authenticity of events surrounding 9/11, pushed conspiracy theories about former President Bill Clinton and theassassination of John F. Kennedyand is now serving as the latest vessel for false claims of fraud with the 2020 election. We will now look at the claims Carlson made on his show. The segment opened with a weeks-old piece of disinformation about an alarm sounding at an election warehouse in Fulton County. Carlsonstated:On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarm sounded in a big nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary. It was under round-the-clock surveillance by both private security and local law enforcement including armed deputies with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office. Any unauthorized person entering from the outside would have to get past a locked 100-pound steel door, as well as a maze of motion detectors -- not easy -- but someone tried to do it, anyway and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after the deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their posts. By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the 100-pound door to the warehouse. So, what happened that night? And why? We still don't know. In fact, we do know. Georgia Public Broadcasting reporter Stephen Fowler took to Twitter to point out that not only did Carlson use a photograph taken by Fowler without crediting him, the photograph was lifted from astorythat explains why an alarm went off and what happened with the door. Fowlerreportedin June 2021 that the alarm didn't come from the area where ballots were secured.""The source of the alarm was a motion detector in an upstairs office belonging to the Clerk of Superior Court in the warehouse, and the county said a test showed that alarm is audible from where the private security officers were stationed off property.""As for who opened the door, it was law enforcement. Fowler reported that two off-duty Douglas County Sheriff's officers in a marked patrol car approached the warehouse and found the outer door unlocked.""The officers opened it themselves, and it was not 'left wide open,'"" as pro-Trump media had reported at the time, Fowler explained in the report. Carlson claimed VoterGA found double-scanned ballots accounted for more than 3,300 votes for President Joe Biden and 865 votes for Trump. But there's no evidence thousands of double-scanned ballots were reflected in Georgia's official vote tally.""Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times,"" Carlson stated. In this segment, Carlson directed viewers' attention to a woman wearing a yellow shirt in a video he said was obtained by VoterGA. But that video doesn't prove that the state's election results were falsified by ballots scanned multiple times, and importantly, Georgia's election results were recounted after the election,including by hand. That means that if any ballots were scanned more than once, in order for it to end up in the final vote tally, those ballots would have needed to have been counted more than once in both the heavily-scrutinized machine recountsin the hand counts of the ballots. The video used by Carlson was from a surveillance camera at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, where ballots were being processed on the night of the election. Investigatorslooked intoallegations of fraud at that time and found no evidence of wrongdoing. The closest Carlson came to offering an independent source for the figures he regurgitated from VoterGA was a July 13 report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC). In doing so, not only did Carlson acknowledge that VoterGA is a problematic source on its own, he also misrepresented the Journal-Constitution's report. Carlson stated:Now before you dismiss [attorney] Bob Cheeley and Voter GA as dishonest partisan actors, keep in mind that the strongly left of center ""Atlanta Journal Constitution"" appears to agree with this at least in outline. The newspaper reviewed the available digital ballot images independently and concluded that hundreds of ballots were improperly duplicated. The AJC didn't report that ""hundreds"" of ballots were improperly duplicated. Itreportedthat ""nearly 200"" ballots were scanned twice before a recount. An important part of the AJC report left out by Carlson was that there was ""no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""The newspaper, which offered readers the opportunity to look at ballot images themselves, further reported:The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also verified the duplicate ballots inballot imagesobtained under the Georgia Open Records Act andposted online. Although it's true that a small number of ballots were duplicated in Fulton County, the numbers are nowhere near as large as Carlson claimed; and contrary to what Carlson stated, the amount wouldn't have changed the outcome of the presidential election. The source for this assertion is a July 13news releaseposted by VoterGA which claimed that the group found ""7 falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals for their respective batches.""This claim originated with a comparison made by VoterGA between ballot batches from theinitialelection machine count to ballot batches from the state's manualrecountand audit, per Mark Niesse, reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who has covered the election and its aftermath. But a discrepancy between those two numbers is not evidence of fabricated vote totals or even of wrongdoing. At this time, we don't know how election workers sorted and counted ballots. But Niesse pointed out that neither the initial count nor the audit were the the official, certified vote totals for the presidential race. Theofficial resultscame from the machine recount requested by Trump. He also pointed out that the official tally closely matched the initial count. Carlson cited a ""whistleblower"" who stated she saw mail-in ballots without creases on them.""That's strange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" Carlson observed. Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling explained this to The New York Times in aninterviewpublished Jan. 4 about false election fraud claims being promoted by Trump and his supporters:TRUMP’S CLAIM: That officials improperly counted “pristine” ballots — meaning ballots that weren’t folded, indicating that they hadn’t arrived in an envelope. STERLING’S EXPLANATION: “Pristine” ballots aren’t unusual, Mr. Sterling said. For instance, many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print out, complete and mail back. But these printed ballots aren’t the right size for scanners, so election workers have a standard process for transferring the votes to scannable ballots. A ballot that gets damaged and can’t be scanned may be transferred in the same way.""""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to election day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""This claim comes from a July 12storypublished by thepro-Trumpwebsite The Federalist. Although the article cites an ""expert in voter data analytics and residency issues"" named Mark Davis, it doesn't link to his work. It only reports that he compared two different databases, the U. S. Postal Service national change of address database and data from the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, and came up with a figure: 35,000 Georgians registered a change of address but voted in their old county. But The Federalist admitted the reason for this isn't known and it may be perfectly legitimate in most cases:While some of those nearly 35,000 voters may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily—situations which do not affect an individual’s residency for purposes of election law—everyone else in this group voted illegally under Georgia law. Now we are seeing from Davis’ further research that as of May 2021, more than 10,300 of those individuals have updated their voter registration to their new address, thereby confirming that the move they had previously informed the USPS of was permanent. Insinuating that there were 10,300 votes cast by people illegally is pure supposition, however. No evidence is offered that this number, if accurate, represents 10,300 illegally cast votes. About that, The Washington Postreportedthat ""If true — again, this is unproven third-party analysis — it’s illegal in the sense that going 67 in a 65 is illegal, not in the sense that you’re driving a stolen car.""",3,Reliable,0.0738617704134945,0.4427610464248394,2368,3,Snopes

Fiscus said the health department’s attorney provided a letter about the doctrine based on a 1987 Tennessee Supreme Court ruling and that her job was to explain what is allowable.""While childhood immunization rates temporarily dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are already seeing vaccination rates rebound to pre-pandemic levels and will continue supporting parents who are working to get their families back on track,"" the governor’s spokesperson said. In this image made from video, Michelle Fiscus speaks to the Associated Press, from Franklin, Tennessee, on Tuesday, July 13, 2021. (AP Photo)The program, which includes immunizations DTap, MMR, Polio, Chicken Pox and Hepatitis B, ""will continue to be successfully administered,"" the statement added. According to the governor’s office, Tennessee ranked among the top 10 states for MMR vaccination coverage among kindergartners during the 2019-2020 school year, and 95.3% of 2020-2021 kindergarten students in Tennessee were fully immunized. For more than a decade, Tennessee has had above 90% coverage of kindergarten students receiving childhood immunizations, including DTap, MMR, polio, chicken pox, Hepatitis B, Lee’s office said. Fiscus said that before her termination leadership at the state health department had instructed the department to ""no longer do outreach around immunizations for children of any kind,"" WMC reported. ""That’s infant immunizations, HPV immunization in a state that has one of the highest HPV cancer rates in the country. Flu vaccine outreach in schools has been canceled,"" she said. A health department situation report, first obtained byWSMVin Nashville, said that Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey had recently directed department employees not to hold any immunization event in or on school property or hold any COVID-19 vaccine events at organizations whose clientele are solely children. Sarah Tanksley, a spokesperson for Piercey, told the Associated Press the agency had ""in no way halted the immunizations for children program"" and stressed that the state will continue to support vaccine outreach efforts. Tanksley added the state is ""mindful of hesitancy"" surrounding vaccinations and pointed out the department intends to recognize National Immunization Awareness Month. Only 38% of Tennesseans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, lagging behind much of the nation, according to the Associated Press. State Sen. Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis, said the change was ""dangerous and terrifying,"" arguing the move by the state health department provided ""an example of politics leading our public health department. That is a problem. That is an abdication of leadership.""Shelby County Health Department, which serves Memphis and operates independently from the state, said the new state health department rule would not affect their vaccine outreach. Shelby County Schools said it will continue to advise students, parents and families to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Separately, Fiscus’s husband, Brad Fiscus, toldThe Tennesseanthat his wife received an Amazon package containing a muzzle about a week before her firing – thought it’s unclear who sent the item.

The crowd cheered in favor of the idea. Seeming to indicate that somehow Fox News — his favorite network, often mocked as a former of ""state TV"" — was somehow biased in favor of Sanders, Trump complained in a tweet Tuesday night that his supporters were kept out of the town hall:Fox News host Bret Baier had said that the audience was ideologically mixed, with Republicans, Independents, and Democrats all in attendance.

How are we feeling, what do we predict, how much whiskey are we going to drink (I am going to mix it with cider okay). I have the novelarriving today in the mail, and I started a free 7 day trial of HBO. These are my coping mechanisms. Perhaps I will also make cookies. Going to butter myself up so I am too slippery for the National Guardto catch. How fun it is to have absolutely no idea what is going to happen!I am wondering if/hoping this will be slightly like January after Suleiman’s assassination, where everyone was convinced Trump would take the United States to war with Iran, but events didn’t actually stack up that way and Trump dropped the whole thing. If Biden can go up to a commanding lead early, then it may be difficult for Trump to outright steal the election. Ultimately Trump’s got the courts, but there has to be a procedural excuse for invoking them—of course the GOP can easily invent one, but if nothing super obvious presents itself, they may decide to go the simpler anti-president, popular-opposition-figure route. Republicans aren’t going to give up power easily, but on the other hand the Democrats are so weak, it may be easy enough to undermine and try for a Tea Party-like resurgence in two years, followed by a tilt at the presidency in four. Or, Trump could just suspend what scraps of democracy we have left, and dare the Democrats to do anything about it. Who knows! Many things are possible. All I know is I keep thinking aboutStephen Miller’s immigration plans for a second termand feeling ill. In terms of whether this election will contain shenanigans that wildly diverge from previous elections—I am not convinced that that will happen, although it’s totally possible that it could. In some sense, I think the (utterly plausible) worst case scenario is that Trump wins fair and square and then feels emboldened by the renewed public mandate to do worse shit. I think there’s an extremely small chance that Trump (and maybe more importantly, the cops and paramilitaries that support him) accept any counting of the votes that doesn’t result in a GOP win. A big margin for Biden—who might be the single least-inspiring “resistance” figure short of like, a sickly Bourbon princeling—can be very easily dismissed by claims of box-stuffing, fake ballots, cloned voters, or whatever other type of fraud Republicans can imagine. When it comes to the courts, I think there’s a presumption that Trump would “need to have a case” for them to hand him a victory. But the courts at multiple levels have been so stuffed with Republicans that all he really needs is the facade of a case—one that might not pass muster with plugged-in politics junkies, but wouldn’t look completely dictatorial when splashed across the front page of a newspaper. Which is why the media’s role is going to be so important over the coming days. Whatever people see on TV, in the paper, etc., is going to have a huge impact on how they react to what’s unfolding. If you think about the mainstream media’s tendency to treat politics as a sport, you might come to the conclusion that they’ll treat Nov. 3 like the Super Bowl—i.e. a game that ends at a set time, just as it has in the past. But this particular “game” is probably going to have overtimes that stretch on for days or even weeks. On one hand this means the media won’t get the big decisive closure to their election coverage (so they might be tempted to manufacture it, especially Fox). On the other hand, a couple weeks of people nervously glued to their TV screens could be a 9/11-esque bump in ratings, which would give the media an incentive to preach patience even as they stoke massive anxiety in their viewers. Trump will almost certainly try to use TV as a bullhorn to shout I WON/I WAS ROBBED at some point, and how networks handle this is going to have a huge impact on how ordinary people react. We’re off to a good start, Trump is posting a video of himself dancing to theYMCAas his final message to the voters. The one thing that gives me a little bit of hope is that Trump does not really seem to have found a message or argument for himself. I suppose “Joe Biden is a radical socialist” is something he’s managed to get some people to believe, a friend of mine ran into a voter convinced Joe Biden is a cannibal, but it’s so obviously untrue that I am not sure how well it can succeed. There are some alarming numbers (more people think they’re better off now than four years ago than thought so in 2004 or 2012, somehow, tighter polls in PA and FL than anyone should be comfortable with) so who knows how this will go. I am cautiously optimistic, Trump has seemed a bit desperate. I do think Nick is completely right about the press having an incentive to create a dragged out fight over Trump’s imaginary claim to victory, which is alarming. But I don’t even want to think about that until we’re there. I can’t remember who it was, unfortunately, but someone on Twitter pointed out that one of Trump’s failures has been to define Joe Biden consistently. Is Biden a radical socialist or part of the do-nothing, corrupt, business-as-usual Dems? One of the reasons Trump managed to beat Clinton is that he successfully defined her and the media ran with the narrative (and there was enough truth to it to make it stick). Yeah Trump’s attacks on Clinton over Iraq and Wall Street really worked because they were impossible to contradict. But how are people who just watched a year of Joe Biden fighting to save the Democrats from Bernie supposed to think Joe is now Bernie? It’s totally incoherent. At, we are much more in the feelings-and-speculation game, but <<my wife voice>> MY HUSBAND happens to be very knowledgeable about the nuts and bolts of national electoral politics. So please welcome John, who 1) is potentially the best human being alive 2) will treat you to a brief guide on what to look for tonight as the numbers roll in. Before I get started, can I just say this is thevery first time I’ve contributedto?During the early hours of this evening our focus should probably be on Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. Not necessarily because these will be the three most important states (looking at you, Pennsylvania) but because these are the most likely swing states that should have some relatively definite early results. We’re also very likely going to read some truly terrifying stuff about them. Like this from Nate Silver:If Trump wins all three Needle States the election is 50:50. the surface that isn’t great! Woe to the Democrat whose candidacy depends on Florida. But it’s actually not that bad. Let’s simplify things and basically say that all three contests are tossups (Biden is actually favored narrowly in all three). That means that Trump would need to essentially win three coin flipsto win a fourth. Now, of course it’s likely that polling errors in 1 of those states will be correlated with the others, but that’s still an uphill climb. However, should these states come in for Trump or be inconclusive, then the next contest we should focus on is Arizona, another state that is accustomed to mail-in voting and should process results quickly. Two more things: don’t be surprised if Trump is WAY out ahead in the early Pennsylvania tallies. If you’re reading this then presumably you know all about the electoral shenanigans their state legislature has been up to this year vis-a-vis the delay in countingmail-in ballots. Also, as ever, give not a whit of your attention toexit polls. Just grab a beer, turn on the TV at 7, and come what may. Either the high-quality polls this cycle are right and we can breathe a sigh of relief before hating the Biden administration for four years, or they’re historically wrong, in which case…we’re gonna need a lot more beer.",1,Questionable,0.0910685483870968,0.5527137736815155,1773,2,Current Affairs

S. economy and debating whether it can be safely reopened. Though castigated for his remark, Trump has a point. Advertisement - story continues below The U. S. is rightly using extreme measures to meet the threat and control the virus that threatens the lives of millions of Americans, with the elderly sick foremost among them. And we need to do so without killing the economy upon which scores of millions of other Americans depend. Clearly, America was unprepared for this pandemic.11 things desperate Dems are willing to do to beat TrumpAnd there will be time enough to assess responsibility for the lack of surgical masks, medical gowns, rubber gloves, respirators, ventilators and hospital beds. The immediate imperative is to produce those beds and that equipment and get it delivered to doctors, nurses and hospital staff, the front-line troops in the battle to control the virus. Advertisement - story continues belowHowever, during this shutdown, all ""nonessential businesses"" are being closed and their workers sent home to shelter in place and to keep ""social distance"" from friends and neighbors to minimize the risk of spreading this easily transmissible virus. Unfortunately, what is ""nonessential"" to some – bars, restaurants, hotels, stores, cruise ships, tourist sites, shops, malls – are places of employment and indispensable sources of income for millions of other Americans. Close the businesses where these Americans work and you terminate the paychecks on which they depend to pay the rent and buy the food and medicines they and their families need to shelter and live. And if the salaries and wages on which workers depend are cut off, how are these millions of newly unemployed supposed to live?How do those who follow the instructions of the president and governors to remain in their homes get their prescriptions filled and buy the food to feed their families?How long can the shutdown be sustained if the necessities of life for the unemployed and unpaid begin to run out?

S. Army officer in the Vietnam War. Must we cripple or destroy the economy to rescue the American nation from the coronavirus crisis of 2020?Then there is the matter of time. Many Americans can survive on what they have on hand for two or four weeks. Far fewer can survive without income for two or four months. If we shut down the economy, what will we have when the medical crisis passes, be that in May, June, July, August or September?Will all those nonessential businesses we put to sleep come back to life?Advertisement - story continues below The free market system that is the legacy of Hamilton and the Founding Fathers is the world's best design for the distribution of goods and services and ensuring prosperity. And in a population where life expectancy is decades beyond what it was in the early 20th century, there are government programs to provide the necessities of life for those who can no longer access or afford them. But businesses are needed to deliver the goods. And if, by government command, America's free economy is partly shut down as unessential in this medical crisis, the government could be responsible for imposing the conditions that lead to social disorder. At some point, the country is going to have to open up the supply chains and take the risks to let the market work to provide food – or people will engage in panic buying, hoarding and using any means to get what they need for themselves and their families.

With only 12 fighters in his attack group, the Marine Corps captain recognized he was impossibly outnumbered. That didn’t stop Foss, though. The cigar-chomping, tough-as-nails American ace with 26 kills in World War II gunned hisGrumman F4F Wildcatinto action and ordered his pilots to use the overcast conditions to their advantage as they attacked the overwhelming enemy force. By darting in and out of the clouds, the aptly namedFoss’ Flying Circusquickly shot down four Japanese fighters and tricked the bombers into thinking they had encountered a much larger squadron. The Japanese withdrew from attacking strategically importantHenderson Fieldon Guadalcanal and flew back to their base without dropping a single bomb. Foss was hailed for his heroics by saving the airbase with a “brilliant tactical maneuver” and would receive theCongressional Medal of Honor, which put him on the cover ofLife Magazine. By equalingCapt. Eddie Rickenbacker’sFirst World War record of planes destroyed, Foss became America’s first “ace of aces.” Though his total would later be surpassed by other U. S. fighter pilots, Foss’ exploits came at a time when the outcome of the war was very much in doubt and the country desperately needed heroes.“His remarkable flying skill, inspiring leadership and indomitable fighting spirit were distinctive factors in the defense of strategic American positions on Guadalcanal,” his citation read. Foss answered the call of duty piloting the F4F Wildcat, a very capable carrier-based aircraft that saw service from the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor in 1941 to the Japanese surrender aboard theUSS Missourinearly four years later. While not as fast or nimble as other planes, it was surprisingly rugged and effective as a fighter in the hands of a trained pilot.“The Wildcat was actually well-armored and very difficult for the Japanese to shoot down,” saysLarry Burke, curator of U. S. naval aviation at theSmithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, which has aWildcatin its collections that will go on view in the museum's new World War II gallery slated to open in 2024. “They had to put a lot of fire into it to knock it out. The Wildcat and other Grumman planes during the war acquired this reputation for sturdiness. One of the reasons the company was nicknamed Grumman Iron Works was because of the survivability of the planes,” says Burke. And rugged it was. Despite the quickness and agility of the F4F’s main opponent in the Pacific Theater—the JapaneseMitsubishi A6M Zero—the Wildcat shot down an average of seven enemy aircraft for every one of its losses. Foss scored his first kill in an F4F during his first combat mission on October 13, 1942. However, his Wildcat was also severely shot up and was being chased by three Zeros. He was forced to land at Henderson Field at full speed with a dead engine and no flaps. Nearly a month later, on November 7, another Wildcat flown by Foss was hit hard, forcing him to ditch at sea. He survived both incidents with no major injuries. In fact, Foss was shot down at least four more times and got back in the cockpit after each one. Bigger and better fighters—such as theGrumman F6F Hellcat—would enter the fray, but the F4F Wildcat saw service throughout the war. Its durability, along with multiple .50-caliber machineguns and wing space for two 100-pound bombs, made it ideal for search-and-destroy missions. Plus, it possessed another feature that worked wonders onboard the smallerescort carriersoften used in convoys.“(Company co-founder)Leroy Grummanvery famously experimented with an eraser and unfolded paperclip to come up with a diagonal hinge that he called the Sto-Wing,” Burke says. “It allowed thewing to fold alongside the aircraft, kind of like a bird’s wing, which permitted more planes to be stored on the escort carriers.“What’s fascinating is the wing is still in use today,” says Burke. TheE-2 Hawkeye, the Navy’s early-warning aircraft, features the Sto-Wing because the aircraft has a big radome on top that interferes with the upward-folding wings on other aircraft. The Wildcat at the National Air and Space Museum is a version of the Grumman F4F-4, known as an Eastern Division FM-1. It was actually produced under license by General Motors, which began manufacturing Wildcats in 1943 when Grumman switched over to F6F Hellcats. While this plane never saw combat, it is a well-preserved example of the aircraft that helped turn the tide in the Pacific.“The Wildcat was the airplane that held the line for the Navy at the beginning of World War II,” Burke says. “It held on in combat until better aircraft could be designed and put into service. It was the primary fighter operated by the U. S. Navy and Marine Corps.“The Wildcat was the main fighter used in four of the first five big carrier battles of World War II. And it continued to make a mark later in the war by flying from the convoy escort carriers, which the bigger planes couldn’t do,” says Burke. During World War II, Joe Foss scored all 26 of his victories flying the F4F, including his last three kills in a single day. He would go on to serve at age 39 as the youngest governor in South Dakota history, first commissioner of the upstartAmerican Football Leaguein 1959 and was a passionate gun-rights advocate aspresidentof the National Rifle Association from 1988 to 1990. Foss died in 2003 at the age of 87. Wherever he went later in life, the Wildcat was never far from his heart. The Medal of Honor fighter pilot developed a strong affinity for the rugged aircraft that protected him and propelled him to victory at a critical moment in history.“I loved that Grumman F-4F Wildcat,” Foss oncetold an interviewer. “I just loved it. It was like a brother to me. It was tough, and I would be able to destroy the enemy with it, and I couldn’t blame it for the speed it didn’t have, but I felt at home.”Get the latest on what's happeningin your inbox.",3,Reliable,0.1028144793802688,0.4554095845674793,1457,3,Smithsonian Magazine
64,How to Stay Safe With a Fast-Spreading New Coronavirus Variant on the Loose,0.0,49.0,https://heavy.com/news/new-fast-spreading-coronavirus-covid19-variant/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,21,"National Institute of Allergies and Infectious DiseasesThe new SARS-CoV-2 variant’s increased transmissibility is believed to come from a change in the spike protein, visible here in yellow under an electron microscope. A fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has been foundin at least 20 states, and people are wondering: How do I protect myself now?We saw what the new variant, known as B.1.1.7, can do as itspread quickly through southeastern Englandin December, causing case numbers to spike and triggering stricter lockdown measures. The new variant has been estimated to be50% more easily transmitted than common variants, though itappears to affect people’s health in the same way. The increased transmissibility is believed to arise from achange in the virus’s spike proteinthat can allow the virus to more easily enter cells. These and otherstudies on the new variantwere released before peer review to share their findings quickly. Additionally, there is some evidence that patients infected with the new B.1.1.7 variant may have ahigher viral load. That means they may expel more virus-containing particles when they breathe, talk or sneeze. As professors who studyfluid dynamicsand aerosols, we investigate how airborne particles carrying viruses spread. There is still a lot that scientists and doctors don’t know about the coronavirus and its mutations, but there are some clear strategies people can use to protect themselves. TheSARS-CoV-2 variantsare believed to spread primarily through the air rather than on surfaces. When someone with the coronavirus in their respiratory tract coughs, talks, sings or even just breathes, infectious respiratory droplets can be expelled into the air. These droplets are tiny, predominantly in the range of1-100 micrometers. For comparison, a human hair is about 70 micrometers in diameter. The larger droplets fall to the ground quickly, rarely traveling farther than 6 feet from the source. The bigger problem for disease transmission is the tiniest droplets – those less than 10 micrometers in diameter – which can remain suspended in the air as aerosols forhours at a time. With people possibly having more virus in their bodies and the virus being more infectious, everyone should take extra care and precautions. Wearing face masks and social distancing are essential. Spaces and activities that were previously deemed “safe,” such as some indoor work environments, may present an elevated infection risk as the variant spreads. The concentration of aerosol particles is usually highest right next to the individual emitting the particles and decreases withdistance from the source. However, in indoor environments, aerosol concentration levels can quickly build up, similar to howcigarette smoke accumulates within enclosed spaces. This is particularly problematic in spaces that have poor ventilation. With the new variant, aerosol concentration levels that might not have previously posed a risk could now lead to infection.1) Pay attention to the type of face mask you use, and how it fits. Most off-the-shelf face coverings are not 100% effective at preventing droplet emission. With the new variant spreading more easily and likely infectious at lower concentrations, it’s important to select coverings with materials that are most effective at stopping droplet spread. When available, N95 and surgical masks consistently perform the best. Otherwise, face coverings that usemultiple layers of materialare preferable. Ideally, the material should be a tight weave. High thread count cotton sheets are an example. Proper fit is also crucial, as gaps around the nose and mouth candecrease the effectiveness by 50%.2) Follow social distancing guidelines. While the current social distancing guidelines are not perfect –6 feet isn’t always enough– they do offer a useful starting point. Because aerosol concentrations levels and infectivity are highest in the space immediately surrounding anyone with the virus, increasing physical distancing can help reduce risk. Remember that people are infectiousbefore they start showing symptoms, and they many never show symptoms, so don’t count on seeing signs of illness.3) Think carefully about the environment when entering an enclosed area, both the ventilation and how people interact. Limiting the size of gatherings helps reduce the potential for exposure. Controlling indoor environments in other ways can also be a highly effective strategy for reducing risk. This includesincreasing ventilation ratesto bring infresh air and filtering existing airto dilute aerosol concentrations. On a personal level, it is helpful to pay attention to the types of interactions that are taking place. For example, many individuals shouting can create a higher risk than one individual speaking. In all cases, it’s important to minimize the amount of time spent indoors with others. The CDC has warned that B.1.1.7 couldbecome the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variantin the U. S. by March. Other fast-spreading variants have also been found inBrazilandSouth Africa. Increased vigilance and complying with health guidelines should continue to be of highest priority.[Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]By Suresh Dhaniyala, Bayard D.

S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled in favor of Texas and eight other conservative states that sued to halt the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides limited protections to about 650,000 people. People who are already enrolled won’t lose protections, but Hanen is barring the approval of any new applications. Hanen’s decision limits the immediate ability of Biden, who pledged during his campaign to protect DACA, to keep the program or something similar in place. His ruling is the second by a federal judge in Texas stopping Biden’s immigration plans, after a court barred enforcement of Biden’s 100-day stay on most deportations. The program has been challenged in court since former President Barack Obama instituted it in June 2012. In Friday’s ruling, Hanen wrote that the states proved “the hardship that the continued operation of DACA has inflicted on them.”He continued: “Furthermore, the government has no legitimate interest in the continuation of an illegally implemented program.”Biden has already proposed legislation that would provide a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people living in the U. S. without authorization. He also ordered agencies to make efforts to preserve the program. Supporters of DACA, including those who argued before Hanen to save it, have said a law passed by Congress is necessary to provide permanent relief. Hanen has said Congress must act if the U. S. wants to provide the protections in DACA to recipients commonly known as “Dreamers.”The House approved legislation in March creating a pathway toward citizenship for “Dreamers,” but the measure has been stalled in the Senate. Immigration advocates hope to include a provision opening that citizenship doorway in sweeping budget legislation Democrats want to approve this year, but it’s unclear whether that language will survive. Hanen’s ruling came after a nearly 3 1/2 hour court hearing Dec. 22 on DACA’s fate. The states argued that Obama never had the authority in 2012 to create DACA because it circumvented Congress. The states also argued that the program drains their educational and health care resources. Suing alongside Texas were Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina, and West Virginia — states that all had Republican governors or state attorneys general.",3,Reliable,0.0042388167388167,0.3487193362193362,543,3,Boston Herald

First, let reporter Alec MacGillis introduce you to “Healthy Holly.”Get this: Baltimore Mayor Cathy Pugh, who sits on the board of the University of Maryland Medical System, sold 20,000 copies of her children's book ""Healthy Holly: Exercising is Fun"" to the hospital.

70,"Google committed “antitrust evils,” colluded with Facebook, new lawsuit says",0.0,44.67,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/new-suits-accuse-google-of-antitrust-evils-collusion-with-facebook/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,19,"Two separate coalitions of states have filed massive antitrust lawsuits against Google in the past 24 hours, alleging that the company abuses its extensive power to force would-be competitors out of the marketplace and harms consumers in the process. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton spearheaded the first suit, which nine other states also signed onto. The second suit is led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, and an additional 36 states and territories signed on. Antitrust law isn't just about a company being an illegal monopoly or even about being the dominant firm in its market sector. Although being a literal monopoly, with no available competition of any kind, can put you on the fast track to investigation, the law has broader concerns. Primarily, antitrust investigations are about—in short, how a company uses its power. If you're a big company because everyone likes your stuff best, well, you're a big company, congratulations. But if you got to be the dominant company by cheating somehow—strong-arming other firms in the supply chain; targeting anticompetitive acquisitions; colluding with other firms to manipulate market conditions, and so on—that's a problem. With that in mind, let's delve into what's going on. You have indeed heard this song before, and recently, too. Both new suits come in the wake of a suit the Justice Department and a group of 11 states—Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas—jointly filed against Googlein October. Three additional states also filed with the court today to join on to the federal case, so a total of 52 attorneys general—representing 49 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia—and the DOJ have now signed on to one or more of the three legal challenges. (Alabama appears to be the remaining state not yet participating in any of the cases at this time.)For the time being, these two new lawsuits are separate and distinct both from the federal case and from each other. However, according to the DOJ, the coalition that filed its suit today also petitioned the court to consolidate the proceedings, so in all likelihood, this will eventually be oneantitrust case. The October suit is surprisingly narrow, considering how many segments of the digital marketplace Google's parent company Alphabet either participates in or dominates. That case focuses almost entirely on Google's search business, which the DOJ alleged the company monopolized illegally for more than a decade through ""exclusionary agreements and anticompetitive conduct."" These both focus on other elements of Google's business. The Texas-led suit (PDF) is focused on the online advertising market. According to that suit, Google uses its control of the advertising ecosystem to block potential competitors from competing in online advertising exchanges and unfairly uses its vertical integration to win realtime advertising auctions.""Google is essentially trading on 'insider information' by acting as the pitcher, catcher, batter, and umpire, all at the same time"" in the online advertising market, Paxtonsaidwhen announcing the suit. ""This isn't the 'free market' at work here. This is anti-market and illegal under state and federal law.""Google entered a series of agreements, codenamed Project Jedi, with other advertising firms to allow it to maintain its market share, the suit alleges. The most eye-popping of those deals is an agreement Google allegedly signed with Facebook in 2018, which ""fixes prices and allocates markets between Google and Facebook as competing bidders in the auctions for publishers' Web display and in-app advertising inventory.""Basically, according to the suit, Facebook in 2017 figured out a way to make money from a new online-advertising bidding system. Google thought that new tactic posed an ""existential threat"" to its own massive slice of the advertising pie and made an agreement with Facebook: Facebook would cut back on the new tech, and Google would give Facebook a big edge in its own advertising auctions. Tactics such as bid rigging and market division areexplicitly, flatly illegalunder antitrust law. ""The Supreme Court has warned that there are such things as antitrust evils,"" the suit begins, alleging that Google is guilty of such, and it ""seeks to ensure that Google won't be evil anymore.""The Colorado-led suit (PDF) focuses on Google's search and search-advertising business, accusing the company of behaving anticompetitively in three key ways. Firstly, the suit argues, Google ""uses its massive financial resources to limit the number of consumers who use a Google competitor."" This holds particularly true in mobile, the suit alleges, which Google dominates entirely. Not only is Google the default search engine on Android, which is a Google product, but the company also pays Applebillions of dollars every yearto be the default search engine on iOS devices as well. Secondly, Google leverages its search-advertising business, SA360, in such a way as to prevent competition from arising, the suit alleges, by prohibiting interoperability with competitors and locking advertisers in. And thirdly, according to the suit, Google ""throttles"" those who try to go around Google to reach sites, products, and services directly. This harms ""specialized vertical providers"" by keeping them from reaching potential customers, especially on mobile. In response to the lawsuits, Google today published alengthy corporate blog postexplaining why Google search is Great, Actually, and should be left alone.""Rigorous testing"" has shown Google that consumers vastly prefer their search results to be chock-full of Google's own modules, wrote Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy. ""We know that if you don't like the results we're giving you, you have numerous alternatives—including Amazon, Expedia, Tripadvisor and many others just a click away.""Amazon, to consumers, is an e-retailer, streaming video company, and digital goods purveyor, not a search engine, and both Expedia and Tripadvisor are specifically for searches related to travel and hospitality, but it is indeed true that they exist. The antitrust lawsuit ""suggests we shouldn't have worked to make Search better and that we should, in fact, be less useful to you,"" Cohen added. ""The claims being made have been closely examined and rejected by regulators and courts around the world, including the US Federal Trade Commission, competition authorities in Brazil, Canada, and Taiwan, and courts in the United Kingdom and Germany, who all agreed that our changes are designed to improve your search results. It's also well established that the most important driver for our search results is the specific query—not your personal data.""Google's claims are accurate but misleading: while the FTC didback away frompursuing major action against Google in 2013, European regulators fined Google a total of more than $9 billion across three years for violating antitrust law: 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in 2017, related tosearch; 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) in 2018, related toAndroid; and 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in 2019, related toAdSense. Regulators in several other nations such asAustralia,Japan, India, and South Korea, are also reviewing Google's competition practices. The potential outcomes of these cases are unclear. We could be looking at the biggest antitrust action in a generation, a giant nothingburger, or anything in between. None of the three cases specifically calls for Google to be broken up, unlike theFacebook antitrust lawsuitsthe feds and states filed last week. That said, they don't exactlyseek breakups either. Instead, the suits are all calling for whatever ""structural relief"" might be deemed necessary alongside all the various fines, penalties, and injunctions against bad behavior they seek. It's going to be a very long, very ugly legal fight, no matter what happens. Even if the cases are consolidated into a single docket, as seems likely, don't be surprised if it takes until 2025 or beyond for the case to wrap once and for all. For comparison, the DOJ filed its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft in May 1998; the court accepted what became the final settlement in November 2002, 4.5 years later.",3,Reliable,0.0556299416836606,0.4687218704160853,1801,3,ARS Technica

Of course, Bongino, as an investor in Parler, has a vested interest in getting people to join these new platforms, where his worldview is welcomed with open arms. But since Bongino isone of Facebook’s top performers, there is little chance that he’ll be giving up a platform where he has 4 million followers any time soon. Despite Bongino’s rather disingenuous pronouncements that people should leave Facebook and Twitter for Parler, it’s clear that there has been a significant spike in users checking out these so-called “free speech networks.” And while these networks don’t pose a danger to the dominance of the mainstream platforms, their growing numbers are creating a right-wing echo chamber where users are exposed to more extremist views and the possibility of being further radicalized. In the wake of the presidential election, Facebook and Twitter have clamped down on election misinformation, leading figures like Bongino, conservative radio host Mark Levin, and Fox News host Sean Hannity to claim that these networks are biased against conservatives, when the reality is that the platforms are simply labeling misleading posts. Conservative voices continue to top lists of the best-performing content. Topping the list of alternative networks is Parler, seen by some as an alternative to Twitter. The Nevada-based company, founded in 2018 by software engineers John Matze and Jared Thomson, announced Thursday that its membership had almost doubled since the election, from 4.5 million to 8 million. This has been driven by figures like Bongino, as well as Levin, and Fox News presenter Maria Bartiromo, who tweeted last week that she was quitting Twitter, and her followers should join her on Parler. A week later, Bartiromo has not quit Twitter, but she now has more followers on Parler (1 million) than she does on Twitter (886,000). As well as offering a home to figures like Alex Jones, who is banned from all mainstream platforms, Parler has become a new hive of activity forthe Stop the Steal movement, as well as QAnon followers. There is also MeWe, seen as an ad-free alternative version of Facebook, that has become a major anti-vaxx forum. It has added a million new users in the last week, the company said. Gab, which has been banned from Apple’s and Google’s app store for hosting extremist content, claimed in an email to users on Wednesday that its traffic for the last week was almost the same as for the entire month of October.“Gab isn’t growing because of ‘celebrity’ endorsements, sponsorships, or big paid advertising budgets, but rather from the most powerful form of advertising on the planet: word of mouth,” Andrew Torba, Gab’s CEO claimed in the email. Finally, Rumble, a conservative alternative to YouTube founded in 2013, has been on a“rocket ship” of growthaccording to its CEO Chris Pavlovski, and its app has been at the top of the app store charts this week. Despite this influx of users, the number of views (sorry, the number of “rumbles”) on the videos on Rumble’s homepage number in the low thousands, compared to the tens of millions of views for videos on YouTube’s homepage. Rumble is not going to replace YouTube any time soon, but it is becoming part of a right-wing echo chamber that helps amplify and reinforce the beliefs its users hold. And that shift is already happening. On Wednesday night, Pavlovski tweeted that for the first time, Parler was now sending more referrals to his website that both Facebook and Twitter combined. In the world of Parler, Gab, MeWe, and Rumble, users who left Facebook and Twitter because their posts about the election being stolen were censored, will find an entirely new world, with ample “evidence” to back up their beliefs. Take, for example, a video posted by MMA star Tito Ortiz that claims to show a “poll worker” in Colorado tearing up a ballot for Trump. The video was actually created by a TikTok user who has admitted on Facebook that the video was a joke. On Parler however, it has been viewed over 1 million times, without any labels from moderators to indicate that the video is fake. The danger of this shift to these smaller platforms is not just that users will have those beliefs reinforced, but that they will be exposed to other ideas, such as those promoted by militia and boogaloo communities, and be further radicalized.“The risk in a mass migration to smaller, fringe platforms is that they do not enforce the same guidelines as older, more established platforms, meaning there is potential for not only echo chambers to form, but for extremist groups to make use of these spaces to organize offline activity or to promote more extreme material and beliefs than they might on larger platforms,” Ciarán O’Connor, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told VICE News. Last week Facebook removed a viral “Stop the Steal” group that gained over 360,000 members in under 34 hours, making one ofthe fastest-growing groups in the platform’s history. But almost immediately,alternative groups with almost identical names appeared up. Now, a week later, new research shows the scale of the problem on the platform. There are now at least 78 public “Stop the Steal” public groups on Facebook, according to extremism researcher Marc-André Argentino. The three biggest groups have 103,000, 52,000, and 10,000 members respectively, and 11 of the groups have generated 1.7 million interactions between them. And this is just the part of the problem that is visible: many of the founders of the original “Stop the Steal” movement have created a private Facebook group, where they continue to spread the kind of misinformation that got the public group shut down. On Wednesday Reuters reported that Facebook and Google were going to extend their political ad bans for another month, a move designed to stop campaigns from spreading misinformation targeted at voters. The report cited an email from Facebook to advertisers in which the company said that “while multiple sources have projected a presidential winner, we still believe it’s important to help prevent confusion or abuse on our platform.”In response, senior adviser to the Biden campaign Megan Clasen blasted Facebook for what she saw as its failure to openly call the election for her employer. So is Facebook failing to say that Biden won the election? Well, no. On Saturday when multiple media outlets called the race for Biden, the company put a notification at the top of Facebook and Instagram that said “Joe Biden is the projected winner of the 2020 US Presidential Election.” And it has also been putting this information in labels alongside posts from President Donald Trump as well as in its Voting Information Center. So what about the letter? “I think there was a little nuance lost in the email sent to advertisers,” one Facebook source told VICE News.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0916649831649831,0.4376575276575276,1561,3,Vice
74,Poll: Most Americans Believe Mail-In Voting Should Be Allowed in 2020 Elections,-11.33,47.33,https://truthout.org/articles/poll-most-americans-believe-mail-in-voting-should-be-allowed-in-2020-elections/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"Voting by mail has become a political issue in this election year, thanks in part to many errant and unverifiable statements by President Donald Trump. But a new poll demonstrates most Americans still trust the practice of voting by mail. Only 31 percent of respondents in a Politico/Morning Consult poll released on Wednesday say the United States shouldn’t allow mail-in voting under the mistaken belief that it “jeopardizes election security” — a likely outcome of viewpoints widely expressed by Trump and others in his campaign over the past several months that voting by mail is rife with fraud. However, the vast majority of respondents in the poll, 58 percent, when asked their opinion about mail-in voting said that it should be allowed to let voters take part in this year’s elections in order to prevent or slow down the spread of coronavirus while Americans exercise their constitutional right to vote. Those who say they belong to or align with the Republican Party are more likely to be wary of mail-in voting, with 57 percent of GOP voters saying they’re against the practice for this year’s races. On the other side, 81 percent of Democratic-leaning voters say the practice should be allowed for anyone with concerns about contracting COVID-19 while trying to cast their votes this year. Every state in the country allows some form of mail-in (or absentee ballot) voting, but not every state this year will allow voters to use a mail-in ballot if their reason for doing so is to prevent exposure to COVID-19 or limit the spread of the disease. Sixteen states require an excuse to obtain an absentee ballot, such as being elderly and unable to make travel arrangements to the polling place, or being out of town on business or vacation and thus, too far away to make it to the polls in their jurisdictions on Election Day. In seven of those states, fear of catching a highly contagious disease like COVID-19 is not yet an acceptable excuse for obtaining absentee ballots. Other polling has shown strong support for allowing “no excuse” absentee ballot voting across the entire nation during the pandemic. A Pew Research poll from last month, for example, found that 65 percent of Americans would favor giving every voter the chance to cast their ballots by mail, even in states that don’t typically allow such exceptions to be recognized. Except for a rare instance this week in which he said that mail-in voting was fine in his home state of Florida, Trump has made several statements since the start of the pandemic in the U. S. warning against the practice, suggesting despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, that voting by mail would invite fraud. Just last week, the president claimed in a tweet that “2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,” adding that consideration for delaying the election should be given “until people can properly, securely and safely vote.”Trump’s messaging on mail-in voting is not consistent with reality — the re’s no evidence of widespread fraud with those ballots — and it also breaks away from the talking points his own campaign is making in swing states, where supporters of the president are actually being encouraged to vote by mail. As far as how Americans view the president’s bogus warnings, the Politico/Morning Consult poll found that most did not agree with him. Just 7 percent of respondents in the poll said that the election should be delayed, while 86 percent said the election should go on as scheduled — with 52 percent saying that most Americans should vote by mail rather than in person.",3,Reliable,0.1068856822190155,0.4891292287958956,758,1,Truthout

FBI vetting -- which is normal for high-security events -- begins by checking social media accounts, looking for connections to extremist groups. Along with reviewing posts, comments and photos ... we're told the feds are using facial recognition software to track the activities of guardsmen and women, specifically searching for photos or videos tying them to radical activities. Our sources say all 21,000+ National Guard members currently in D. C. -- who have come in from all 50 states -- have been scrutinized by facial recognition and other high-tech methods to determine if they had any involvement -- direct or indirect -- in the. As for how that works ... all Guard members were required to take a photo when they showed up in D. C. for duty. We're told that photo is then cross-referenced with security camera footage along with online content to make sure there's no connection to extremist, far-right or fringe groups. Along with the high-tech vetting tricks, our sources say the more common criminal background checks are also conducted ... in order to pick up on any red flags such as arrests or police report mentions. When it's all said and done ... the FBI's goal is obviously to weed out anyone who might not have national security as their top priority while serving with the National Guard. A U.

76,What the megadrought means to the American West,-7.0,44.33,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-the-megadrought-means-to-the-american-west/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"The American West was once seen as a place of endless possibilities: grand vistas, bountiful resources, and cities that somehow grew out of deserts. Now, manifest destiny has become a manifest emergency. A scorching drought made worse by climate change is draining reservoirs at an alarming pace, fueling massive wildfires and deadly heat waves, and withering one of the most important agricultural economies in the country.""I'm really concerned, I'm really worried,"" said Joe Del Bosque, who has been growing melons and other crops in California's Central Valley since 1985. He's weathered droughts before, but nothing quite like this. He showed correspondent Ben Tracy a field of dirt that he's left fallow – there's not enough water to plant a crop here this summer. Tracy asked, ""How much of your land have you left unplanted this year?""""About a third,"" he replied. ""That's significant. If that water doesn't get here, we will start to lose our crops. Some of our crops will probably die.""Del Bosque's water comes from the San Luis Reservoir, which is at just 30% of its capacity. The state has now cut water deliveries to many of its farmers who supply much of the nation's fruits, nuts and vegetables. Del Bosque paid for water he now can't get. Tracy asked, ""I'm sure you talk to your neighbors, to farmers up and down the valley. What are people saying?""""Well, a lot of them are worried, and a lot of them are mad,"" Del Bosque said. ""If we have no water, we can't farm. If we get no water next year, these trees won't get water. They're gonna die.""This devastating drought is not confined to California; it's impacting nearly all of the West. The red and brown colors on this map are what the government calls ""severe and exceptional drought.""""This drought is really bad; it's one of the worst handful of years since the year 800 A. D.,"" said Park Williams, a hydroclimatologist at UCLA. He said this is not just one long, hot dry summer, but what scientists call a ""megadrought.""""This is really the 22nd year of a long drought that began in the year 2000,"" Williams said. He and his colleagues know this from studying the rings on trees, which show how much they grow in any given year. ""The last 22 years actually rank as the driest 22-year period in at least 1,200 years, based on tree ring records,"" Williams said. ""And so, humans now are contending with a water limitation crisis in the West that modern society in this region has not yet had to contend with.""We've long known the limitations of the arid West. In the mid-1800s the U. S. government sent geologist John Wesley Powell to survey the Western U. S. water supply and bring back recommendations. Williams said, ""He warned that the West did not have enough water for a really widespread population. And we kind of bent the rules along the way when we started figuring out how to dam up the Colorado River and divvy it up to the Western states.""Hoover Dam, an engineering marvel, was thought to be a concrete solution. It harnessed the mighty Colorado River, and created Nevada's Lake Mead, still the nation's largest reservoir. This water supply is what made Western cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas possible, and allowed us to create some of the richest farmland in the country. But the predicted water supply from the Colorado River was based on 20 abnormally wet years at the beginning of the last century. Now, 40 million people in seven states depend on it.""We did it. We built it. We've become reliant on it,"" said Pat Mulroy, the former head of the Southern Nevada Water Authority. ""So, we have to deal with what we have.""Tracy met Mulroy on the shores of Lake Mead, which has sunk to its lowest level ever. In the year 2000, the water came right up to the top of Hoover Dam. During the megadrought, the lake has dropped more than 140 feet.""When it loses this much water, to me that is an enormous wakeup call,"" Mulroy said. Next month the federal government is expected to make an unprecedented decision: declaring a first-ever shortage on the river, triggering cuts to the water supply in Arizona and Nevada that will cost some farmers 25% of their water.""It's a tipping point,"" Mulroy said. ""It's an existential issue for Arizona, for California, for Nevada. It is a river system and a water supply that cannot fail.""Tracy asked, ""Without this, are places like Phoenix and Las Vegas and Los Angeles possible?""""No, absolutely not. They're not possible. At the end of the day, this is gone, and those cities and that economic base is in dire jeopardy.""What the West needs more than anything is snow. Snowpack in the mountains melts throughout the summer and flows into reservoirs.""In the West, snow is like our battery; it's where we store water,"" said J. T Reager, a water scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""Now, we're getting less snow. The snow season is markedly shorter.""""Is this something that is caused by climate change or something that's just made worse by climate change?""""I think it's something that's definitely made worse by climate change,"" Reager said. Climate change is making the West hotter and drier, which means more rain than snow is falling, and much of that is evaporating.""Over the long-term, what we're seeing with our satellite data is a picture of continual drying,"" Reager said. A NASA satellite is documenting the loss of water stored in the mountains, reservoirs, and underground aquifers. ""These are some images that we've taken from the satellite mission from April 2010, 2015 and 2021, showing this steady drying progression of water in the West,"" Reager said.""Given how severe this drought is,"" asked Tracy, ""how long would it take to recover from something like this?""""We would need a solid decade of really wet years, which is probably just not gonna happen,"" he replied. Joe Del Bosque has already let 70 of his farm workers go, and isn't sure how long his farm will survive if the drought drags on. Tracy asked, ""If you were starting all over, knowing what you know about this climate now, would you do this?""""I don't know,"" he replied. ""It was like a dream for me to be able to do this. Because I was the son of farm workers. I have a lot of people that depend on me. There's hundreds of people working in the fields, picking melons, that are people just like my ancestors, that came here, worked hard to try to make a living for their kids, so their kids could go to college like I did. And this is gonna end their dream, too.""",3,Reliable,0.0245897984662029,0.458828250401284,1552,3,CBS News
77,Tulsa Church Ledger Preserves Stories of Faith After Historic Massacre,0.0,43.33,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/june/tulsa-massacre-ame-church-book-redemption-museum-bible-pres.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-01,25,"The book might look like it’s just a list of names and numbers, but Robert Richard Allen Turner, pastor of Vernon African Methodist Episcopal Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, knows it’s more than that.“It’s a ledger of our history that we still need to know today,” Turner said. “It’s a story of faith and folks who had faith in God.”The city of Tulsa will pause on June 1 to remember the 100th anniversary of a racial massacre. In 1921, white Oklahomans killed hundreds of Black people and completely destroyed a prosperous Black community. When the violence ebbed, Greenwood Avenue—the heart of what was then called America’s Black Wall Street—was rubble. The mob haddestroyedfour hotels, two newspapers, eight doctor’s offices, seven barbershops, half a dozen real estate agencies, and half a dozen churches. One of the Black houses of worship that was damaged was the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, located then at307 N. Greenwood. The only thing left of the AME was the basement, and it too had been badly damaged. But the church decided to rebuild, and it kept a ledger of all the people who pledged to help and the money they contributed to the cause. When Turner looks at that book, he thinks of the biblical genealogies and the Book of Numbers, where God told Moses to write down the names of the people who assisted him and to count and record the names of the people who had escaped bondage in Egypt and the descendants who went through the wilderness to the Promised Land.“It’s not considered to be one of the sexier, more quoted [parts] of the Bible,” Turner said, “but the history of the genealogy in the Book of Numbers shows you the history of the people.”What the Book of Numbers was to the Israelites, theis to the congregation of Vernon AME Church. When Turner took the position at Vernon, the book was old and decayed, though. He stuck it in a Tupperware container in an attempt to protect it from further damage. It might have stayed there if not for a special visit to the church on Juneteenth in 2020 by Oklahoma’s First Lady Sarah Stitt. During the tour, Turner showed Stitt the book and told her the story of the people whose names were written in it.“She just immediately became overwhelmed by the story of faith of the individuals who had just lost their homes, just lost their businesses,” Turner said. “Some of them lost their loved ones and friends in the race massacre in 1921, but yet they came back to the church.”The story stuck with Stitt, and she reached out to the Museum of the Bible to see if they could help Vernon restore the book. The answer was yes. Anthony Schmidt, senior curator for the Museum of the Bible, said he and the staff at the Oklahoma City headquarters were instantly captivated by the story of the church and the. They met with Stitt and Turner in late July 2020 to discuss the project. In August, they began what would become an eight-month restoration project involving 15 people.“It was in rough condition,” Schmidt said. “The cover was warped, and the leather that was originally on the cover had gone from a rich red to a brownish color, and it was flaking off and disintegrating.”The binding for the book was torn in places, and some of the pages had tears and were falling out.“When we first saw it, we knew this was going to take a little bit of time and a little bit of effort to restore it fully,” Schmidt said. Conservator Francisco Rodriquez led the project: meticulously taking the book apart, repairing pages, cleaning mold, and stitching it back together again. Turner had expressed his desire to see as much of the original preserved as possible, and Rodriguez did his best to honor that.“What Francisco was able to do was save large portions of the original cover but also place them on top of a new leather cover that was close to the original color it would have looked like back in the 1930s,” Schmidt explained. “You get to see the cover that survived to today but also what it would have looked like back in the day.”In addition to restoring the original, the Museum of the Bible made a replica so that people will be able to look at and study the book without handling the original and adding any more wear and tear.“Generations to come will be able to look at this book and study it and learn about the history of this church,” Schmidt said. Schmidt said he was personally touched when he read the donations listed in the book. Some donations are large for the time—$50 or $100. But other gifts are smaller—50 cents or a dollar. To him, those represent the biggest hearts.“These were individuals who didn’t have a lot of money but they had a lot of faith and they had a lot of love for this community, and they wanted to see it rebuilt and wanted to see it thrive like it had,” he said. “That’s just inspiring.”When Schmidt hears Turner speak of the work that the church is doing today, including raising money for feeding the hungry during the pandemic, he can’t help but think of the 360 names in the ledger and the families they represented.“The hope and perseverance you see demonstrated in this ledger allowed the church to thrive and enabled it to serve the needs of the community for generations after,” he said. Turner said he couldn’t be happier with the finished product and is grateful to be able to have it on display at the church for the 100th anniversary of the massacre on June 1 and for many years to come.",3,Reliable,0.153302109767627,0.4390288351495248,1208,3,Christianity Today
78,EastEnders’ police plot is the perfect soap timebomb for Callum and Ben,0.0,36.67,https://www.radiotimes.com/news/soaps/eastenders/2020-11-20/eastenders-callum-ben-police-timebomb-comment/,https://adfontesmedia.com/radio-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-20,15,"Viewers have become frustrated over the endless amount of turmoil the poor man is facing, willing it to be over. But the storyline has its advantages, acting as a catalyst for issues that have yet to be dealt with and providing an intriguing backdrop for other characters. In order to secure his boyfriend Ben Mitchell’s freedom, Callum reluctantly agreed to investigate Ben’s dad Phil (Steve McFadden). The young rookie therefore decided to gain Phil’s trust by using his role in the police to help with his dodgy dealings - making him something of a double agent. Who would have thought the notorious hardman could be fooled so easily?We've got spoilers, gossip and exclusive interviews for you. It’s a complex format, but there are so many elements that make Callum’s dilemma the perfect soap timebomb. He has become a beloved character, so just the presence of the intimidating DI Thompson (played by Philip Wright) is enough to make the audience seethe. The love story between Callum and Ben is also central to proceedings. The couple’s romance has a huge fan following, making them a constant talking point. Ben and Callum’s popularity both individually and as a unit makes them a compelling watch in any scenario; so however viewers feel about recent developments, they will still be tuning in. The role reversal between the characters has been a welcome change of pace. After a year of lies rolling easily off Ben’s tongue, it’s Callum’s turn to be deceitful - even if he has been forced into it and it’s all Ben’s fault in the first place! Giving Callum his own story is equally important, after several months as a supporting character. His alter ego’s impossible situation has placed actor Tony Clay right in the middle of the drama, with the strong performances he has always delivered now taking centre stage. There is an edge to the character that we may not have discovered if the soap had taken the easier route and had Callum remain as the moral compass. Still, alongside his treacherous behaviour, Callum attempts to put Ben first at every stage. He has made the very same choice that has plagued Ben throughout their relationship: his boyfriend, or his loyalty to Phil. Actor Max Bowden (Ben) recently suggested that the current plot could finally solve that problem for his character. So perhaps it could put an end to the main points of conflict for ‘Ballum’, allowing for a healthier dynamic in the long term. The twists also make the Mitchells’ repetitive criminal activities much more interesting. A heist or scam is more common in this family than a downpour of rain in Walford; so it’s refreshing to add something new with Callum’s involvement. Taking the focus off Phil and Ben’s latest great escape, EastEnders dropped another cliffhanger in the form of newbie thief Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), who threatened to take Ben down with him unless Callum let him go. The blackmail angle may seem overused; but bringing in such an unlikely character was a clever choice that put a different spin on events. If there’s one thing we weren’t expecting to see, it was Callum debating whether to arrest nice guy Kush! We are constantly being surprised and left in suspense - which serves to prove how inventive the scriptwriters have been. This week has seen the pressure mount further for Callum; and as exasperating as it can be to watch, he needs to be pushed to the limit so that the stakes are raised even higher. Concluding the storyline before that point would be premature, and the show is sure to have more shocks on the way. It has already been hinted that PC Highway will reach breaking point in the coming weeks. The pay-off will be worth it as an explosive aftermath is guaranteed once the bombshell drops. Every outcome has disaster written all over it, even if it does ultimately lead to changes for the better - and EastEnders will continue to captivate us while we wait.

80,Former Obama Ethics Chief: Hunter Biden Art-Selling Arrangement ‘Perfect Mechanism for Funneling Bribes’,7.67,37.0,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/former-obama-ethics-chief-hunter-biden-art-selling-arrangement-perfect-mechanism-for-funneling-bribes/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"During an appearance on CNN on Friday, former Obama-era Office of Government Ethics chief Walter Shaub called the White House’s arrangement allowing Hunter Biden to sell his art “the perfect mechanism for funneling bribes” to the president. Shaub’s statement comes amid the development that the White House crafted a deal under which the price tags of Hunter Biden’s artwork sales, some listing as high as $500,000, will be obscured from the artist to prevent ethical violations. Per the contract, New York gallery owner Georges Bergès will set the prices for the art and also will conceal related records such as prospective bidders and buyers. Bergès has promised to refuse extraordinary offers far exceeding the asking price or those that he deems suspect, sources first told the Washington Post. The president’s son’s art sale, expected to be held this fall, has been subject to criticism amid concerns that the market he’s dabbling in has a reputation for corruption and shady business activity.“They have outsourced government ethics to an art dealer. She mentioned industry standards,” Shaub said in reference to comments by White House press secretary Jen Psaki. “It’s an industry that’s notorious for money laundering. There’s no standards in that industry,” he said during the interview.“The idea that they’re going to flag any overly priced offers — well, this is art that hasn’t even been juried into a community art sale. How are they going to decide what’s unreasonable when they’ve already priced it in the range of $75,000 to $500,000 for a first outing? This is just preposterous and very disappointing,” the Obama official said. Psaki said during a press briefing Friday that Biden has every right to pursue a new career like any other previous president’s child. She said the White House’s appointing itself the intermediary in the arrangement would help the Biden family avoid running afoul of ethics concerns. Shaub disputed that. When asked for his opinion on the White House decision, Shaub replied, “They’ve absolutely made it worse, for two reasons. One: What they’ve done is ensure that neither you nor I nor anyone watching this show will know who buys the art unless they share it publicly.“There’s nothing we can do to monitor to make sure that Hunter Biden or anyone in the White House doesn’t find out that the dealer keeps his or her promise, that the buyers don’t call the White House, ask for a meeting, and say ‘Hey, I just bought the president’s son’s art for $500,000,'” he added. Ethics experts have contended that Hunter Biden’s artwork wouldn’t have had the enormous price tag if not for his last name and family connection to the sitting executive. They have suggested that the buyers of his creations are unlikely to be real art-appreciating connoisseurs or collectors but rather individuals looking to purchase clout, preferential treatment, and influence.“It’s got the absolute appearance that he’s profiting off his father’s fame. He’s not selling under a pseudonym, he’s not waiting until his father’s out of office, and he’s not selling at any price comparable to what other first-time artists are selling,” Shaub said.“The problem is, now they’ve set a precedent for the next president. And even if you happen to trust Joe Biden, what if the next president has the character of a Donald Trump? This would be a perfect mechanism for funneling bribes to that president,” the former ethics head concluded. Hunter Biden is already entrenched in a number of scandals and investigations, including one into his allegedly falsifying a firearm application form, his foreign business dealings, and his tax filings.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0525782172373081,0.3791748655385019,827,2,National Review
81,Black People Are 3 Times More Likely to Experience Pulse Oximeter Errors,-4.0,46.67,https://heavy.com/news/black-people-pulse-oximeter-errors/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,21,"GettyA pulse oximeter measures a person’s blood oxygen saturation level and heart rate. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have purchased small devices calledpulse oximetersfor use in their home – based on well-intentioned recommendations from health care providers and the media. Pulse oximeters are devices, usually placed on a person’s finger, used to noninvasively measure oxygen levels in the blood. Clinics and hospitals, for example, use them regularly to screen newborns for heart defects after birth. Yet pulse oximeter measurements are imperfect, particularly for Black patients. Our recent paper demonstrated that Black patients werethree times more likely than white patients to have low oxygen levels that were missed by pulse oximeters. That could translate into as many as 1 in 10 inaccurate readings among Blacks. We areICUphysiciansandinternistswith expertise in health care research and policy. Our findings were guided by our personal experiences engaging with communities of color during the pandemic and seeing firsthand how easy it is for racial bias to affect health care. Low blood oxygen levels are harmful to patients and can indicate that they are seriously ill. Clinicians frequently use pulse oximetry measurements to decide whether a patient should receive oxygen therapy and how much oxygen a patient should receive. Health care workers may also use this information when deciding what type of care a patient needs, such as admission to a hospital, transfer to an intensive care unit or need for a ventilator. Pulse oximeters came on the market in the late 1970s and seemed to meet the need for an accurate measure of oxygen levels. Pulse oximetersuse light that passes through the skin to measure oxygen levels. Blood with higher oxygen levels absorbs light differently than blood with lower oxygen levels. However, anything that slows the passage of this light, like nail polish or skin tone, can cause inaccuracies. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic we started to recognize that these measurements seemed to be inaccurate for Black patients. Our study confirmed those suspicions, for example finding that sometimes when a pulse oximeter read 94%, the actual blood level of oxygen was much lower. A normal oxygen saturation is above 92%. Oxygen therapy is typically started when oxygen levels are consistently below 89%. In our study, we identified patients who had normal oxygen levels by pulse oximetry (between 92% and 96%) but low oxygen levels by blood oxygen testing (less than 89%). If low oxygen levels in Black patients are missed because of inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, Black patients may be less likely to receive appropriate oxygen therapy or other medical care when they need it. Some people with COVID-19 infection were encouraged to purchase pulse oximeters to monitor their oxygen levels at home as a tool to decide whether hospitalization was needed. These inexpensive home pulse oximetersmay be even less accuratethan the hospital pulse oximeters used in our study. The extent to which biased pulse oximetersmay have delayed appropriate treatmentfor Black patients is unknown. It is also unclear just how these inaccuracies might affect other medical conditions whereracial disparities in medical carehave been previously identified. Thefirst pulse oximeterwas developed in 1974. However, because early designers did not use a diverse group of test subjects, sources of error, like skin tone, were underrecognized. Today’s pulse oximeters might be better than the ones from the 1970s – the FDA requires all medical technology to be tested on a diverse population of patients, based on age, gender and skin tone. However, the agency defines skin tone diversity by havingat least two “darkly pigmented” individualsin the entire testing sample. Our study shows today’s pulse oximeters are still not good enough and that the agency’s guidelines for diverse testing remain insufficient. A study fromthe late 1980sbegan to show that pulse oximeters might be inaccurate based on skin tone, and aseriesofpublicationsin the 1990s seemed to confirm these findings. Yet 40 years later, these findings have not been widely publicized, were not thoroughly investigated with additional clinical studies and are not routinely a part of medical school curricula at this time. Pulse oximetry will remain an important tool for clinicians, and our findings highlight the need to consider pulse oximetry data in the context of other information related to the patient. However, there are no other straightforward and noninvasive ways to estimate oxygen levels. Feeling short of breathpoorly correlateswith oxygen levels; skin findings, such ascyanosis, may be more difficult to identify in individuals with darker skin tones; and using other locations of the body to measure oxygen levels noninvasively (like the ear) may not produce more accurate results than the finger. An alternative strategy might be to perform more invasive measurements of oxygen level, such as sampling arterial blood. However, arterial blood draws are painful andcan lead to complications. They are also inconvenient and require specialized training. Requiring arterial blood for accurate measurements in Black patients but not white patients simply propagates a different form of racial bias. Medical technology developers should increase the number and diversity of test subjects, with device performance compared across groups to ensure the equity of their accuracy. In addition, prior testing was conducted only among healthy subjects, and our study suggests inaccuracies may be more prominent as oxygen levels decrease. Diversity, in this case, should include a range of patients, based on age, gender, skin tone, and disability. Our recent conversations with device manufacturers suggest that engineering solutions may already be available. However, once new technologies are available, replacing legacy pulse oximeters with more accurate devices will be difficult, given the ubiquity of existing pulse oximeters and the expense associated with purchasing new devices. Health care providers and patient advocacy groups will need to demand updated technology when it becomes available. Recognizing this now may lead to improvements in medical technology, better medical care for Black patients, and greater recognition ofstructural racism within medicine.[Subscribe to The Conversation’s new science newsletter.]By Thomas Valley, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,;Michael Sjoding, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,University of Michigan Medical School, andSusan Dorr Goold, Professor of Internal Medicine and Health Management and Policy,University of Michigan Medical SchoolThis article is republished from The Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

Although Constitutional Carry is currently stalled due to several problematic amendments attached to HB 1927, another measure that would eliminate the fee for acquiring a License to Carry waspassedby the Texas Senate on May 14, 2021 by a vote of 18 to 12. State Senator Joan Huffman is the author of Senate Bill 2247. SB 2247 modifies Texas’scurrent law, which requires individuals to possess an LTC to carry a handgun in public. Daniel Friend of The Texanhighlightedwhat the LTC acquisition process looks like:The fees for the test can go up to $60 and fingerprint fees usually cost $10. On top of that, Texans must pay a $40 fee to submit an LTC application. Previously, the application costs for LTCs were $140. This changed in 2017, when the state legislature approved legislation that lowered the fee to $40. Now, if the House approves the bill, the application fee will be lifted. Overall, the 87th session of the Texas State Legislature has a lot of promise for Second Amendment related issues. Nevertheless, conservative activists cannot afford to be complacent. They must continue pressuring their elected officials and letting them know that not passing legislation that the grassroots base desires will come with negative consequences throughout the Republican primaries in 2022.

83,House Speaker Michael Madigan says it’s not ‘ethically improper’ to find government jobs for people. Here’s what he’s failing to mention.,7.0,49.33,https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-speaker-madigan-com-ed-patronage-scandal-letter-20201002-6wsggdldbrbfjezdtkob4q7ro4-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-10-02,25,"For years, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan has defended his aggressive push to land political allies and their friends and family on taxpayer-funded payrolls, but rarely has he waxed as philosophically about it as he did last week in a three-page letter. Facing intense pressure from a federal investigation into ComEd’s bribes-for-favors scandal and an invitation from a House corruption committee to tell the public what he knows, Madigan’s missive broke two months of near silence. The powerful speaker loudly proclaimed his innocence and tried to reframe his penchant for patronage hiring as a virtue. Not only is “helping people find jobs not a crime,” Madigan wrote, it’s not even “ethically improper” for politicians to make job recommendations. “To the contrary, I believe that it is part of my duties as a community and political leader to help good people find work — from potential executives to college interns, and more,” wrote the 78-year-old Illinois Democratic Party chairman, alluding to some of the very jobs that prosecutors brought up in charging ComEd with crimes. “What an employer chooses to do with that recommendation rests solely with their discretion.” What Madigan didn’t mention when discussing the numerous jobs he’s secured for people during more than 50 years in politics is how that practice has benefited him and what it’s cost taxpayers and electricity ratepayers. The Tribune has spent the last decade chronicling how it works: Patronage jobs are the lifeblood of Madigan’s political organization. And the people Madigan recommends be hired often serve as foot soldiers on the campaigns for the very legislative seats that allow the speaker to stay in power. In turn, that control of the House is key to helping Madigan bring in clients at his law firm, which handles high-dollar property tax appeals on some of Chicago’s biggest buildings. Starting in 2010, the Tribune published the “The Madigan Rules,” a first-of-its-kind, yearslong investigation that exposed how the speaker built his political empire and law practice, revealing how those two careers repeatedly intersected. The report found that in some cases Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients, though the speaker said his “personal code of conduct” ensured he maintained “high ethical standards.” In 2013, the legislature’s watchdog investigated Madigan’s role in a Metra scandal after the commuter rail agency’s the n-executive director contended he was muscled out for not acceding to the speaker’s patronage demands. More recently, Madigan even answered questions about patronage under oath in what he said was his first-ever deposition. During testimony as part of a lawsuit, Madigan made clear he knows the finer points of his vaunted patronage army. Beyond that, the current ComEd probe has put under the spotlight another practice that’s gone on at the Capitol under Madigan: the cycle of House Democratic staffers and friendly lawmakers who leave and the n land a hefty stable of lobbying clients in part based on their perceived access to the speaker. Those lobbyists often become part of a campaign fundraising network that provides money to help Madigan-backed candidates. Though they’re not drawing a government salary, those lobbyists also contribute to the policies enacted in Springfield that affect the pockets of taxpayers. The speaker has not been charged in the ComEd case. He has denied wrongdoing. “As I have said before, I have done nothing wrong,” Madigan wrote in his letter, which explained why he would not appear before the House panel looking at the ComEd scandal. “I believe that (the federal) investigation, once all of the facts are made available to the public, will demonstrate that I have not engaged in any improper conduct.” Speaker’s playbook. While the ComEd investigation represents the gravest threat Madigan has faced to his reign, it’s not the first time his government and political operation has come under public scrutiny. In its investigative series, the Tribune reported that public records showed Madigan’s law firm in 2008 represented 45 of the 150 most valuable downtown buildings ? more than twice what the closest rival represented. Some clients said it’s not that simple to separate the expert tax assistance the firm provides from the political reputation of the man whose name is on the door. At that time, Madigan ally Joe Berrios sat in judgment over property tax appeals that Madigan’s firm filed. Berrios doubled as a state lobbyist, plying his trade inside a Capitol where Madigan held sway. In 2010, Madigan helped Berrios get elected county assessor, giving him power over how all property is valued for property tax purposes. Madigan’s firm did well on appeals when Berrios was assessor. The Tribune also found Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients. As a public official, he got a private road behind a shopping mall repaved, helped secure state funding for an expanded tollway interchange and intervened for a developer looking for state cash. In each case, Madigan was a private lawyer for businesspeople who stood to benefit. Madigan said there were no conflicts of interest in the Tribune’s findings, which he described as “strained attempts to link my legislative actions to clients of the firm who might remotely and incidentally ‘benefit’ from such action.” In 2012, the Tribune reported on how a large operator of assisted living homes signed on with Madigan’s law firm and found itself with several Springfield wins. Nursing homes, pharmacies and other assisted living companies in recent years all have hired the property tax law firm where Madigan is the rainmaker-in-chief. As speaker, Madigan made decisions affecting the fortunes of many companies that put money in his pocket, the Tribune found. Madigan said he abides by a written personal code of conduct to avoid conflicts on matters involving clients. In addition, the Tribune in 2014 documented more than 400 current or retired state and local government employees who worked elections for Madigan, donated regularly to his campaign funds, registered voters for him or circulated candidate petitions on his behalf. The investigation also found repeated instances in which Madigan took personal action to get them jobs, promotions or raises. From the ranks of those workers, Madigan built the most potent ground game in Illinois politics, which he has used to influence elections in every corner of the state, especially state House races. One of those political workers, Raymond Nice, had a six-figure job at the Cook County recorder of deeds office and later briefly was appointed to a county employee panel. More recently, prosecutors alleged that Nice was designated a subcontractor and had payments funneled to him through a ComEd lobbyist. Nice did little or no work, prosecutors said. Metra scandal. That look at Madigan’s patronage army was spurred by a scandal at Metra over whether the speaker went a step too far in trying to exert his clout as he navigated the intersection of public business and ward-style patronage through his Chicago office and Illinois Capitol suite. Metra CEO Alex Clifford contended his tenure was shortened because he didn’t bow to Madigan’s patronage demands. According to Clifford, the speaker wanted Metra to give a raise to a 13th Ward acolyte who was a labor relations specialist and secure a job for another person who was not identified. Clifford refused. In the end, he walked away with a severance package worth up to $871,000 — a controversy that ended up with public hearings. “I thought it was an ethical and moral character flaw,” Clifford testified about Madigan’s actions. A secret 2014 watchdog report obtained by the Tribune concluded that “insufficient evidence” existed to say Madigan violated the state ethics act or other related laws in the Metra scandal. But Thomas Homer, the legislative inspector general at the time, issued a statement noting that “a decision to close an investigation based on insufficient evidence does not constitute a Good Housekeeping seal of approval or a best practices award.” Madigan, who requested the Metra investigation at the height of the scandal, was quoted in the report as speaking highly of one operative the speaker backed for a promotion. “You can understand that there are many people that are involved with me and campaigns and community service. Among these many people, some are better than others. (He) happens to be one of those who is better than others,” the speaker is said to have told Homer. The report also highlighted how Metra’s the n-board chair once entered Madigan’s Capitol office totalk about government issues and left with a yellow Post-it note bearing the names of two workers the speaker wanted to see promoted — moves the board chair later told the Tribune she didn’t make. And the report outlined how Clifford recalled a similar meeting in which a the n-Metra lobbyist with strong Madigan ties was spotted carrying two resumes out of Madigan’s office. In his report, Homer wrote that the proximity of Madigan’s discussions first about government issues and the n shifting to his favored employees “created the impression among Metra officials that the speaker’s support for Metra’s legislative initiatives may be linked.” “While this may not have been the speaker’s intention,” Homer wrote, “the natural inferences to be drawn by Metra officials should have been obvious.” ComEd probe. Long ago, Madigan learned the ways of Chicago-style patronage under his mentor the late Mayor Richard J. Daley. Since the n, Madigan has made so many inroads that at least one pocket of government has earned a nickname in his honor. At the city’s Streets and Sanitation Department’s bureau of electricity, Madigan enjoyed such success in placing people that the agency became known as “Madigan Electric.” That nickname has taken on a different context as the speaker has been linked to the ComEd scandal. ComEd has admitted in federal court that it sought to influence legislation in Springfield by arranging for jobs and vendor subcontracts for Madigan’s political allies, approved lobbyists and ward operatives even in instances where they performed little or no work. For instance, ComEd allegedly agreed in May 2018 to pay $5,000 a month to retiring 23rd Ward Ald. Mike Zalewski, an ally from Madigan’s Southwest Side sphere of political influence, as part of a “roster” of Madigan associates. Former Ald. Frank Olivo, who represented Madigan’s 13th Ward power base for years, is among those identified as getting a ComEd subcontract. Victor Reyes, the speaker’s onetime ally, a former political operative for Mayor Richard M. Daley and founder of the now-defunct patronage army the Hispanic Democratic Organization, is in a law firm identified as receiving ComEd legal contracts. The deal was set to shrink, but Reyes talked to a Madigan ally to try to save it from the chopping block, according to federal court records and testimony from a ComEd official. One 2019 meeting involving ComEd officials described matter-of-factly how Madigan had named people for decades to hold lower-ranking power company jobs, such as meter readers ? what one speaker ally called part of an “old-fashioned patronage system,” according to federal authorities. As part of an agreement with prosecutors, ComEd is paying a $200 million fine, the largest ever at Chicago’s federal courthouse. In exchange, federal authorities will drop a charge of bribery against ComEd after three years if the power company cooperates. The federal filings on ComEd also include allegations of Madigan clout involving an individual who was well-versed in the speaker’s ways. Juan Ochoa, the former head of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, told the Tribune for a 2014 story that Madigan called him to request a raise for the daughter of a former state senator who once represented Madigan’s Southwest Side neighborhood. Ochoa said the daughter was a hard worker who deserved a raise, and she got it after Madigan’s call. “I didn’t feel like he was putting a gun to me but, the n again, he is the speaker of the House,” Ochoa explained at the time. “This was someone who is important to the speaker of the House, who to a great extent controlled our legislation and funding.” These days, federal prosecutors have alleged that in 2017, Madigan sought to appoint Ochoa to ComEd’s board of directors. The request was made by longtime ComEd lobbyist and Madigan confidant Michael McClain to the n-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, prosecutors said. Pramaggiore received internal company resistance and asked McClain if Madigan would be satisfied if she secured a $78,000 part-time job for Ochoa rather than the board seat, but McClain said the speaker would appreciate if she’d “keep pressing,” according to court documents. Around September 2018, having been elevated to an executive post with Exelon, Pramaggiore allegedly reassured McClain: “You take good care of me and so does our friend (meaning Madigan), and I will do the best that I can to, to take care of you.” Ochoa was appointed in April 2019, but he is no longer on ComEd’s board. Madigan’s ties to the ComEd scandal were on display on two fronts this week. In Chicago, former ComEd executive Fidel Marquez, who oversaw lobbying efforts, pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy for participating in a long-running jobs scheme designed to influence Madigan’s legislative decisions. In Springfield, Democrats and Republicans in the House debated whether the speaker conducted himself in a manner unbecoming of a lawmaker. The proceedings were part of an evenly split Special Investigative Committee, one that the nation’s longest-serving legislative leader dismisses as a Republican “stunt” to get free media coverage before the November election. Democrats rejected Republican attempts to subpoena Madigan, Marquez and a lineup of the speaker’s associates who allegedly benefited from jobs and contracts. Madigan’s letter to the committee loomed large at a hearing, where House Republican leader Jim Durkin maintained Democrats would have to disregard ComEd’s admissions to believe the speaker “didn’t know what was going on around him.” In his letter, though, Madigan maintained that ComEd’s agreement with federal prosecutors “does not attribute any misconduct to me. It asserts that certain individuals at ComEd hired individuals I purportedly recommended in an attempt to influence me. But let be me clear: that attempt was never made known to me — if it had been, it would have been profoundly unwelcome.” Under oath. What does Madigan look for when he makes a job recommendation? A Madigan deposition the Tribune first disclosed last year gave a few clues. He acknowledged giving recommendations on behalf of a number of members of his 13th Ward organization for government jobs, ranging from the offices of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to Cook County’s circuit court clerk. Madigan knew the whereabouts of his troops so well that when he was asked about a policy analyst at City Hall, the speaker recalled that person, a member of his ward organization, had switched over to a job at a different government agency. “I recommended him to the (Chicago Housing Authority),” Madigan testified. And he was hired, an attorney asked? “He was hired.” Madigan also had a recommendation to replace the retiring Zalewski in the neighboring 23rd Ward seat when the alderman left the City Council: state Rep. Silvana Tabares. Who did you talk to, the speaker was asked? “Rahm Emanuel,” Madigan said. The the n-mayor appointed Tabares to the seat. At another point, Madigan was pressed on whether it is his standard practice to recommend precinct captains for positions in various levels of government. “You can understand that many people come to me asking for recommendations for employment, and I render recommendations for employment in both the private and the public sector. I do it in both. But the re’s a test that people have to meet,” he replied. “They have to be, to my knowledge, they have to be honest, hardworking people with integrity. And if they are, I’ll recommend to a potential employer the best of my knowledge and my experience with this person, this would be a good worker for your office, a good worker for your business whatever it may be.”",3,Reliable,0.1200093632958801,0.3923074865209695,3517,3,Chicago Tribune

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blasted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following the suspension of U. S. sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson, who tested positive for THC — a chemical compound found in marijuana — during a drug test at the recent U. S. Olympic trials. Ocasio-Cortez called on the IOC to “reconsider its suspension” of Richardson, as well as any other similarly “penalized” athletes, arguing that the criminalization of cannabis is an “instrument” of policies related to racism and colonialism.“The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “The IOC should reconsider its suspension of Ms. Richardson and any athletes penalized for cannabis use. This ruling along w/ IOC denial of swim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.”The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy. The IOC should reconsider its suspension of Ms. Richardson and any athletes penalized for cannabis use. This ruling along w/ IOC denial of swim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)July 2, 2021AstheNew York Postnoted, “Following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) relaxed the threshold for what constitutes a positive marijuana test from 15 nanograms per milliliter to 150 nanograms per milliliter in an effort to detect use during competition rather than in the days and weeks before.”“However, marijuana remains on WADA’s list of prohibited substances, with THC — the chemical Richardson tested positive for — classified as a so-called ‘Substance of Abuse’ along with cocaine, ecstasy and heroin due to their use in society outside of a competitive context,” the Post added. Despite Ocasio-Cortez’s claims, colonialism was actually a driving factor behind the cultivation of cannabis. Indeed, one of the three primary crops George Washington grew at Mount Vernon was hemp. It wasn’t until the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 that cannabis products were required to be accurately labeled, which then opened the door to regulation and criminalization. While Ocasio-Cortez issomewhat accuratewhen it comes to racist elements of the history of cannabis criminalization, the argument that the IOC is therefore racist is arguably unfounded, given that it is applied to all athletes, regardless of race.“The rules are clear, but this is heartbreaking on many levels; hopefully, her acceptance of responsibility and apology will be an important example to us all that we can successfully overcome our regrettable decisions, despite the costly consequences of this one to her,”saidUSADA CEO Travis T. Tygart of Richardson’s suspension. Indeed, Richardson herself did not make any accusation of racism against the IOC.“Honestly, I just want to apologize for my actions,” Richardsonsaid. “I know what I did. I know what I’m supposed to do, I’m allowed not to do, and I still made that decision. Not making any excuse, or looking for any empathy in my case.”“At the Olympic trials, Richardson ran the 100 meters in 10.86 seconds, even though she informed the world after the race that her biological mother had passed away the week before,”The Daily Wire’sJoe Morgan reported. “Richardson admitted to using marijuana in order to cope with the loss.”“We all have our different struggles, we all have our different things we deal with.

85,Nurses question hospitals’ claims they’re contracting coronavirus in the community instead of at work,-4.33,48.33,https://www.cleveland.com/coronavirus/2020/12/nurses-question-hospitals-claims-theyre-contracting-coronavirus-in-the-community-instead-of-at-work.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,18,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – Over the past several months, hospitals have repeatedly said contact tracing shows the doctors, nurses and other health care workers who’ve acquired COVID-19 are largely being infected through community spread. Leaders from the Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth and University Hospitals made those assertions during a Nov. 16 news briefing where they announced that hundreds of health care workers and other hospital employeeswere sidelined due to the virus. The claim has also been repeated by leaders from other Ohio hospitals who’ve appeared at Gov. Mike DeWine’s coronavirus briefings. Yet those assertions have puzzled and disheartened nurses who are at the front lines of the pandemic. They question how hospitals can pinpoint where they acquired a virus that is so widespread, and they contend it’s just as likely they were infected while treating COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, nurses feel that suggesting they’re getting the virus through community spread insinuates they’re being careless once they’re off the clock.“Every time someone from a hospital is talking, they seem to want to throw in that this is all community spread, that health care workers are not getting [COVID-19] in the hospital,” said Brandon Marlow, a labor representative from the Ohio Nurses Association. “It just seems very curious, why it’s a consistent message they feel they need to give.”Marlow said he isn’t sure why hospitals continue to say employees are being infected outside of work. He assumes it could be related to liability reasons, and said several hospitals have made the same assertions in private meetings with the ONA. However, several of Cleveland’s largest health systems said they are offering paid leave to employees who contract COVID-19 without requiring them to use vacation or paid time off. Data on the topic is scarce, although one study published in The Lancet foundfrontline health care workers were at higher riskfor contracting COVID-19 than the general community. Doug Meredith, an ICU nurse at Cleveland Clinic Akron General, said health care workers who are around coronavirus patients every day know the severity of the virus and take precautions to protect themselves outside of work. He said it’s discouraging to hear hospitals suggest employees are getting infected elsewhere.“I think [nurses] do take it personally. They do feel like their professionalism is being questioned, because of what they do outside of work,” he said. “Because I think we all try to do the right thing.”Hospitals in Cleveland said they trust their employees and do not believe they’re being careless in the community. Instead, they feel the high number of employees who’ve contracted the virus is the result of a spike in infections across Ohio.“Our caregivers are highly professional, and contracting COVID-19 outside the hospital is not a reflection of their professionalism, but a reflection of how contagious this virus can be in the community,” a UH spokesman said. How do they know?Hospitals say they’ve been conducting contact tracing when an employee tests positive for COVID-19 to identify the source of infection. Leadership for the Clinic, MetroHealth and UH said during the Nov. 16 news briefing that the rise in infections among employees largely mirrored the spike in coronavirus cases in Northeast Ohio. But the ONA is skeptical the hospitals can truly identify where and when someone was infected, Marlow said. Even though employees are wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and taking other precautions in the hospital, there’s still a risk they’re being exposed.“What [hospitals] would like to say is that because all these measures are in place, there’s no way somebody could be getting it in the hospital,” he said. “And I don’t know if that’s a conclusion a reasonable person could come to.”Marlow said the ONA has repeatedly asked for data that shows employees are being infected in hospitals but has yet to receive any such proof. The Clinic, MetroHealth and UH did not provide any specific contact-tracing data to cleveland.com. UH said roughly 4.5% of its caregivers have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. That compares favorably to a U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 13.4% of U. S. health care workers have tested positive. Less than 1% of the UH cases have been linked to exposure at work, a spokesman said. All three health systems have said they’ve conducted robust contact tracing and have protocols in place to protect employees, such as temperature checks for visitors, mask requirements and social-distancing measures. Meredith has not tested positive for COVID-19, but some of his colleagues have. He said he’s not aware of any contact tracing that took place after those exposures. Nurses are already dealing with skeptics in the community who claim the virus isn’t that serious and the pandemic is overblown. So it’s frustrating to hear hospitals tell nurses that they’re acquiring it outside of a workplace where they’re constantly interacting with COVID-19 patients, Meredith said.“It’s kind of like you’re hearing it from both ends, and you’re stuck in the middle,” he said. “Sometimes you feel like you’re completely on your own.”The liability questionEarlier this year, Democratic lawmakers in Ohio’s House of Representatives sought to address the issue of workplace liability through H. B. 573, which proposed making COVID-19 an occupational disease under the workers’ compensation law. Rep. Lisa Sobecki of Toledo and Rep. Kristin Boggs of Columbus introduced it March 23, the same day Ohio’s stay-at-home order went into effect. Yet the bill never got a hearing after being referred to the House Insurance Committee on May 5. Sobecki said she isn’t sure why it failed to gain any traction, although the state’s Republican lawmakers have consistently pushed back on any legislation surrounding the coronavirus and evensought to strip DeWine’s authorityto issue statewide public health orders. Sobecki said she’s unaware of any outside lobbying to prevent the bill from becoming law. But she said she heard from constituent groups who supported the legislation, and feels it’s important for Ohio to stand behind the essential workers who’ve put themselves in harm’s way throughout the pandemic.“We haven’t seen bills that help everyday Ohioans in the middle of a pandemic,” she said. “It really saddens me.”She plans to reintroduce a new version of HB 573 once the Ohio Legislature begins a new session in 2021.“This is not going to go away. The pandemic doesn’t stop on Dec. 31,” Sobecki said. “This pandemic is going to continue until we can get the vaccine to Ohioans.”Cleveland health systems said they’ve nevertheless taken steps to support employees who contract COVID-19. The Clinic is giving its employees paid time off if they contract COVID-19, regardless of where they’re infected. Those employees are not required to dip into their own PTO, a Clinic spokeswoman said.“There’s a lot of positive things [the Clinic] is doing as well, to try to take care of workers who are off with COVID,” Meredith acknowledged. UH employees who acquire COVID-19 at work qualify for workers’ comp. If they’re infected through community spread, they may use the health system’s leave and short-term disability programs, a UH spokesman said. Marlow said other Ohio hospitals have similar programs in place to help employees. Those efforts are appreciated, but the ONA also wants hospitals to provide robust contact-tracing data and give more weight to the possibility employees are being infected at work.“I think what makes the most amount of sense is to not pretend once you walk into a hospital, it’s a magical place where it’s no longer the community and you can no longer contract the virus,” Marlow said.",3,Reliable,0.0567740592740592,0.4221837421837423,1750,3,Cleveland.com
86,Two Catholic Priests Go Inside Abortion Clinics to Save Babies From Abortion,24.67,20.67,https://www.lifenews.com/2019/03/19/two-catholic-priests-go-inside-abortion-clinics-to-save-babies-from-abortion/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,22,"Two Catholic priests entered two Washington DC abortion facilities Tuesday morning — risking arrest to save babies from abortion. In what is known as Red Rose Rescues, the two priests and several pro-life advocates hand out Red Roses with messages attached to them about abortion alternatives and they and peacefully counsel women to save their babies from abortion.“In doing so, each of the pro-lifers risk arrest for trespass and possible incarceration. They also prayerfully witness to moms, their escorts, the medical workers, and law enforcement who arrive on the scene. Several of the rescuers will remain in the facility until arrest, prayerfully joining in solidarity with the babies who will die in that location from abortion,” organizers told LifeNews this morning. Fr Fidelis Moscinski along four other pro-life men and women entered Capital Women’s Services in Washngton D. C. while Fr Stephen Imbarrato led four men and women into Surgi-Clinic abortion center, also located in the nation’s capital. The suspected owner of Capital Women’s Services is Steve Brigham who has lost his medical license in six states and was charged in 2011 with 10 counts of murder in Maryland. This DC facility advertises abortions up to 36 weeks and has been the subject of complaints to DC’s Licensing Office of Health Equity for operating without all the required medical licenses. The abortion provider and director of Capital Women’s Services, Myron Rose, was disciplined by Maryland Board of Health for lying on his relicensing application in 2016. Washington Surgi-Clinic is another of the 19 abortion facilities in the DC metropolitan area. Also known for providing later abortions, Cesare F. Santangelo, has a history of medical malpractice. Court documents obtained by Operation Rescue showed a 2011 medical malpractice/wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of a women who died during an abortion. A 2013 uncover video from Live Action indicate that Santangelo would leave a baby struggling for life to die after a failed abortion. “Hopefully we’ll get this pregnancy out intact, but it doesn’t always happen that way,” Santangelo tells an undercover Live Action investigator who is 24 weeks pregnant. “I try and sever the umbilical cord first, and we wait for that to stop pulsing, and this way the fetus is expired first.”Once inside these abortion facilities, pro-lifers quietly approach mothers scheduled for abortions and offer them red roses as a symbol of life…thus the name “Red Rose Rescue.” Attached to each rose is a card which states: “God is love and he loves you and your unborn baby. Don’t be afraid. Your life circumstances will change and this baby will give you boundless joy… There is help for you and your baby.” The reverse of the card contained phone numbers of local pregnancy help centers. Frs Moscinski and Imbarrato, who led today’s Red Rose Rescues have been arrested several times prior, attempting to peacefully save preborn babies from death as have the majority of pro-lifers in today’s activism. Today is the Catholic feast of St Joseph and Fr Imbarrato’s birthday.“I felt strongly called to this mission of saving babies on this special day on which I give thanks for my own birth, knowing that God desires that these babies, conceived through His grace, are granted the additional grace of being born, loved, and cherished in this world,” Imbarrato said. Organizers concluded: “Red Rose Rescues began in September 2017. Today’s saving efforts mark more than a dozen in a little over 10 months. Red Rose Rescues are known to have saved numerous babies’ lives from abortion as well as untold numbers of babies who may have been saved because women are not able to keep their appointment when these rescues occur. Rescuers have been known to remain in abortion facilities up to 3 hours praying, singing, counseling women, and witnessing to medical and building staff, and law enforcement.”",0,Problematic,0.1209891401701746,0.3497947454844005,855,0,Life News
87,Coronavirus: Hong Kong records 13 new Covid-19 cases as health authorities set up more than 100 booths for mass testing,-0.33,48.0,https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3099212/coronavirus-health-authorities-set-more-100-mass,https://adfontesmedia.com/south-china-morning-post-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,25,"Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Centre for Health Protection’s communicable disease branch, reported that all but three of the new cases were locally transmitted, while three infections were without a known source. The news came as the government began to relax some social-distancing measures, including the reopening of cinemas and beauty parlours, and resuming evening dining at restaurants until 9pm. Friday’s figures represent the city’s second-lowest daily total since July 3. Just nine cases were reported on Monday. Hong Kong’s coronavirus infection tally now stands at 4,768. Among the newly infected was another resident of Hong Chi Lei Muk Shue Hostel, a home for the mentally disabled, taking the number of confirmed infections there to 14. Another resident also tested preliminary positive, as did a nurse at the private clinic of Dr Tse Kin-wah. A family cluster of three infections involving a Food Panda delivery worker, her 30-year-old son and 59-year-old husband was also found. Chuang said the delivery worker had worn masks on the job, so her customers were not considered close contacts. Her husband died two days earlier at Tseung Kwan O hospital with his infection only confirmed on Friday. At a press conference earlier in the day, government officials unveiled details of the mass testing scheme set to begin on September 1, and urged residents to sign up for it from 7am on Saturday. The scheme is initially expected to last for seven days, but authorities said they might extend it if demand was high. A total of 141 sites across 18 districts, comprising mostly government schools under the Education Bureau, Home Affairs Department’s community halls, and sports centres administered by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, have been chosen as makeshift testing facilities. Yuen Long has the most sites, with 14, while Islands district has the least, with just one at Tung Chung Man Tung Road Sports Centre. Other centres include Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, Kowloon Bay International Trade and Exhibition Centre, Science Park in Sha Tin, MacPherson Stadium in Mong Kok and Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai. The government headquarters in Tamar also made it to the list, though it will not be open for public appointments. North Point, Shau Kei Wan and Hennessy Road government primary schools; Kwun Tong, Tin Shui Wai, Tuen Mun government secondary schools; and Queen’s College are among the schools on the list.“For yourself, your loved ones, our hardworking medical staff and the wider community, you should join the testing,” Secretary for the Civil Service Patrick Nip Tak-kuen said. Those who test negative for Covid-19 would receive their results via text message within three days of screening, while those testing positive would get a call from the Department of Health, he added. Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee also made the same appeal to the public. She said the government had conducted 950,000 tests since January, and had recently performed 420,000 tests on high-risk groups – such as taxi drivers and care home staff. But Chan said a mass testing scheme could detect the remaining silent carriers of the virus. Nip said 6,000 medical staff – including doctors, nurses and other health care professionals such as paramedical personnel, first responders, and teachers and students at medical schools – had expressed their willingness to join the drive. They will be trained properly before taking part in the work and will wear protective gear when collecting samples. He added that the government had put in place infection-control measures, such as temperature screening at entrances, and designated exits to avoid cross infections. Daily collection of samples will run from 8am to 8pm, with disinfection carried out twice a day, while advance online appointment would ensure crowd control and help reduce infection risks, he added. Some 164 technicians from mainland China arrived in Hong Kong on Friday, adding to the 60 who arrived earlier this month. Thomas Chan Chung-ching, permanent secretary for food and health, said up to 600 mainlanders would be involved in lab testing, while sample collection would be done by Hongkongers. Dr Constance Chan Hon-yee, director of health, said the community testing scheme was designed for asymptomatic carriers of the virus. She said those who had already developed symptoms should not take the test, and should see a doctor instead. Citing Swedish reports of about 3,700 false-positive results returned by faulty test kits supplied by BGI Genomics, one of the firms involved in Hong Kong’s mass-testing scheme, Permanent Secretary for Food and Health Thomas Chan Chung-ching said the Department of Health would run another round of screening for those testing positive, to ensure accuracy. Nip also brushed aside privacy fears, saying personal data collected for testing would be encrypted and stored in government servers, and information related to people who tested negative would be destroyed after one month. He said the data would remain in Hong Kong, and testing agencies would only be able to see codes on the sample bottles. The civil service minister said the government had made flexible arrangements to enable civil servants to go and take the test during office hours, adding he had spoken to business leaders to urge them to allow their workers to do the same.“If you have domestic workers in your home, you can bring them along for testing, too,” he said. Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung also drummed up support for the scheme, using his Facebook page to appeal to teachers, students and parents to join the testing drive. Five civil servants union, including the Hong Kong Civil Servants General Union and Government Disciplined Services General Union, have also pledged their support for the scheme in a joint statement urging residents to take part. On Friday afternoon, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung led nine ministers in attending the special house committee meeting in the Legislative Council, to discuss latest health policy measures. Pro-establishment lawmakers gave their full support to the universal testing scheme, and most said they would register for tests to be held in Legco on Tuesday. But most opposition lawmakers said they would not take the tests, questioning security issues of the scheme over how their private data would be handled.",3,Reliable,0.0667384044526901,0.3787888064316636,1315,3,South China Morning Post

89,McConnell says he will vote to acquit Trump in 2nd impeachment trial: sources,-0.67,46.0,https://globalnews.ca/news/7639361/mcconnell-to-acquit-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/global-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-13,19,"Senate Minority LeaderMitch McConnelltold colleagues Saturday that in a “close call,” he will vote to acquitDonald Trump in the former president’s impeachment trial. McConnell’s decision, conveyed to colleagues in an email obtained by The Associated Press, ended the suspense over what the chamber’s most influential Republican would decide, essentially slamming the door on chances that Trump would be found guilty.“While a close call, I am persuaded that impeachments are a tool primarily of removal and we therefore lack jurisdiction,” McConnell wrote. He said the Constitution lets presidents no longer in office be pursued for “criminal misconduct,” easing his concern about Democratic prosecutors’ argument that an acquittal would allow a “January exception” against trying impeached presidents after leaving office. Trump is charged with inciting the deadly Jan. 6 riot by his supporters at the Capitol as Congress was formally certifying his election defeat by Joe Biden. A final Senate vote in the trial was expected later Saturday. McConnell’s views carry sway among GOP senators, and his decision on Trump is likely to influence others weighing their votes. Seventeen Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats to reach the two-thirds threshold needed to convict Trump, a margin that seems all but insurmountable. Many had expected the Kentucky senator to vote to clear Trump of the charges, based on McConnell’s history as a GOP loyalist who likes to take few major risks. But before Saturday, McConnell had said little in public or private about his mindset, and no one was certain what he would decide. McConnell jarred the political world just minutes after the Democratic-led House impeached Trump on Jan. 13, writing to his GOP colleagues that he had “not made a final decision” about how he would vote at the Senate trial. It was an eye-opening departure from his quick opposition when the House impeached Trump in December 2019 for trying to force Ukraine to send the then-president political dirt on campaign rival Joe Biden and other Democrats. McConnell had also told associates he thought Trump perpetrated impeachable offences and saw the moment as a chance to distance the GOP from the damage the tumultuous Trump could inflict on it, a Republican strategist told The Associated Press at the time, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. But since this week’s trial began, McConnell has voted with a majority of Republicans against proceeding with the trial at all on the grounds that Trump was no longer president. McConnell’s decision to acquit Trump leaves the party locked in its struggle to define itself in the post-Trump presidency. Numerous and fiercely loyal pro-Trump Republicans and more traditional Republicans who believe the former president is damaging the party’s national appeal are struggling to decide the GOP’s direction. A guilty vote by McConnell would have likely done even more to roil GOP waters by signalling an attempt by the party’s most powerful Washington leader to yank the party away from a figure still revered by most of its voters.“The overwhelming number of Republican voters don’t want Trump convicted, so that means any political leader has to tread carefully,” said John Feehery, a former top congressional GOP aide. While Feehery noted that McConnell was clearly outraged over the attack, he said the senator is “trying to keep his party together.”Over 36 years in the Senate, the measured McConnell has earned a reputation for inexpressiveness in the service of caution. The suspense over how he was going to vote underscored how much is at stake for McConnell and his party. McConnell has spent the trial’s first week in his seat in the Senate chamber, staring straight ahead. A guilty vote by McConnell would have enraged many of the 74 million voters who backed Trump in November, a record for a GOP presidential candidate. That could expose Republican senators seeking reelection in 2022 to primaries from conservatives seeking revenge, potentially giving the GOP less appealing general election candidates as they try winning Senate control. McConnell’s decision will no doubt colour his legacy. He turns 79 next Saturday and doesn’t face reelection for almost six years. Even critics say McConnell likes to play the long game.“For McConnell, it’s always strategy, it’s always about how he can live to fight another day,” said Colmon Elridge, chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party. McConnell manoeuvred through Trump’s four years in office like a captain steering a ship through a rocky strait on stormy seas. Battered at times by vindictive presidential tweets, McConnell made a habit of saying nothing about many of Trump’s outrageous comments. He ended up guiding the Senate to victories such as the 2017 tax cuts and the confirmations of three Supreme Court justices and more than 200 other federal judges. Their relationship plummeted after Trump’s denial of his Nov. 3 defeat and relentless efforts to reverse the voters’ verdict with his baseless claims that Democrats fraudulently stole the election. It withered completely last month, after Republicans lost Senate control with two Georgia runoff defeats they blamed on Trump, and the savage attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters. The day of the riot, McConnell railed against “thugs, mobs, or threats” and described the attack as “this failed insurrection.”A week later, the Democratic-controlled House impeached Trump for inciting insurrection. Six days after that, McConnell said, “The mob was fed lies” and he added, “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people.”___",3,Reliable,0.0455977845683728,0.4918592436974788,1249,3,Global News

Obtaining one required going in person to the court building to complete several pieces of paperwork, waiting around to see if a petition was granted, and then finding out when a hearing would take place. The whole process could take all day. “It can be incredibly intimidating to file a personal protection order,” said Jeni Hooper, program coordinator of the community response team at First Step, an advocacy group in Detroit for survivors of domestic violence. The coronavirus has required court systems to adapt — and at a time when expertswarnthat social isolation, economic uncertainty, anda historic wave of gun-buyingare driving up domestic abuse. Calls to the Michigan Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violencewere up102 percent in March and the first half of April, compared to the same period last year. In Wayne County, officials accelerated plans to digitize the process for a personal protection order (PPO) as it is called locally. On April 17, three days before its courthouses closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the Wayne County Circuit Courtlauncheda digital portal through which people canrequest ordersremotely. As part of theprocess, a petitioner can ask a judge to prohibit the respondent from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Themajority of stateslack an automatic gun prohibition with an temporary pre-hearing order, even though experts warn that a failure to disarm abusers when an order is served exacerbates the risks for victims. Kathleen McCarthy, the presiding judge in the family division of Wayne County Circuit Court who spearheaded the e-filing program, said that when she was deciding whether to temporarily close the courthouse last month, her biggest concern was how domestic violence survivors would be able to get restraining orders. Growing up in a household with domestic violence had made her particularly attuned to the risks, she added. The pandemic “turned everything on its head and forced everyone to learn and to acquire the technology to do these things in a more up-to-date fashion,” McCarthy said. In 2018, Wayne County had the highest rate of reported domestic violence incidents by county in Michigan, according toa Trace analysisof the most recent availablecrime statisticsfrom the Michigan State Police and population data from the U. S. Census Bureau. When a state stay-at-home order started on March 24, officials and advocates in Michigan feared the problem would get worse. “A lot of times people need to get these personal protection orders and the person they need to get it against is still somewhere around them,” said Shelly Drain, an assistant prosecuting attorney in Wayne County.“The pandemic puts survivors at a much more increased risk because they can be isolated with their abuser,” added Hooper. In April, the county registered a slight decline in reported incidents of domestic violence compared to the last year,accordingto an analysis of county data by theDetroit Free Press. But local crisis centers have reported an increase in calls about domestic violence in the same period compared to last year, a possible sign of underreporting. McCarthy says the e-filing system has been processing an average of 17 PPO applications per day, about the same volume that came through the old system in March. That’s down from a pre-pandemic average of about 25 per day, she said. Researchshowsthat when an abuser has access to a gun, the risk of homicide becomesfive timesmore likely. Federal lawbarsconvicted abusers and those subject to domestic violence protective orders from owning guns. But the law refers to permanent orders of protection that have been handed down by a judge, not orders that are served prior to a hearing. Twenty-one stateseither bar gun possession for people subject to a PPO before a hearing is held, or allow a judge to authorize a gun prohibition. Michigan falls into the latter category. Most of the time, Drain said, judges in Wayne County order a gun prohibition even if a petitioner hasn’t asked for it. McCarthy added that all sitting judges in her jurisdiction must attend domestic violence training, where “it’s clearly taught that removing guns from the household is the number one way, if you can, to prevent a fatality.”Thee-filing systemmakes it much easier for petitioners, whether in a pandemic or not, said Hooper, whose group is one of several domestic violence organizations available to help petitioners complete the process. They can file on behalf of a domestic violence survivor if that person is unable to access the forms themself. The courtwebsitealso makes it easier for petitioners to find court-approved process servers or send documents by certified mail. Georgea Cole, an advocate for victims with the Americorps Urban Safety Domestic Violence Program at Wayne State University, spends the vast majority of her time helping domestic violence survivors file for PPOs, including through the new system. Normally, she works out of police stations throughout Detroit, speaking with people who are referred by an officer or via a domestic violence hotline. She says working from home has hindered her ability to connect with survivors. “You can’t get that kind of refuge virtually,” she said. But for other survivors who are unable to get to a physical place of safe harbor, the online filing system offers potentially life-saving access — even without the pandemic or state of emergency. Cole said she thinks that the addition of online filing after the state reopens can allow for the greatest access possible for survivors whose circumstances restrict different resources.“We see both of the methods work,” Cole said. “But everything is not for everybody.”Wayne County is not the first place to add an e-filing system for personal protection orders. Macomb County in Michigan has had such a system in place since 2018. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, three states — Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin — allowed people to electronically file restraining order petitions directly to the court without having to visit a courthouse or meet with a legal advocate, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for State Courts. Since the pandemic began, others likeUtahhave also allowed temporary restraining order petitions to be emailed directly to the court. But online systems remain unusual. And that largely comes down to funding, said Rachel Teicher, director of intimate partner violence intervention at the National Network For Safe Communities. “It costs money to set up these systems and adopt them and make sure they’re secure and that the process works,” said Teicher. But she said the investment is worth it. “It saves victims a lot of time and stress.”Wayne County officials hope that other jurisdictions might follow their lead. Said Drain, “It can really be rolled out everywhere.”",3,Reliable,0.0757204700061842,0.3258558372844087,1451,3,The Trace

Here’s what you need to know about Gracyn Courtright:US Attorney for DCGracyn Courtright seen in an Instagram screenshot included in court documentsUS Attorney for DCGracyn Courtright seen in an Instagram screenshot included in court documentsCourtright uploaded a selfie photo on her Instagram story on January 6 or January 7 before she deactivated her account with the caption, “Infamy is just as good as fame. Either way I end up more known. XOXO.” The Instagram photo was posted after she had shared photos from the rally and videos from inside the Capitol building, according to court documents. She had pushed back against people on social media who had called her out for being at the rally and siege. Federal authorities received tips about Courtright after asking the public for information on those who were possibly inside the Capitol during the siege. An FBI special agent wrote in an affidavit, “Following this incident, the FBI reviewed screenshots from an Instagram account under the account name @gracyn_dawn. This account name is consistent with Courtright’s first and middle name. This account has since been deleted, so your affiant was unable to view the photographs on the Instagram page. However, the photographs that were posted were captured and provided to law enforcement via screenshots.”The FBI agent said they were able to identify Courtright through the beanie-style hat with a yellow band, black puffer-style jacket, black shirt over a pink shirt, black pants, light pink socks and black fanny pack she was wearing in her Instagram photos at the Capitol. The FBI also compared the Instagram photos to Courtright’s West Virginia driver’s license and found “significant physical similarities,” including her hair color, facial structure and dimples on both sides of her face. The agent said a Twitter video provided to the FBI that Courtright posted shows her walking through the Capitol and chanting “USA” with others, while another video showed her chanting “whose house, our house,” toward a line of police officers. She was identified in those videos because she turned the camera toward herself and the agent saw she was wearing the beanie with a yellow band, according to court documents. The FBI agent also said Courtright could be seen in a Washington Post photo of a crowd inside the Capitol because her “unique hat with the yellow band” stuck up above the other people.

Cuomo even got a book deal out of it. He got a great run with that character, but his own arrogance has contrived circumstances that are conspiring to write him out of the script in a particularly ugly way. FromCNN:No matter why he got his government to fudge the statistics on nursing home COVID deaths, it’s plain that, not unlike the previous president*, Cuomo simply thought he was smarter, and (especially) that he was tougher, than everyone else. It all began with a report from New York Attorney General Letitia James that concluded the state health department had undercounted COVID deaths in the state’s nursing homes by as much as 50 percent. Then, last week, a key aide to Cuomo named Melissa DeRosa told a private meeting that the numbers were fudged partly because the state was worried about what the last administration’s Department of Justice might do with them. FromCNN:This was not an unreasonable suspicion, as we all know. However, it also functioned to hang a lot of Democratic state politicians out to dry, which, alas, is of a piece with the high-handed way Cuomo has treated his fellow Democrats ever since ascending to his father’s old job. Back when the pandemic began, Cuomo was granted emergency powers by the state legislature. In the wake of these revelations, the state legislature is in full revolt. In 2011, a rump faction of Democratic legislators formed something called the Independent Democratic Conference. They allied with Republicans in the state senate and enabled Cuomo to ignore the establishment Democrats in the legislature and, with the support of the IDC, get pretty much anything he wanted passed. Regular Democrats fumed, but the situation didn’t change until 2018, when five members of the IDC, including the group’s founder, lost Democratic primary elections. (Biaggi, quoted above, was the one who eliminated Jeff Klein, the IDC’s founder.) Those five allied with the Democratic regulars and the IDC went out of business. Cuomo suddenly was faced with a new political reality and now, he’s run headlong into it. His career is in ashes at the moment. Whether it can rise again is a long shot bet.

Store unseated a centre-right coalition on Monday headed by Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg, which had been in power since 2013.“We waited, we hoped, and we have worked so hard, and now we can finally say it: We did it!,” Store, who is likely to be the next prime minister, told cheering supporters after Solberg conceded defeat. With 97.5 percent of the votes counted, Labour and four other centre-left parties could swing to a combined majority of 100 seats, up from 81 currently, the Directorate of Elections projected. A minimum of 85 seats is required to win a majority in the 169-seat parliament.“Norway has sent a clear signal: the election shows that the Norwegian people want a fairer society,” said the 61-year-old millionaire who campaigned against social inequalities. Norway’s position as western Europe’s biggest oil and gas producer was at the heart of the election campaign after the August report on climate from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) thrust the issue to the top of the agenda. Store had called for a gradual transition away from the oil economy, while the Greens had called for an immediate end to oil exploration. The Conservatives had also called for a transition away from the fossil fuels that have made Norway wealthy.“I want to congratulate Jonas Gahr Store, who now seems to have a clear majority for a change of government,” 60-year-old Solberg said in her concession speech. To form a viable cabinet, Stoere might need to persuade potential centre-left partners to compromise on policies ranging from oil and private ownership to Norway’s relations with the European Union.“We, as the biggest party, will make sure that Norway will get a new government and a new course,” Store said in a speech to party members.“In the coming days, I will invite the leaders of all parties who want a change,” he said, adding he would start with the Centre Party and Socialist Left. The oil sector accounts for 14 percent of Norway’s gross domestic product, as well as 40 percent of its exports and employs 160,000 people directly. It has also helped the country of 5.4 million people amass the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, today worth close to 12 trillion kroner ($1.4 trillion). A former minister in the governments of Jens Stoltenberg between 2005 and 2013, Store is now expected to begin negotiations with the Centre, which primarily defends the interests of its rural base, and the Socialist Left, which is a strong advocate for environmental issues. Store has also pledged to address inequality by cutting taxes for low and middle-income families and increasing rates for the rich.",3,Reliable,0.0880980861244019,0.4060871876661351,611,3,Al Jazeera

The Immigration Index has been under the baseline in every survey since Election Day 2020, and reached a record low of 82.3 in late March 2021. The index is more than 15 points below where it was in late October 2020, indicating voters are looking for tighter immigration control from President Joe Biden’s administration. The Index is based on a series of questions designed to determine whether voters are moving toward an immigration system that encourages more immigration to the United States or one that reduces the level of immigration here. (To see survey question wording,click here.)All surveys are compared to a baseline –set the week of December 2-6, 2019– which has been given an Index of 100. An index finding moving up over 100 indicates growing support for a more expansive immigration system. An index number falling below 100 indicates increased support for a more restrictive immigration system.

During his campaign, President Biden pledged to greatly reduce the level of enforcement against illegal immigration, but in the latest survey, 60% of Likely U. S. Voters feel the government is already doing too little to reduce illegal border crossings and visitor overstays. Thirteen percent (13%) say the government is doing too much. Twenty-one percent (21%) rate the level of action as about right. Significantly, 73% of Republicans and 71% of voters not affiliated with either major party say the government is not doing enough to reduce illegal border crossings and visitor overstays, as do 40% of Democrats. When it comes to this year’s presidential election, immigration is ranked as the most important issue by 19% of Likely Voters. Only the economy (30%) is ranked as the most important issue by more voters. Sixty-nine percent (69%) of all Likely Voters believe the government should mandate employers to use the federal electronic E-Verify system to help ensure that they hire only legal workers for U. S. jobs. Seventeen percent (17%) disagree, with 14% undecided. Voters have consistently championed E-Verify throughout the history of the Immigration Index. Biden has said he will legalize the status of the so-called Dreamers, and a majority of voters (53%) favor giving lifetime work permits to most of the approximately two million illegal residents who came to this country when they were minors. This includes 29% who Strongly Favor it. Forty-two percent (42%) are opposed, with 26% who are Strongly Opposed. President Biden also has indicated that he wants to legalize all illegal immigrants in the country, and 41% favor giving lifetime work permits to most of the estimated 12 million illegal residents of all ages who currently reside in the United States, with 19% who Strongly Favor it. Fifty-three percent (53%) are opposed, including 38% who are Strongly Opposed. Legal immigration has averaged around a million annually in recent years, and Biden has vowed to increase that. Sixteen percent (16%) of voters want to increase the number of new immigrants over one million. Another 19% are comfortable with one million newcomers each year. Fifty-four percent (54%), however, believe the government should be adding no more than 750,000 new immigrants annually, with 37% who say it should be fewer than 500,000. Twelve percent (12%) are not sure. Sixty percent (60%) said it’s better to raise pay and try harder to recruit non-working Americans than to bring in new foreign workers in the construction, manufacturing and service industries. Forty-eight percent (48%) said immigration-driven population growth should be reduced to limit the expansion of cities into U. S. wildlife habitats and farmland. Only 25% favor current U. S. immigration policy which allows legal immigrants to bring in not just their spouse and children but also eventually other adult relatives that can include extended family and their spouses’ families. Sixty-three percent (63%) are opposed to current policy and think legal immigrants should be able to bring only their spouse and children with them. Eleven percent (11%) are not sure. The Census Bureau projects that current immigration policies are responsible for most U. S. population growth and will add 75 million people over the next 40 years. Most voters continue to want to slow that growth as they have in surveying throughout the Index’s history. In terms of the effect on the overall quality of life in the United States, 31% want to continue immigration-driven population growth at the current levels.

By Friday afternoon, the president wastweetingthat they’d have a new campaign ad on “Sleepy Joe Biden.” Here’s the first one they came up with. They didn’t get the factswrong. Biden will raise taxes on the wealthy and has promised a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But the main point was to paint the former vice president as weak and beholden to the far left. That is supposed to scare moms. Things went downhill from there. Here is the ad they released two days later. The three issues from the previous ad were repeated. But this one begins by suggesting that Biden is in his basement alone, hiding, and diminished. The first thing to note is that Biden is doing the same thing a lot of Americans are doing: practicing social distancing to slow the spread of a pandemic. I suspect that a lot of voters identify with him. But secondly, the Trump campaign had to photoshop images of Biden to create some visuals to dramatize their claims. The first image is of Biden at an event outside. It has been photoshopped to look like it was taken in his basement and the microphone in his hand has been edited out. The second one is of Biden attending an event at the home of the mayor of Coralville, Iowa. The vice president apparently gave up his seat to someone else and sat on the floor. According to The Gazette, the original photowas takenby their photographer Liz Martin and the Trump campaign not only edited it to remove the people around Biden, but failed to get permission to use it. The third one was taken by an AP photographer on June 1 when Biden met with community leaders in a Black church in Wilmington, Delaware to discuss the George Floyd protests. The specific image was taken as Biden bowed his head in prayer with the group. It has been used in the ad to make him look alone and dejected. If this is the kind of thing Stepien halted the president’s ad campaign in order to produce, it certainly doesn’t speak well to his skills as a campaign manager. Blatant photoshopping is child’s play, and to misuse an image of the former vice president in prayer is beyond the pale. That is particularly true as the president seems to have simultaneously launched an initiative to suggest that Biden is against the Bible and God. For example,duringa “telerally” with Pennsylvania voters on Sunday, Trump said, “Joe Biden, the radical Democrats are against fracking, they’re against guns, and they’re against the Bible, essentially, they’re against God.” Here is what he said in Ohio on Thursday. Here’s Trump in Ohio claiming that Joe Biden is “against God.”“No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He’s against God,” Trump says. ?pic.twitter.com/IwAjgbkEyB— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar)August 6, 2020One can only assume that Trump thinks that kind of thing works with the Christian nationalists. He’s probably right, but they’re already voting for him. Everyone else knows that it’s nothing but an offensive cheap shot. So there you have the Trump campaign’s new attack strategy on Joe Biden: photoshops and lies about the vice president’s faith. But it is hard to simply fault Bill Stepian. When it comes to his candidate, the guy doesn’t have much to work with.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0586997885835095,0.3835175677036142,783,1,Washington Monthly

102,The Lies Tearing America Apart,13.33,30.67,https://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2021/01/13/the-lies-tearing-america-apart-n2583038,https://adfontesmedia.com/townhall-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-13,25,"Last week, the Capitol was breached by a group of fringe Trump supporters who had bought into a series of lies: the lie that President Donald Trump lost the election due to proven voter fraud and irregularity; the lie that the Electoral College results, legally certified state by state, could be overturned by Congress or the vice president; the lie that Trump would remain in office if only some sort of armed rebellion were to prevent the election certification by Congress. Those were lies. And those lies had deadly consequences. Thankfully, the vast majority of Americans don't believe those lies. Which means we should be able to unify around certain basic truths: that Joe Biden is legally president-elect of the United States; that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and those who participate in it should be punished to the full extent of the law; that broad claims regarding invasion of rights ought to be backed by compelling evidence. But we won't. That's because while the Democratic Party and the political left agree that Joe Biden is president-elect, they absolutely disagree with both the fundamental precept that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and the even more fundamental precept that claims require evidence. We saw that this summer when Democratic Party officials made light of riots spreading across the nation in the name of yet another lie -- the lie that America is systemically racist, rooted in slavery and Jim Crow, and replete with bigoted police dedicated to endangering black lives. Democrats demanded no evidence to support those claims; in knee-jerk fashion, they simply repeated ad nauseam untruths about the existential threat to black Americans in the United States. Which means that for the Democrats and the political left, violence is fine so long as it supports their narrative, and un-evidenced claims are fine so long as they support an agenda. In order to defend such violence, the political left has mobilized behind another convenient and advantageous lie: the lie that the Capitol riots represent all conservatives and Republicans. Paul Krugman of The New York Times suggested that the ""putsch was decades in the making,"" chalking up the rioting to ""Republican elites"" since before Ronald Reagan. The Washington Post amplified a nutty post from the chairman of the Nye County Republican Party in Nevada into a referendum on a ""long-festering struggle within the Republican Party over conspiracy theories, purity tests and fealty to the rule of law."" Members of the media gleefully hunted for Republicans to blame for the Capitol riots, calling for the deplatforming of brand-name conservatives and cheering on social media crackdowns. Lies are dangerous. And double standards are perhaps the most dangerous form of lying: They grant the bravery of purity to those most willing to defy decency, prompting similar spasms of cruelty and malice from the other side. The solution to our national crisis of conscience isn't bad-faith political purges or repetition of tiresome falsehoods about the nature of the United States. It's truth. But truth is more a shield than a sword. And we are now in the age of swords, wielded aggressively by those with little principle but an unending sense of their own moral superiority.",1,Questionable,0.0397921261128808,0.4461437147757902,678,1,Townhall

S. by the end of this year. On Monday, President Joe Biden’s senior adviser for COVID-19 response, Andy Slavitt,announced in a press briefing that the U. S. government has partnered with the test kits’ manufacturer, Australian-based diagnostics company Ellume, in a deal to produce millions of kits throughout 2021.“These are over-the-counter, self-performed test kits that can detect COVID with roughly 95% accuracy within 15 minutes,” Slavitt said. “It’s less invasive than the long nasopharyngeal swab that people may have seen on the news.”The Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services are granting Ellume $231.8 million to build a facility in the U. S. and ramp up manufacturing. According to theofficial company announcement, Ellume will manufacture 8.5 million tests that Slavitt says are “guaranteed” to go to the U. S. for distribution.“At full capacity, the U. S. facility will be able to produce up to 19 million tests per month,” perhaps by the end of the year, according to Slavitt and the press release. Ellume will start by providing 100,000 test kits per month from February to July, until the U. S. facility is finished. Slavitt notes that the number of tests is “good, but obviously not where we’ll need to be.”Slavitt said the test works by placing the swab in the digital testing device included in the kit, which will then send your results to your smartphone. He also said the test can be used on people two and older and can detect the virus in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.“Our focus is enabling the U. S. to minimize community transmission and reopen as quickly as possible,” Ellume founder and CEO Dr. Sean Parsons said in astatement.“The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test is the only authorized test of its kind and is an essential tool for the broader pandemic response in the U. S.”The Food and Drug Administration approved Ellume’s at-home testing kit for emergency use authorization on December 15. According to Slavitt, each kit is $30, but he said the “cost will come down only when we can get to that mass production and scale.” Previousat-home testing kits,which required sending in results to a lab, were priced at more than $100 per kit.“Making easier-to-use tests available to every American is a high priority with obvious benefits,” Slavitt said on Monday. “The ability to quickly test, to contact trace, and quarantine is a linchpin of our national strategy and will be a vital part of containing the virus and stopping community spread.”As of Monday, more than 26 million people in the U. S. have tested positive for COVID-19, including at least 442,000 deaths, according toJohns Hopkins University.",3,Reliable,0.1522431208638105,0.4511267850923023,695,3,NowThis News
104,How HBO Max Became ‘Wonder Woman 1984’s’ Best Option,0.0,43.33,https://variety.com/2020/film/news/wonder-woman-1984-hbo-max-analysis-1234835650/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-19,21,"Warner Bros.didn’t have a lot of good options. After the studio released Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” in September tolackluster ticket sales, it was hesitant to unveil another $200 million-budgeted movie in the middle of a pandemic. And yet, just three months after “Tenet” tried and largely failed to reignite moviegoing, Warner Bros. had to make a decision about the fate of “Wonder Woman 1984,” the last blockbuster scheduled for 2020 after other major films such as “No Time to Die” and “Soul” had been postponed or opted for streaming debuts. With “Wonder Woman 1984’s” Christmas Day release date looming, the studio had found itself in between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, it had a superstar director in Patty Jenkins, who wanted the follow-up to her 2017 superhero adventure “Wonder Woman” to have a splashy big-screen debut. The original DC Comics adaptation — spotlighting Gal Gadot’s female heroine — was a critical and commercial smash, generating $820 million in ticket sales globally. The sequel was expected to surpass the billion-dollar mark. The studio, however, was painfully aware that cases of coronavirus were going up, not down, and seeing the virus continue to surge would affect those plans. Rising cases also meant that New York City and Los Angeles would likely double down on their decision to keep theaters closed — in the case of “Tenet,” Warners estimated that the loss of those markets cost them tens of millions of dollars in revenue. But the studio couldn’t delay the release of “Wonder Woman 1984” indefinitely. The movie was filmed and completed in 2018, which seems like an eternity ago given everything that’s happened in the last few months. There was a sense that the sequel would get stale by waiting until summer or next fall — four years after “Wonder Woman” premiered. Even with several promising vaccines, there’s no guarantee that the world will return to some kind of normal in a matter of months. So Warner Bros. found itself weighing options that would have been unthinkable when the studio first greenlit “Wonder Woman 1984.” Up until the 11th hour, higher-ups at Warner Bros. were debating the best release strategy — a combination that would allow the movie to play in theaters on Christmas Day while also making a splash onHBO Max, the subscription streaming service owned by its parent company WarnerMedia. The studio heavily considered giving “Wonder Woman 1984” a shortened exclusive theatrical run. But instead, Warners made the surprising decision torelease the movie day and date— meaning it would land in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously on Dec. 25. Though the film is forgoing substantial box office returns and will likely end up losing money — “Wonder Woman” cost $200 million to make and many millions more to market globally — leaning into the HBO Max of things became the best option because it allowed them to get the movie out in a timely manner while promoting a streaming service that’s struggled to make waves. Rival studios believe that WarnerMedia, which is under pressure to make HBO Max a true rival to Netflix, hadserious “Hamilton” envy. The company sawthe successthat Disney had skipping a theatrical release for the Lin Manuel Miranda movie musical in favor of a streaming launch last summer, and wanted to make a similar stir.“They’re going to make less money for the greater good of building HBO Max,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at LightShed Partners. “This is putting the long-term future of the company ahead of profits.”HBO Max is on the pricier side, running at $15 per month compared to the $7 monthly fee for Disney Plus and $9 monthly fee for Netflix’s basic plan. As of late September, HBO Max reportedly had around 9 million subscribers. Disney Plus has 73 million subscribers worldwide, and Netflix has over 195 million worldwide. A major caveat: The nascent HBO Max is only available in the U. S. The budding streamer’s bigger issue, Greenfield argues, is that 70% of HBO customers have access to HBO Max for no extra charge but still haven’t signed up to use it.“It’s far less about driving new subscribers as it is getting people to know HBO Max exists,” he said. “They have people who pay for HBO Max and don’t use it. The whole initiative is getting people over to Max.”WarnerMedia has made it no secret that the company isshifting its focus to streaming, and the launch of “Wonder Woman 1984” will surely entice legions of comic book loyalists to HBO Max. (How many will cancel after thefree seven-day trialmay be a different issue.) But the company still recognizes the importance of movie theaters, especially for blockbuster franchises that rely on global box office receipts to turn a profit, and didn’t want to leave multiplexes entirely in the lurch. Cinema chains big and small would normally refuse to play a major movie that is debuting simultaneously on home entertainment. Last spring, the biggest movie theater chain in the country,AMC, vowed to boycottUniversal’s movies after the studio launched “Trolls World Tour” on digital rental services when most theaters were closed due to the pandemic. But those lines in the sand have washed away during COVID. Months into a global heath crisis that has no end in sight, theater exhibitors are struggling to make ends meet. If they want any chance of staying open, they have to play whatever they can. On Wednesday, AMC’s CEO Adam Aron had a very different response to news that “Wonder Woman 1984” was taking a course of action similar to Universal’s “Trolls” sequel.“Given that atypical circumstances call for atypical economic relationships between studios and theaters, and atypical windows and releasing strategies, AMC is fully onboard for Warner Brothers’ announcement,” Aron said. It’s unclear how many U. S. cinemas will be open by the time “Wonder Woman 1984” rolls around in late December. About half of the theaters in the country are closed. Comparatively, 70% of theaters were back in business when “Tenet” was released in September — and that movie just barely made $50 million in domestic ticket sales. Regal, the second largest theater chain, chose to remain shuttered and has previously said it won’t reopen locations for one movie. It would need a string of buzzy new releases to make reopening a financially viable proposition. Overseas, where HBO Max is not available, “Wonder Woman 1984” will bow in theaters a week earlier on Dec. 16, in an effort to prevent piracy. Unlike the cratering domestic box office, international movie theater operators, particularly in China and Japan, have already fielded a few blockbusters. In the U. S., exhibitors are still grateful that Warner Bros. took a bold bet in launching “Tenet” despite enormous headwinds facing the box office. And, they’re hoping “Wonder Woman 1984” going to HBO Max will be a one-off, not the start of a release strategy that will outlast the pandemic. Another reason theaters aren’t outraged is because they’re expected to receive a larger cut of ticket sales in exchange for allowing Warner Bros. to break their theatrical contract. Traditionally, studios and exhibitors split profits 50-50. With “Wonder Woman 1984,” some major circuits are expected to keep an even larger percentage of the revenues. Sources familiar with negotiations said deals haven’t been finalized. Theater operators were comforted that WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar affirmed the company’s commitment to exhibition. “We believe in theaters because hundreds of millions of fans around the world value going to the movies,” he said Wednesday. Those hundreds of millions of fans may want to see “Wonder Woman 1984” in their local cinema, but the harsh reality of this pandemic means they may have to settle for watching it in their living room instead.",3,Reliable,0.0645664983164983,0.369669191919192,1694,3,Variety
105,Running for New York City Mayor — How Much Chaos Can We Expect Between Now and June?,-7.67,43.67,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/02/04/running-for-new-york-city-mayor-how-much-chaos-can-we-expect-between-now-and-june-22/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,17,", you could walk up to Gracie Mansion and touch your fingers to the cool brick of the walls surrounding the grounds. Those days, like so much before the coronavirus, are long gone. The Upper East Side mansion, erected in 1799, sits behind NYPD barricades. The metallic gates are everywhere, cutting off the walking paths that used to invite visitors to the home of the mayor of New York City. Gracie resembles, a year into the pandemic, a fortress under siege. On June 22, when the virus may well be less pervasive, Democrats in New York will choose their nominee for mayor. In our heavily Democratic city, this primary victory will be tantamount to election. And given the ease with which incumbents glide to a second term — the oft-maligned Bill de Blasio won his 2017 primary with nearly 75 percent of the vote and easily swatted away a Republican by 38 points — this election will effectively determine who gets to govern the largest city in America for the nextyears. (The last one-term mayor, David Dinkins, left office in 1993.)There may be no more important election — in this city, at least — in modern history. Not since the city nearly went bankrupt in 1975 has it been so close to the brink. COVID-19 has killed more than 27,000 of our fellow citizens. The restaurant, tourism, and hospitality industries are decimated. The true unemployment rate, some experts estimate, could exceed 20 percent. The murder rate is up all over America, and here in New York it hassoared 41 percent over 2019. This past summer, protests against police brutality shook the city during some of the tensest days and nights in memory, drawing savage crackdowns from an NYPD that de Blasio — a left-leaning Democrat — has repeatedly failed to reform and discipline. The Gracie Mansion barricades went up around the time of those hot, violent nights, as de Blasio, known for his stubborn workouts at the Park Slope Y and his refusal to show up anywhere on time, seemed to retreat from his city. While the gangly mayor has real, lasting accomplishments — he created a universal prekindergarten program and helped pass laws increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing paid sick leave — he has been mocked and derided for his quixotic national ambitions and for failing, along with Governor Andrew Cuomo, to contain the spread of COVID-19. The city, laid so low, may be even more immediately beleaguered than it was in the 1970s, when a fiscal crisis triggered mass layoffs and enormous cuts to social services. “Here the challenge is much greater,” says City Comptroller Scott Stringer, one of the front-running candidates. “We have no tourists, no arts and culture, no restaurant or dining to speak of. This is unprecedented territory.”Candidates crisscross neighborhoods as large as small cities, courting varied racial, ethnic, and interest groups that can diverge wildly in their needs and wants. There is a Hasidic vote, a Chinese vote, an Afro-Caribbean vote, and an MSNBC liberal vote. There are dozens of labor unions, civic organizations, churches, block associations, and Democratic clubs that all want to feel that the mayor will represent them, and often, them alone, even though the primary has drawn close to 1 million voters in the past.“Running for mayor involves having an understanding of these different communities, having some people who have some ties in these communities and understanding issues that matter to them—and that does create some whiplash for candidates,” says Lis Smith, a prominent Democratic operative who worked on de Blasio’s 2013 campaign. “One day you’re talking to a group that’s very progressive, very liberal, and the next day you’re talking to a group of voters that are more fiscally conservative, socially conservative. There are a fair amount of anti-abortion Democrats.”The pandemic, of course, has upended all of this. The last time there was an open mayoral race, candidates had months to glad-hand at parades, block parties, and Sunday services, slowly building name recognition as voters spotted them on street corners and subway platforms. Once an unknown, de Blasio himself had to cajole commuters at the subway, hunching his six-six frame to give his elevator pitch to the people rushing by. These days, the candidates are locked into Zoom forums. Andrew Yang, one of the top contenders, hustled across the city in January, staging walking tours and riding the subway with reporters in tow. On February 2, he announced thathe had tested positive for COVID-19. His diagnosis may well convince the other contenders to avoid crowd contact, at least for now. “The last time I had a flu no one gave a shit,” Yang joked. Pandemic campaigning, generally, has meant increased phone banks, more glossy campaign mailers, and additional digital and TV ads to replace door-to-door canvassing. For candidates without built-in followings, this is cutting down on opportunities to meet voters and demonstrate momentum, either with a big rally, a strong showing at a parade, oreven a staged arrest, cameras flashing.“I’m still a believer, as far as citywide races, that regular cable TV is important,” says Jerry Skurnik, a longtime Democratic consultant. “That’s why de Blasio won eight years ago. It seems to me that TV is even more important this year. I’m sitting home right now — the TV is on.”More than 30 candidates, remarkably, have registered to run with the city’s Campaign Finance Board, though there are only five or six Democrats who have a viable chance of seizing the nomination and breezing to victory in the fall. Much of this has to do with money: A competitive mayoral race costs millions of dollars, and only a handful of Democrats will be able to raise and spend that kind of cash. Two of the candidates, Stringer and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, have been enmeshed in the city’s political machinery for decades, taking the most traditional route to power. Stringer, who has been the city’s comptroller since 2014, is a Manhattanite with a base on the white, liberal Upper West Side. He is the undisputed endorsement king — three members of Congress, including the newly elected Bronx firebrand Jamaal Bowman, are backing Stringer’s candidacy, along with a deep roster of state lawmakers. Stringer has been courting the city’s resurgent left, criticizing power elites like the real estate industry and proposing an ambitious plan to phase out all fossil fuel infrastructure citywide. Once a more risk-averse, clubhouse politician, Stringer is hoping he can woo progressives in the primary, recreating a version of the playbook that got de Blasio to Gracie Mansion in the first place. Adams, unlike Stringer, does not chest-thump over progressive credentials. A former state senator, police captain,and Republican, Adams proudly fundraises from the real estate developers loathed on the left. A power broker in Brooklyn’s Black neighborhoods, Adams has been a muscular voice on police reform, pitching an idea to let community groups select police commanders. He said hewould publicizethe names of police officers being monitored for bad behavior. (Adams did not return multiple requests for comment.)Stringer, who has promised to “manage the hell” out of the city,has bankedclose to $6 million for the race so far; Adams has about $6.6 million. Both of them are expected to be prolific fundraisers in the months to come. In 2001, a little-known, charisma-challenged billionaire named Michael Bloomberg defied the Democratic establishment, winning the mayoralty in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Bloomberg triumphed on the Republican line, all but impossible in today’s city, unless you can spend $100 million, which is out of reach for all of the current candidates. In 2013, horrifying entrenched Democrats while delighting every newspaper in town, Anthony Weiner plunged into the Democratic primary, fresh off the first of many sexting scandals. Before his implosion, he was a polling leader, drawing huge crowds in the streets. At the same time, Eliot Spitzer, the former governor felled in a prostitution scandal, was running for city comptroller, whipping up a singular frenzy around a municipal contest. In 2021, there are no black swan candidates like Weiner and Spitzer, but there is a famous outsider: Yang, the entrepreneur who gained widespread recognition running for president on a platform to give $1,000 to every American every month, forever. Mayoral candidate Yang cannot propose anything so ambitious — his current cash-transfer proposal is micro-targeted to very poor households, and would cost $1 billion annually out of an $88 billion budget — and he has mixed worthy progressive goals, such as a public bank for New York City, with the more curious,including a casino on Governors Islandthat would be forbidden under a federal deed restriction.“I’m running for mayor for one reason and one reason only: I believe I can help New York City recover from this crisis faster than others,” Yang says. He is chasing the progressive vote, like Stringer, but he is also hoping to cross over everywhere, knitting together moderates and exciting the city’s burgeoning Asian communities. Before testing positive, he took to street-level campaigning with particular gusto, and is easily recognized when he ventures out.“There’s like a real need in New York to have someone who people have a sense of pulling for them,” Yang continues, pitching his candidacy, “and one of the things happening in New York City right now — the nature of the race is a lot of noise — to me, as long as New Yorkers are happy to see me, I’m pumped to fight for them.”The bubbly Yang is, more than any other candidate, resented by the rival campaigns, who treat him with a mixture of derision and fear. His top consultant, Bradley Tusk, advised Bloomberg’s failed presidential campaign andgrew rich advising Uber, drawing ire from the left. Maya Wiley, a former counsel for the de Blasio administration and a civil rights lawyer who rose to greater fame as an MSNBC analyst, is seeking to become New York’s first female mayor. (Wiley declined an interview request.)And the city’s Wall Street titansspecifically recruitedRay McGuire, a Citigroup executive, to run for mayor; he has raised nearly $5 million frombusiness heavyweightsin a short amount of time, vaulting himself into the top tier.“I don’t owe anybody anything,” McGuire says, boasting of his status as a first-time candidate. “Zero. I’m unbought.” Celebrities such as Spike Lee and Samuel L. Jackson are in McGuire’s corner. As a Black business executive, he has spoken openly about racial justice and coalition building between the city’s millionaire class and leftists who seek to check their power. Some on the left are hoping Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, can catch fire. Though the Democratic Socialists of America, an emerging power center in New York politics, are not formally backing any candidate, members of the organization have been drawn to Morales, who has called for slashing the NYPD budget in half and redirecting the funds to social services.“I kind of reject the idea that we can’t talk about decreasing this sort of system that criminalizes poverty for Black and brown people because people are going to be unsafe. Black and brown folks are already unsafe,” Morales says. “We need to be morally committed to people’s needs to live in dignity.”And there is no shortage of technocrats: de Blasio’s former Sanitation commissioner and interim NYCHA chair, Kathryn Garcia, and ex-HUD secretary and federal OMB commissioner Shaun Donovan are hoping to vault into the first tier. Each boasts of governmental experience that outstrips the rest of the field. “I am absolutely the most qualified,” Garcia argues. “I think I am the only person in the race who really understands what this job is. This is a day-to-day, deliver for the people job.”Donovan, who was also a housing commissioner under Michael Bloomberg,drew attentionwhen he proposed giving every city child a $1,000 “equity” bond that could grow to $50,000 by the time of their high school graduation. “With all due respect to the other candidates, no one else has ever run a four trillion dollar budget,” he says, referring to his tenure at the federal level. “No one else has sat side by side with Dr. Fauci in the Oval Office or Situation Room.”In the old days, candidates clawed for slivers of the electorate. If no one won 40 percent of the vote, there was a citywide runoff between the top two candidates. These were vicious, if low turnout, affairs. Ranked-choice allows votersto rank their top five candidates. Getting second- and third-place votes matter. The runoff is no more. No one quite knows how this will impact one candidate or another, although everyone has a theory about why they are the most well suited for the new era. It’s already produced coalitions: Stringer and Morales shared a co-endorser, a state senator from the Bronx, and some Democrats are speculating that Stringer wants to elevate Morales to undercut other progressive rivals, including Wiley. Adams, meanwhile, hasaggressively opposed the systementirely, on the premise that the voter education hasn’t been there to make it happen effectively. The race, like the city, is in flux. There is no candidate with a clear claim to the nomination. There is no single woman or man with the best argument, either — not with multiple technocrats, a citywide elected official, an unorthodox figure of national renown, a well-regarded civil rights attorney, and many others seeking the prize of governing one of the world’s great cities. Come 2022, inordinately challenging decisions will have to be made. New York will be emerging, slowly, from pandemic hell. At some point, the new mayor will have to lower the barricades — metaphorically and literally — and enter the streets where the city, ravaged by plague, longs for compelling leadership.“We have to get it right this time,” says Stringer. “We have to have a reset.” ❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

106,Professor defends teaching students to question COVID-19 ‘propaganda’ as NYU investigation continues,11.67,38.33,https://www.thecollegefix.com/professor-defends-teaching-students-to-question-covid-19-propaganda-as-nyu-investigation-continues/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,23,"A New York University professor is suing several colleagues for alleged defamation in relation to his unpopular views on COVID-19 interventions, including the efficacy of masks and particular treatments. The private university opened an investigation againstMark Crispin Miller, a tenured professor in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communications, after 25 facultycalled on the departmentto respond to his “ongoing harm to our students.”Their letter refers to a September incident in Miller’s class “Mass Persuasion and Propaganda.” A female student, who has since dropped out of the course, accused him of promoting right-wing conspiracy theories about COVID-19, and the department chair quickly responded that MCC was considering “next steps.”Miller () responded bybloggingabout the dispute, asking readers to sign a petition in favor of his academic freedom. He mentioned NYU communications to his students and a department email urging him to stop teaching the course, and claimed he was acting in self-defense. The professor toldthat NYU Steinhardt School Dean Jack Knott told him the investigation would conclude by the end of the semester, but gave him no other details. Miller, who has spent more than 20 years on the NYU faculty, filed alawsuitin New York State court Nov. 30 after his colleagues did not retract their statements and apologize as he demanded. He shared several NYU communications withto illustrate his legal claims. Miller explained in a phone interview that he wasn’t suing any of the junior professors who signed the letter: “Whether they signed it, willingly or not, I’m sure they had no choice.”According to the suit, Miller’s colleagues intended to “disgrace and humiliate” the professor “under the guise of phony and uninformed political and cultural correctness and orthodoxy.” He’s seeking $750,000 in damages, saying their letter led to loss of professional standing and the worsening of his Lyme disease. The faculty letter “takes every conceivable opportunity to cast me in a bad light,” Miller told. He also said in a separate email that the charges from his colleagues are “so false as to seem downright psychotic.”:Judge tells NYU it can’t punish students for breaking after-the-fact COVID rulesIf Miller is a right-wing conspiracy theorist, he’s an unconventional one. The professor isnamedon Turning Point USA’s Professor Watchlist, which identifies faculty who allegedly promote “leftist propaganda in the classroom.”He also helped lead a movement in 2012 tohalt NYU’s redevelopment plansfor the Greenwich Village campus. The resulting lawsuitsuccessfully challengednearly half of the university’s expansion plan, though Miller toldthe experience also convinced him not to sue NYU itself this time. Politically, Miller considers himself a leftist: “I’m anti-war, I believe in empowering the working class, cutting back corporate power – I could go on and on.” He said progressive luminaries such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Oliver Stone signed his petition, and Ralph Nader provided a separate statement of support. The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, whopublicly accused NYUof forcing him out of a fellowship because of pressure from Beijing, also signed Miller’s petition, the professor said.:NYU declines to testify in Congress about its China campusBut Miller also believes the left has “changed radically over the years. I don’t really recognize it anymore.” The left today wants “censorship and government authority to be accepted without question—except if it’s Trump,” he said. Some of the professor’s colleagues have long despised him for his course content and extramural statements on subjects including the Sandy Hook massacre and transgender ideology. But a civil liberties group told NYU that Miller’s alleged conduct is expressly protected by its own policies, and cited court rulings against private universities including New York City’s Fordham. One group is not weighing in on the dispute: the American Association of University Professors. A representative toldin an email that AAUP’s department of academic freedom and tenure confirmed “we haven’t been involved with this case,” and declined to comment further. Student Julia Jackson tagged NYU in atweet threadSept. 20 to complain that Miller had “spent an entire class period telling students that wearing masks doesn’t prevent the spread of COVID-19.” She also claimed that he said “hydroxychloroquine trials were made to fail so more people would be given the vaccine and have their DNA changed.”She linked to articles and videos shared by Miller, including atwo–partinterview of Canadian physicist Denis Rancourt on One America News Network (), describing them as conspiratorial and “far-right.”Jacksoncalled onNYU to “relieve him” of educating and advising students. MCC Chair Rodney Benson thanked her for reporting the issue and said the department had “made this a priority.”MillerrespondedOct. 6 on his News From Underground blog, explaining that his pedagogical style is to teach students how to identify propaganda drives and seek out alternative claims. He urged his students to read studies that conclude masks and ventilators are ineffective at preventing transmission of the novel coronavirus and saving lives, “with due attention to the scientific reviews thereof.” Miller cited “possible financial links between” researchers and interests such as “Big Pharma and the Gates Foundation.”The blog post embedded Jackson’s tweet thread and mentioned a Sept. 21 email to Miller’s students from Knott and Carlo Ciotoli, who leads NYU’s COVID-19 Prevention and Response Team.:Miller’s student tries to get him firedMiller providedwith this email (below), which he said a student forwarded to him. Prefaced by the claim that NYU has the “utmost respect for the principles of academic freedom,” it referred students to “the most authoritative public health guidance” – CDCrecommendations.“The evidence backs it up,” the email continued, linking sources. “And we remind you thatwearing a mask is required at NYU.” The NYU leaders said “we do not feel we have a choice” in pushing back on Miller’s alleged comments. Miller said he didn’t tell students to break the university’s mask mandate, which he actively observes – a point emphasized in his lawsuit. The blog post alleged that NYU had urged Miller to cancel his propaganda course because it would be “better for the department” if he instead chose to teach two sections on cinema. (Miller toldSunday that the quoted phrase was from an email sent by the department’s administrative assistant, while a later phone call with Benson, the MCC chair, claimed the change would be better for enrollment.)It linked to apetitionto back Miller’s cause, which as of Monday night has been signed by more than 20,000 people. Miller toldlast week that the blind Chinese lawyer Guangcheng, who memorably escaped house arrest in China, was among them. Guangchengclaimedto have been forced out by NYU following “great, unrelenting pressure” from Chinese communists, at a time when the university was building a campus in Shanghai. NYU stated that Guangcheng’s stay was based on a one-year fellowship and that his claims were “both false and contradicted by the well-established facts,” including that the foreign campus was approved to be built before the dissident’s arrival at NYU. The Oct. 21 faculty letter to Steinhardt Dean Knott and Provost Katherine Fleming criticized the views that “Miller has espoused on his highly visible website” over the years. While it doesn’t say what is “highly visible” about Miller’s blog, the letter complains that “he prominently displays his title as a full tenured professor in our department.”Miller has characterized “transgender surgery as a eugenic form of sterilization,” mocked transgender people and denied “the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting,” they alleged. While Miller has a right to his views, his colleagues object to “discrimination, attacks against students and others in our community, or advocacy for an unsafe learning environment.” Students have complained about his discussion of controversial viewpoints and “non-evidence based arguments” for years, yet frequent complaints to bias review offices and administrators have not “improved” the situation. (The letter does not mention any specific complaints.)Miller’s post that linked Jackson’s public tweets opened an opportunity for “cyberbullying and threatening communication directed toward the student,” which “subsequently occurred and continues,” the letter claimed. I hope@nyuniversity,@nyusteinhardt, and@mccNYUagree that this professor should not be trusted with educating and advising students, and I hope they take immediate steps to relieve him of these duties. 8/— Julia Jackson (@julia_jacks)September 21, 2020:Cornell vaccine mandate only applies to white studentsIt called for an “expedited review” of Miller’s “intimidation tactics, abuses of authority, aggressions and microaggressions, and explicit hate speech,” to be followed by “whatever further disciplinary measures are deemed appropriate.”In an email provided by Miller, Dean Knott told the professor Oct. 29 that an investigation had been opened that day. “I will ask Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs LaRue Allen to begin this review immediately” and decide, based on the collected information, whether to proceed “with next steps as outlined in the Faculty Handbook,” Knott wrote. Miller conveyed his shock at receiving the email in a Thursday phone call with. “I was completely surprised that he hadn’t talked to me first,” he said. In a Zoom meeting requested by Miller, Knott said that NYU “lawyers and provost told him that they had to” investigate. Knott wouldn’t give him the scope of the investigation except that “they would talk to people,” according to Miller. “And I said what people? And he said, faculty and students. And I said, what faculty? None of them have seen me teach. And he said: well yeah, so the students.”Miller then told the dean that he would solicit and send testimonials from current and former students, “maybe 40 letters” so far that “make abundantly clear that there is not a shred of truth” in the colleagues’ letter. He excerpted several in his blog post. A few days after this meeting, Miller confronted his colleagues’ charges in arebuttalhe shared with. He called “nearly all” their claims “demonstrably untrue,” and the letter “misleading in its various insinuations.” Miller did not launch an email campaign against the department, as they claimed, but rather highlighted “NYU’s violation of my academic freedom.”Miller reiterated his public assertion that he simply encouraged students to read “scientific studies—eight randomized, controlled trials, conducted among health professionals over the last 15 years or so—finding that masks are ineffective against transmission of respiratory viruses.”On Sunday he pointedto his Sept. 5essay“Masking Ourselves to Death” for sources:researchfrom Rancourt, the Canadian physicist, as well asJoshua Jacobs,B. J. Cowling,Faisal bin-Reza,Jeffrey Smith,Vittoria Offeddu,Lewis RadonovichandYoulin Long. The essay mentions the two-part interview with Rancourt and adebatehe had with “another COVID-19 dissident,” physician Joseph Mercola, whose videos “have been banned on YouTube and Spotify since mid-June.” Miller also provided alinkto Mercola’s website pertaining to the censorship. Miller emphasized that he “very clearly” told students that he was “telling you not to wear masks,” but simply engaging in an intellectual exercise. Responding to the email from Knott and Ciotoli, he noted the CDC guidelines “that you regard as gospel truth abruptly changed in early April.” Previously they had “echoed the consensus of the [randomized controlled trials] that I encouraged my students to examine.”It is “wholly false” that he “attacked” Jackson, when in fact “the student attacked, on Twitter, demanding that NYU fire me.” She didn’t speak up during that class and did not “bother reading any of those studies,” he claimed. “How, and where, and when,I‘attacked’ her your letter fails to specify—as it could not, because I never did.”NYU professor who questions COVID orthodoxy demands colleagues retract false claims about himbyThe College Fixon Scribd:Stanford lockdown skeptic disinvited from academic conferenceBy publicly writing under her own name, Jackson tweets “provoked attacks by others, which had nothing to do with me,” Miller continued, adding that he had received similar attacks spurred by Jackson’s tweets. (While he mentioned “three media hit-pieces” against him, Miller did not identify the articles.)He only identified Jackson by name once, in the petition defending himself, to show that she demanded his firing. “To cast me as the aggressor in this case is as perverse as your accusing me of having attacked” the department, he said. His website does not have “a single mention of Sandy Hook” and he only mentioned the school massacre in a class discussion on gun control. Miller recommended “some troublingly compelling scholarship on Sandy Hook” to students, because “we cannot simply rule out any argument that deviates from the official story.” (He exempted speculation about child-sex-slave colonies on Mars, whichsaid was shared by a guest on theAlex Jones Show.)Regarding the alleged transgender mockery, Miller said the university “quickly exculpated” him from secondhand claims by a colleague, defendant Nicole Starosielski, based on “three brief online writings.”His writing on the subject is “highly critical of transgender” because of its “troubling real-world consequences” in sports and prisons and the “radical medical intervention in the sexual development of children.” The ideology has also been aggressively promoted throughout the corporate media with the backing of “multibillionaires with large investments in Big Pharma,” which might have “eugenic purposes.”Miller cited his own “pleasant” email exchange with a transgender colleague at NYU. Though this person signed the letter against him, he understands “why she may have felt obliged” to sign it. The professor said he could make his own allegations about a “hostile work environment” going back “some time, but especially this semester,” citing comments from students about faculty disparaging him. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education told NYU President Andrew Hamilton in a Nov. 13letterthat the university’s ownstated commitmentto academic freedom meant it must end the investigation into Miller. The civil liberties group noted a New York court ruled in 2019 thatFordham violated its contractual commitmentsby refusing to recognize a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. In a 2018 case closely paralleling the factual allegations in Miller’s dispute, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled thatMarquette University could not punisha professor’s extramural expressions because of its contractual promises on academic freedom. NYU did not respond toqueries on how its Miller investigation was any different from the rulings cited by FIRE. When the university ignored FIRE’s Nov. 20 deadline to respond, the grouppublicly condemnedNYU’s investigation. A spokesperson for the civil liberties group toldlast week that NYU has still not responded. Miller has long been a bee in NYU’s bonnet. He’s one of several named plaintiffs in anongoing class action suitagainst its “mismanagement of our retirement funds,” he told. Having seen the university’s lawyers in action, Miller said they are “extraordinarily aggressive when it comes to legal action.”He’s more surprised by criticism from colleagues – “people whom I did everything I could to serve in trying to halt the real estate plan” and protecting pension funds. Some of them “wrote letters of recommendation” when Miller was “nominated for a distinguished teaching award in 2012.”He emphasized that “I’m not saying this to brag. I’m saying this to demonstrate how egregious this attack is.” Only one faculty member – untenured, from the School of Professional Studies – went to bat for him. Miller is the one person “above all” that the instructor recommends to her students, she wrote to President Hamilton and Provost Fleming Dec. 6. (Miller removed the colleague’s name from the email he showed.):Trump advisor blasts Stanford colleagues for shutting down COVID-19 debateHis propaganda course is the “best” to make students “critical thinkers, a person who can question mass delusions whether they be scientific or political.” She compared Miller to Galileo and Copernicus, who were “condemned for exploring unpopular truths.”The colleague asked rhetorically, whether “Christopher Columbus was a hero or whether masks do prevent the spread of a virus, don’t we want to encourage one and all to look at all the material out there?”Miller toldhe doesn’t attribute the hostility to his political views, but rather to the “discomfiture” his work causes colleagues. He closely studies “official narratives to determine whether they are true or false and to try to figure out what purpose they serve and what interests are behind them.”The political right doesn’t have a monopoly on critiquing the “echo chambers” of academia, he said: “I think it’s also possible to make the same critique from a left-perspective.”Miller sees something similar occurring with the COVID-19 pandemic",2,Generally Reliable,0.0489640614640614,0.3742497172497173,3854,2,The College Fix
107,‘From hearsay to hard evidence’: are UFOs about to go mainstream?,-0.33,43.67,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/ufos-uap-america-pentagon-report,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"Nick Pope spent the early 1990s investigatingUFOsfor the British ministry of defence. Sequestered in a rarely visited government office – the “metaphorical basement” – he well remembers how his field of work was regarded.“I would walk down the corridor and people would whistle the theme music to either Close Encounters of the Third Kind or the Twilight Zone,” Pope told the Guardian. Towards the end of his spell at the MoD, a new science fiction show featuring a pair of FBI alien hunters was also growing in popularity. “I do recall the X-Files theme tune being whistled, too,” he said. In the nearly two decades since then, attitudes towards UFOs have slowly been changing, especially in America where the subject matter has gone from the margins to the mainstream, with even former president Barack Obama opining on their potential existence. Rebranded by governments and enthusiasts as “UAPs”, or unidentified aerial phenomena, 2021 has seen arguably the first ever serious discussion of unknown flying things. In June the Pentagon is set to releasea highly anticipated reporton what it knows about UAPs, and the excitement about that disclosure has been fueled by a slew of witnesses coming forward to share their experiences with the 60 Minutes news show in May. Obama was among many public figures to add his thoughts on UAPs and the Pentagon report this month.“There’s footage and records of objects in the skies, that we don’t know exactly what they are, we can’t explain how they moved, their trajectory,” Obama said inan interviewwith CBS. “They did not have an easily explainable pattern. And so, you know I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.”The sincerity of the discussion around UAPs – “I want us to take it seriously and have a process to take it seriously,” the Republican senator Marco Rubio told 60 Minutes – is a far cry from the jeers Pope once faced. So what has changed in America?“In the last three years it has been elevated above just hearsay and segued into hard evidence,” said Pope, who is now based in Arizona, said. “Not just the testimony from military pilots who’ve been involved in encounters with these things, but radar data and the infra-red camera videos that everyone’s seen.”In recent years a series of government videos showing UAPs, have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet which showed an oblong objectflying through the skynear San Diego in 2004. This April photos and videos taken by navy personnel wereleakedonline, showing triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in the sky, and in May leaked military footage showedan oval flying objectnear a navy ship in San Diego – an apparent UAP hotspot. Members of the navy saw UAPs so frequently that the encounters became commonplace, Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot, told 60 Minutes.“Every day,” Graves said. “Every day for at least a couple years.”For Ted Roe, who runs the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena, a non-profit where pilots or others can report their experiences with UAPs, this was merely confirmation of what he already knew.“That doesn’t surprise me at all,” Roe said. “Somewhere in the world every day this is happening – it manifests steadily, daily. And from my private conversations with current and former military fliers I feel that the reports that I get – as far as pilot reports – are clearly the tip of the iceberg.”But for all the apparent easing of taboo around UAPs, Roe says there is still a stigma.“Nobody is willing to risk their careers or reputation on this subject, even now,” Roe said. “Pilots won’t contact us until they retire. I’d say it’s almost 50-50, the cases I get, that are more recent, versus those that happened years ago and they didn’t want to talk about because they would lose their flight status, and because they were worried about their careers.”The government – all governments – have previously been reluctant to even acknowledge that they monitor UAPs. In 2007 the US defense department launched an “Advanced aerospace threat identification program” to investigate UFOs. The effort was so secretive that the public was only made aware of it 10 years later, aftera New York Times investigation. As leaked or officially published footage has spread, however, demands for transparency from the public and politicians has grown, prompting the CIA torelease thousands of documentson UAPs in January 2021. Rubio, the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, has been a particularly loud voice, and he was part of a group of elected officials who succeeded in thrusting theIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021into the $2.3tn coronavirus relief spending bill signed into law by Donald Trump in December. That act ordered government agencies to provide a declassified “detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence”, and “a detailed description of an interagency process” for reporting UFOs. The report must be handed over by 25 June.“Men and women we have entrusted with the defense of our country are reporting encounters with unidentified aircraft with superior capabilities,” Rubio toldthe Tampa Bay Timesin mid-May.“We cannot allow the stigma of UFOs to keep us from seriously investigating this. The forthcoming report is one step in that process, but it will not be the last.”The flurry of recent videos and the imminent release of the report has ignited an excitement around unidentified flying things not seen for years. Pope warned, however, that after years of furtiveness from intelligence agencies, people should not expect the government to releaseit knows about these mysterious objects in the sky.“The report must be unclassified, but it could have a classified annex, so there’s a strong possibility that any earth-shattering facts will be in that classified annex, rather than the unclassified report,” Pope said. He added: “So people should be excited, but not too excited. They should be pragmatic, and a little expectation management might be useful.”",3,Reliable,0.0465480143904801,0.438191504081915,1315,3,The Guardian

When Trump granted a commutation toCraig Cesal, by contrast, he freed a man who had already served 17 years of what was originally a life sentence for repairing trucks that were used to transport marijuana. As those examples reflect, Trump's acts of clemency mixed favors to cronies with relief for genuinely deserving federal prisoners hit with grossly disproportionate penalties. Thecontroversyover his choices highlightslongstanding problemswith a clemency system that is a woefully inadequate remedy for the injustices routinely inflicted by rigid and draconian federal sentences. Trump'sfinal batchof 70 commutations broughthis totalto 94, which included dozens of nonviolent drug offenders, 18 of whom had received life sentences. He shortened more sentences than all but one of his eight most recent predecessors. The one exception is Barack Obama, whogranteda record 1,715 commutations, nearly all in his second term and the vast majority during his last year in office. Even Obama, however,approvedjust 5 percent of petitions for commutations, five times Trump's rate (which was in turn 10 times George W. Bush's rate) but still pretty slim odds for people languishing behind bars, often because of conduct that violated no one's rights. On Trump's last day in office,complainedthat he had ""largely bypassed a rigorous Justice Department process for vetting and approving"" pardons and commutations. Yet that process, as theTimesnotedtwo days later, ""has left thousands of petitions waiting for review with a small team of lawyers unable to keep up.""Margaret Colgate Love, who served as the Justice Department's pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997,saysshe was ""continually frustrated by the hostility of the prosecutors to whom I reported, who evidently feared that pardon would undo their hard work."" Those prosecutors ""were unreceptive to suggestions that pardon could tell good news about their work by showcasing rehabilitation and redemption.""As a result, Love says, ""the Justice Department sent few favorable pardon recommendations to the White House."" While some of the system's critics think the White House should cut the Justice Department out of the process (as Trump effectively did) to avoid this conflict of interest, Love argues that a better approach would be for Congress to let judges or executive agencies perform some of the clemency system's functions. People often seek pardons, for example, to recover their Second Amendment rights, something that Love suggests could be accomplished ""by application to an administrative agency or a court."" She notes that the FIRST STEP Act, a 2018 law that Trump supported, authorized judges to reduce prisoners' sentences for ""extraordinary and compelling reasons,"" a reform that could be expanded to cover many of the people who are now desperately hoping for commutations. President Joe Biden haspromisedthat he will ""broadly use his clemency power for certain non-violent and drug crimes."" He should do that throughout his administration, instead of waiting until he is nearly out of office. Biden also favors abolishing the mandatory minimum sentences that hechampionedfor decades as a senator. Such reforms, especially if they are retroactive, would have a much bigger impact than liberal use of clemency: During the first year after the FIRST STEP Act took effect, its relatively modest changes resulted inshorter sentencesfor more than 7,000 people. That amounts to less than 5 percent offederal prisoners, nearly half of whom are serving time fordrug offenses. But the law still helped four times as many prisoners in one year than even Obama managed through commutations in eight. If Biden truly wants to atone for hislong historyas a hardline drug warrior, he cannot let sentencing reform sink to the bottom of his priorities.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1334715136054421,0.4235863095238095,866,2,Reason
109,Supreme Court ruling on student speech could impact Pasco school rules,0.0,46.33,https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2021/06/23/supreme-court-ruling-on-student-speech-could-impact-pasco-school-rules/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tampa-bay-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,21,"A U. S. Supreme Court decision upholding students’ First Amendment rights might change the way one Tampa Bay area school district deals with students’ off-campus comments. In an 8-1 ruling issued Wednesday, the court found that a Pennsylvania school district was wrong to suspend a student who made profane Snapchat statements about campus activities after she did not win a spot on the varsity cheer team. While schools have some room to discipline students for things said outside school, the majority wrote, they do not have blanket authority to control all student speech.“[T]he school itself has an interest in protecting a student’s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. “America’s public schools are the nurseries of democracy. Our representative democracy only works if we protect the ‘marketplace of ideas.’”Pasco County school district officials had been keeping close tabs on the case. A year ago, the School Board amended its student code of conduct to include potential punishments for students on teams or clubs who make derogatory online comments while wearing school gear. Pasco students could face suspension or dismissal from their team, and in some cases teams could forfeit games or events. Director of student services Melissa Musselwhite said the rule was meant to target instances such as students in uniform posting TikTok videos that depict violence or making negative statements about school — particularly if they cause campus disruptions. Given the nature of the Pennsylvania case, and the court’s support of the plaintiff’s right to make general criticisms on her own time, Musselwhite said the district would reexamine whether its stance could hold.“We’re definitely going to look at it,” she said. “We won’t take very long.”School Board chairman Allen Altman favored the restrictions placed on students in uniform, saying they should positively represent their schools. He added, though, that if the district rule does not meet legal muster, it would be fixed. The board updates policies at least twice a year to reflect changes in state and federal law, and court precedents. Officials in the Pinellas and Hillsborough county school districts said they did not have rules in their codes of conduct that go as far as Pasco. Their regulations over student speech adhere more closely to the areas the court found permissible to govern, such as dealing with bullying, cheating, threats and safety concerns. Pinellas, for instance, has a policy on First Amendment freedom of expression, which states in part, “when a student exercises that right, the student must do so in a responsible manner that does not cause a disruption of the school or a school activity. A principal may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on your exercise of First Amendment freedom of expression when there is evidence of imminent disruption of the school.”School Board member Nicole Carr, a former assistant principal, said she was pleased the court left intact schools’ ability to deal with threats and bullying that occurs off campus. She agreed that the Pennsylvania school district went too far in suspending the student because of her Snapchat tirade.“If someone expressed an opinion that doesn’t negatively impact an individual or constitute bullying, you should be able to articulate your opinion,” Carr said. The Pennsylvania case arose from posts made by Brandi Levy, who was 14 at the time and just starting high school. One post pictured her and a friend with raised middle fingers and repeated use of a vulgarity to complain that she had been left off the varsity cheerleading squad.“F--k school f--k softball f--k cheer f--k everything,” she wrote. Now 18, Levy recently finished her first year of college. Levy’s parents filed a federal lawsuit after the cheerleading coach suspended her from the junior varsity team for a year. Lower courts ruled in Levy’s favor, and she was reinstated. The school district appealed to the Supreme Court after the broad appellate ruling that said off-campus student speech was beyond schools’ authority to punish. The dispute is the latest in a line of a cases that began withTinker v. Des Moines, the Vietnam-era case of a high school in Des Moines, Iowa, that suspended students who wore armbands to protest the war. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court sided with the students, declaring students don’t “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”The court also held then that schools retained the authority to restrict speech that would disrupt the school environment. Breyer wrote that Levy’s case seemed less serious than its Vietnam-era predecessor, decided in 1969. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he would have upheld Levy’s suspension. Pinellas School Board attorney David Koperski said he did not see any need to change the district’s policies because of the ruling. He said the decision seemed to generally uphold 50 years of case law without breaking much new ground. He speculated that the court took up the case “not to make any new rules, but rather to essentially overturn the 3rd Circuit Appellate Court’s statement that the seminal 1969 case ... did not applyat allto off-campus speech.”That would have been a significant change, Koperski said. Jim Porter, the lawyer for the Hillsborough School Board, agreed that the ruling offered more of a clarification for school districts as they deal with student speech issues. The Hillsborough code of conduct does not spell out any specifics on student free speech.“I don’t anticipate, based on this decision, we would have to change anything,” Porter said.

110,The Left Wants to Eliminate Competing Ideas,21.0,27.33,https://stream.org/the-left-wants-to-eliminate-competing-ideas/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,24,"ByMichael BrownPublished onJanuary 19, 2021•It was President Dwight Eisenhower who once wrote that “in a democracy debate is the breath of life.” Today, it seems as if the left wants to snuff that breath out. Competing ideas must be censored and even cancelled. Only PC groupthink will be tolerated. Back in 2012, GLAAD, which originally stood for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,launchedits so-called “Commentator Accountability Project.”It started with a list of 36 “anti-gay” commentators, people whom GLAAD urged the mainstream media to keep off the air. Why? The views of these commentators were considered dangerous and could hurt people. Plus, GLAAD alleged, they really weren’t expert in their fields. Among the first names listed were Chuck Colson, Tony Perkins, and Jim Daly. Blacklist them! (For other names on the original list, gohere. Thecurrent listhas expanded considerably.)As GLAADexplained:The GLAAD Commentator Accountability Project (CAP) aims to put critical information about frequent anti-gay interviewees into the hands of newsrooms, editors, hosts and reporters. Journalists or producers who are on deadline often don’t have the time to dig into the histories of a commentator. Audiences need to be aware that when they’re not talking to the mainstream media, these voices are comparing LGBTQ people to Nazi Germany, predicting that equal treatment of LGBTQ people will lead to the total collapse of society, and even making accusations of satanic influence. So, these conservative leaders, presented in the most misleading fashion possible, should be kept off the major networks. Their ideas — actually, our ideas, since I was on that list as well — were too toxic to be entertained. Only the pro-gay side could be presented. In light of that, I suggested that GLAAD really stood for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Disagreement. Dissenting positions must be banned. Today, however, the attempt to stifle competing viewpoints has expanded well-beyond LGBT circles. We have seen the rise of the campus thought police, with our colleges and universities replete with trigger warnings and safe spaces. We have seen Big Tech’s attempts to censor and control. And now, in the aftermath of the storming of the Capitol, the witch hunt is out in full force. If you voted for Donald Trump, you too stormed the Capitol. If you supported his policies, you are, by default, a xenophobic white supremacist. If you preferred Trump to Hillary or Biden, you present a real threat to America and you must be either purged or reeducated. Your words are dangerous. Your views are dangerous. You yourself are dangerous. Back in October 2020, Keith Olbermannopined, “The terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box. And then he, and his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators, and the Mike Lees and the William Barrs and the Sean Hannnitys and the Mike Pences and the Rudy Gulianis and the Kyle Rittenhouses and the Amy Coney Barretts must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it and rebuild the world that Trump has nearly destroyed by turning it over to a virus. Remember it.”Today, the net is being cast even wider, in particular when it comes to shutting down opposing views. During a recent segment on CNN with Brian Stelter, Alex Stamos, a former Facebook chief security officer,said, “We are going to have to figure out the OANN [One America News Network] and Newsmax problem.”Indeed, he noted, “These companies have freedom of speech, but I’m not sure we need Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and such bringing them into tens of millions of homes.”And so, Stamos concluded, “We have to turn down the capability of these conservative influencers to reach these huge audiences.”They must be stopped in their tracks. Freedom only goes so far. So the cat is clearly out of the bag. These rightwing nut jobs, who directly incited the storming of the Capitol, must be starved out if not shut down. And this comes from CNN, the last network in America that can accuse other networks of extreme bias while keeping a straight face. Are you kidding me? (For the record, I wish that all networks, on all sides, would be more circumspect in their reporting and rhetoric, given the tumultuous times in which we live.)Even someone like Katie Couric, hardly considered a radical leftist, couldsayto Bill Maher, “And the question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump.”Note that word carefully: deprogram. The interesting thing is that I do believe there is a cult of Trump. I’ve even put together achecklistto help identify those trapped in this cultlike way of thinking. And the people who stormed the Capitol are dangerous fanatics who must be denounced without qualification. As Iwrotepreviously, those involved did not represent anything truly Christian, despite the “Christian” expression of some of the participants. (This includes their despicable prayer in Jesus’ name in the Halls of Congress, which they had just taken over. It’s one of the more repulsive scenes I’ve ever witnessed.)But let’s not deceive ourselves. The left wants to cast us all in the same light. All of us should be viewed as brainwashed cultists. As for those on the left having a cultlike devotion to their own ideologies, they seem oblivious even to the possibility. It’s true that some on the right are worked up into a lather, their fears exaggerated beyond measure, like the person who responded to one of myarticles, saying, “In 4 years, under Biden, we will be lucky if we are still allowed to have a Bible in our homes.

111,Eating out costing more as Chicago restaurants emerge from the pandemic — and price hikes may not slow down anytime soon,-1.67,46.33,https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/ct-food-restaurants-more-expensive-cost-eating-out-covid-19-20210709-dwkaz2cy2nbyll7pfyzgf7qht4-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-07-09,25,"Classic burgers are cooked up at Big Guys Sausage Stand in Berwyn. Cooks Adam Bryant, left, and Orlando Loyola prepare meals for customers at Big Guys Sausage Stand in Berwyn on July 9, 2021. Restaurant prices are rising due to an array of factors, including rising costs of food and other supply chain goods, as well as the rising cost of employing people. Among those reacting is Big Guys Sausage Stand, which is adding a 10% surcharge. Classic cheeseburgers are cooked up at Berwyn's Big Guys Sausage Stand.

A customer shows her order and 10% surcharge at Big Guys Sausage Stand in Berwyn. When Big Guys Sausage Stand opened its doors Friday, everything on the menu was 15% more expensive. The Berwyn restaurant, known for its burgers, sausages and an appearance on a Food Network show in 2012, has had plenty of customers in recent months. But the cost of seemingly everything has risen, Big Guys owner Brendan O’Connor said: chicken is up 200%, beef is up 150%, packaging (“if we can get it”) is up 20%. O’Connor gave all employees a raise this spring amid an industry wide labor shortage. Even the cost of bread is up 5%. The result? Despite sales O’Connor would have longed for five years ago, Big Guys is losing money.“To be as busy as we are and not making money is a real hard pill to swallow,” he said. Footing the bill? You. And get used to it, because in the reopened phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, restaurant prices in Chicago and beyond are on the rise.“Absolutely we have to do this to survive,” O’Connor said of the price hikes. “How long can you lose money until the money runs out?”Restaurant owners across Chicago and the United States are asking the same question — and reaching similar conclusions. Menu prices are “running hot” nationwide, up an average of about 4% in 2021, said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic, a restaurant and food industry research and consulting company. Menu inflation, typically closer to 2.5%, is expected to stay elevated, Henkes said; Technomic forecasts prices to rise about 3% next year. Fast-food restaurant menus are seeing even higher spikes, averaging about 6% jumps in 2021, he said.“We’re seeing price increases we haven’t seen in a long time, and at a faster rate than history would suggest,” Henkes said. The pandemic disrupted the labor market and the supply chain for nearly everything restaurants need to operate, forcing operators to rethink their menus and how they charge customers.“They’re just trying to maintain margins and profitability,” Henkes said. “Sales are surging, but costs are surging even more than their sales.”Several restaurant owners and industry observers said more expensive restaurant outings are here to stay. After all, restaurant prices rarely go down. But the increases come with additional questions: Have restaurant prices historically been artificially low? Does the entire pricing model of eating out need to be rethought?Some restaurants have turned their backs on the old way of doing things — charging competitive prices to draw customers, the n relying on tips to round out server wages — by instituting surcharges for gratuity and employee health care. Though the restaurant industry has regained its footing thanks to states lifting capacity limits, summer weather and increasing vaccination rates, “this is still a time of rebuilding and vulnerability for the hardest hit operations,” Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of research for the National Restaurant Association, said by email. Between increased labor and wholesale costs, restaurants are left with few options other than raising prices, he said.“Many small business restaurants have made all of the cuts and changes they can over the last year, and now are having to substantially increase menu prices to deal with the pressure on their already thin margins,” he said. Henkes said the price increases don’t seem to have had an adverse impact, at least not yet. After more than a year of pandemic lock downs and restrictions, consumers appear ready to spend.“People are not all that price sensitive and not conscious about getting a good deal,” Henkes said. “They want experience and they’ve been generally willing to pay the higher prices.”Fall may present a bigger hurdle, he said. But by that time, some of the labor and supply chain issues could be resolved, which could slow the growth of restaurant prices.“As we get into the fall and the industry and, knock on wood, everything goes in the right direction, consumers will start to notice costs a little bit more and things will start to moderate a little bit,” he said. But restaurant operators will remain focused on profitability, he said, whether by raising prices, tweaking menus to focus on higher-priced items with the greatest profitability or implementing surcharges — the route Big Guys is adopting. A broken ventilation motor in the hood above Big Guys’ grill shuttered the restaurant just before July Fourth, and O’Connor used the time to significantly raise prices, which he said he should have done at least two months ago. And, in fact, he nearly did. Stressed by his soaring costs, O’Connor raised menu prices one night before bed in late April, and significantly. The cost of his signature cheeseburger was poised to spike 32% overnight, from $7.95 to $10.50. But in the morning, fearing customer reaction, he dropped prices to more palatable increases, inching that cheeseburger to $8.50 instead.“I thought, ‘People are gonna laugh at me trying to sell a 6-ounce burger for $10.50,’ ” he said. “Even if it is a good burger, don’t get me wrong.”In retrospect, O’Connor said, he should have stuck with the price increase.“But you’re really scared to raise prices,” he said. Now, he said, he has no choice. Big Guys still isn’t profitable, and subtle coronavirus-related consumer shifts have taken additional bites from the bottom line: people have started paying almost universally with credit cards, which comes with about a 3% hit to Big Guys; before the pandemic, about half of sales were cash, O’Connor said. Also, more people are ordering delivery, which O’Connor contracts through a third-party service that charges fees. So O’Connor launched a 15% surcharge Friday, added online as “service charges” and explained at the restaurant as a “supply chain surcharge.” A couple of customers complained and, urged by a manager, he dropped it to 10% after an hour — which is where it will stand. He said he’d like to drop the extra charge eventually, but has “no idea” when he will be able to. And when he does, it may be paired with another modest price increase across the menu. The pandemic actually went reasonably well for Big Guys, O’Connor said. Because the restaurant is primarily carryout, it was well positioned to navigate what was a downturn for much of the industry. Things started getting difficult in the spring, and he’s been losing money for nearly two months.“At first I just figured this is a temporary supply chain thing and we’d weather the storm, and I didn’t want to be reactive and increase prices and scare customers away,” he said. “But now it’s dragging on for months.”Derek Gaspar, owner of Lucky Platter, an upscale diner in Evanston, posted an open letter to customers in May announcing a likely 5% price increase for all menu items. The letter, sent by email to customers and available via QR code in the restaurant’s bathrooms, said the prices increases would mostly be used to offset a 12.5% raise given to kitchen staff in May, boosting starting salaries for cooks to $18 per hour and $15 an hour for dishwashers.“Over the next few weeks we will be working hard to come up with other cost-saving ideas that will help us fund this dramatic increase,” the letter says. “At the end of the day though, the final say comes from what the customer will pay for these services. So it probably goes without saying, but I will err on the side of transparency, a price increase directly targeting this wage increase is soon coming.”In an interview, Gaspar said the price increases will probably happen in the coming weeks, ranging between 3% and 5%. As a former server at a high-end downtown restaurant, Gaspar said, he’s acutely aware of pay inequities in the restaurant industry, and wants to play a role in balancing the scales forced into reality by the labor shortage. But by paying staff more — and paired with the same supply chain cost increases others are facing — he said he needs customers to share the cost.“It’s what I have to do and if it doesn’t work out, it’s best thing I could think to do,” he said. “I have to take the pressure off myself.”His concern is that higher prices will lead customers to eat out less. He’s already girding for it, and thinking more expansively as a result. This past fall, he took over a small space beside Lucky Platter that he opened in March as a bodega, selling drinks, pastries and meals to go from the Lucky Platter kitchen, including frozen soups and chicken pot pie. Even if he loses some sit-down diners, he hopes they’ll buy a chicken pot pie that costs Lucky Platter less to make and costs the customer less than a meal at the restaurant.“It’s like a chess game, right? You make the next move and the next move, and you think of things you didn’t think of at the beginning,” he said. “If you raise prices, the same (stuff) might happen again. I don’t know if it’s the fix, but for the small business owner, it has to be.”jbnoel@chicagotribune.comWhat to eat. What to watch. What you need to live your best life … now. Sign up for our Eat.

112,Senate confirms progressive tech critic Lina Khan to become an FTC commissioner,-6.67,44.33,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/senate-confirms-lina-khan-to-become-ftc-commissioner.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnbc/,2021-06-15,25,"Progressive tech critic Lina Khan wassworn inas chair of the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, the agency said in a release. News that Khan would lead the agency came just hours after she was confirmed by the Senate to serve as a commissioner. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who leads the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, first announced the new title at a hearing on Tuesday afternoon. The Senate approved Khan's nomination as a commissioner earlier in the day in a 69-28 vote. The promotion puts the direction of the FTC in the hands of the young academic who helped launch a reckoning amongst antitrust scholars and enforcers. At 32, she was already the youngest commissioner ever confirmed to the agency, let alone to lead it. The Senate approved her nomination earlier in the day in a 69-28 vote. As chair, Khan will have the ability to steer the direction of the agency to a greater extent than she would as a commissioner. That makes the announcement a significant statement on President Joe Biden’s intended direction for the commission, suggesting he wants to see a progressive agenda. Khan will take over the helm from Acting Chair and Democrat Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who has led the commission under Biden’s presidency. Biden is expected to name a third commissioner to succeed Democrat Rohit Chopra, whom he has nominated to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The FTC is made up of five commissioners who vote on enforcement matters, with no more than three coming from the same party. Khan’s confirmation signals a bipartisan desire to impose more regulations on Big Tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Apple. She received the support of several Republicans, including Commerce Committee Ranking Member Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who participated in her confirmation hearing. Still, others like Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, opposed her confirmation. Lee has tended to be cautious about certain types of regulation despite concerns about tech companies' influence and previously expressed apprehension about Khan's experience. Khan became a well-known figure in antitrust circles after writing ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox"" for the Yale Law Review in 2017, while a student at the university. The paper made the case for using a different framework for evaluating competitive harm than the popular consumer welfare standard. That standard essentially says that antitrust law violations can be determined based on harm to consumers, which is often measured based on prices. But Khan argued that standard could miss significant competitive harm in the modern economy, such as predatory pricing that lowers consumer prices in the short term but allows a company that can afford it to quickly gain market share. She also argued that both owning and selling on a marketplace, like Amazon does, could allow a business to exploit information across their ecosystem to undercut the competition. In the years since, Khan has become a recognized name among those in the field and a noted figure among progressives eager to see more expansive enforcement of antitrust laws. She participated in the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, helping to compile the report from Democratic staff that found each held monopoly power. The report recommended legislative reforms to reinvigorate competition in digital markets, which informed several recent proposals introduced by subcommittee members last week. Khan specifically worked on the Google section of the Democratic report. The company has since been sued on antitrust grounds by the Department of Justice and several states. As chair, Khan will be tasked with voting on enforcement matters in areas of both competition and consumer protection. That means she will also have to deal with questions of whether companies have effectively secured their customers' data or misled them with deceptive marketing or so-called dark patterns that can influence users' choices online through calculated designs. Khan could end up voting on whether to bring antitrust cases against some of the very tech companies she has investigated in the past. The FTC has been probing Amazon on antitrust grounds,Bloomberghas reported. But Khan's past writing on the company has already made some lawmakers question whether she would be allowed to vote on the case or be expected to recuse herself. Khan told Lee at her confirmation hearing that she does not have any financial conflicts that would indicate recusal under ethics laws and that she would follow the evidence where it leads. More recently, Khan joined the faculty at Columbia Law School, teaching antitrust as an associate professor. Before that role, Khan worked as legal director for anti-monopoly group the Open Markets Institute and as a legal advisor to Chopra at the FTC.""Congress created the FTC to safeguard fair competition and protect consumers, workers, and honest businesses from unfair & deceptive practices,"" Khan tweeted following the vote. ""I look forward to upholding this mission with vigor and serving the American public.""WATCH: Big Tech may face even more scrutiny for antitrust and monopoly in 2021—Here's why",3,Reliable,0.1219552669552669,0.3539051226551226,1059,3,CNBC

114,The Left Will Not Let Go of COVID,17.67,27.0,https://spectator.org/covid-masks-left/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,23,"COVID’s grip on America is relaxing, not so the Left’s. The Left seized COVID as an unprecedented statist opportunity to advance their agenda. Unsurprisingly, they now resist relinquishing it. Since the Left refuse to let go of America, America must let go of the Left. Last week the CDCrelaxedits guidelines for outdoor mask-wearing by those fully vaccinated against COVID. It was more a rearguard action than a vanguard one, but at least it was a start. Several states are well ahead in their return to normalcy. America’s virus statistics demonstrate the remission of the virus and validate accelerating relaxation of the lockdowns. On a seven-day moving average, active cases, daily new cases, and daily deaths have been plummeting since the beginning of the year. On the ledger’s other side, vaccinations began in the U. S. in December, averaging over two million a day since February; as a result, around 31 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated at this writing. Beyond just the statistics, we have long known who the most vulnerable are — the elderly and those with preexisting conditions — and who are not: children. This understanding and the response to it have led to the U. S.’s overall 98 percent survival rate, which is far higher in the least vulnerable. Despite this, the lockdowns have overwhelmingly taken a one-size-fits-none approach, and nowhere more than in school closings. As of the end of April, only 14 states required in-person instruction with plentiful conditions (for all or some grades and either full or part time). All evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, the Left have little interest in relaxing their COVID power grab. Only eight states have lifted restrictions. Oregon is consideringextendingits mask and social distancing mandates on businesses indefinitely. COVID presented the Left with the statist opportunity of a lifetime. Of course, the most left of America’s major unions have been the epitome of reopeningresistance: teachers unions. In most states, they have resisted returning to classrooms like truants. The Capitol Hill newspaperrecentlyreportedthat when Congress earlier this year debated “reopening schools and including money for education in a massive coronavirus relief package, the nation’s largest teachers unions sharply increased their spending on political contributions … The money overwhelmingly went to Democrats.”The Left’s refusal to let go of lockdown protocols, even in the face of mounting evidence that supports doing so, is hardly surprising because they so eagerly seized them initially. Blue governments locked down earlier, longer, and more severely than red governments — often doing so in unnecessary and even counterproductive ways. The temptation and opportunity for unprecedented control were simply too great. COVID presented the Left with the statist opportunity of a lifetime, justifying, under the cover of COVID, the ultimate masking: the use of government power to advance their preexisting agenda. Naturally, the Left acted most robustly where government was already most intrusive. So unique was the COVID crisis that they were able to move aggressively and with astonishing alacrity. Starting in California and New York, America was effectively locked down in short order. What the Left could not have prevailed on at the ballot box, they obtained by fiat. All was shrouded under a cloak of necessity and moral superiority, with questioners muzzled by righteous indignation. So successful were the Left that they were able to go beyond just the government’s reach and into public opprobrium to enforce their goals. Virtually everything the Left had sought incrementally for decades, and with only marginal success, they pursued headlong. The $5.5 trillion in federal spending alone — over a quarter of the size of the entire federal debt in 2020 — in just over a year has provided unimaginable resources for income redistribution. It has also provided billions to cash-strapped blue governments whose long-time leftist policies had already pushed them to bankruptcy’s brink. Nationwide lockdowns have provided an incredible opportunity for every facet of business regulation. In many locations, this regulation has gone beyond how businesses legally operate to whether or not they can operate at all. And school closures for over a year have given teachers unions complete control of schools and their curricula. Never have parents been more excluded from decision-making, and never have students’ needs been more disregarded. Yet as successful as the Left have been, they are not done. Even as the Biden administration proposes another $4 trillion in more spending and corresponding taxes on corporations and the wealthy (the Left’s favorite targets), the Left complain that both are inadequate. COVID may be winding down, but the Left are still winding up. The Left cannot and will not let go because such a unique opportunity is not readily relinquished. Their policy opportunity has far outstripped their political one. There was no mandate for the Left’s policies in the 2020 election, and the slim advantage Democrats hold today could be gone tomorrow — in November 2022 to be exact. So the left are pushing to get more through their closing COVID opening and ensure what they have gotten under the auspices of emergency becomes permanent. Historically, the Left never willingly relinquished power. Unlike conservatives, whose highest faith lies in the private sector, to which they would yield more authority, the Left sees government — especially if they control it — as the highest aspiration for society’s administration. Name a single left-supported program that the Left have ever been willing to see discontinued. Demonstrable failure or success makes no difference to the Left. Their response is always the same: The program in question needs more resources and authority, either to correct its rationalized shortcomings or to expand its claimed achievements. The Left also are aware that once COVID is no longer a national emergency, the reappraisal of their actions during the pandemic will begin. They know that the general public believes they have a lot to answer for. The public, no longer preoccupied with COVID and no longer held in check by lockdowns, is likely to retaliate against the Left’s harm and hypocrisy during the crisis. The recall effort against California’s Gov. Gavin Newsom and the spiraling investigations into New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo — governors of the two states that began the lockdowns over a year ago — could be just the beginning of the public’s postmortem. Yet COVID is not the only crisis the Left refuse to surrender. Their claim of systemic racism is equally resilient as they seek evidence of it in every conceivable instance. The Left always follow a similar pattern: seeking to advance by promoting a crisis only they have discovered and that only their policies can solve. The Left will never relinquish power, just as they will never cease seeking it. They have not in the past, they are not with COVID, and they will not with any of their future crises. It is not in their DNA. The Left’s policies are always just a means to an end, and that end is always power, for which no end is ever intended. The sooner America realizes this reality, the sooner they can rid themselves of the opportunist Left — and until Americans do they can never expect a return to normalcy.",1,Questionable,0.1177611986122624,0.3891966780264653,1603,0,The American Spectator
115,Biden’s Private Prison E.O. Won’t Affect Mass Incarceration,7.67,40.0,https://freebeacon.com/policy/bidens-private-prison-e-o-wont-affect-mass-incarceration/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-free-beacon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced an end to federal use of private prisons, a move he heralded as a blow to mass incarceration but which would affect just 2 percent of all prisoners. Biden's executive order, which requires the Department of Justice to begin phasing out private detention contracts, is specifically targeted at ""decreas[ing] incarceration levels"" by reducing ""profit-based incentives to incarcerate."" Speaking to the press Tuesday, Biden called the order ""just the beginning of my administration’s plan to address systemic problems in our criminal justice system.""""President Biden is committed to reducing mass incarceration while making our communities safer,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing on the order. ""That starts with ending the federal government’s reliance on private prisons.""But the federal government is not reliant on private prisons, and the order would affect less than 2 percent of all prisoners in the United States, official data show, including just 16 percent of federal prisoners. It would also not reduce incarceration, as prisoners would be moved to public facilities and would likely leave untouched the many federal private prison detainees housed under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security. Biden's order instead follows private prisons' role as a popular scapegoat for advocates of ""criminal justice reform,"" who argued as far back as the Obama administration that profit-motivated corporations would tend to increase incarceration. That position is similar to other popular arguments—like advocacy for marijuana legalization on decarceration grounds—that allow proponents of reform to avoid talking about prisons' large population of violent offenders. In its specifics, the new order only requires that the Department of Justice not renew its contracts with ""privately operated criminal detention centers."" It does not implicate detention centers administered by other departments. That may mean that private entities will still detain illegal aliens pending deportation, who account for ""the vast majority of contractor-operated facilities,"" according to the private prison group Day One Alliance. In other words, the Biden order may target a small share of a small share of offenders. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statisticsindicate thatprivate prisons hold just 7 percent of state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners. In total, they detain roughly 116,000 of the roughly 1.4 million prisoners in the United States—the federal prisons that Biden's order would close house just 28,000 people or roughly 2 percent of the U. S. prison population. In fact, the BJS data show, the federal private prison population was already in decline, falling between 2018 and 2019. Just five states hold more than 20 percent of their prisoners in private prisons, while 18 states hold none at all. These facts did not stop ""criminal justice reform"" groups from praising Biden's executive order, with the ACLU's David Fathicalling it""an important first step toward acknowledging the harm that has been caused and taking actions to repair it."" It alsogarnered praisefrom the union representing some 30,000 federal prison workers, who stand to gain from the closing of competitors. Biden's order explicitly restarts an initiative of the last days of the Obama administration, which similarlyprepareda phase-out in the months leading up to the 2016 election. Following his victory, President Donald Trumpreversed that decisionshortly after taking over the White House. That made it a popular punching bag in the ensuing years, particularly during the 2020 Democratic primary. Then, contenders such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren(D., Mass.) andCory Booker(D., N. J.) took aim at it,as didnow-Vice President Kamala Harris. Those candidates likely induced Biden to pull his criminal justice platform to the left, includingendorsingan end to federal private prisons—part of a larger effort to shed a tough-on-crime image from his days in the Senate. Opposition to private prisons in the 2020 field followed that group's use of other popular progressive talking points on ""criminal justice reform,"" like thedebunked claimthat marijuana criminalization is a major driver of incarceration. Just as with prisoners in private prisons, marijuana offenders account for a small fraction of overall prisoners. In reality,48 percentof prisoners are violent offenders, a fraction that has risen even as prison populationshave shrunkover the past decade and a half.

116,We Won't Do This for 12 to 18 Months,5.67,30.0,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/23/we_wont_do_this_for_12_to_18_months.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-23,18,"Economist Herb Stein was famous for a great many things, but most prominent among them was “Stein’s Law.” It is elegant in its simplicity: “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.”Stein’s Law is particularly appropriate these days as we discuss plans for reopening the economy. There is a small but growing portion of mostly Republican governors who seem intent on opening up sooner rather than later. There’s also a group that insists on opening up slowly, with Ezekiel Emanuel suggesting “conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure” while concluding that “[w]e need to prepare ourselves for this to last 18 months or so and for the toll that it will take.”Somewhere in the middle are a slew of plans from think tanks outlining a variety of suggestions to open up gradually over the course of the next few months. Most of these plans are pegged to a variety of metrics based off of declining caseloads, or a set period of time. The Center for American Progress suggests 45 days, while Harvard suggests three months. These are interesting debates, but they don’t frame the question properly. The question isn’t what timeline we should allow for things to start to reopen. That assumes a degree of control over events that we probably lack. Instead, the timeline will probably be dictated for us, which demands a slightly different policy discussion. There are a couple of reasons for this:First is public opinion. Support for stay-at-home orders remains robust nationally in polling, but there is at least anecdotal evidence that patience with such orders is starting to wane. I’ve noticed an increase in traffic when I go to the bank, and longer lines when I get takeout. We’ve seen protests, although they are sporadic at best. And, again anecdotally, people’s nerves seem to be fraying. How long the public will support these measures is anyone’s guess, but I doubt the public’s patience is infinite. This debate will heat up as our economy sorts into three tiers: knowledge economy workers unaffected by the collapse who demand continued distancing; essential workers who have to work (often in jobs where it is impossible to distance); and a growing segment of unemployed. Simmering in the background is the issue of churches; secular observers often have a hard time appreciating the mindset of religious believers, but I’m confident that while the devout are willing to take a few weeks off of services, they won’t wait several months to resume them. Second, for plans that are based on the development of a vaccine or a national test-and-trace system, it isn’t assured that we will ever have either. In fact, we’ve never developed a vaccine for a coronavirus, and there are challenges involved in doing so. Attempts to develop an effective vaccine for SARS ran into financial challenges as the virus disappeared, but those vaccine trials also were showing secondary effects. This doesn’t mean it is impossible – many trials are well under way for this pathogen, and the reward for developing this vaccine will be much greater than developing one for, say, the coronavirus strains of the common cold. But we shouldn’t act as though success is assured, either. Hope is important, but it is not a plan. As for test-and-trace, this would require immense intrusions on personal liberty to carry out, which the public and courts may or may not tolerate. I also think people underestimate the massive logistical challenges involved in implementing such a policy in a country that is roughly the same size as all of Europe, including the Russian portion, only less densely populated overall. I’m not a public health expert, but implementing this in Manhattan seems to be a fundamentally different challenge than doing so in, say, Montana. But these are secondary, and to some degree speculative, concerns. The biggest problem is that, sooner or later, something will collapse that we can’t bail out or regulate our way around. The most obvious prospect is another collapse of the financial system, though we successfully bailed out and regulated our way around such an event only 12 years ago. A crisis in higher education is another possibility. If students decide to opt for gap years before college or to take another year off before going to graduate or professional school as campuses close, school income would be hit. More important for some larger schools would be the cancellation of sports. The Ohio State University, for example, makes some $75 million in profit off of sports, and it isn’t the nation’s biggest sports school. Those are big gaps to fill, especially when states will be facing contracting budgets as well. Larger concerns would be a collapse of the health care system or food distribution networks. We’ve seen increasing stories of hospitals conducting layoffs – counterintuitively, one might think, amid a pandemic – because of the cancellation of non-emergency surgeries, which supply a huge amount of their operating budget. To put this in perspective, Ohio hospitals are projected to lose $1.2 billion a month in revenue. That’s unsustainable for the summer, much less 18 months. Farmers are beginning to destroy their crops as the collapse of the dining industry removes a major source of demand. You should think of this probabilistically. We’ve thrown a live grenade into a very delicate social and economic web. Regardless of whether or not you support the measures we’ve adopted so far, the longer they go on, the higher the probability of the grenade detonating as we hit a “tail risk” phenomenon. Sooner or later some second- or third-order effect is going to pop up that no one anticipated, and that threatens to overwhelm us. If you need further convincing, follow oil prices. Negative prices are not normal. Mind you, the first school closures barely occurred a month ago (speaking of which, if secondary schools are closed next year, those parents still working are going to have to figure out how to make it work). We haven’t been at this very long and we’re already seeing serious threats looming. I can only imagine what other threats will emerge after another month or two of this. Finally, we shouldn’t let these trees obscure a wider forest. These different scenarios work with each other: As second- and third-order effects begin to present, Americans’ tolerance for restrictions will increasingly wear thin. This will be especially true if, as some suspect, the virus retreats in the summer (before reappearing in the fall). Two concluding thoughts: First, this is descriptive, not prescriptive; the analysis does not vary whether one opposes or supports the current measures. Second, none of this means that we should do nothing. It means that time is of the essence. We don’t have unlimited runway to get things up and running before our hand is forced. We might have the 45 days envisioned by the Center for American Progress, but I’m extremely skeptical that we have the three months envisioned by Harvard.",1,Questionable,0.050396944653143,0.4193457300275484,1511,2,RealClear Politics
117,"Chicago Teachers Union votes to refuse in-person work, defy Chicago Public Schools’ reopening plan",-1.67,46.17,https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2021/1/24/22247280/chicago-teachers-union-votes-in-person-work-defy-chicago-public-schools-reopening-plan-strike,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-24,25,"Chicago Teachers Union members have voted to defy Chicago Public Schools’ reopening plans and continue working from home Monday because of health and safety concerns. City officials had said in recent days theywould view the collective refusal of in-person work as a strike, but in response to Sunday’s vote results said they will delay the scheduled return of thousands of teachers and staff until Wednesday “to ensure we have the time needed to resolve our discussions without risking disruption to student learning.”The CTU’s move to reject in-person work marks the culmination of a months-long fight between the union and the nation’s third-largest school system over how and when to reopen schools during the pandemic — a disagreement that threatens to plunge the city’s education into deeper turmoil if a deal isn’t reached over the next few days.“So what does this mean? It means the overwhelming majority of you have chosen safety,” the union told teachers and staff as they announced the vote results. “CPS did everything possible to divide us by instilling fear through threats of retaliation, but you still chose unity, solidarity and to collectively act as one.”About 86% of the 25,000 rank-and-file CTU members participated in the electronic vote over the past three days, with 71% favoring the rejection of in-person work in an unusually close vote for CTU labor actions. When the CTU voted to strike in 2019, 94% of members who voted chose to walk out. CTU President Jesse Sharkey wrote on Twitter he “will grant that it’s a lower percentage than we’ve had in the past. It’s a pandemic, after all.” He later added in a statement he believes “an agreement is within reach, but we need a willing partner.”Illinois law requires three-quarters of CTU members to authorize a typical contract strike, such as the one in 2019. The union has said a work stoppage this time around would come in response to several alleged unfair labor practices by CPS, and the approval of only a simple majority of voting members is required — though the CTU said last week it would seek 60% to show its unity. Union leadership has been adamant, however, that its initial action is not a strike since teachers intend to continue working from home — even though the school district is no longer allowing that option for about half of union members this week. The union has said it would only withhold its labor if no agreement is reached come Wednesday and CPS decides to block teachers from remote work — as it has done with a few dozen pre-kindergarten and special education staff members who have not reported to schools as ordered this month and are no longer being paid. The strategy from union leadership has been to back CPS officials into a corner in negotiations by forcing the district to address teachers’ concerns immediately, delay its reopening plan or risk halting all classes. Thekey unresolved issues are: which teachers and staff who have a household member with a vulnerable medical condition are eligible for accommodations for remote work; the public health metrics that determine the reopening or closing of individual schools and the district as a whole; how vaccines factor in to requiring staff to work in person; and the scope of districtwide testing of staff and students. About 3,800 preschool and special education cluster program teachers and staff were ordered to return to schools earlier this month for the resumption of in-person learning for their students. Another 10,000 staff members in kindergarten through eighth grades were due back Monday. K-8 schools are scheduled to reopen Feb. 1 for an estimated 71,000 students — out of 191,000 children in those grades — who have said they plan to return. Black, Latino and low-income families have been less likely to choose in-person learning, data has shown. It’s also not clear, however, how many of those K-8 students will actually follow through with their intentions to go back. CPS officials on Friday released attendance data from the first week of school for pre-K and cluster students that revealed an average of 3,189 of the 6,470 students who opted in — 49% — returned to classrooms each day. That meantonly 19% of 16,944 eligible students were learning in-person that week. The CTU has said those numbers should help predict a similar pattern in the next reopening wave, leading to fewer teachers needed for in-person work. But CPS has said it’s still planning as if all 71,000 kids are returning. Schools chief Janice Jackson wrote in an email to families Sunday that the return of K-8 teachers and staff will be pushed back to Wednesday as the two sides continue to negotiate, but CPS still plans for K-8 students to return Feb. 1. Pre-K and cluster staff will be expected to keep reporting to schools this week, and Jackson said the district’s goal is “to reach an agreement with CTU as soon as possible.”When she was asked Friday if the union’s walkout would mean even remote learning would come to a halt, Jackson said, “I think my point was clear that if the union refuses to work on Monday, that constitutes a strike.”Jackson said it would be unfair to deny families the opportunity to return to schools, and she and City Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady expressed strong confidence that all necessary precautions have been taken to keep students and staff safe from COVID-19. The district has spent $44 million on disinfectants, PPE, air purifiers and other measures to ready schools for the return of staff and students. After a rough fall and early winter, coronavirus infection rates in Chicago have steadily fallen. The city’s test positivity rate is at 7.2%, and the seven-day average of daily confirmed cases is down to 629 — both the lowest since mid-October. But teachers have shown serious concerns about their health in schools they believe won’t uniformly or strictly enforce mitigation protocols. The teachers union and its medical consultant, national expert Dr. Vin Gupta, have advocated for a slower, more phased-in approach to reopening schools that coincides with teacher vaccinations. School staffers in Illinois are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccinations starting Monday, and some suburbs are prioritizing teachers for those shots over other essential workers. Gupta also said last week he was concerned about the new strain of the virus that originated in the U. K. Sharkey wrote to members Sunday that CPS’ decision to delay the return of K-8 staff was done “unilaterally” — not in agreement with the CTU, as the district claimed — and was meant “to sow dissent and disrupt collective Union action” without reaching a tangible agreement. Still, the union was encouraged by the move because it signaled a willingness to resolve the dispute, sources said.",3,Reliable,0.0011886724386724,0.3922095959595958,1458,3,Chicago Sun-Times

Jared Kushner created a shell company and paid the Trump family $617 million. Business Insider reported:President Donald Trump’s most powerful advisor, Jared Kushner, approved the creation of a campaign shell company that secretly paid the president’s family members and spent almost half of the campaign’s $1.26 billion war chest, a person familiar with the operation told Insider.….. The shell company — incorporated as American Made Media Consultants Corp. and American Made Media Consultants LLC — allowed Trump’s campaign to skirt federally mandated disclosures. The tactic could attract scrutiny from federal election regulators. The Trump family appears to have violated campaign finance laws by creating a shell company, and then paying themselves funds that were not disclosed and odds are properly documented. The problem could much deeper than campaign finance violations. There is the possibility of potential money laundering and conspiracy charges if investigators find that the Trump family wasn’t just trying to skirt campaign finance laws, but were engaging in even more serious criminal activity. Trump was so confident that he would beat JoeBidenthat he spent half of the money that his campaign raised paying himself and his family. If Trump and Kushner thought that what they were doing was above board, they would not have created a shell company to hide their activities. Donald Trump will stay in politics,because bilking his followersand the taxpayers is his main source of revenue. The Trump campaign was a con, and all of those red hat wearing believers who donating money were lining Trump’s pockets. For more discussion about this story join ourRachel Maddow and MSNBC group.

119,The train is leaving the station,-21.67,22.0,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/the-train-is-leaving-the-station/39571/,https://adfontesmedia.com/palmer-report-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,25,"President Biden has tried several times to get Republicans involved in legislature to benefit the American people. They have steadfastly refused. Recently, a group of Democrats and Republicans, who NBC News refers to as “the G10,” have been meeting and trying to find a middle ground so that we can move forward with much-needed help for our crumbling infrastructure. Bernie Sanders has already signaled that he will not vote for the newly negotiated plan because it is not enough. Republicans will likely vote for neither. What is President Biden going to do about it? According to the Hill, Democrats have been told to prepare to go it alone again. Reconciliation is not new to Democrats. They used it to pass President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. Many families felt relief from the passage of that plan, and more will get relief from Biden’s infrastructure plan, which includes the American Jobs Plan. That relief is part of Republican complaints because they never want to do anything for the American people. About all they can do is lie to us. Republicans are paying attention to nothing. Not only did the rescue plan generate support from most Americans, but it also propelled President Biden’s approval rating into the stratosphere. But Republicans cannot be bothered with the truth. They prefer to obstruct. The problem for them is that the Democrats can, once again, pass this new bill without their help, and that is where things are headed. As the Hill reported, Steve Ricchetti and Shalanda Young have said that Republicans have 7 to 10 days to reach an acceptable agreement, or the train is leaving the station without them. “Then, we move along with reconciliation—for everything,” John Yarmuth (D-KY) told the Hill. While the infrastructure plan includes traditional items such as bridges and roads, the other component seeks to enhance the lives of millions of Americans by, for example, creating new, well-paying jobs; ensuring clean drinking water; enhancing our digital infrastructure; and improving schools. Republicans balk at items they do not see as infrastructure, but what they fail to see is that without a strong, healthy populace, the traditional infrastructure items will be of little use. Republicans refuse to see the “big picture” in President Biden’s agenda, but the American people can and will clearly see the benefits. Once again, Republicans are being given a chance to do what they were elected to do. They can either get on board or do as they did last time: sit back and watch the world in Washington pass them by at risk of their coveted positions. Democrats keep trying to give Republicans a chance, but at some point, they—unlike Republicans—remember why people sent them to Washington. Once this legislature passes and the American people respond positively, will Republicans try to claim bragging rights again? The American people are not stupid. We know that, just like last time, they decided to sit out any attempts to help this country recover. Hopefully, that knowledge will be reflected in November 2022.",0,Problematic,0.0911713286713286,0.3727855477855477,627,0,Palmer Report

Prosecutor Eli Savit announced in a press release that his office is ending the practice of prosecuting sex workers who engage in consensual sex.""The Washtenaw County Prosecutor’s Office is well aware that sex work carries an increased risk for violence, human trafficking, and coercion. Data and experience, however, have shown that criminalizing sex work does little to alleviate those harms,"" Savit said in the statement. ""Indeed the criminalization of sex work actually increases the risk of sex work adjacent harm. Accordingly, the Washtenaw County Prosecutor’s Office will henceforth decline to bring charges related to consensual sex work per se. The Prosecutor’s Office, however, will continue to charge sex work-adjacent crime — including human trafficking, violence, and offenses involving children — that directly harm county residents.""Efforts to reach Savit for further comment Thursday were not successful. Elected in November, Savit said with the exception of Nevada, sex work is generally criminalized in the United States but that ""America’s prohibitionist stance on sex work is increasingly out of step with international norms. Consensual sex work is legal — at least in some form — in nearly 100 countries across the globe.""Savit added the laws against ""consensual"" sex work conflict with the U. S. constitution as adults have a right to ""engage in private conduct"" such as sex.​Savit added that ""Laws banning consensual sex between adults thus generally violate the United States ConstitutionIt is only when sex is exchanged for money that such activity may be banned. But even once money enters the equation, sex is not consistently criminalized.""In Oakland County, Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams told The News Thursday that while his office's main focus is human trafficking, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald will be ""rolling out"" policy changes in prosecutions.""I applaud what (Savit) is doing and he certainly is headed in the right direction,"" said Williams. ""There's no question. There absolutely will be changes (in Oakland County).""Last week, Savit made headlines when he announced his office would end cash bail for defendants, saying the practice punishes the poor.""America’s system of cash bail is unfair, inequitable, and imposes severe harm on communities,"" Savit said last week. ""Cash bail is a system under which a defendant who has been accused of a crime is required to post money in order to secure release from jail pending trial. Importantly, cash bail forces defendants to pay for their release before they have been convicted. In function, then, cash bail imposes pre-conviction punishment on criminal defendants who cannot afford to pay.""Savit is a faculty member at the University of Michigan Law School. A former school teacher, he also is a former law clerk to the late U. S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In Michigan, the criminal penalty for prostitution ranges from a misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine, to a felony, punishable by up to two years in prison and/or a $2,000 fine.",3,Reliable,0.0115375695732838,0.4140254586683158,721,3,Detroit News

In an emergency meeting called with 20 minutes’ notice, the Charlottesville City Council voted unanimously to cancel another piece of public art targeted by left-wing activists.“I feel that it should just be melted down,” Rose Ann Abrahamson, a Sacagawea descendant,said during the council meeting, The Daily Progress reported. “I feel that it’s entirely offensive and it should be obliterated.”Within minutes, a city work crew — the same group that had dismantled equestrian statues of Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson earlier Saturday — arrived with ropes, a crane, and pry bars to wrench the artwork off the plinth where it had stood on Charlottesville’s West Main Street since 1919. Local observer Molly Congerdocumented the processon Twitter.“Getting right down to business, not even taking the cherry picker off the truck,” Conger wrote. Lewis, the famous American adventurer who was sent by President Thomas Jefferson to explore the land west of the Mississippi River in 1804, was a local hero born in Charlottesville’s Albemarle County. The bronze statue cast to honor the Lewis and Clark expedition includes the two men and Sacagawea, their Shoshone guide and interpreter. In recent years its design has been criticized for its portrayal of Sacagawea, who appears in a crouching position behind the standing white men — which activists have seen as disparaging. But some historians contend that her posture shows her in action as a tracker and is not meant to place her in a subservient stance. Charlottesville’s Lewis and Clark Exploratory Center has offered to take the statue — but the city council has not yet decided to accept its plan.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0632395382395382,0.3097041847041847,425,2,New York Post

123,"Officers, sergeants resign en masse from Portland’s Rapid Response Team crowd control unit",1.0,43.67,https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2021/06/officers-sergeants-with-portlands-rapid-response-team-resign-from-the-specialized-crowd-control-unit.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-17,25,"Officers who serve on the Portland Police Bureau’s specialized crowd control unit, known as the Rapid Response Team, voted to resign from the team during a meeting Wednesday night. The unprecedented move by about 50 officers, detectives and sergeants to disband their own team came a day aftera team member, Officer Corey Budworth, was indicted, accused of fourth-degree assault stemming from a baton strike against a protester last summer. A team lieutenant called Chief Chuck Lovell to inform him Wednesday night after members of the team, who volunteer for the assignment, voted to resign due to perceived lack of support from City Hall and from the district attorney over the past year during more than 100 consecutive nights of protest coverage. The indictment of one of the team’s officers appeared to be the last straw.“Have I ever seen anything like this in my career? No, I don’t think any of us have,” said Deputy Chief Chris Davis, serving Thursday as acting chief while Lovell is out of state for a week in St. Augustine, Florida, for training. The Police Bureau acknowledged Thursday that the Rapid Response officers “no longer comprise a team.” The officers remain sworn members of the bureau but no longer work on the specialized team that received additional training and was an addition to the officers’ daily assignments. Mayor Ted Wheeler, who serves as police commissioner, Davis and Lovell met via video conference at 9 a.m. Thursday. The mayor also reached out to Gov. Kate Brown and said the Oregon State Police will have its mobile response team on standby to assist Portland police if protests occur in the next few nights. The mayor also discussed backup support from the Oregon National Guard if necessary, according to his office. The mayor also invited Rapid Response Team members to share their concerns directly with him during an 11 a.m. video conference call. Close to 40 officers appeared on the call. Wheeler reportedly asked the team members to delay their resignations from the team for a week so the Police Bureau could work out logistics for their replacement, but several officers on the conference could be seen visibly shaking their heads in opposition, according to one person present.“I want to acknowledge the toll this past year has taken on them and their families—they have worked long hours under difficult conditions,” the mayor said in a statement. “I personally heard from some of them today, and I appreciate their willingness to share their concerns about managing the many public gatherings that often were violent and destructive. It is my expectation, and the community’s expectation, that the City remains committed to public safety and effective police oversight. City leaders will continue working in partnership with Portlanders, community organizations and police leadership to reform our community safety system.’'The specialized Portland police team has been on the front lines at social justice protests held in the city after the May 25 murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck and pinned him to the pavement. Many demonstrations devolved into clashes with officers late at night, and at times ended with vandalism, property damage and fires. The crowd control team was the unit often directed to disperse crowds after police declared unlawful assemblies or riots. The team’s use of force has led to multiple civil lawsuits in state and federal court, sanctions from a judge and now an indictment. Aside from the Oregon State Police, few outside police agencies in the past year were willing to assist Portland in protest coverage. Davis said Portland patrol officers assigned to mobile field forces also likely will be called into action, and the chief can order the Rapid Response Team officers to provide crowd control as well. An incident management team will be activated Thursday night and likely through the weekend should any problems arise, he said.“We’re committed to providing the community the best service that we can. And this does not mean that there will be no response in public order situations,” Davis said. “We’ll use the resources that we have.”The current contract with the police union says the city retains “the exclusive right to exercise the customary functions of management including, but not limited to, directing the activities of the Bureau, determining the levels of service and methods of operation... the right to hire, lay off, transfer and promote; to discipline or discharge for cause, to determine work schedules and assign work and any other such rights not specifically referred to in this Contract.”In late October, the president of the police union, the Portland Police Association, sent the mayor and police chiefa letter,urging both to “stand up and publicly support Police Bureau members who voluntarily serve on the Rapid Response Team (RRT).”The union president urged the mayor and City Hall to “stop using RRT members as political pawns,” and called the team’s members “exhausted and injured.” He wrote then that the “only glue holding their team together’' was their “commitment to serve their city.”“Our RRT members do not volunteer to have Molotov cocktails, fireworks, explosives, rocks, bottles, urine, feces and other dangerous objects thrown at them,” wrote Daryl Turner, then president of the union and now its executive director. He noted that the team members volunteer for the work without any specialty pay.“Nor do they volunteer to have threats of rape, murder and assaults on their families hurled at them. They do not volunteer to suffer serious injuries, to be subjected to warrantless criticism and face allegations by elected officials, or to suffer through baseless complaints and lengthy investigations devoid of due process.”He urged that the trained supervisors of the Rapid Response Team, “not politicians,” be allowed to make decisions on police tactics to use during demonstrations, and that investigations into use of force by team members be done in a timely manner. He noted that a number of seasoned team officers had been pulled from the team during months-long investigations.“These officers find themselves in a no-win situation. They are told to stand down and only intervene when things have gotten so out of control that they have no other option than to use high levels of force to regain control of unlawful demonstrations,” Turner wrote. “They are criticized for their perceived inaction on the front end and are criticized for their inevitable use of force on the back end. They can’t win because of the position others have put them in.’'The acting chief acknowledged the “challenging times,” the Police Bureau and community has faced in the last 14 months during the pandemic and mass protests in the wake of Floyd’s videotaped killing.“Our entire organization, and not even just our sworn staff, but also our professional staff in the last 14 months, has been put through something, none of us have ever seen in our careers, at a level and an intensity that I don’t think any other city in the United States has experienced,” Davis said. He said he recognizes that the officers serving so many consecutive nights on the protest lines have been facing “really, really extreme circumstances,” which “takes a toll.’'“It’s my responsibility to make sure that if we send someone to go out and do something, that I’m not subjecting them to any more risk than I absolutely have to, and that’s why we have to be smart about how we send them out to do this work, and what strategy we want them to follow,” he said. Budworth marked the first Rapid Response Team officer to face criminal prosecution stemming from force used during a protest. He’s accused of striking a woman, Teri Jacobs, in the face with a baton after knocking her to the ground on Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard after a riot was declared near the Multnomah Building on Aug. 18. Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt described Budworth’s baton strike as excessive force that was legally unjustified. Thedistrict attorney also told The Oregonian/OregonLive Tuesday afternoonthat he had asked the Oregon Department of Justice to review for potential criminal prosecution the force used by another Rapid Response Team member, Detective Erik Kammerer, during protests. His office, he said, continues to review other protest-related uses of force by officers. The union criticized Budworth’s prosecution as politically driven, and it contends Budworth’s baton strike was “accidental,” not criminal. The Portland Police Association issued a statement earlier this week, saying Schmidt needs to prosecute “the real criminals who are perpetrating vandalism, arson, gun violence, and other violent crimes in our community,” and not go after officers attempting to do their jobs with little support. On Thursday, Schmidt vowed to hold officers accountable for their actions. He issued this statement: “Management and staffing of the Rapid Response Team falls within the purview of the leadership of the Portland Police Bureau. I have confidence that the Bureau will continue their mission to maintain public safety. In the meantime, my office will continue to focus on the fair and just prosecution of criminal matters. We cannot expect the community to trust law enforcement if we hold ourselves to a lower standard.”Attorneys Juan Chavez and Franz Bruggemeier - both of the Oregon Justice Resource Center who have sued the city and Portland police on behalf of protesters and represent the woman who was struck with a baton by Budworth — say they the Rapid Response Team’s mass resignation demonstrates “the contempt its members feel for even the possibility that one of their colleagues is held accountable for his actions.”“Portland Police officers need to understand that they are not above the law nor are their actions exempt from the protections the Constitution aims to provide to people against exactly these types of abuse by police,” the attorneys said in a statement. “The refusal to acknowledge and address this wrongdoing goes to the heart of what’s wrong with Portland Police. The failure of our City’s elected leaders to step in is an indictment of their role in this mess and their complicity in the violence and trauma committed by PPB against the community.”By late Thursday, city commissioners issued their own reactions to the stunning development. Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, the most vocal critic of Portland police on the City Council, urged the city to formally disband the Rapid Response Team. She said its members’ resignation is an example of a “rogue paramilitary organization” that’s unaccountable to elected officials and residents of Portland.“Ironically, we now see some PPB officers engaging in the act they showed so much disdain for last summer by staging their own protest: resigning from the RRT the moment there is a possibility for accountability for inappropriate and potentially illegal conduct,” she said. “What today’s action says is that some Portland police officers believe they are above the law. I support District Attorney Mike Schmidt in his efforts to hold police officers accountable when they commit crimes themselves, because no one is above the law.’'Commissioner Mingus Mapps said while he supports the district attorney’s close review of mistakes made by Portland police during recent protests, he added, “at the same time, our city has endured nightly rioting, arson, and vandalism. I will continue to support our public safety officers while also reforming how we police in our city.”In March, a federaljudge also restricted officers with the Rapid Response Team from using crowd-control launchers during protestsuntil they completed further training and “can recognize and articulate a threat without speculating and before using less-lethal force.’'U. S. District Judge Marco A. Hernandez’s sanctions came after the judge’s findings in November that two officers had acted in contempt of his June 26 order barring police from firing FN303s and 40mm less-lethal launchers and using pepper spray on people engaged in passive resistance. The case stemmed from a suit filed by Don’t Shoot Portland, a Black-led nonprofit that advocates for social and racial justice in the city. Patrol officers who aren’t part of the specialized Rapid Response Team but are on mobile field forces are armed with batons and pepper spray. The Rapid Response Team officers carry less-lethal launchers, impact munitions and riot-control agents, tear gas, OC (the irritant Oleoresin Capsicum, or pepper spray) pyrotechnic gas or smoke, which are either fired from a 40mm launcher or thrown in canisters. Impact munitions they’ve been armed with include foam-tipped projectiles fired from a 40mm launcher or a plastic projectile containing an inert powder and non-toxic chemical called bismuth that’s fired from an FN 303 air-powered launcher. They received advanced training to respond to public order policing, natural or human-caused disasters. Last fall, the mayorissued an order for police to stop using tear gas for crowd controlunless lives were at risk and nothing else could resolve the threat — and only if he or his designee approved its use. There was no additional written guidance given to officers, beyond the mayor’s press release, the U. S. Department of Justice found.“Banning reasonable police tactics and less lethal tools only serves to escalate police action and force, rather than allowing RRT to use lower levels of force to control unlawful activity. Remove politics from police operations. Allow RRT supervisors, who have the most training, experience, and knowledge about crowd control, to manage these events unencumbered by shifting political winds,” Turner wrote to the mayor and chief in late October. While the mass departure of officers from a Portland police specialized team hasn’t occurred before, two other cities have seen such moves in the past year. Last summer,Buffalo Police Department’s dedicated riot squad quitafter two officers faced criminal investigations, accused of pushing down a 75-year-old protester outside City Hall. The action came after the Buffalo police union told its rank-and-file members it would no longer pay for legal fees to defend police officers related to the protests. And in April,17 officers, a sergeant and lieutenant resigned from the Albuquerque Emergency Response Teamfollowing a protest. Portland’s Rapid Response Team members also have been frustrated by the number of protest-related prosecutions that were rejected by the district attorney’s office. As of late January, the office had rejected almost three-quartersof 1,057 protest-related arrests referred by police. The dismantling of the team comes as the Police Bureau is struggling withan exodus of officers resigning from the bureaudue to low morale and complaints about lack of support from city commissioners. It also comes amid a spiraling number of shootings and homicides, and the U. S. Department of Justice’s formal notice to the city that the Police Bureau has failed to complywith mandated reforms required under its settlement agreement. Further, any urgency to create a new uniformed, proactive policing team to try to combat the city’s gun violence has not materialized, withless than a handful of officers volunteering to serveon a team that the police chief had anticipated would include two sergeants and 12 officers.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail atmbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter@maxoregonian",3,Reliable,0.0241417628667628,0.4281501443001445,3164,3,The Oregonian
124,Diehard Britney Spears Fans Are Wondering What's Next After #FreeBritney,-0.33,38.33,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paigeskinner/britney-spears-fans-after-free-britney,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"“I think all of this has kind of, in part, become a little bit of my identity.”BuzzFeed News ReporterSupporters of Britney Spears take part in a #FreeBritney protest outside a courthouse inLos Angeles. After 17 years of running hisBritney Spearsfan blogBreatheHeavy, Jordan Miller is only now starting to process what life will be like after the pop star he’s so tirelessly advocated for is finally free from her conservatorship. Spears has hired a high-profile attorney to wrest her from under a legal arrangement that has given her father and a number of lawyers control over her life since 2008, starting the clock on what many consider to be the inevitable: a free Britney. But that outcome means a big question looms on the horizon for many #FreeBritney stans — what now? Miller has already started working with a life coach to find the answer.“It’s hard for me to separate myself from BreatheHeavy at this point, which is one reason why I do think I’m working with a life coach because in some way, I think all of this has kind of, in part, become a little bit of my identity,” he said. “What does that mean and do I even like that?”When the 33-year-old launched the blog, he was a closeted sophomore in high school. With too much energy and not enough activities, he began posting about the pop star without his classmates knowing — openly running a Spears fan site might have given away his sexual identity, he said. I forgot how hard I went way back when the conservatorship was put into effect😩😩😩. I feel Britney's anger in her new posts. She has every right to be, and though I'm not at all happy about what's gone down, I am happy she is using her voice. #FreeBritneyThe relationship he has with Spears is parasocial, a one-way social tie in which a person “imagines a relationship with a celebrity or media figure,” Tracy R. Gleason, psychology professor at Wellesley College, told BuzzFeed News. Some parasocial relationships are simply just thinking about the celebrity when consuming their work or art. Some fans heighten the relationship when they start to seek out more information about the celebrity, and some might even imagine conversations with them. Miller’s blog has taken up nearly two decades of his life, but before that, he was an average, dedicated Spears fan, listening to her music, watching her music videos, and attending concerts. But things shifted in 2008 when Spears was put under the conservatorship and Miller started raising concerns about it on the blog and advocating on her behalf — something he said doesn’t come as easily when he has to do it for himself. But soon, the conservatorship may come to an end, and Spears has teased the idea of never performing again. So what does life look like for a fan in an all-consuming parasocial relationship if their idol ditches everything?Pamela Rutledge, a media psychologist and social scientist, said losing yourself in a parasocial relationship can become harmful if the person you rely on disappears.“Where it might be problematic for someone is if they had so little sense of self that they used this fandom to create that sense of self,” Rutledge said. “It’s very difficult to move on because [the celebrities] become integral to who you think you are.”For Leanne Simmons, advocating for Spears’ rights has come naturally. She’s been a lifelong Spears fan, has protested with other #FreeBritney supporters, and helps run the #FreeBritney LA Instagram account. Her dedication adds up to about 20 hours per week.“For me, it just really feels like this is where I’m meant to be,” Simmons said. She’s confident the conservatorship will end, in which case she’ll have a lot of free time, especially if Spears quits performing.“I think there will be an adjustment period because I know she will be free and I feel it very soon that it’s coming, so I definitely think I will find myself bored after work, but I am going to use that energy for other causes,” she said. While fans are united in helping Spears, some are divided on who the celebrity actually is. Most fans describe a “gut feeling” when trying to articulate why they believe the conservatorship is wrong, but that’s to be expected. Gleason said fans in a parasocial relationship typically see their idol in a good light, so when the conservatorship was imposed on Spears, it made sense that fans wanted to fight against it.“The idea that she might be in so much trouble that she needs somebody else to take care of her [is] sort of disappointing,” Gleason said. “That doesn’t go along with the image of this person you really like. So explaining it as something’s off here as opposed to Britney really has problems, it’s much more appealing to think Britney’s fine and other people are mistreating her than it is to think that this person you have so admired and so been tied to maybe has problems.”Other than her explosive testimony at a recent court hearing, Spears has mostly communicated with the public through her Instagram captions, but the legitimacy of those are up for debate among her fans, with some believing the account has been run on her behalf. But Twitter user @notedyourhonor, who did not want her name to be used for fear of retaliation from Spears’ team, thinks questioning whether it’s the “real” Spears is dangerous.“When Britney stopped being the Britney that everyone wanted to be and look up to, like when she shaved off her hair or when she dyes her hair brown — ….fans or people in general are quick to say, ‘Well, that’s not the real Britney,’” @notedyourhonor said. “But that might be the real Britney, but we’ve never allowed her to be anything but a blonde sex goddess Britney that we’ve all come to accept as the real Britney.“I think what’s dangerous to me about that is if it is Britney making those decisions and saying those things, it’s taking away so much of her autonomy in the same way that the conservatorship does, where maybe that is the only place where she’s allowed to be whatever she wants to be and we’re telling her that that’s not the real her.”Whenever fans get to see the “real” Spears, @notedyourhonor tweeted that fans should love her unconditionally. You guys think you know Britney and you don’t. We don’t know who she is anymore. She’s not the projection we have been told she is. When the time comes and she shows us who she really is, love her without any conditions. That is all. With an end in sight for the conservatorship, fans are encouraging Spears to do whatever she wants, even if she disappears from the public eye. Megan Radford, who also helps run the #FreeBritney LA Instagram account, said she thinks it will be “weird” if and when Spears becomes free. Radford has spent the last few years dedicated to the cause, which has taken time away from her family. By the time my 3-year-old is old enough to really remember things, Britney will be free. He won’t remember all the work he watched his mama put in to help her for YEARS. (1/3)#FreeBritney“[My husband] is fully supportive, but he, probably more than anyone, is ready for Britney to be free,” Radford said. She, like Simmons, plans to continue helping people get out of abusive conservatorships. As for Miller, BreatheHeavy covers a lot of pop culture news, so he said it will continue on without Spears if she steps away from public life.“I welcome the day we no longer need Free Britney, because that implies she has taken back the reins of her autonomy, legally,” he said.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1169954940237959,0.4808691020719322,1777,3,BuzzFeed News
125,Talkin’ ’bout a Starcity revolution – The San Francisco Examiner,0.0,42.0,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/talkin-bout-a-starcity-revolution/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,19,". Not to go all “you kids get off of my lawn!” at you, but has anyone else noticed that lately it’s not enough to have a good idea; the idea has to “change the way we live and work!” Even a bad idea, like COVID, changes the way we live and work. In fact, every single technological upgrade, since the first time a caveman rubbed two sticks together, has arguably changed the way we live and work. Every upgrade is going to change our lives, and we eat it up. Bring the change. It’s always for the better, right?But not every new idea can deliver on this, can it?Of course not, but someone in the real estate world really is trying to change the way we live and work. In a world of sound and fury, often indicating nothing, Starcity, a co-living outfit with properties in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Barcelona (!), stands apart from the myriad would-be change agents. If they can pull off their plans for the next two years, they will indeed change the way many people live and work — but are these changes for the better?Up to now Starcity has been a pretty standard co-living provider, offering furnished rooms in rehabbed homes in San Francisco and other cities. They charge residents a membership fee which covers rent, utilities, internet and common area upkeep/perks. They’re basically streamlined, upscale boarding houses, temporary in nature (memberships can range from three to 15 months), tailor-made for newly-arrived white-collar workers. But this wasn’t enough for Starcity. They’re taking a huge swing next year, and it could result in, in a world of would-be game-changers, an actual game-changer — for a specific type of San Franciscan. At some point in 2021, Starcity will start construction on a project at 457 Minna St. When it’s completed, Starcity Minna will be a 15-story, 270-unit co-living monster, built in modular fashion to keep down costs but festooned with all manner of upscale (and, let’s admit it, youthful) perks: an event space, a bike repair and storage area, a massive rooftop deck. Each level will consist of 18 en-suite units, a “chef’s kitchen,” a dining area that, per online drawings, will double as a laptop-strewn workspace, a media area and a lounge (more laptops). It is a dream come true for a certain type of renter. I’m just not sure Starcity is ready to admit who that renter actually is. You may as well lose the drawings of energetic, fashion-forward seniors mingling with their young co livers, Starcity, and technically, I guess the project is aimed at “low- and middle-income residents,” but let’s be honest, here; this is a giant upscale dorm for young tech workers. Imagine the catnip Starcity Minna will be for exhausted techies who’ve been couch-surfing and sleeping in eight to a room in “tech pods?” Imagine getting all of these perks for well below market rent? So what if I have to share a kitchen? I mostly do take-out anyway. Young tech workers, new to The City and at adulthood? They’re the ones, perfectly positioned for the soft landing of grown-up dorm living. Not satisfied with this single revolution, last week Starcity rolled out another game-changer,invest.starcity.com, which expands real estate investment beyond the reach of institutions and high-rolling individuals, offering opportunity to anyone with $5,000 to invest. It’s a chance, Starcity CEO Jon Dishotsky says, to “democratize access” to real estate investing, in a city where traditional home-buying is well out of reach for many. With this program, and with Starcity Minna, the company has changed access for renters and investors, while also truly creating “a new way to live and work.”And let’s be clear about that new way to live and work. Is it a revolution everyone wants? Or needs? Starcity Minna is many things, but what it is at its core is a co-working space with bedroom suites attached. Google may have game rooms and fitness centers to keep you at work (“Need your dry-cleaning done? Don’t leave! We’ll do it right here!”); at Starcity Minna, you never have to go to home because you’re already there. Your home office gets lonely; at Starcity Minna, you’re never alone. This is the real revolution, a world where work and home are one, a life where you can still take Zoom meetings in your pajamas and then afterward retire to the coffee station to kibbitz with like-minded peers. It may not be the revolution everyone wants, but Starcity isn’t lying when it claims to be changing the way we live and work.",3,Reliable,0.1285285567894263,0.459879331618462,1074,3,SF Examiner
126,"Reflecting the Authoritarian Climate, Washington Will Remain Militarized Until At Least March",14.33,35.0,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/reflecting-the-authoritarian-climate,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-26,16,"beginning the week leading up to Joe Biden’s inauguration, when 20,000 National Guard troops weredeployed onto the streetsof the nation’s capital. The original justification was that this show of massive force was necessary to secure the inauguration in light of the January 6 riot at the Capitol. But with the inauguration over and done, those troops remain and are not going anywhere any time soon. Working with federal law enforcement agencies, the National Guard Bureau announced on Monday that between 5,000 and 7,000 troopswill remainin Washington untilmid-March. The rationale for this extraordinary, sustained domestic military presence has shifted several times, typically from anonymous U. S. law enforcement officials. The original justification — the need to secure the inaugural festivities — is obviously no longer operative. So the new claim became that the impeachment trial of former President Trump that will take place in the Senate in February necessitated military reinforcements. On Sunday,quoted“four people familiar with the matter” to claim that “Trump’s upcoming Senate impeachment trial poses a security concern that federal law enforcement officials told lawmakers last week requires as many as 5,000 National Guard troops to remain in Washington through mid-March.”The next day,,citing“a U. S. official,” said the ongoing troop deployment was needed due to “ominous chatter about killing legislators or attacking them outside of the U. S. Capitol.” But the anonymous official acknowledged that “the threats that law enforcement agents are tracking vary in specificity and credibility.” Even National Guard troopscomplainedthat they “have so far been given no official justifications, threat reports or any explanation for the extended mission — nor have they seen any violence thus far.”what an extreme state of affairs it is to have amilitary presence in American streets. Prior deployments havebeen rare, and usually were approved for a limited period and/or in order to quell a very specific, ongoing uprising — to ensure the peaceful segregation of public schools in the South, to respond to the unrest in Detroit and Chicago in the 1960s, or to quell the 1991 Los Angeles riots that erupted after the Rodney King trial. Deploying National Guard or military troops for domestic law enforcement purposes is so dangerous that laws in place from the country’s founding strictly limit its use. It is meant only as a last resort, when concrete, specific threats are so overwhelming that they cannot be quelled by regular law enforcement absent military reinforcements. Deploying active military troops is an even graver step than putting National Guard soldiers on the streets, but they both present dangers. As Trump’s Defense Secretarysaid in responseto calls from some over the summer to deploy troops in response to the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests: “The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.""Are we even remotely at such an extreme state where ordinary law enforcement is insufficient? The January 6 riot at the Capitol would have been easily repelled with just a couple hundred more police officers. The U. S. is the most militarized country in the world, and has the most para-militarized police force on the planet. Earlier today, the Acting Chief of the Capitol Policeacknowledgedthat they had advanced knowledge of what was planned but failed to take necessary steps to police it. Future violent acts in the name of right-wing extremism, as well as other causes, is highly likely if not inevitable. But the idea that the country faces some sort of existential armed insurrection that onlycan suppress is laughable on its face. Recall that, on January 11, citing “an internal FBI bulletin obtained by ABC News,”claimedthat “starting this week and running through at least Inauguration Day, armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols and at the U. S. Capitol.” The news outlet added in highly dramatic and alarming tones:The FBI has also received information in recent days on a group calling for “storming” state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event President Donald Trumpis removed from office prior to Inauguration Day. The group is also planning to “storm” government offices in every state the day President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump. None of that happened. There wasvirtually no unrestor violence during inauguration week —except forsome anti-Biden protests held by leftist and anarchist protesters that resulted in a few smashed windows at the Oregon Democratic Party and some vandalism at a Starbucks in Seattle. “Trump supporters threatened state Capitols but failed to show on Inauguration Day,” was the headlinechoseto try to justify this gap between media claims and reality. ShareThis threat seems wildly overblown by the combination of media outlets looking for ratings, law enforcement agencies searching for power, and Democratic Party operatives eager to exploit the climate of fear for a new War on Terror. But now is not a moment when there is much space for questioning anything, especially not measures ostensibly undertaken in the name of combatting white-supremacist right-wing extremism — just as no questioning of supposed security measures was tolerated in the wake of the 9/11 attack. And so the scenes of soldiers on the streets of the nation’s capital, there in the thousands and for an indefinite period of time, is provoking little to no concern.all the more remarkable is that a mere seven months ago, a major controversy erupted whenpublishedan op-edby Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) which, at its core, advocated the deployment of military troops to quell the social unrest, protests and riots that erupted over the summer after the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd. To justify the deployment of National Guard and active duty military forces, Cotton emphasized how many people, including police officers, had been seriously maimed or even killed as part of that unrest:Outnumbered police officers, encumbered by feckless politicians, bore the brunt of the violence. In New York State, rioters ran over officers with cars on at least three occasions. In Las Vegas, an officer is in “grave” condition after beingshot in the headby a rioter. In St. Louis, four police officerswere shotas they attempted to disperse a mob throwing bricks and dumping gasoline; in a separate incident, a 77-year-old retired police captain wasshot to deathas he tried to stop looters from ransacking a pawnshop. This is “somebody’s granddaddy,” a bystander screamed at the scene.(Cotton’s claim that police officers “bore the brunt of the violence” was questionable, givenhow many protesterswere also killed or maimed, but it is true that numerous police officers were attacked, including fatally). Cotton acknowledged that the central cause of the protests was a just one, noting they were provoked by “the wrongful death of George Floyd.” He also strongly affirmed the right of people to peacefully protest in support of that cause, accusing those justifying the violence of “a revolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters,” adding: “A majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldn’t be confused with bands of miscreants.”But he insisted that, absent military reinforcements, innocent people, principally ones in poor communities, will suffer. “These rioters, if not subdued, not only will destroy the livelihoods of law-abiding citizens but will also take more innocent lives,” Cotton wrote, adding: “Many poor communities thatstill bear scarsfrom past upheavals will be set back still further.”The backlash to the publication of this op-ed was immediate, intense, and, at least in my memory, unprecedented. Very few people were interested in engaging the merits of Cotton’s call for a deployment of troops in order to prove the argument was misguided. Their view was not that Cotton’s plea for soldiers in the streets was misguided, but that advocacy for it was so obscene, so extremist, so dangerous and repugnant, that the mere publication of the op-ed by The Paper of Record was an act of grave immorality.“I’ll probably get in trouble for this, but to not say something would be immoral. As a black woman, as a journalist, I am deeply ashamed that we ran this,” pronounced the paper’s Nikole Hannah-Jones in a now-deleted tweet. Thewriter Taffy Brodesser-Aknerposteda multi-tweet denunciation that compared Cotton to an anti-Semite who “says, ‘The Jew is a pig,’"" argued that “hatred dressed up as opinion is not something I have to withstand,” and concluded with this flourish: “I love working at the Times and most days of the week I'm very proud to be part of its mission. But tonight, I understand the people who treat me like I work at a tobacco company.”Formereditor andHuffington Posteditor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen announced, also in a now-deleted tweet: “I spent some of the happiest and most productive years of my life working for the New York Times. So it is with love and sadness that I say: running this puts Black@nytimesstaff – and many, many others – in danger.” That publication of the Cotton op-ed “puts Black New York Times staffin danger” became a mantra recited bymore journaliststhan one can list. Two editors — including the paper’s Editorial Page editorJames Benettand a young assistant editorAdam Rubenstein— were forced out of their jobs, in the middle of a pandemic, for the crimeof endorsing Cotton’s argument but merely airing it. Media reports attributed their departure to a “staff revolt.” The paper itself appended a major editor’s note: “We have concluded that the essay fell short of our standards and should not have been published.” In addition to alleged flaws in the editorial process, the paper also said “the tone of the essay in places is needlessly harsh and falls short of the thoughtful approach that advances useful debate.”There is a meaningful difference between deploying National Guard troops and active duty soldiers on American streets. But both measures are extraordinary, create a climate of militarization, have a history of resulting in excessive force against citizens engaged in peaceful protest and constitutionally protected dissent, and present threats and dangers to civil liberties far beyond ordinary use of law enforcement. Why was the idea of troops in American streets so grotesque and offensive in June, 2020 but so normalized now? Why were these troops likely to indiscriminately arrest and murder black reporters and other journalists over the summer but are now trusted to protect them? And what does it say about the current climate, and the serious dangers it poses, that the public is being trained so easily to acquiesce to extreme measures in the name of domestic security?We are witnessing the media and their public treat what ought to be regarded with great suspicion as not only normal but desirable, all through the manipulation of fears and inflation of threats. That does not bode well for those who seek to impede theimminent attempt to begin a new domestic War on Terror.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0419472873141351,0.4667586987288074,2431,2,Glenn Greenwald

The Amazon founder revealed this week that both he and his brother Mark would take a place on board the company’s New Shepard launch vehicle on July 20, to fly to the edge of space and back. They will be joined by the winner of Saturday’s charity auction, whose identity will be disclosed in coming weeks, and by a fourth, as yet unnamed space tourist, according to Blue Origin’s director of astronaut and orbital sales Ariane Cornell. Saturday’s successful bidder beat some 20 rivals in an auction launched on May 19 and wrapped up with a 10-minute, live-cast frenzy. Bidding had reached US$4.8 million by Thursday, but shot up spectacularly in the final live auction, rising by million dollar increments. The proceeds – aside from a six per cent auctioneer’s commission – will go to Blue Origin’s foundation, Club for the Future, which aims to inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEM – science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Taking off from a desert in western Texas, the New Shepard trip will last a total of 10 minutes, four of which passengers will spend above the Karman line that marks the recognised boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and space. After lift-off, the capsule separates from its booster, then spends four minutes at an altitude exceeding 100km (60 miles), during which time those on board experience weightlessness and can observe the curvature of Earth from space. The booster lands autonomously on a pad 3.2km (two miles) from the launch site, and the capsule floats back to the surface with three large parachutes that slow it down when it lands. Bezos, who announced earlier this year he is stepping down as chief executive of Amazon to spend more time on other projects including Blue Origin, has said he would be fulfilling a lifelong dream by flying into space. Blue Origin’s New Shepard has successfully carried out more than a dozen unmanned test runs from its facility in the Guadalupe Mountains of west Texas. The reusable suborbital rocket system was named after Alan Shepard, the first American in space 60 years ago. The automated capsules with no pilot have six seats with horizontal backrests placed next to large portholes, in a futuristic cabin with swish lighting.

S. military completes its withdrawal from embattled Afghanistan at the end of next month, the country’s wire service Khaama Press (KP) reported Thursday. KPnoted:Human and women’s rights advocates have asked Biden administration to add up to two thousand expedited and additional visas for women and advocated of women’s rights who are prone to danger and threat after US full pullout from Afghanistan.…US officials have told Reuters that Biden’s administration is considering to grant additional visas to Afghan women politicians, journalists and activists. The report came on Thursday, the same day that Bidenvowedto evacuate some of the Afghans who worked for the U. S. government and military and their family members who already applied for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) to wait out the lengthy and complex process outside of Afghanistan if they choose to. There are 18,000 SIV applicants with an estimated 50,000 family members stuck in bureaucratic limbo waiting for the U. S. to process their visas. SIVs are available to Afghans who fear Taliban revenge attacks against them and their families for working for the U. S. as interpreters, drivers, engineers, security guards, embassy clerks, fixers, contractors, and other capacities. Biden told reporters that his administration would start relocation flights for Afghan SIV applicants who want to wait out the already backlogged process outside of Afghanistan. Without explicitly saying exactly where the Afghan evacuees will go, Bidendeclaredduring the press briefing that the operation to get them out “has identified U. S. facilities outside the continental United States, as well as in third countries to host our Afghan allies.”According to Biden, not all SIV applicants want to wait out the challenging process outside their home country. Some of them may be denied. Human and women’s rights advocates have reportedly told the White House and State Department, which oversees U. S. visas, that America should include women in any urgent plan to evacuate Afghans. They “not only asked” the Biden Administration “for women’s visas but also men and minority-groups who are subject to life-threatening dangers,” KP noted. U. S. lawmakers have proposed bills to expedite the SIV process by eliminating national security and fraud safeguards, potentially resulting in any Afghan becoming eligible for the visa, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)reportedThursday. CIS learned that pending bills in the House and Senate are seeking to speed up the SIV process by no longer requiring applicants to show that they performed “sensitive and trusted work” to qualify. Some of the proposals would do away with the requirement that applicants prove they are at risk if they stay in Afghanistan. Moreover, the bills will nearly double the number of available visas, despite fast approaching U. S. military withdrawal. In recent statements, the Taliban has asserted that Afghans who contributed to the U. S. military mission are free to live, adding that they will not target them as long as they repent, KP noted. KP conceded that neither the White House nor the State Department has officially committed to accepting the rights group’s recommendations.",1,Questionable,0.052828884078884,0.3334656084656084,709,1,Breitbart
130,Liz Cheney and the ‘Big Lie’,22.5,13.0,https://amgreatness.com/2021/05/10/liz-cheney-and-the-big-lie/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-10,25,"The vote this week on Representative Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) status as House Republican conference chairman vastly transcends her. All sides are correct that it is a battle over the “Big Lie.”Cheney, the Democrats, and NeverTrumpers all say the Big Lie is the contention that 2020 was not a fair election. They argue further that Donald Trump tried to promote the violent overthrow of the government on January 6 at the Capitol. They support Joe Biden’s claim in his address to Congress last month, that his (unnamed) predecessor had left the country “staring into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy.”Trump supporters and many independents say this series of false and defamatory allegations is the actual Big Lie. It is already clear that Cheney, deservedly, will be thrown out of her leadership and presumably defeated in her bid to remain the representative from Wyoming. She voted with the former president on most occasions; their differences are not primarily over public policy. For her own reasons, she has not only come out of the Trump-hate closet, but declined even to bother testing the air as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and some others did, by squealing with joy that Trump was gone and then noting that perhaps he had not gone and abruptly returning to the closet of ambiguity. No one outside of Wyoming, except Peggy Noonan, cares a whit about Liz Cheney. The question is whether the NeverTrumpers, abetted by the Democrats, can kill Trump’s chances of a political resurrection. Success will be impossible unless they can both stamp out the belief of approximately half the voters that 2020 was a tainted election, and keep alive the fiction that Trump was actively promoting an insurrection on January 6. This is bunk and the cornerstone of what is really the Big Lie—the Trump-haters’ theory that he is just a hooligan and a sore loser of a fair election. In truth, the only reason that has any traction at all is due to the failure of the judiciary to address the constitutional and electoral controversies Trump raised. Trump warned of the dangers of ballot harvesting, but his campaign wasn’t ready on the ground or in the courts to tackle the issue when it presented itself. And he didn’t help his case with his nonsense about having won the popular vote. In these respects, he is not blameless. Yet we are endlessly told about the “86 cases” thrown out of court which, because of that fact alone, debunk Trump. This is part of the real falsehood: There were only 28 cases in six seriously contested states by or on behalf of President Trump, as well as the lawsuit brought by the attorney general of Texas, supported by 18 other states, against Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The Texas allegation was that those states had violated the Constitution by altering election and vote-counting methods outside of legislation, and had failed in their duty to assure an honest election. The Supreme Court seemed interested at first, but then determined that Texas had no standing to challenge an election in another state (a preposterous finding, whatever the merits of the allegations—the high court was just chickening out). Of the other cases, 12 of the 28 cases were in Pennsylvania andnone of the 29 was actually adjudicated. In Georgia, Trump sued “an improper party” over the 90 percent decline in the ballot-rejection rate. The argument over the alleged 20,000 Georgia non-residents who voted couldn’t be heard because Georgia’s secretary of state, the respondent, was not himself a candidate for office. Trump’s lawsuit in Michigan over failure to allow access to his observers was ruled moot because it was filed late. That was when we saw people applauding as Republican observers were evicted and plywood placed over the windows. The judge also ignored a recent ruling requiring surveillance of all drop boxes installed after October 1. The allegation in Pennsylvania that between 144,000 and 288,000 possibly illegal absentee ballots were accepted was rejected because the request came in 11 days late. Judicial allegations by the Trump campaign of widespread irregularities in Wisconsin were not adjudicated because a divided state Supreme Court determined that the case had to start in the lower courts and wind its way upwards, completely impossible within the constitutional deadlines. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court overruled a lower court and determined that in Philadelphia all that was necessary was for one representative of each party to be in the room where votes were counted, not necessarily to verify the counting process itself. In Arizona, it was determined that the Trump claim was untimely because the same methods objected to had been used in the August Democratic primary election, of which the Trump campaign was apparently supposed to be fully aware. In the same case, a number of other odd developments were ignored to reach the conclusion that “the evidence does not show illegal votes,” in a state where more than 400,000 foreign citizens who entered the United States illegally reside, and many were believed to have voted, and which went to Biden by 10,000 votes out of more than 3.2 million cast. The Democrats’ effort to produce evidence that January 6 was a Trump planned assault on democratic government will be as complete a failure as the’ Tom Friedman’s theory of four years ago that Trump’s collusion with Russia in the 2016 election was as great an assault on American sovereignty as Pearl Harbor or 9/11. Liz Cheney has unwittingly helped to clarify the issues arising from last year’s election. The country must decide that it was an entirely fair and unquestionable election and that Trump was trying to incite insurrection on January 6 or it must acquiesce in the possibility that he will return as president. The McConnell faction seems determined to close ranks to fight oppression by the radical Left in the Democratic congressional caucuses and work for Republican victories next year. Peggy Noonan’s theory that the Republicans are tearing themselves apart is also bunk. Republicans can get a candidate other than Trump if they want but not on the false charge that he has no legitimate complaint about the 2020 election, or that he was trying to stir up a revolt on January 6. McConnell and most of the wiser anti-Trump elements in the Republican Party leaped back into their trenches and presumably will return to the comparative discretion most of them observed while Trump was president. Those unable to contain their Trump-hate will bite the dust if they have to deal with a primary opponent—e.g., Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Senators Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), and one or two others can grumble, but presumably even they realize that being useful idiots for the Democrats is not what they were sent to Washington to accomplish. Trump’s enemies are going to have to face the facts: They defeated him with a tainted election—assisted by the abdication of the judiciary from its constitutional status as a coequal branch of government with the executive and the legislature, and with a sandbag job from almost the entire media. The attempt to hang January 6 around his neck has been a complete fiasco, led, appropriately, by the director of the much-diminished FBI, Christopher Wray. The dawning awareness that Trump or a candidate approved by him can only be kept out of the White House in 2024 will, on past form, lead his enemies to an even more frenzied assault. It won’t fly. This is an incompetent administration seriously mismanaging the most dubious mandate any president has ever had. (Hayes and Tilden reached a compromise in 1876.) When Cheney gets the high jump this week the real loser will be the attempt to suppress any real examination of what happened last election. There were a lot of other improprieties in the 2020 election; if 42,000 votes for Biden in three states had shifted to Trump, he would have been reelected. These are the indisputable facts and the Democratic propaganda machine will not succeed in exterminating the truth which is that 2020 was rivaled only by 1876 as the most dubious presidential election result in the country’s history. Here, the thieves are the self-righteous. Trump isn’t the problem, his enemies are.",0,Problematic,0.0309938837920489,0.4415596330275229,1753,0,American Greatness
131,Locked in? Republicans appear to have votes to take up a SCOTUS nominee this year,8.0,45.67,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/locked-in-republicans-appear-to-have-votes-to-take-up-a-scotus-nominee-this-year,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-21,25,"Senate Republicans said Monday they are ready to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, despite the election-year timing and the objections of Democrats, and they appear to have the votes to do it.“I think the vast majority of our conference is going to be OK with whatever the speed with which we move is,” Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, told the Washington Examiner. A Monday evening statement by Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, appears to give Republicans at least 50 votes in favor of moving and eventually confirming a nominee, with Vice President Mike Pence able to break a tie if needed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday the Senate will vote sometime this year on a high-court nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday. McConnell did not indicate whether the nomination would make it to the floor before the Nov. 3 election or sometime later this year, but the timing is expected to be sorted out quickly, a GOP aide said. So far, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski are the only two GOP senators signaling they’ll oppose consideration of any nominee this year. Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican who frequently clashes with President Trump, told reporters in the Capitol Monday night he would wait to make a decision and planned to confer with fellow Republicans at a critical, closed-door GOP conference meeting on Tuesday. Republicans control 53 votes, and even if Romney opposes taking up a nominee, Pence could cast the deciding vote. Consideration of a Supreme Court nominee is considered the most consequential vote of a senator’s career, and it will be difficult for Republicans to vote to block a nominee selected by a president in their own party, no matter the timing. Murkowski and Collins base their current objection on the GOP’s decision in 2016 to block consideration of Merrick Garland, who was President Barack Obama’s pick to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. At the time, McConnell cited the upcoming election as the reason for punting on Garland. Collins is running in a highly contested race for a fifth term, and recent polls show her trailing Democratic competitor Sara Gideon. Democrats have attacked McConnell this week on his announced plan to try to confirm a nominee. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the GOP had “no right” to confirm a nominee so close to the election and accused McConnell of a double standard.“If that was how Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans justified their mindless obstruction of President Obama’s nominee, surely, they must abide by their own standard,” Schumer said. “What’s fair is fair. A senator’s word must count for something.”But Republicans told the Washington Examinerthe circumstances are not the same today.“Four years ago, Obama was president, and we were in control of the Senate, and we certainly weren’t going to do it,” Sen. Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, told the Washington Examiner. “There’s a political equation here, too. Why would enough Republicans turn their back on a conservative judge, when they’ve got the power and they could lose the power. That would be more than dumb.”Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, told the Washington Examinerhe won’t hesitate to vote on a high-court nominee this year and neither should his Republican colleagues.“Isn’t that what we are supposed to do? Isn’t that our job?” Paul said. “I don’t think there is any constitutional mandate you shouldn’t let a president appoint someone and approve them. I think that is what we are supposed to do, that’s our job.”Gardner put out a statement Monday supporting the consideration of a nominee. He was among the remaining Republicans whose decisions were in question. Gardner is up for a second term, and his reelection bid is considered a toss-up.“I have and will continue to support judicial nominees who will protect our Constitution, not legislate from the bench, and uphold the law,” Gardner said. “Should a qualified nominee who meets this criteria be put forward, I will vote to confirm.”Other Republicans told the Washington Examinerthey, too, would base their decision on Trump’s nominee and whether they approved of his choice. Trump has released a long list of conservative names who are widely supported by the GOP.“For me, personally, I’m simply waiting to see who the president is going to nominate,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican. Trump said he would make an announcement by the weekend, after services for Ginsburg take place.“My consideration is based on the nominee,” Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, said. “I want to make sure I’m voting for a pro-Constitution justice.”He said the nominee’s interpretation ofRoe v. Wade, the high-court decision legalizing abortion, is also critical. Hawley called it “my threshold question.”The favorite among the most conservative lawmakers is U. S. Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett, 48, a constitutional scholar, devout Catholic, and mother of seven who was confirmed by the Senate in 2017 with the backing of three Democrats.“That seems to be the one everyone is talking about, if only because she’s been considered before,” Sen. Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, said. Hawley and other Republicans said the Senate should act before the election because a lame-duck confirmation would be more difficult if the Senate flips to Democratic control or Trump loses to former Vice President Joe Biden.“I suspect you’ll have folks within my caucus who would then become less comfortable, depending on the outcome,” Hawley said. “It introduces a whole new set of considerations. I think it should ideally come before Election Day.”",3,Reliable,0.0927908335051192,0.5469495407590645,1245,2,Washington Examiner
132,Opposing Repressive Regimes in the Middle East Is a Death Sentence,-2.9,45.2,https://www.fairobserver.com/world-news/middle-east-news/bill-law-middle-east-human-rights-bahrain-saudi-arabia-egypt-iran-regime-repression-news-14415/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,21,"The ruling by Bahrain’s top judicial body, the court of cassation, on July 13 to uphold thedeath sentencesof Mohammed Ramadhan and Husain Moosa has been decried by human rights organizations,condemnedin the UK House of Lords and questioned in the British Parliament. Whether any of that will save the men from execution is debatable. The men were convicted and sentenced to death in 2014 for the killing of a policeman. That conviction was overturned when evidence emerged that they had been tortured into giving false confessions. Despite that decision, the death penalty was reinstated and subsequently confirmed by the court of cassation. An official in the public prosecutor’s office defended the court’s latest ruling while denying theaccusations of torture, claiming that medical reports showed that the confessions were obtained “in full consciousness and voluntarily, without any physical or verbal coercion.”That confounds the earlier court decision to throw out the convictions, which was based on an investigation undertaken by the Bahraini government’s ownSpecial Investigation Unitthat showed the men had been tortured. However, in the contorted reality of the kingdom’s politicized judicial system, the court of cassation decided that the convictions were not based on evidence extracted under torture but rather on other evidence. Amnesty Internationaldenouncedthe latest verdict, saying: “The two men were taken to the Criminal Investigations Department where they were tortured during interrogation. Mohamed Ramadhan refused to sign a ‘confession’, though he was subjected to beating and electrocution. Hussain Ali Moosa said he was coerced to ‘confess’ and incriminate Mohamed Ramadhan after being suspended by the limbs and beaten for several days.”Moosa has said that, after his genitalia were repeatedly beaten, he was told that if he signed a confession implicating Ramadhan his sentence would be commuted to life: “They were kicking me on my reproductive organs, and would hit me repeatedly in the same place until I couldn’t speak from the pain. I decided to tell them what they wanted.” His repudiation of the confession was ignored by the courts. In UK Parliament, four days prior to the court of cassation ruling, the Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley hadaskedForeign Secretary Dominic Raab for a statement on whether he would use what he called “the UK’s constructive dialogue” with Bahrain to publicly raise the cases of the men. In reply, the Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly spoke of a “close and important relationship” with an “ongoing, open and genuine dialogue” with Bahrain. The minister averred that “this dynamic” enabled the UK to raise human rights concerns, adding “the cases of Mr Moosa and Mr Ramadhan had been, and would continue to be, raised in conversations with officials in Bahrain.”Earlier this month, it was revealed that another heavily politicized judiciary, this time in Iran, had upheld the death sentences of three young Iranian protesters who had been arrested in November of last year during countrywide protests that sawhundreds killedby security forces. Though moving swiftly to convict the men and sentence them to death, the authorities have done virtually nothing about investigating the killings carried out by the state in suppressing the protests. Amongst media highlighting their case is the Saudi news siteAl Arabiya. It noted that a hashtag trending in Iran, “#do not execute,” has had over 2 million tweets. On July 19, Iranhalted the executions, according to one of the lawyers for the accused. In 2019, Saudi Arabia executed arecord 184 people, including six women, many for drug-related offenses. Some were crucified after being beheaded. At least one was a minor. In April, the kingdom announced it would no longer execute juveniles; rather it would sentence them to a maximum of 10 years in a juvenile detention center. It is unclear if the decree will save the life ofAli al-Nimr, who was 17 when arrested and 19 when sentenced to death. His uncle Nimr al-Nimr, a prominent Shia Muslim cleric and critic of the ruling family, was beheaded in 2016. In Egypt, more than2,000 peoplehave been sentenced to death since Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, with nearly 200 executed. At least 10 children have been sentenced to hang. In the country’s prison system, there is another kind of death — by deliberate medical neglect, as was the case with the country’s first democratically elected president Mohammed Morsi. He was repeatedly denied medication for his diabetes and collapsed and died in a Cairo court on June 17, 2019. On November 8 last year, a panel of UN experts led by Agnes Callamard, the special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions,concludedthat Morsi’s death “after enduring those conditions could amount to a State-sanctioned arbitrary killing”. The caseshed lighton the horrific conditions in Egypt’s overcrowded and brutal prison system, a situation that has been severely exacerbated by theCOVID-19 pandemic. On July 13, prominent Egyptian journalistMohamed Monirdied from COVID-19. He had been arrested and held in pre-trial detention for criticizing, on the Al Jazeera news network, thegovernment’s handlingof the coronavirus crisis. The charge against him was broadcasting false news. The 65-year-old suffered from heart disease and diabetes, and was therefore at high risk of contracting the disease. After falling ill Monir was released to hospital a week before he died. An influential critical voice was silenced. Surely that was the intention — death, be it by medical malfeasance or by execution, is a powerful weapon in the hands of authoritarian regimes.

133,Big Tech and Other Multinationals Are About to Pay a Lot More in Taxes,-4.67,46.67,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/04/biden-big-tech-multinationals-corporate-tax-reform/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-04,25,"On the eve of his first overseas trip as U. S. president, Joe Biden is pushing for a dramatic revamping of international corporate tax policies that could resolve a stalemate between the United States and Europe over taxing America’s Big Tech sector and make it much harder for all major multinational corporations to exploit tax havens. On the eve of his first overseas trip as U. S. president, Joe Biden is pushing for a dramatic revamping of international corporate tax policies that could resolve a stalemate between the United States and Europe over taxing America’s Big Tech sector and make it much harder for all major multinational corporations to exploit tax havens. Meeting in London on Friday, the G-7 finance ministers are expected to endorse a proposal by Biden and U. S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for a minimum global corporate tax of at least 15 percent, part of a measure that major governments hope will yield corporate taxes that are not getting paid worldwide. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is responsible for writing tax guidelines in the world’s wealthiest nations, is leading the discussions. This week, the new OECD secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, called Biden’s plan a “game-changer” and said he was “quietly optimistic” about reaching an international deal on taxing multinational companies. Biden is also asking the G-7 and G-20 nations to approve an additional proposal requiring the world’s largest and most profitable companies to pay taxes in any country they sell goods or services to. The new approach would upend century-old policies that now make it legally necessary for corporations to be physically present in countries where they are taxed. Though the proposal would also apply to other multinationals from many other countries, it is partly an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute among the United States, the European Union, and other countries worldwide over how to deal with major tech companies, most of them headquartered in the United States. Both the Obama and Trump administrations refused to consider a digital tax specifically targeted at companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. And until now, countries haven’t been able to tax the profits of goods and services sold under their jurisdictions if the corporation is not headquartered there. Under the Biden administration, the United States has gone from being the No. 1 holdout on corporate tax reform to the champion for such a transformation—including new taxes on Silicon Valley’s tech titans. It’s far from a done deal, with Ireland and other tax havens resisting the Biden proposal, but U. S. officials say they fully expect an endorsement from the G-7 as well as major G-20 nations such as Japan, India, Argentina, and South Africa. On Wednesday, the Biden administration imposed, and then immediately suspended, 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on six countries—Austria, Britain, India, Italy, Spain, and Turkey—that have imposed a tax on digital services that Washington says discriminates against U. S. companies. The move was interpreted as a warning to go along with the Biden proposal.“It’s a negotiating ploy,” said Michael Greenberger, an expert in international finance at the University of Maryland. “Essentially, what they’re telling these countries is this is not a free vote for you. There’s a significant threat of pain, and we’re going to give you six months to think about this.”If approved by the G-7 ministers, Biden is expected to sign off on the deal at his summit next week in Cornwall, England. If an agreement is then reached by the G-20 finance ministers at their meeting in July—and finally by leaders at the G-20 summit in October—the changes could amount to a virtual revolution in international corporate tax policies. And at a time when multilateral trade negotiations are stalled, the forthcoming pact could also open the door to new trade deals, some experts say.“This agreement could be the starting point for the reemergence of multilateralism in international trade,” said Eduardo Baistrocchi, a professor of tax law at the London School of Economics. “The next stage might be a new wave of free trade agreements.”A senior Biden administration official toldthat the “two pillars” of the negotiations amount to a trade-off. The administration will demand agreement on one pillar—a minimum global corporate tax of 15 percent—in exchange for the ability to tax U. S. digital giants and other multinationals that often find tax havens where they are charged only a few percentage points.“We’ve never had as much momentum as we’ve had now,” the official said. Such changes would also have to be approved by Congress, but administration officials believe some Republicans might be on board, and the filibuster rule that has blocked so much legislation could well be eliminated by the time the proposal comes up for a vote, perhaps next year. For Biden, the new corporate tax plan is integral to his broader aim of reorienting the U. S. and global economy away from exploitation by major corporations and back to labor. Biden’s “Made in America” tax plan seeks to eliminate incentives for offshore investment and reverse a trend under which, even though U. S. corporations are the most profitable in the world, the United States collects less in corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP than almost any advanced economy in the OECD. Yet the problem of missing corporate tax revenue affects all advanced economies. For more than a decade since the Great Recession, revenue-strapped major countries have sought to find ways to collect tax revenue for multinationals that have headquartered themselves in tax havens such as Ireland, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Caribbean locales like the Cayman Islands. The so-called race to the bottom among countries has driven down corporate tax rates substantially over the last two decades. The average statutory corporate rate among OECD countries was 32.2 percent in 2000; by 2020, this had fallen to 23.2 percent, according to the OECD.“Our goal is to end the global race to the bottom in terms of corporate taxation,” said the administration official. “Every country is made worse off by tax competition, especially workers. … When people say they feel the system is rigged, and when you consider why we have such extreme inequality, tax is a big part of the story.” The official pointed out that corporate revenue as a share of U. S. GDP fell from an average of 2 percent in 2000 to 1 percent in 2018 and 2019. “That’s one-third of the average of the OECD,” the official said. “And we have to fix it.”Even before Biden assumed the presidency, the web had been slowly closing on tax evasion by individuals. In recent years, the OECD, working with more than 100 countries worldwide, adopted new international standards on the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes that have curtailed the use of tax havens and resulted in more than $100 billion in additional tax revenues to OECD countries, according to the organization’s data. And in 2019, the OECDproposeda new formulation for the way taxing rights are allocated across jurisdictions to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. Its proposal would empower states to treat some multinationals as single, consolidated entities and tax them on a share of their worldwide profitsbasedon where “real” economic activity occurs. The profits targeted are known as “residual” or excessive profits of higher than 10 to 20 percent margins. Biden’s proposal builds on these ideas. If enacted, Baistrocchi said Biden’s plan would amount to the “first systemic attempt” to redistribute profits and revenues from tax havens and multinational corporations since the 1930s.is a columnist forHe is the author of two books:Capital Offense: How Washington’s Wise Men Turned America’s Future Over to Wall StreetandAt War With Ourselves: Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World.

Saying to someone “I’m sorry your foot was in the street and therefore I rolled over it with my car,” is not an apology. Saying how you really feel and then apologizing because you’ve been called out is not an apology, it’s a get-right. Meaning, you’re trying to get right so you don’t lose your job or endorsements or public standing after spouting your true feelings. See,ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith’s apologyfor his xenophobic comments about Japanese Major League Baseball star Shohei Ohtani. Smith’s apology had nothing to do with own feelings and everything to do with getting right with his employer. So with that I say, fuck Texas Deputy Attorney General Aaron Reitz, who fixed his dumbass fingers to tweet that Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast in the history of the sport, is a “national embarrassment,” after she withdrew from the team final and the individual all-around competition earlier this week to focus on her mental health. Biles lives in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston, and it remains unclear whether we’ve seen the last of the most accomplished gymnast in the sport at the Tokyo Games. In a now-deleted tweet, Reitz, who would probably get winded running a city-block, “quote-tweeted video from Kerri Strug’s 1996 Olympic performance on an injured ankle” then said, “Contrast this with our selfish, childish national embarrassment, Simone Biles,”CBS Newsreports. Late Wednesday afternoon, Reitz tweeted to say he owed Biles “an apology. A big one”:It is exhausting dealing with the criticism of Black women who have elected to take care of themselves over everything. Show me one time where America ever gave a shit about Black womenwho still aren’t paid properlyand who arethree to four times more likely to die during pregnancythan their white counterparts. Why would a Black woman ever risk her mental health for a country that hasn’t figured out whythey are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancerand aremore at risk than white men to die from COVID-19?If Black women don’t look out for themselves and their own mental health who is going to? Surely not doctors. Doctors don’t even listen to them, and when they do, they don’t believe that Black women are suffering as badly as they say they are. Simone Biles is the face of a sportthat allowed her and her teammates to be sexually assaulted. Let that sink in. So fuck all of these Facebook warriors, elected officials and armchair quarterbacks who couldn’t carry Biles’ medals on a good day without needing to take a water break. And fuck America, too. You should be ashamed of yourself for wanting to ride the coattails of a Black woman when it’s patriotic, but can’t support her when she’s not performing for you.

136,"Dr. Anthony Fauci responds to criticism of Wuhan lab funding, release of thousands of his emails",3.67,44.0,https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-donlon-report/dr-anthony-fauci-responds-to-criticism-of-wuhan-lab-funding-release-of-thousands-of-his-emails/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-06-02,25,"CHICAGO (NewsNation Now) — Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the faces of the U. S. government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, responded to criticism of funding sent to a Chinese lab, the release of thousands of his emails, and the state of the pandemic in a wide-ranging interview Wednesday. You can watch Dr. Anthony Fauci’s full interview with Leland Vittert in the player above Dr. Fauci and the National Institutes of Health are facing scrutiny from Republican members of Congress and others over grant money paid to a lab in Wuhan, China in the early 2000s, as scientists increasingly question whether COVID-19 emerged from the lab. But Fauci said the research, which looked into the risk of bat coronaviruses being transmitted to humans, is being inappropriately connected to the Chinese military. “We’re not talking about the Communist Chinese party. We’re not talking about the Chinese military. We’re talking about scientists that we’ve had relationships for years,” Fauci said. The grant in question was given to a group called EcoHealth Alliance in 2002, which then paid the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which collects genetic material from wildlife and experiments with live viruses in animals to gauge human susceptibility. Fauci argued the amount of NIH funding which went to the lab was relatively low. “The Wuhan lab is a very large lab, to the tune of hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars — the grant that we’re talking about was $600,000 over five years,” Fauci said. To reduce the risk of pathogens escaping, the facility is supposed to enforce rigorous safety protocols, but even the strictest measures cannot eliminate such risks. While testifying before a Senate committee last Wednesday, Fauci acknowledged it wasn’t possible to tell if the grantee was lying about what the funds were used for, but said Wednesday the quality of reports issued by the lab suggested they were used appropriately. “I can’t guarantee everything that’s going on in the Wuhan lab, we can’t do that, but it is our obligation as scientists and public health individuals to study the animal-human interface because we had a very difficult experience that we lucked out that we didn’t get hurt too badly with the original SARS in 2002 and 2003,” Fauci said. Fauci said working with the lab was necessary in order to find out the potential for the viruses to infect humans, “which might then damage the United States.” “You don’t want to go to Hoboken, New Jersey or to Fairfax, Virginia to be studying the bat-human interface that may lead to an outbreak, so you go to China,” Fauci said. President Joe Biden has ordered American investigators to submit a report looking into the origins of COVID-19 within 90 days, and pledged to release the results of their findings publicly. China responded by accusing the U. S. of playing politics with the virus. Also this week, thousands of Fauci’s emails from early in the pandemic were released to news outlets including Buzzfeed and The Washington Post under a Freedom of Information Act request. They show Fauci’s communications with officials, reporters, celebrities and even concerned citizens as the pandemic unfolded. “The only trouble is they are really ripe to be taken out of context where someone can snip out a sentence in an email without showing the other emails and say, ‘based on an email from Dr. Fauci, he said such-and-such,” where you don’t really have the full context,” Fauci said. Looking ahead, Fauci said if the U. S. meets President Joe Biden’s goal of 70% of adults with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by Fourth of July, it will be a “giant step towards” returning to normal but the pandemic won’t be completely over. “Even though the virus is not going to disappear, it will diminish greatly as a public health threat, which means we can get closer to normality and we feel that by the time we get to the summer it will get better and better,” Fauci said.",3,Reliable,0.0439341146658219,0.3907322352444304,915,3,NewsNation Now
137,"Antidumping, China and “Deindustrialization”",9.0,43.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/antidumping-gets-its-moment-economic-sun,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,18,"Whether it’s due to the “China Shock” or “deindustrialization,” a common refrain from those seeking to support American manufacturers and workers via U. S. trade restrictions and subsidies is that these groups have been the helpless victims of “unfettered trade” and “free‐​market fundamentalism.” As I’ve explained in a series of recent papers, however, this narrative ignores (among other things) the panoply of U. S. laws that already exist to boost the manufacturing sector — laws that, despite their frequent and continued use, just haven’t worked very well in terms of increasing U. S. manufacturing jobs (and, in fact, have likely harmed the U. S. economy, domestic manufacturers, and blue‐​collar workers). Chief among those measures is the U. S. antidumping law, which allows domestic manufacturers and unions to request that the government impose special duties on injurious imports allegedly priced below “fair market value” and has been a (deserving) target of criticism here at Cato for more than four decades. Recent economic research has bolstered these criticisms, while demonstrating why any legitimate account of U. S.-China trade policy, the domestic manufacturing sector, and blue‐​collar jobs must acknowledge and evaluate current U. S. industrial policies before demanding new ones. In a July 2020 working paper, economists Alessandro Barattieri & Matteo Cacciatore examined the hundreds of U. S. antidumping measures (and less‐​frequent “countervailing duty” measures) imposed between 1994 and 2015 and found that duties (1) were concentrated in industrial inputs like primary metals and chemicals; (2) depressed employment in downstream U. S. industries (e.g., steel‐​users); but (3) provided no long‐​term benefit for jobs in the protected, upstream industries (e.g., steelmakers). Figure 5 below shows these employment effects. The authors attribute the downstream industries’ job‐​losses to declining competitiveness caused by higher input and finished goods prices. (Newsflash: water remains wet.)In a January 2021 paper, economists Chad Bown, Paola Conconi, Aksel Erbahar, and Lorenzo Trimarchi examined antidumping measures on Chinese imports imposed between 1988 and 2016 and found that these duties (1) increased substantially — in terms of duty rates, total import value, and number of measures — over the period examined, and particularly during the height of the “China Shock” in the 2000s (Figures 1, A‑1 and A‑2 below); (2) had large, negative effects on downstream industries in terms of increased production costs and decreased employment, wages, sales, and investment; but (3) had no significant effect on blue‐​collar jobs, wages, or sales in the protected industries (even though the duties decreased imports and increased foreign and domestic prices). They estimate that the antidumping measures cost approximately 1.85 million U. S. jobs between 1988 and 2016, primarily in blue‐​collar services industries (though 280,000 manufacturing jobs were also lost). They further provide evidence that duties were often politically motivated, with protection more likely when petitioning companies or workers are located in U. S. “swing states.”One can quibble with these authors’ exact figures, but the studies’ overall conclusions are consistent with past research showing that U. S. protectionism not only imposes significant economic costs for American companies, workers, and consumers, but also fails to create thriving domestic companies with expanding workforces. The papers also reiterate that any proper accounting of the costs and benefits of open markets generally, or of specific events like the “China Shock,” must consider jobs gained from imports (and lost from protectionism), as well as the longstanding inability of existing U. S. laws — far from “free‐​market fundamentalism” — to increase blue‐​collar manufacturing jobs. Such points are all‐​too‐​often missing.",3,Reliable,0.0460547939714606,0.4016273849607183,835,3,Cato Institute

140,Court ruling: Big Ten must disclose additional documents in next 10 days,2.67,48.67,https://omaha.com/sports/huskers/football/court-ruling-big-ten-must-disclose-additional-documents-in-next-10-days/article_5dfb72e7-3bb7-586d-b354-b488c91441f3.html#tracking-source=home-trending,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,22,"The Big Ten must disclose additional information related to its decision to postpone fall sports and do so in the next 10 days, the Lancaster County District Court ruled Wednesday. The order comes less than a week after eight Nebraska football players sued the league on multiple counts for its decision to push back fall sports. The Big Ten must produce all documents reflecting whether an official vote was taken on the decision, including the official tally but not including how individual members voted. It must also reveal in full its governing documents and bylaws — it submitted 13 pages of bylaws to the court last week but redacted more than 11 full pages.“The court’s order recognizes the time-sensitive nature of the lawsuit,” said Mike Flood, the lead attorney for NU players, in a statement. The typical timeline for discovery in Nebraska is 45 days. Between NU players filing their lawsuit Aug. 27 and the Sept. 12 deadline, the Big Ten will be compelled to disclose documents within 16 days. Players’ argument to speed up the process is based on the idea that the decision to postpone wrongfully interferes with their business expectations to build their personal brands and potentially profit from their name, image and likeness within a fall college season. Not all of the player requests were granted in the order. Meeting minutes, including audio and video recordings and transcripts, are not included in the order to produce. Players also asked for all medical assessments, studies and data between July 1 and Aug. 12 — the day after the postponement announcement came down — that went into the decision to postpone. In her order, Judge Susan Strong said that request was “potentially burdensome.”Though the Big Ten won’t be forced to reveal how individual presidents and chancellors voted, The World-Herald and other media outlets have confirmed the dissenting votes came from Nebraska, Iowa and Ohio State. The league has already submitted a sworn affidavit from Northwestern President and Council of Presidents and Chancellors Chairman Morton Schapiro saying the vote was 11-3. Wednesday’s ruling, in essence, forces the league to confirm that tally and not just one member of the COP/C.“Requiring the (Big Ten) to formally produce a limited amount of information is not unduly burdensome and may expedite the resolution of some of the issues in this time-sensitive lawsuit,” Strong said. The court ruling is only on the motion for expedited discovery, not the merits of the players’ case at large. NU player reps can take the suit in a variety of directions after reviewing documents of the vote and the full league bylaws. The lawsuit’s top stated objective is to invalidate the Big Ten’s decision to postpone fall sports. It also seeks greater transparency in how the league arrived at the decision and limited damages not exceeding $75,000.

One of the provisions of the Green New Deal is the guarantee of ""a job with a family-sustaining wages."" In a segmentairingon Fox News, host Steve Hilton asked Trump's thoughts on that. Ivanka Trump bizarrely assumed that only people who were unwilling to work needed a guarantee of employment. She stood up for the American working class, about whom she doesn't have a clue. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spoke for us all when she responded ""Imagine attacking a Jobs Guarantee by saying ‘people prefer to earn money.’""After getting destroyed on Twitter,Trump issued a clarification:Actually, the question she was asked was:The fact that she thought that guaranteed jobs were the same as charity shows how disconnected she is from the reality of unemployment. The fact that she has never had to work a day in her life was not lost on anyone.""They want the ability to be able to secure a job,"" says Trump. ""They want the ability to live in a country where’s there’s the potential for upward mobility.""Trump, who has only worked either with her father directly or used his money to start her own companies, has ahistoryof failing to provide that sort of ""upward mobility"" for employees in her factories - most of whom work overseas and are severely underpaid.

142,VP Harris to campaign for California Gov. Newsom as recall race heats up,2.67,43.67,https://nypost.com/2021/08/20/vp-harris-to-campaign-for-california-gov-newsom-in-recall-race/,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-20,25,"Vice President Kamala Harris will put in a good word forCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsomlater this month as Golden State voters grapple with whether to recall their state’s chief executive. The Sacramento Bee reported that Harris will join Newsom at a rally in the Bay Area on Aug. 27 to encourage Californians to vote “no” on Sept. 14 election — in the state’s second recall election in fewer than 20 years.“I am excited to join my friend and our vice president next week,” Newsom said in a statement. “The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher.”The intervention from Harris shows the extent of White House concerns about polls showing a close vote on the question of whether to keep or remove Newsom, who was elected governor in 2018 after eight years as second-in-command under fellow Democrat Jerry Brown. Last week, President Bidenissued a statementurging Californians to stand by Newsom, saying the governor had been “a key partner in fighting the pandemic and delivering economic relief to working families and helping us build our economy back better than ever … He knows how to get the job done because he’s been doing it.”An average of polls published since July 14 by thewebsite FiveThirtyEightshowed that support for keeping Newsom as governor was just 1.2 percentage points ahead of the support for ousting him. Under California law, voters who take part in the recall election will first be asked if Newsom should be recalled. If a simple majority votes “yes,” Newsom will become the second California governor to be removed from office midway through his term by the electorate — joining fellow Democrat Gray Davis, who achieved the dubious distinction in 2003. Voters will then be asked to chose from a list of 46 potential candidates to replace Newsom — nine Democrats, 24 Republicans, two members of the Green Party, a Libertarian and 10 other fringe candidates. If Newsom is recalled, the candidate on the list with the most votes will become California’s next governor — no majority necessary. No Democratic office-holders have put their names forward to succeed Newsom should he be recalled. The list of Republican candidates includes former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, Newsom’s defeated 2018 opponent John Cox and state Assemblyman Kevin Kiley — as well astalk radio host Larry Elderand Olympic gold medalist-turned-reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner. Newsom and Harris have deep Bay Area roots (he’s from San Francisco, she’s from Oakland) and have enjoyed simultaneous rises in California Democratic politics. Harris was elected San Francisco District Attorney in 2003, the same year Newsom won the first of his two terms as the city’s mayor. In 2010, when Newsom was elected lieutenant governor, Harris was elected to be state attorney general — a post she left after winning a Senate seat in 2016. Next week’s rally will take place as Harris makes her way back to Washington from Singapore and Vietnam, her second overseas trip as vice president.",3,Reliable,0.1181818181818181,0.3391053391053391,635,2,New York Post
143,Whitmer calls on Michigan legislature to pass law requiring masks,-3.0,50.67,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/11/05/whitmer-covid-michigan-mask-legislature/6175062002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,25,"The day before Michigan expects to record the 200,000th case of the coronavirus in the state, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on legislators to pass a law requiring residents to wear masks in indoorplaces and crowded outdoor areas. The governor said she sent a letter to Republican lawmakers this week asking them to pass a bill. Lawmakers, especially Republicans leading the House and Senate, have asked to have more of a role in the process of tackling the pandemic, Whitmer noted. Now is their time to act.""This is the law under epidemic orders. But we do think it would be helpful to our health, our safety and our economy if it was codified in a bipartisan (manner at) the Legislature, and that's what we've asked for, "" Whitmer said.""We've known for a long time that the single most important weapon that we have against this virus is the simple task of wearing a mask.""State health orders issued in October already require mask wearing in public. Yet case rates continue to rise. While Whitmer said she thinks putting the requirement in law would likely encourage Michiganders to take the precaution more seriously, she knows people are tired and frustrated.""We are all tired of dealing with COVID. And yet ignoring the problem is making it worse,"" Whitmer said.""I think fatigue is a part of it, I think the political rhetoric has created a lot of confusion and unnecessary suspicion around the efficacy of masks. However, studies have shown this remains the best tool that we have.""Whitmer said state health and labor officials are also ""increasing scrutiny"" of remote work policies, especially for employers requiring staff to work on-site. The state may cite employers, require changes and issue fines of up to $7,000, Whitmer said. The comments came the same day Michigan recorded its highest number of cases in any day since the start of the pandemic: 5,710. That brings the state's total case count to more than 197,800. The seven-day average daily case rate is above 3,500, much higher than at any point in the pandemic. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, state medical executive, said the percentage of positive tests is averaging 7.5%, though it exceeded 10% on Monday and Tuesday. Hospitalizations are four times higher now than they were at the end of August, and 60% are outside of southeast Michigan. More than 7,400 people have died from the coronavirus. There were more deaths in Michigan in October from the disease than in any month since May. About 2,300 people are now hospitalized in Michigan with COVID-19 symptoms, said Dr. Adnan Munkarah, Henry Ford Health System's executive vice president and chief clinical officer.""It is definitely taxing all health care systems and hospitals across the state,"" he said. The Detroit-based health system has re-activated its incident command center to allow it to ""make rapid changes as needed to accommodate the increasing number of patients"" who have COVID-19, Munkarah said. About 18% to 20% of the COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized at Henry Ford need to be admitted to intensive care units, he said, but fewer are in need of ventilator support.""Part of this is because we've learned much more about the disease over the past few months and how to manage it differently where we do not feel that we need to put people on respirators or ventilators so early,"" Munkarah said. For the time being, no elective procedures or medical services are limited at Henry Ford because of the rising coronavirus hospitalizations, but Munkarah said: ""We are going to continue to monitor things very, very closely.""But one of the biggest concerns he has is whether Henry Ford and other hospitals statewide will have enough staff to get through this surge. With so much community spread of the virus, hospital workers are at higher risk of contracting the virus just as everyone else. And if they get sick, Munkarah asked: ""Are we going to have enough staff to take care of patients in the hospital?""“If we don’t do anything else, if we don’t change our behaviors, we could be seeing 100 deaths per day by the end of December,"" Khaldun said.“We are really at a tipping point right now when it comes to COVID-19. … Our rates are rising exponentially. “What it’s like to vote when you have COVID-19Michigan coronavirus cases: Tracking the pandemicIn late October, state health officials announced it would be continuing regulations and restrictions intended to mandate mask wearing while in public, limit crowd sizes at private gatherings and in business, and generally promote actions that will stop the spread of the disease. That included requiring restaurants to keep contact information for patrons, in order to ease any potential contact tracing efforts. The state also limited the number of people who may eat at an establishment together at six, and reduced the number of people allowed at a gathering like a wedding venue that does not have fixed seating. Michigan sets new restrictions on dining, gatherings as COVID-19 cases riseCoronavirus Watch: Where cases are increasingHealth officials hurriedly issued a similar order in early October in response to Michigan Supreme Court rulings. The court, in a split decision, essentially invalidated executive orders put in place by Whitmer. The court determined one law Whitmer had relied upon was unconstitutional, and a second law required Whitmer to obtain approval from the Legislature if she wanted to extend a state of emergency. State health officials issued the restrictions under a completely separate law that was not in any way affected by the court's ruling.""We have to get the politics out of the public health crisis. It is killing us. It is jeopardizing our economy ... today, the most important tool that we have is a mask. And every one of us has an interest in masking up,"" Whitmer said Thursday. Michigan Supreme Court rules against Whitmer on emergency powers but effect unclearMichigan lawmakers approve extension of unemployment benefits, new nursing home rulesWhile state Republican legislative leaders have groused about Whitmer's decision to issue executive orders, the Legislature has not passed any comprehensive legislation aimed at stopping the spread of the disease. The GOP-led House and Senate have collaborated with the governor on legislation that helped schools open, extend unemployment benefits, give clarity to nursing home operators and new legal protections to some businesses.""Michiganders are tough. We have grit. Take care of each other. We can't stop now,"" Whitmer said.",3,Reliable,0.0470038941271817,0.4253300124533,1429,3,Detroit Free Press

Josh Holmes, a former McConnell aide who stopped working for the senator in 2015, posted a link to an article published by the Associated Press. The article outlined allegations against Walker,a Trump-backed potential candidateto run for the Senate in Georgia. Citing public records, the article alleged that Walker repeatedly threatened to kill his ex-wife and ""exaggerated his success.""""This is about as comprehensive a takedown as I've ever read.

Greene was stripped of her House Committee assignments in early February, in a vote supportedby 11 fellow Republican lawmakers. The decision came after bizarre old social media posts emerged in which Greene promoted wholly discredited conspiracy theories and appeared to endorse violence against Democratic lawmakers. Before that vote, McConnell made his views on the freshmen Republican congresswoman clear.""Loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country,"" he said in a statement at the time. ""Somebody who's suggested that perhaps no airplane hit thePentagonon 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.'s airplane is not living in reality.

146,Pelosi and Mnuchin agree to try to avoid government shutdown,0.0,49.67,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/03/pelosi-mnuchin-plan-clean-cr-but-length-other-details-unclear/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,23,"An agreement between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to pursue a “clean” stopgap spending measure significantly reduces the chances of a government shutdown at month’s end but leaves most other funding questions unanswered. Tuesday’s accord, days before Congress prepares to return from summer recess, shows that neither President Donald Trump nor Republican or Democratic lawmakers see a political advantage in risking a partial shutdown just ahead of the elections. The agreement on a “clean” stopgap may be shorthand for avoiding “poison pills” or other controversial provisions that could hamper such a measure’s enactment. Nevertheless, the door is open to potentially dozens of tweaks to spending provisions and temporary extensions of expiring programs, which often ride on a stopgap, Republican and Democratic aides familiar with the process said. The White House requested three dozen adjustments or “anomalies” to current fiscal 2020 spending laws that would be extended into the next fiscal year in a stopgap, and another 51 extensions of, or legislative tweaks to, federal programs set to expire before the end of the year. The House and Senate Appropriations committees have compiled their own lists of adjustments after conversations with agency officials. One looming question is the stopgap’s length, something Mnuchin and Pelosi, D-Calif., did not discuss, aides familiar with their phone conversation Tuesday said. The White House and GOP lawmakers prefer acontinuing resolutioninto December, giving the current Congress and president leverage to negotiate the final fiscal 2021 spending bills before a new Congress convenes in January. It is unclear where Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N. Y., will come down on this. Some Democrats speculate Pelosi may prefer a stopgap that extends into next year, when Democrats hope they will take control of the Senate and the White House in addition to holding the House. The agreement to negotiate a clean stopgap was a bright spot Tuesday in a reportedly otherwise dispiriting Mnuchin-Pelosi phone call over the shape of a new COVID-19 relief bill. In a press release following the conversation, Pelosi said the call “made clear that Democrats and the White House continue to have serious differences understanding the gravity of the situation that America’s working families are facing.”During a hearing before a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on the same day, Mnuchin said Schumer and Pelosi “do not want to sit down at the negotiating table unless we publicly agree on a topline.”“My own opinion,” Mnuchin said, “is we should go piece by piece, and any area of the legislation we can agree on we should have the House and Senate pass.”Pelosi has said Democrats would be willing to go down to a bill costing $2.2 trillion, while White House officials have talked about going up to $1.3 trillion.",3,Reliable,0.1136931818181818,0.4310606060606061,637,3,Roll Call

The report was compiled by a team of personnel from outside the Department of the Army who were tasked with examining the command climate and culture at Fort Hood and its surrounding community in central Texas.“My preliminary review of the report, recent cases and recent media coverage, have hardened my belief that the Army’s SHARP program hasn’t achieved its mandate to eliminate sexual assaults and sexual harassment by creating a climate that respects the dignity of every member of the Army family,” McCarthy said in a video statement Wednesday afternoon. Army leadership intends to also release an action plan to address the review’s recommendations when it’s released next month. The Army’sSexual Harassment/Assault Response and Preventionprogram, or SHARP, has been under scrutiny in recent months following the death of Spc. Vanessa Guillen, a Fort Hood soldier who prosecutors say was murdered in an armory on post by a fellow 3rd Cavalry Regiment trooper. Guillen’s family said she had been sexually harassed by a fellow soldier prior to her death, but she didn’t report the incident for fear of retribution. Following those allegations, Army Forces Command sent a small team in June to specifically look at theSHARP program on Fort Hood. FORSCOM’s review found that the post’s SHARP program overall meets Army standards. But the team also found that 18 out of the 52 women surveyed on post, about one-third, reported being sexually harassed. That number concerned lawmakers and prompted questions about whether the standards of success for SHARP programs need to be changed. TheGovernment Accountability Officeannounced in late August that it would review the Army’s SHARP program, as well, following complaints from members of Congress who sought more answers. Natalie Khawam, an attorney representing the Guillen family, said McCarthy’s comments “corroborated what I have been emphasizing.”Khawam drafted a piece of legislation called the Vanessa Guillen Act, which would create an independent system to investigate both sexual harassment and sexual assault incidents. It would also provide independent charging decisions for courts-martial.“Victims like Vanessa Guillen, who suffered from sexual harassment and assault while serving our country, were failed by the system,” Khawam told Army Times. “In September Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi has promised to schedule our bill for a vote. We have patiently been waiting for her to tell us the date.”In his comments on video Wednesday, McCarthy said that it is “abundantly clear” that Army leaders must do more with regards to sexual harassment and assault investigations.“I am deeply saddened and concerned by the recent news reports of how sexual assault and sexual harassment have plagued our force and brought harm to our soldiers,” McCarthy said in the video statement Wednesday. “Leaders, regardless of rank, are accountable for what happens in their units and must have the courage to speak up and intervene when they recognize actions that bring harm to our soldiers and to the integrity of our institution.”McCarthy did not elaborate on which media reports he was referring to specifically, but Guillen’s case has sparked hundreds of survivors to come forward to sharestories of sexual traumain the military. Some of those stories were chronicled this week by CBS Evening News, which interviewed nearly two dozen victims and several whistle-blowers who worked for the SHARP programs as part of a series aired Tuesday. The problems at Fort Hood, however, go beyond issues related to sexual assault and harassment. The post has been plagued this year with a number of violent deaths that set it apart from other installations. Severalof thedeaths that involve foul playinvolveviolence against soldiersstationed there by civilians in the local community.“The numbers are high here,” McCarthy said during a visit to Fort Hood in early August. “They are the highest, in most cases, for sexual assault and harassment and murders for our entire formation — the U. S. Army.”Kyle Rempfer was an editor and reporter who has covered combat operations, criminal cases, foreign military assistance and training accidents. Before entering journalism, Kyle served in U.

148,The $15 minimum wage would most hurt the people it's intended to help,7.67,36.33,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/feb/15/the-15-minimum-wage-would-most-hurt-the-people-its/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-15,23,"As someone who grew up in poverty and worked much of her career to help others out of it, I know the importance of having a good job with a good income. It’s a way out of poverty for many. It allows people to provide for their families. And we all know the sense of dignity that comes from being able to support oneself. However, both economics and experience show us that Congress’ newest proposal to more than double the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour won’t create good incomes but would instead hurt the very people it’s intended to help. There are better ways to increase people’s wages that don’t create destruction in the process. For starters, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that a $15-an-hour minimum wage increase would cost 1.4 million to 2.7 million jobs. The report shows that while some employees would certainly make more money, many of their colleagues would pay for it with cuts to their work hours and even the loss of their jobs. That’s because when businesses are forced to pay employees more with no corresponding increase in revenues to help pay for it, they have to resort to some combination of cutting employees’ hours, laying off employees, replacing employees with automation, shipping jobs overseas, permanently closing their doors or passing the costs on to customers. We’ve already seen this happen when states and localities have raised the minimum wage on their own. Most of the time, the cost of a higher minimum wage can’t be entirely passed on to customers, as many customers refuse to pay — or aren’t able to afford — higher prices and end up buying less of what the business is selling. That leads to more hours cut, more layoffs and more employers — especially small businesses — shutting their doors for good. Betsy LeRoy, a Delaware restaurant owner and supporter of President Biden, recently told TheHeritage Foundationabout the real-world consequences businesses face. She said that if she had to pay every entry-level worker $15, their incomes would be too close to people who had been working for her for three or four years and had more experience. As a result, she would have to raise her current employees’ wages even more to make it fair. But where would that money come from? Especially now during COVID-19 with dining restrictions and fewer customers, it’s hard for restaurants to pay the people they already have. Government-imposed minimum wage increases are a bad idea to begin with, and they’re made worse when businesses are already struggling with COVID-19’s economic devastation. A minimum wage increase could push many hard-hit businesses out of business — then you’ll have a lot of former employees making $0 an hour. Heritage FoundationResearch Fellow Rachel Greszler recently pointed out another unintended consequence of a minimum wage increase. She analyzed the effect on child care costs and found that a $15 minimum wage would force many child care providers to pass on the costs to parents, increasing prices by an average of 21%, or $3,728 a year for families with two children. That would make child care entirely unaffordable for many. In some states, parents could see increases of up to 43% — or more than $6,000 a year. While we know how beneficial it is for children to have one parent at home until they’re school-aged, the reality is that staying home is not an option for many poor and working-class folks and single parents, and raising the cost of child care only makes an already difficult situation even harder. Rather than creating destructive consequences like these with a $15 minimum wage, politicians should look at policies that help create real income gains. They include expanding education and job training so people can gain more valuable skills that they can use to work their way up the ladder and eventually make more than the minimum wage. Such policies also include reducing unnecessary government regulations that cost businesses considerable money to follow, freeing up that money so they can pay their employees more or invest in growing their businesses, ultimately creating more jobs and higher wages. And they include reforming onerous occupational licensing requirements to make it easier for people to get jobs as landscapers, barbers, cosmetologists and other skilled occupations. While licensing can offer some protections for consumers, it often requires unnecessary training, lengthy delays and high fees that prevent people from starting a new career. Having a good-paying job is an important part of the formula for achieving the American dream. But good pay can’t be artificially created by government. It results in unintended consequences, and the people who should be most helped are often the most harmed. Instead of imposing more heavy-handed government mandates, our leaders should focus their efforts on removing government-created barriers to work and higher wages",2,Generally Reliable,0.1962293262293261,0.5215417915417916,1001,1,Washington Times

The city’s health order states attendees at live indoor performances must remain masked except when actively eating or drinking. Breed maintained that she was drinking at the time.“My drink was sitting at the table,” said Breed. “I got up and started dancing because I was feeling the spirit and I wasn’t thinking about a mask.”In a vacuum, I agree with this. It’s a free country, and we don’t, in fact, need the “fun police to come in and micromanage and tell us what we should or shouldn’t be doing.” It’s just that, well, London Breed is the “fun police.” The rule in San Francisco is that unless you’re actively eating or drinking, you need to wear a mask. And, per her own testimony, London Breed wasn’t actively eating or drinking; she was dancing while her drink was “sitting at the table.” Is the rule that Breed broke stupid? Yes, it is — especially given that San Francisco has a system of vaccine passports that applies to the very club she was attending. But it’s the rule nevertheless, and, as mayor, she has to follow it, too. Under the current rules, my three-year-old has to wear a mask when traveling on airplanes. Like many children, he, too, likes to dance when he feels the spirit. And, like many children, he, too, is less than fond of the fun police. But do you know who cares about any of that? Nobody, that’s who. As I write, millions of American kids are on their way to school with masks strapped over their faces — a fact of which London Breed’s political party not only approves, but is willing to sue in order to universalize. If, as Breed implies, these rules represent unnecessary and intrusive micromanagement that can’t possibly survive contact with reality, then maybe we should do the obvious thing, and blow them all up?",1,Questionable,0.1004370629370629,0.5352564102564101,509,2,National Review

As Eoin Higgins notes in a piece for(10/30/20), a concurrent strain of argument is that Trump himself should face no real public reckoning. Higgins cites a column by historian Jill Lepore in the Washington Post(10/16/20)—heralded as “eloquent” by the New York Times‘ Nicholas Kristof (Twitter,10/18/20): “Let History, Not Partisans, Prosecute Trump.”Lepore, a Harvard professor, says it would be inappropriate to have a reconciliation commission like other countries have had; Trump’s “wrongdoing” instead “should be investigated by journalists, chronicled by historians and, in some instances, tried in ordinary courts.” How those courts can adequately address such “wrongdoing” as allowing, throughcorruptionand mismanagement, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people is unclear.

There is no accountability to the millions of people who lost their lives, their loved ones, their homes, their jobs.

153,To Cancel or Not to Cancel: That Is the Question,-0.25,38.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/march-web-only/walter-kim-nae-timothy-dalrymple-cancel-church-or-not.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-23,25,"To cancel or not to cancel? That is the Shakespearean question confronting churches today. It is not a question of mere expediency. The gathered worship service is central to the church’s identity, and therefore, cancellation seems to trample on more than tradition. It can feel like a threat to the church’s existence. Government officials, medical experts, and civic leaders have all asked citizens to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus by practicing physical distancing. According to leading experts, churches are one of the top places of community spread. Why? Christians shake hands, embrace one another, and kiss cheeks. Some are liturgically directed to drink from a common cup; others pass the peace with a warm touch. Our bodies do naturally what our souls do supernaturally. We connect. And we do so intergenerationally. What are churches to do?Our mandate as Christians to obey governing authorities (Rom. 13:1–7; 1 Pet. 2:13–17) is a good reason for churches to cancel worship services. But there are other Biblical principles that help us embrace this difficult decision. Canceling in-person worship services is not the same as canceling worship. Christians should never stop worshiping, because God is worthy of all our praise. Those in the persecuted church have long worshiped God without buildings, because they know that church is not primarily a place but a people. And technology now gives us unprecedented options. This does not mean, of course, that place is unimportant. God himself authorized the building of a temple that would serve as a place where his name would dwell. Even with that decree, however, at the dedication of the temple, Solomon humbly acknowledged that God cannot be consigned to a place (1 Kings 8:27). The Book of Hebrews warns we should “not forsak[e] our assembling together, as is the habit of some” (Heb. 10:25, NASB). Does closing church doors lead to direct disobedience of God’s command? The habitual practice of “missing church” may reflect a disregard of faith or a dismissive view of corporate responsibilities. Such is not the case for churches that are suspending gathered worship services in a pandemic. This decision comes out of sacrificial love, not from habitual or casual disregard for worship. The amount of angst displayed proves this point. Nor does it arise from a dismissive view of corporate responsibilities. The very reason for canceling is predicated upon a deep sense of responsibility for others. The coronavirus has reminded us that we are so interconnected that our very lives are impacted by proximity. In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus challenged the contemporary understanding of the Sabbath. When his disciples had picked grain for food on the Sabbath, Jesus responded to the Pharisees’ criticism by saying, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27–28). Jesus later applied this statement about the Sabbath to a situation of service. Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in front of everyone.” Then Jesus asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent. He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. (Mark 3:1–5)Jesus reminded the worshipers that a critical dimension of Sabbath involved care for the needy and vulnerable in society. He healed on the Sabbath, because healing is an appropriate thing to do on the Sabbath. Sabbath observance was never just about what worshipers gained personally, but also what they gave communally. Sabbath encompassed the well-being of others. In Deuteronomy 5:12–15, the Israelites were instructed to observe the Sabbath by not working and also not allowing others to work. In the ancient world, it was astounding to be commanded to regularly release your household, servants, animals, and even the immigrant workers and refugees from work. Sabbath answered on a weekly basis the age-old question, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” Yes! We are called to ensure the flourishing of those within our sphere of influence. With fresh power and unique authority, the Lord of the Sabbath applied the prophetic connection between worship and service. We hear echoes of Isaiah’s declaration of true fasting in acts of justice for the hungry and poor (58:6–7), of Micah’s concern for true sacrifice in expressing mercy (6:6–8), and of Amos’ lyrical entreaty for festivals of worship to be coupled with rivers of righteousness (5:21–24). The teachings on Sabbath as an occasion of healing and service as an aspect of worship provide guidance for us on the question of whether or not to make religious services remote. It is lawful to do good and not to do harm, to save life and not to kill. Churches for thousands of years all around the world have had to find creative ways to worship. By physical distancing, the church practices preventative healing to mitigate the spread of a deadly virus. This would seem to be not only lawful but loving. We cancel physical gatherings not because we fear a virus but because we love the vulnerable and care for the world God loves. We remember that healing—both spiritual and physical—are aspects of worship. Some of our brothers and sisters have argued that shuttering in-person services elevates the love of health over the love of God. We do not share this view. Of course, as Christians we believe there are worse fates than the loss of physical health or even this earthly life. We too admire the example of Christians throughout history who have risked their lives out of devotion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. However, we are being asked temporarily to convene remotely, not to deny our faith or to cease worshiping God. It is one thing to risk your own life in order to worship together in person; it is quite another to risk the lives of countless others, when so many churches are finding creative and compelling ways to carry on in worship and community from a distance. By offering their remote services and proclaiming the hope of the gospel in troubled times, many churches are reaching audiences they have never reached before. For those who feel called by their faith to demonstrate the love of God in the midst of the pandemic in ways that are self-sacrificial, we encourage you to do so in ways that do not endanger others. Offer to watch a neighbor’s children so she can continue to work. Distribute food to the poor and the vulnerable. Arrange remote “visits” with the elderly and the isolated. Give sacrificially to your church and to other ministries engaged in the fight. We need not fall short in either our love of God or in our love of neighbor; the church can be the church outside the walls of the sanctuary. Even if our observance of worship is less than ideal, even if there are honest mistakes or misjudgments made in the cancellation of services, God sees the heart of faith. During the time of King Hezekiah, the people of God sought to celebrate Passover after years of neglect. But because they could not get their act together, they observed the Passover in the wrong month (2 Chron. 30:15). They compounded bad timing with bad practices: “they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written.” (v. 18). Yet, even though the people were “not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary” (v. 19), the Lord accepted their worship because it was done in good faith, albeit not in good practice. Will the Lord show any less grace to us than he showed to his people in Hezekiah’s day? In our moment of crisis, we suspect the Lord will see the deep faith and sincere intentions of his people, and will be pleased with worship that may not follow liturgical protocols but nonetheless seeks to honor him. We will not be passing the peace with hugs, but rather with texts and phone calls. Are these modes inferior? Yes. Will they be acceptable to the Lord? We also believe, yes. As the nation closes down non-essential businesses, the church must rise up to its essential work of prayer. Nobody is exempted from this work: “And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people” (Eph. 6:18). Physical distancing in household worship or online services still reflects our profound spiritual solidarity. We can pray for Spirit-filled creativity to worship God, serve our communities, and love our neighbors. As our faithful brothers and sisters have done throughout history, we should be prepared to accept some personal risk as we look for innovative ways to serve that minimize danger to the broader community. Let us join together in this prayer of Clement of Rome: We ask you, Master, be our helper and defender. Rescue those of our number in distress; raise up the fallen; assist the needy; heal the sick; turn back those of your people who stray; feed the hungry; release our captives; revive the weak; encourage those who lose heart. Let all the nations realize that you are the only God, that Jesus Christ is your Son, and that we are your people and the sheep of your pasture. Amen.

S House of Representatives voted topass the Equality Act, the LGBTQ+ rights legislationthat would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. While the bill still has to proceed through the Senate to become law, the vote is a first step towards ahuge win for LGBTQ+ Americans. Across social media, people are already cheering this bill's progress. TheEquality Act, which was previously introduced in 2019, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill would cover discrimination in employment in housing, employment, and public businesses like restaurants, stores, and services. While it passed the House in 2019, it was not brought for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate at the time. Now, reintroduced in a Democrat-controlled Congress, thebill has passed the house in a 224-206 vote, per CNN, with at least three Republicans crossing party lines to vote in its favor. Notably, this version of the bill follows the Supreme Court's June 2020decision in, in which the Court ruled that a gay man fired from his job had been discriminated against — asserting that sexual orientation and gender identity were covered under sex discrimination. Now, the Equality Act would codify that ruling and its precedent into law, while expanding its applicability. Across social media, people celebrated the vote and expressed their hopes for the future. Now, the bill goes to the Senate, where it already has strong supporters among the Democratic Party, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer haspromised to bring it to a vote. However, its ultimate fate is unclear, as it will have to pass the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster. Conservative opponents havesuggested that it would violate religious libertyby requiring businesses and institutions to provide services to LGBTQ+ people — the Equality Act would explicitly supersede 1993'sReligious Freedom Restoration Act(RFRA), which prohibits the government from ""substantially"" burdening the free exercise of religion. In short, religious beliefs couldn't be used to justify discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Still, the bill has a far better chance in 2021 with a Democrat-controlled Senate than under a Republican-controlled Senate back in 2019. With any luck, Twitter will get to celebrate this legislation again soon.

156,How Trump and McConnell set the final pieces for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade,-8.67,45.0,https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/17/politics/abortion-supreme-court-roe-v-wade/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-17,24,"Conservatives have been waiting decades for this moment: a transformed Supreme Court on Mondayagreed to hear an abortion casethat directly challenges women’s reproductive rights tracing to the 1973 Roe v. Wade milestone. And unlike past times when Roe teetered in the balance, this is not a 5-4 court with the potential to suddenly dash the hopes of Republicans and religious conservatives. This is a 6-3 conservative-liberal bench. If one of the GOP appointees suddenly edges left, as happened before, a five-justice right-wing majority would still exist. Republicans rued the abortion-rights votes of GOP-nominated Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, all now retired, over the years. The art of persuasion: How past presidents have tried to nudge Supreme Court justices off the benchBut the current makeup of the court, with three appointees of former President Donald Trump and three other justices who have opposed abortion rights, provides a dynamic that found abortion opponents ecstatic at the court’s announcement and abortion rights supporters trembling. Abortion has been the single most consistent and contentious subject of Supreme Court confirmations since the early 1980s, when Republican President Ronald Reagan made reversal of the 1973 Roe milestone a mission. Abortion politics have influenced the presidential screening of nominees, senators’ votes and the increasing force of special interest groups in the confirmation orbit. RELATED: Democrats wary of appearing to push Justice Breyer out despite their small window to replace himRepublican lawmakers especially have fought to make this moment possible, in statehouses across the country and in the US Senate. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ensured that the conservative stalwart Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, would not be succeeded by a liberal. And McConnell then sped through the nomination ofAmy Coney Barrettto replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg days before last fall’s presidential election. For decades at nomination hearings, senators and nominees have fallen into a cat-and-mouse routine, as senators on the dais ask questions directed at where an individual truly stood on Roe and nomineesavoid revealing anything, particularly at the risk of imperiling the chance of appointment. All subtly evaporated last fall when then-Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican,said of Barrett,“This is the first time in American history that we’ve nominated a woman who’s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.”Barrett declined to “pre-commit” on the subject of abortion. A devout Roman Catholic, she was the third appointee of Trump, who vowed to choose justices who would reverse Roe and return the issue to the states. Barrett strengthened rightward pull on the bench. She also sealed the confidence conservatives expressed, and the dismay from liberals, that a new anti-abortion era was underway. How Amy Coney Barrett has changed the Supreme Court in ways Kavanaugh hasn'tAfter months of internal debate on the matter, the justices announced on Monday they would add to their 2021-22 session a dispute over a Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks. The controversy, which would likely be heard in the fall and decided by June of 2022, could eviscerate the heart of Roe v. Wade, which declared women have a constitutional right to end a pregnancy. That landmark and a 1992 case,Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, effectively prevented bans on pre-viability abortions, that is, before the fetus would be able to live outside the womb. The court placed viability at 23-24 weeks in the 1992 case. The dispute, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, marks the start of the most momentous abortion battle since 1992. The lower US appellate court that rejected the Mississippi law had written, “In an unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed, and re-affirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability. States mayabortion procedures prior to viability so long as they do not impose an undue burden on the woman’s right, but they may not ban abortions. The law at issue is a ban.”The Supreme Court's conservatives may have the votes to expand Second Amendment rightsFor nearly 30 years, the justices spurned appeals that would have meant such a deep reconsideration of precedent. The court worked around the edges, in recent cases reviewing regulations on clinics and physicians, issues that affected women’s access to abortion but not the core right or viability line. Newer justices increasingly complained about the pattern. Trump’s first appointee, Neil Gorsuch, wrote last year that in a “highly politicized and contentious arena … we have lost our way.”But conservatives who voiced an interest in reversing prior decisions on abortion were no doubt unsure whether they would have at least five votes for a major decision. The addition of Barrett plainly changed the calculus, and at a time when more states have passed bans such as Mississippi’s. Earlier this spring Arkansas adopted a near-total abortion prohibition with no exception for cases of rape or incest. With Barrett and Gorsuch, Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh. The other GOP justices who have voted against abortion rights areClarence Thomas, now in his 30th yearand most vigilant in urging reversal of Roe; Samuel Alito, who succeeded centrist-conservative O’Connor in 2006, causing an ideological shift on many dilemmas including abortion; and Chief Justice John Roberts, named in 2005 as a successor to Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Until last year, Roberts had consistently backed abortion regulations. But in a Louisiana dispute, he provided the fifth vote (with the four liberals at the time) to invalidate a regulation similar to a Texas restriction the court had struck down in 2016. Roberts wrote that although he disagreed with the prior ruling, he felt bound by it. At the same time, however, Roberts separated himself from the justices on the left byasserting a legal standard that would enhance government leewayto impose restrictions on abortion, for example, through clinic standards or physician credentialing. As chief justice on a deeply split court in a turbulent era of American politics, Roberts has hedged his own ideological views, seemingly to steady the court and inspire public confidence. Judges are split on how seriously to take John Roberts' abortion opinionThat tendency, along with hisdramatic 2012 vote (again with the liberals) to uphold the Affordable Care Act, has provoked criticism from the right wing and some suspicion of how he would ultimately vote on the future of Roe v. Wade. But conservatives seeking curtailment of abortion rights may not need his vote. With the addition of Barrett, Roberts is no longer at the ideological center of the bench and no longer has the swing-vote power. And now that the court has decided to reexamine abortion rights, the only question is how far the majority will go to roll back the nearly half-century-old declaration that the constitutional right to privacy covers the decision to end a pregnancy.",3,Reliable,0.0506452674309817,0.3818561597133024,1524,3,CNN

Adriana Gallardoprovided additional reporting and translation.in the emergency room of Chicago’s Mount Sinai Hospital, her right breast swollen to nearly twice the size of her left, the skin so thick and dimpled that the doctor examining her would note that it resembled an orange peel., she thought, as she struggled to catch her breath, not knowing she had a partially collapsed lung. I hope it’s just an infection. For more than six months, the 48-year-old factory worker had tried to ignore the pain and inflammation in her chest. She was afraid of visiting a doctor during the pandemic, afraid of missing work, afraid of losing her job, her home, her ability to take care of her three children. She kept working until she couldn’t, until the pain forced her to ask her son to drive her to the hospital on this cold, cloudy night in January. Seven miles away, 24-year-old Sergio waited in his cramped childhood bedroom, clothes scattered on the floor and his medical school entrance-exam books untouched on a shelf, his eyes locked on his phone. Sergio usually accompanied his mother anywhere she might need help with her limited English, but because of the pandemic, he hadn’t been allowed past hospital security. After two and a half hours of silence, he texted her in Spanish, “How’s it going?”“My son they are doing all the checkups they are going to put me in a machine right now for the checkup,” she typed back, also in Spanish. The page from the hospital caught oncologist Dr. Paramjeet “Pam” Khosla in her kitchen in the southwest suburbs, where she, her husband and their two adult daughters had lingered to talk after dinner. Although she had been in practice for more than 20 years, Khosla’s heart still jumped a little whenever the phone buzzed on the nights she was on call. A chest X-ray showed a large mass in the chest of a woman complaining of pain in her breast, the emergency room doctor told her. Concerned, Khosla told him to order an immediate biopsy. They agreed she would see the patient as soon as she could., she thought. In the shadows of COVID-19, another crisis has emerged. With the pandemic in its second year and hope intermittently arriving along with vaccine vials, it’s as if a violent flood has begun to recede, exposing the wreckage left in its wake. Amid the damage is an untold number of cancers that went undiagnosed or untreated as patients postponed annual screenings, and as cancer clinics and hospitals suspended biopsies and chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Across the country, preventive cancer screenings plummeted byas much as 94%during the first four months of last year. At Mount Sinai, the number of mammograms dropped by 96% during that same period. By July, screenings had started to rebound, both nationally and at Mount Sinai, but still trailed pre-COVID-19 numbers. Fewer screenings led to a decline in new diagnoses, which one study found fell by more than 50% for some cancers last year. But people didn’t stop getting cancer; they stopped getting diagnosed. As patients return to their doctors, the toll of those dark months is becoming visible. The National Cancer Institute haspredicted almost 10,000 excess deathsover the next decade from breast and colorectal cancer alone because of pandemic-related delays in diagnosing and treating these two cancers, which often can be detected early through screening and account for about 1 in 6 cancer deaths. Like the pandemic itself, the impact is expected to hit communities of color particularly hard. Black Americans already die of all cancers combined at a higher rate than any other racial group. And cancer is theleading cause of deathamong Latinos, with breast cancer outranking other cancers for women. After almost five hours at the hospital, Teresa left that night without a diagnosis but with instructions to call Khosla. Sergio picked her up outside the emergency room door. On the way home, they talked about all the tests she had undergone. Neither of them mentioned the word cancer.as her right breast began to swell, Teresa stuffed the left side of her bra with paper towels, embarrassed that someone at work might notice. A solidly built woman with deep brown eyes and tattoos weaving up her neck and down her arms, Teresa had worked nearly half her life at the same candy manufacturing factory on Chicago’s West Side. She immigrated to the United States from Mexico almost on a whim at the age of 21, settled in Chicago, became a permanent resident, and got hired at “los dulces,” as she calls it. Over time, the factory’s owners changed — Kraft, Kellogg, Ferrara Candy — but Teresa remained. She eventually became a machine operator, earning $21 an hour. The factory was more than a job to her. It was where she made friends, told jokes to pass the long hours, and blasted music, especially the upbeat cumbia songs of her teenage years, in the locker room. Her colleagues had a hard time keeping up with her energy, but they knew she would pick up the slack if someone on the line slowed down or cover for them if they were out, because Teresa never said no to work. The income allowed her to support her children on her own and, in 2008, accomplish something she had not thought possible: put $5,000 toward buying a century-old, Cape-Cod style home in a largely Latino Chicago neighborhood where the roar of airplanes from nearby Midway Airport regularly interrupted the quiet. The tentative grasp on stability came at a price. She usually worked the overnight shift, often arriving early and staying late, then rushed home to get Aurora, Sergio and Roberto off to school. When they were young, the children enjoyed the lollipops and gummies she brought from work; it wasn’t until they were older that they noticed her bruised knees and bloodied fingers. As the pandemic struck, Teresa didn’t slow down, even as it hit essential workers particularly hard. She had come close to losing her house in 2018 after falling behind on her mortgage payments. She couldn’t risk it happening again. She worked overtime and filled in for co-workers who were sick with COVID-19. Between shifts, she picked up groceries for that night’s dinner, then collapsed on the living room couch for a few hours, only to wake up and do it all over again. She had created a plan to protect herself from the virus, wearing two masks and latex gloves on her hourlong commute on the train and bus. Even though her chest felt as if it was on fire, she kept working. She didn’t want to get COVID-19 at a doctor’s office or the emergency room, and she was so busy she didn’t have much time to think about her symptoms.“I didn’t pay a lot of attention to it because I have to be both a mother and a father to my children,” she said. Her tattoos mapped her life, its struggles and devotions. A lion for León, the city in Mexico where she grew up; a Chicago flag for her home since; her mother’s face to mark her death, a loss that still makes Teresa’s breath catch eight years later. When she faced losing her home, she pledged to memorialize Santa Muerte — Saint Death, a Mexican folk saint — in a tattoo if she could save it. Her prayers were answered when she was able to refinance her mortgage, and Teresa, resolute, had the saint inked on her neck. At an ornate altar in her dining room, she made offerings of flowers and apples and lit candles to Santa Muerte. As she felt herself getting sick, she prayed for her health, and for joy and protection for her family. Finally, when her chest, raw and warm to the touch, hurt too much for her to work, she asked for time off and scheduled a virtual appointment at a nearby clinic in early January. The doctor, viewing her breast through a computer screen, thought Teresa had an infection and prescribed antibiotics. The pills didn’t help. Still, less than a week later, Teresa sat on the worn living room couch, making plans to return to work the next day. Then, unable to tolerate the burning any longer, she wept. Her daughter, Aurora, hearing the sobs, came to check on her. Teresa agreed to let Sergio take her to the ER.before he learned there was a term for what he had been doing for as long as he could remember: language brokering. When his family went to the neighborhood clinic, 6-year-old Sergio explained to the doctor that he and his siblings needed their school physicals. He negotiated a payment plan with the utility company when he was 9. And throughout his childhood, at parent-teacher conferences, he proudly translated his teachers’ comments: exemplary student, near-perfect attendance, excels at exams. Those achievements eventually won him a full-tuition scholarship to Pomona College in California, making him the first in his family to leave home for college. Even there, his responsibilities followed him. He monitored his mother’s bank account on his phone, watching anxiously when the balance dipped near zero. When, during his junior year, the mortgage company filed for foreclosure on their home, his family emailed him the documents to translate, which he did, late at night, alone in his dorm room. Sergio’s freshman year at college had nearly broken him. The classes were rigorous, the pace accelerated, and the lower his grades sank, the more he felt like an imposter. Worse, if he flunked out, he wouldn’t be able to get a good job, and he knew his family was counting on his support. His sister, Aurora, 26, has developmental delays and has not worked consistently although she has an associate's degree in graphic arts. His 21-year-old brother, Roberto, dropped out of high school a few months shy of graduation with what the family believes is undiagnosed depression. His 2017 honor roll certificate still hangs on the refrigerator. Sergio didn’t resent the pressure, but he felt engulfed by it. “Everything was relying on me to succeed, and I wasn’t succeeding,” he said. “It got to the point where I didn’t want to be the one solely responsible for improving the lives of my family. I wanted out of that responsibility.”At points, he even contemplated suicide. But with the help of a therapist, he regained his footing and sense of purpose. He found work at a research lab focused on improving mental health in Latino and other marginalized communities, and he volunteered as a translator for Spanish-speaking patients at a local hospital. He began dating another pre-med student, Ayleen Hernandez, after he offered to help her study for biology and she accepted even though she already knew the material. And he discovered a way to understand his own experience. One day in class, when a professor discussed language brokering, Sergio was captivated. He ended up writing his undergraduate thesis on the topic, citing research showing that Latino communities often place the needs of the family above those of the individual. In the acknowledgements, he addressed his mother: “The resilience and strength you’ve exhibited during our family’s most difficult and trying moments have not gone unnoticed,” he wrote. “I hope to one day ameliorate these stressors, so that you don’t have to anymore.”After graduating in 2019 with a degree in cognitive science and a minor in Chicana/o-Latina/o studies, Sergio moved back home to work for a year and help with the bills before applying to medical school. Even though he had hoped to find a job in health care, he felt he needed to accept the first offer he got, confirming prices with suppliers for a company that sells industrial products online. He told himself it was only temporary and, in the interim, he would study for the MCAT and volunteer as a Spanish interpreter at a free clinic in Chicago. Then came the pandemic, and after that, he noticed his mother getting tired and weak. He urged her to go to the doctor, and she kept promising she would as soon as she had a day off. He decided to stay home a little longer.to the question before she asked it. Turning to the patient on the exam table, a 53-year-old Black woman in jeans and metallic blue boots, she said, “You missed your mammogram. What happened?”“COVID,” the woman answered. Khosla, a white lab coat enveloping her slight frame, rolled closer in her chair. She pointed to an image of the patient’s right breast on the desktop computer screen.“See that starlike structure?” she asked, her voice gentle but assured. “It’s cancer.”Khosla, the hospital’s chief of hematology oncology, had delivered a cancer diagnosis almost a dozen times that week. At 56, she was used to giving people bad news, offering them tissues and holding their hands as she did. But the fallout from the pandemic made her feel inadequate. Patients were showing up with more neglected bodies and more advanced cases of cancer than she usually saw, which, at Mount Sinai, was already more than many oncologists did. Located in Chicago’s North Lawndale community, where almost half the residents earn less than $25,000 a year, Mount Sinai serves a population that is primarily Black and Latino and that relies on Medicaid, government-funded insurance for the poor. Patients here are more likely to visit an emergency room than a primary care doctor for non-urgent conditions, and they experience disproportionately high rates of hypertension, asthma, diabetes and cancer. Khosla joined the hospital in 2005, persuaded by her husband, a doctor who had recently transferred to the cardiology department there, that at Mount Sinai she would be able to help some of Chicago’s poorest and sickest patients. For Khosla, who had earned her medical degree in India and carried memories of mothers and children camped out on hospital floors for hours, the sense of mission was appealing. At Rush University Medical Center, where she previously worked, patients had the time and the resources to seek her out for second or third opinions. At Mount Sinai, patients often had neither. That only worsened during the pandemic. Cancer care in the United States has never seen a disruption of this magnitude. Advances in prevention, increased early detection, improved treatment and new drugs fueled a 31% drop in cancer death rates from 1991 to 2018. But the pandemic has left many patients, particularly those from disadvantaged communities like those served by Mount Sinai, sicker and with fewer treatment options. It may be another year or two before the cancer death toll begins to rise, in part because treatment can delay death for years after diagnosis, said Dr. Norman E. “Ned” Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute. Some cancers also may be slow-growing and are treatable despite a later diagnosis, but others are not. The aftermath of the pandemic may turn one public health crisis into many, endangering people’s lives and risking decades of progress in cancer research and care, Sharpless said.“The longer the pandemic continues,” he said in an email, “the more significant the impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes will be.”Late last year, Khosla helped Mount Sinai launch a program to persuade reluctant patients to come in for cancer screenings by touting the hospital’s COVID-19 safety precautions on every outreach call. But as the oncology department’s eerie quiet began to give way to a rush of patients in January, she saw patients whose health had deteriorated so much they needed help breathing or swallowing. Recently, she counted at least 10 cases of advanced cancer in one four-week period. She saw one patient with a grapefruit-sized mass on his neck. Another, whose tumor had pushed his brain dangerously close to the skull, was transferred to hospice. “He never got to see the light of treatment,” Khosla said. All of these patients had been afraid to seek treatment at the hospital during the pandemic. While her family slept at night, she read medical journals, learning about the latest drug approvals and newest guidelines, and she sometimes sent herself texts in the early morning hours about a test to order or a treatment option to explore.“Cancer doesn’t give you the satisfaction ever of having done a 100% job because the results lie in the future,” she said. “You’re always questioning yourself, especially with my patient population.”Teresa’s case exemplified so much of what Khosla saw go wrong during the pandemic. The fear, the delays, the demands on essential workers, the limitations of telehealth. Three days after Teresa’s emergency room visit, Khosla met her for a follow-up appointment. Teresa and Sergio had arrived early. He turned away before Khosla lifted the hospital gown. Shocked at the extent of the inflammation, Khosla quickly gathered herself, hoping Teresa hadn’t noticed her alarm. It had been a decade since she had seen such a severe case. The biopsies confirmed her suspicions: advanced inflammatory breast cancer.“If she would have come six months earlier, it could have been just surgery, chemo and done,” Khosla said later. “Now she’s incurable.”had long doubled as Teresa’s bedroom because she wanted to give each of her children their own room. But after her cancer diagnosis, she spent almost all her time there, sitting in the oversized chair her sons set up for her after her swollen breast made it too uncomfortable to sleep on the couch. She passed the endless hours texting friends and watching old Spanish-language movies and cartoons, supporting the weight of her right breast with her left hand. She sat with her dogs — Bagel, a black pug, and a white poodle mix named Max — at her feet, rarely leaving the house except to walk them or go to her medical appointments. Sergio, who is the only person in the family who can drive, took her to and from the hospital, having gotten permission from his supervisor to make up the time. The route sometimes took them past the factory, flooding Teresa with sorrow as she asked herself, “When am I going to be able to go back?”Sergio and Teresa rarely spoke about anything beyond the day’s logistics during these trips, each determined to protect the other from their thoughts. One day in late February they were driving to a physical therapy appointment for her swollen hand, a side effect of the tumor. It was the first time Teresa had left the house after Roberto shaved off most of her hair, which had begun to fall out from the chemotherapy. She thought about her family, her job, her hair as she gazed at the overcast sky and, before Sergio could see, wiped away the tears.“I don’t want him to feel equally sad,” she said later. “I don’t want him to take on my pain.”Even with health insurance from her job, the medical bills, past due and seemingly insurmountable, kept coming. Some days she directed Aurora to toss them unopened in a Ziploc bag on the floor of the living room. She received disability payments following her cancer diagnosis and Sergio contributed what he could, but the money wasn’t enough to cover the family’s expenses. Delinquent utility bills alone topped $1,600. Sergio was driving his mother home from another physical therapy appointment in February when traffic stopped for a train. Sergio, beginning to fall behind at work and thinking about all the unanswered emails and Slack messages waiting for him, bounced his knee and checked the time. Ever since that night at the ER, he had ricocheted from his mother’s medical appointments to his job, to the grocery store, to dinner duty, to filling Teresa’s prescriptions, to picking up the cake for Aurora’s birthday. He thought he might erupt.“I try to be honest with myself and transparent and aware of my own capacities,” he said. “But I just started feeling the weight of everything at once.”He waited until he had dropped his mother off at home, circled the block to find a parking space, shut the door to his room and signed off from work for the day. Then he looked up to make sure his door was closed and, to muffle the sound, cried into his sleeves.every three weeks, seeing her in between Teresa’s chemotherapy infusions down the hall at Mount Sinai. At their mid-March appointment, the doctor turned around after washing her hands at the sink and was immediately struck by the dramatic change in Teresa’s appearance.“The swelling is going down,” she said. An interpreter stood by to translate her words into Spanish, but Teresa understood these words on her own.“Sí. Mucho,” she responded. The chemotherapy was working. Teresa’s breast had returned to almost its normal size. She felt lighter and, with the fluid in her lung drained, like she could breathe again. Before she left, she found the confidence to ask the doctor for help with transportation so she wouldn’t interrupt Sergio’s workday. She climbed into the cab, with the winter’s last snow falling around her, and for the first time in months, Teresa felt hopeful.“[I will] be done with this and find a part-time job in the mornings, too,” she said later, “to get out of debt and help my children.”That morning, as they sat in the exam room, Khosla knew the tumor in Teresa’s breast had responded well to treatment, but not for the reason Teresa wished. The more aggressive a cancer — and inflammatory breast cancer is both aggressive and rare — the more quickly it tends to shrink. Chemotherapy attacks growing cells, and advanced tumors with rapidly growing cells, like Teresa’s, initially may be easier to target but ultimately harder to eliminate. The oncologist told Teresa that her stage 4 cancer had metastasized, infiltrating her lymph nodes, sternum, skin, hip and rib. She would need to meet with a surgeon to discuss treatment options. But Khosla chose her words carefully. She wanted Teresa to stay strong enough to get through her treatment, and Khosla herself was an optimist who liked to look beyond published survival rates. She could sense that Teresa was focused on the improvement she could see and feel, and the doctor wrestled with how much more to say.she decided. She would wait until the next month’s appointment.through Cermak Fresh Market this busy Sunday afternoon in April, Sergio trailed a few steps behind, letting his sister lead the way. When she confused the parsley and cilantro, he pointed out the signs above the dewy herbs. He didn’t intervene when she panicked next to the pasta, unsure of which sauce to get for the lasagna she planned to make.“Try to figure it out,” he coaxed, nodding when she returned with the chunky marinara. The outing would have been inconceivable a few months ago, given Aurora’s disability and severe anxiety around crowds. But Sergio was trying to help his siblings become more independent. He supervised Aurora as she made dinner, and he arranged to teach Roberto to drive. He was trying to prepare them to make their way without him by their side. Sergio was making plans, again, to pick up the threads of his life. Ayleen, now a first-year student at Baylor College of Medicine, was waiting for him in Houston. He didn’t regret his decision to stay in Chicago. Early on, he worried he would grow complacent and abandon his aspirations to become a doctor, but seeing COVID-19 ravage communities of color and witnessing his mother’s cancer strengthened his determination. He felt better prepared for medical school, even if the years at home had threatened to derail his plans. Sergio tried not to think about the gap widening between him and Ayleen. He celebrated when she was accepted to multiple medical schools and profiled on the college website. And they still had date nights on the weekends, curling up in front of their laptops — him in Chicago, her in Houston — to eat pizza and watch “Superstore” together. Some nights they fell asleep to the glow of the computer screens, and others they stayed up late talking about what would happen after Sergio got to Houston, whether he would end up leaving if he got accepted to medical school somewhere else or had to return to Chicago for his family. Life could go in a lot of directions from Houston, but he had to get there first. In the kitchen, Sergio stood next to the refrigerator, watching Aurora and Roberto put away the groceries. Roberto held up the chicken patties. “What should I do?”“Keep them out,” Sergio responded. Aurora was going to bake them for that night’s dinner. Teresa watched from the back porch. “They are doing the things I once did for them,” she said. “The sacrifices I made are serving them now.”She rested her hands across her chest, the pink blossoms of the apple tree behind her beginning to open, and listened to her children inside.the family gathered in the living room, with Teresa in her chair, the TV playing in the background and the children scattered around her. Teresa had left the doctor’s appointment with her head spinning. She had expected the oncologist would tell her she was getting better and could return to work. Instead, Khosla told her that, though she would do everything she could, Teresa likely would be on some form of treatment indefinitely. She had patients who had made it as long as six or seven years with this cancer, Khosla said, and she would still fight for a cure. Teresa didn’t ask any questions, just nodded her head and cried. Now, when Roberto asked her what had happened at the appointment, she didn’t answer. Then, as Sergio pressed, she began.“Right now I’m not going to work,” she said. “They are going to keep giving me chemo.”She paused between sentences, sobbing as she struggled to get the words out. Afterward, she would say she almost couldn’t bear to put this burden on them, that she had wanted to shoulder the anguish alone. But they asked, so she told them about the surgery and radiation, pointing to her hip as she explained where the cancer had reached her bones. Read MoreSergio stood a few feet away, his feet planted in the doorway. “Yes,” he said reassuringly, whenever she disclosed another detail. She would know more once she met with the surgeon, she explained.“They’re going to be in touch about what can be done now,” she said, “They are trying to not let it spread.”She finished speaking and looked at the floor. In a gesture his brother and sister would repeat moments later, Sergio walked across the room and, without saying a word, wrapped his arms around his mother. He bowed down to kiss her head.

159,There's a Lot of Talk About Joe Biden's First 100 Days — Here's Why They're Important,0.0,43.67,https://www.popsugar.com/news/why-are-first-100-days-important-for-president-48070657,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-11,25,"President-elect Joe Biden'sinauguration day is just a few days away, which means everyone's eyes will be on the first 100 days of his presidency. We took a look at the mythos around the first 100 days of a presidency andwhat we can expect to see from Biden's. The idea comes from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd US president, who passed15 major pieces of legislation and 76 lawsduring the first 100 days of his presidency in 1933. By today's standards, the efficiency is almost unbelievable. It's mostly due to the extenuating circumstances of his term: Roosevelt was dealing with the Great Depression when he was inaugurated, and the nationwide sense of emergency allowed him to take action swiftly. And while the circumstances for following presidents were less dire, the term stuck. The term wasfirst used by FDR himself. It refers to thefirst session of the 73rd Congress, which began just days after FDR's inauguration and was the period over which he was able to pass so much legislation. It lasted, you guessed it, 100 days and included some of the most recognizable components of FDR's New Deal, such as the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps and Public Works Administration. For better or for worse, they've become a benchmark of a president's efficacy in office. Some argue that it's an arbitrary and unfair standard, based on the extenuating circumstances FDR was governing in. Others raise the point thatwhen a president first takes office, their halo of victory lingersand their leadership style is fresh and new, which can positively affect their impact on Congress. Regardless of which side is correct, the myth of the 100 days becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: a new president knows that people's eyes will be on their first 100 days and therefore works to make them memorable. It can be seen as a time to take definitive action and set the tone of the next four years. After FDR, several other presidents made notable decisions within the first 100 days of their presidency. John F. Kennedy called for theBay of Pigs invasion— an infamously failed attempt to overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Gerald Fordpardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan was said to have ""established his goals faster, communicated a greater sense of economic urgency and come forward with more comprehensive proposals than any new President since the first 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt,"" according to. And Barack Obama passed a$787 million stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, in his first month. Judging a president's effectiveness during his first 100 days isn't as simple as it sounds. After all, the quantity, quality, and effectiveness of laws passed are all very different things, and their ramifications aren't immediately visible. But regardless of the results of past presidents' actions during their first 100 days, there has been a trend of taking bold, swift action when they first arrive in office, perhaps to capitalize on the national energy that put them there. Biden will begin his presidency in a situation not unlike Roosevelt's — in a time of massive and unprecedented crisis. While he's said that, essentially,Trump's fate lies in Congress's hands, he plans to tackle COVID-19 and the economy when he enters office. He intends tosign an executive order to require masks(where he legally can) and to get ""at least 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of the American people in the first 100 days."" Additionally, Biden will prioritizepassing a coronavirus aid packageandreopening most of the nation's schools. Outside of COVID-19, he's proposedover a dozen policies on immigrationfor his first 100 days and promised to immediatelyreverse Trump's corporate tax cut and re-enter the US into the landmark Paris climate accord of 2015.",3,Reliable,0.1347079667644183,0.3824050411953636,818,2,Popsugar
160,"Tears, politics and money: School boards become battle zones",-2.67,45.0,https://apnews.com/article/health-education-coronavirus-pandemic-school-boards-e41350b7d9e3662d279c2dad287f7009,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"RAPID CITY, S. D. (AP) — Local school boards around the country are increasingly becoming cauldrons of anger and political division, boiling with disputes over such issues as COVID-19 mask rules, the treatment of transgender students and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America. Meetings that were once orderly, even boring, have turned ugly. School board elections that were once uncontested have drawn slates of candidates galvanized by one issue or another. A June school board meeting in Loudoun County, Virginia, that dealt with transgender students and the teaching of “critical race theory”became so unrulythat one person was arrested for disorderly conduct and another was cited for trespassing. In Rapid City, South Dakota, and Kalispell, Montana, nonpartisan school board races devolved into political warfare as conservative candidates, angered over requirements to wear masks in schools, sought to seize control. In Pennsylvania, a Republican donor is planning to pour $500,000 into school board races.“We’re in a culture war,” said Jeff Holbrook, head of Rapid City’s Pennington County GOP. In South Carolina’s Lexington-Richland school system, a new majority of board members upset over pandemic restrictions forced out the superintendent, Christina Melton, who had pushed to keep a mask requirement in place through the end of the academic year. She had been honored just weeks earlier as the state’s superintendent of the year. Melton broke into tears at a meeting in June as she offered her resignation. A board member also quit that day, complaining the body decided behind closed doors to force Melton out and avoid a public vote. The board censured the departed member at its next meeting.“Now we’re known as the district with the crazy school board,” said Tifani Moore, a mother with three children and a husband who teaches in the district. Moore is running for the empty board seat and promises to tamp down the political split, which she worries has crippled the board.“It’s so thick, even the kids feel it,” she said. School boards are typically composed of former educators and parents whose job, at least until recently, mostly consisted of ironing out budgets, discussing the lunch menu or hiring superintendents. But online meetings during the pandemic made it easier for parents to tune in. And the crisis gave new gravity to school board decisions. Parents worried their children were falling behind because of remote learning or clashed over how serious the health risks were.“I saw over and over again frustrated parents, thousands of parents, calling into their board meetings, writing letters and getting no response,” said Clarice Schillinger, a Pennsylvania parent who formed a group called Keeping Kids in School. She recruited nearly 100 parents to run in November for school boards across Pennsylvania. While the group coalesced around pushing for schools to fully open, its candidates have also sought to bar the teaching ofcritical race theory, which among other things holds that racism is embedded in America’s laws and institutionsSchillinger said the group is split 70-30 between Republicans and Democrats. But its priorities are unmistakably conservative. She said it is trying to counter the sway teachers unions have over school boards: “It’s really less government — that’s what this comes down to.”Paul Martino, a venture capitalist who donates to Republican candidates and pledged a half-million dollars to the movement and the creation of a statewide political action committee, said the new PAC will support candidates committed to keeping schools open no matter what, “even if there is the dreaded fall COVID surge.”Conservative slates of candidates elsewhere across the country have also set their sights on school boards. In Rapid City, four recently elected school board members will hold a controlling vote on the seven-member body, which oversees the education of roughly 14,000 students. In an area where Trump flags still fly, the four candidates for the usually nonpartisan board secured an endorsement in the June election from the local GOP. In previous elections, seats on the board were often filled in uncontested elections. But this year, the campaigns turned into political battles, complete with personal attacks. Critical race theory is not a part of the Rapid City school curriculum. But that didn’t stop candidates from making it a central issue of the campaign.“I believe with all my heart this is how they are going to slip socialism and Marxism into our schools,” newly elected member Deb Baker said at a campaign event. Curt Pochardt, who was unseated as the school board president in the election, said he worries the new partisan dynamic will hurt students’ education.“It doesn’t help kids when there’s tension on a school board,” he said. Education experts warn that school boards are squandering time that could be spent tackling issues such as recruiting teachers, ensuring students have internet access at home or improving opportunities for youngsters with disabilities.“Every time we’re not talking about those issues and we’re talking about something else that’s divisive and it may not be happening at all — or at least not to the level it’s being portrayed — is lost opportunity for what we really need to be focused on,” said Chip Slaven, chief advocacy officer for the National School Boards Association. In Kalispell, one losing school board candidate who campaigned against mask mandates made it clear he is not finished.“I am the barbed spine of the jumping cholla cactus,” Sean Pandina told the board in May. “I’m the cholla in your flesh that you cannot remove. I’m comfortable with losing the election because I have latched on and am not going away.”Associated Press reporters Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina and Iris Samuels in Helena, Montana contributed.

The Delta variant, which was first seen in India and is already the dominant coronavirus strain in many other countries, is more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and can potentially result in more serious infections. It has already been detected in every state, and government officials believe it will become the main source of American infections within weeks. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. Although cases have been trending downward, the Delta variant creates a coronavirus outbreaks in communities where a significant number of people remain unvaccinated, which can put specific, hard-to-reach populations at risk. The impact could be particularly severe for men, Nunez-Smith acknowledged, since they have generally been more likely to develop complications, sometimes fatal, from COVID-19. Nunez-Smith said that adds to the imperative of getting more men vaccinated. Currently, 53 percent of people who are fully vaccinated are women, and only 47 percent are men, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data does not disaggregate sex and gender or account for nonbinary people. The only age group in which men are more likely to be vaccinated is for adults older than 75, per aseparate CDC analysis. You have been subscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please email[email protected]to subscribe. This email address might not be capable of receiving emails (according toBouncer). You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. White people are more likely to have been vaccinated than Black or Latinx people, the CDC data shows. That has been a concern for months, especially since Black and Latinx people have been more likely to work jobs that expose them to the virus and have been more likely to end up in the hospital. The introduction of the more contagious variant, coupled with that vaccine disparity, could create greater risk of localized, unequally distributed COVID-19 outbreaks, Nunez-Smith said.“There’s more work to do,” she said. “The dynamics of COVID-19 are local. And so it really comes down to the dynamics of one’s community. How many people in one’s community have been vaccinated? The risk is there for these localized surges.”Efforts to vaccinate more Americans have lagged since spring. Though President Joe Biden initially set a target of getting 70 percent of adults vaccinated by the July 4 holiday, the administration acknowledged last week it was unlikely to meet that goal. So far, 66.5 percent of adults have gotten at least one shot. The Biden administration has vowed to distribute vaccines equitably — touting targeted outreach for Black and Latinx people in particular, given their disproportionate harm experienced — but those efforts have not been enough to close vaccine disparities. Nunez-Smith would not say whether federal guidance might change around indoor mask mandates, but she did suggest that more local areas — especially places with low vaccination rates or new surges of COVID-19 — could reintroduce indoor mask mandates even for people who are vaccinated. That’s in line with guidance from other officials, notably Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Currently, the CDC does not recommend requiring indoor masks for people who are fully vaccinated. The World Health Organization does recommend indoor masks, though, citing the risk of the Delta variant. This past week, Los Angeles County’s health department put out a strong recommendation that people wear masks indoors even if fully vaccinated.“It’s really up to locals and states around mask requirements,” Nunez-Smith said. “But I particularly encourage people to pay attention to the local dynamics.”All evidence suggests that people with two shots of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine will not develop severe illness from the Delta variant, and are unlikely to transmit the virus to others. On Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said its vaccine also protects against the Delta variant. But if large pockets of people remain unvaccinated — in the United States or abroad — the virus could further mutate and develop even more potent variants that eventually undercut the power of those vaccines. At the current pace of vaccination, it could take another year for enough of the world to have coronavirus immunity, according to data analyzed by Bloomberg News.",3,Reliable,0.1278406641369603,0.4978848449218819,1122,3,19th News

Gavin Newsom. Faulconer served as mayor from 2006 to 2014 and officially launched his campaign to run in either the 2022 race for governor, or sooner if a recall election takes place.“He’s failed us, year after year,” Faulconer said in his firstcampaign video. “I’m running to make a difference, not to make promises.”While past petitions to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom have failed, there is a current petition that has gained 1.3 million of the 1.8 million of the necessary signatures, according to the “Recall Gavin” campaign. The recall campaign’s senior adviser Randy Economy told L. A. Weekly back in December that he believed enough signatures would be garnered by the end of January and while that did not happen, the campaign has until March 17 to reach the necessary threshold. While leaders in the state, including L. A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, praised Newsom for aggressive action early on in the pandemic, of late, small businesses and Republican voices such as Faulconer have been vocal about their displeasure with the governor’s orders to shut down. Those voices grew louder after Newsom was photographed dining at the French Laundry restaurant in Yountville on Nov. 6, 2020. The dinner appeared to be indoors, although the restaurant said it was their outdoor area, and Newsom was seen packed in tightly with several others and no visible masks worn by the patrons. Newsom later apologized for the dinner, saying he felt “uncomfortable” and should have left the moment he noticed there were so many people in attendance.“To him there’s rules for everybody else and then there’s rules for him,” Economy said about the governor’s November dinner. “It’s the arrogance of power and he doesn’t care for the average person in California. He cares about living in his own political bubble.”On Tuesday, a survey conducted by the University of California, Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studiessaid that among the 10,000 registered voters who were polled, 48% approved of Gov. Newsom’s performance, while 46% disapproved. About 69% of those polled were displeased with Newsom’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is up from 51% in a September poll. A countering poll was released by thePublic Policy Institute of California, Tuesday,and the results were more favorable toward Newsom, showing that 54% of adult Californians were satisfied with satisfied with his performance as governor.“A majority approve of the job that Gavin Newsom is doing as governor, while opinions about him remain deeply divided between Democratic and Republican voters,” Mark Baldassare, PPIC president and CEO said in a media release. “More than four in ten say that COVID is the most important issue for the governor and legislature in 2021, and a majority of Californians approve of the governor’s handling of COVID.

Jumps in cases and deaths have come as Florida tries to roll out its vaccination program. Gov. Ron DeSantis has emphasized immunizing those 65 and older, frontline medical workers and nursing home patients. There have been problems in getting the vaccine to seniors. Around the state, online and phone systems for signing up for the vaccination have crashed under the strain of thousands trying to access the systems at once. Florida launched a new website whereresidents can preregister for the vaccineacross the state, but some counties, including Seminole, are not yet participating. Vaccine efforts hope to stem the rise in hospitalizations and fatalities. Statewide, 1,364,416 people have received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, and an additional 314,528 people have received the second dose. The count is a snapshot through Saturday, state health department report released Sunday. Of those who have received at least the first dose, nearly 1.2 million are over the age of 65. A detailed breakdown of who has been vaccinated so far can be foundhere.Cases and deathsFrom Sunday to Sunday, Florida saw 71,928 new cases and 1,186 newly reported deaths, according to state health department data. In comparison, theweek ending Jan. 24saw 78,170 new cases and 1,156 newly reported resident deaths. January has been the deadliest month since the pandemic began. These are not actual deaths based on date, so there may be a lag time in reporting. Still, there were 4,806 resident deaths reported, surpassing August by 462 deaths. With non-resident deaths included, the gap is higher between the two months by 560 deaths. However, there are signs that Florida has peaked: Sunday over Sunday, cases and deaths were down. That’s the second consecutive week for new deaths and the third consecutive week for new cases. The state is starting to see new daily cases dip below 10,000. With the exception of seven different days, including today’s report, the state has not reported fewer than 10,000 new daily cases since Dec. 29. The state posted a record high of 19,816 new cases on Jan. 7. Since December, the state has seen more than 60,000 new cases per week, peaking at around 111,000 from Sunday, Jan. 3, to Sunday, Jan 10. With a population of about 21.5 million, about one in 12 people in the state have now been infected.An average of 155 resident deaths have been reported per day in January, compared to August, which averaged 140 deaths per day. In a weekly, Sunday-over-Sunday comparison of numbers, the latest week topped 1,186resident deaths, 30 more than the prior week. On Jan. 22, the state sawthe second-highest day for resident deathswith 272 new fatalities posted. That same day, the 277 combined resident and nonresident deaths tied Aug. 11 as the highest since the pandemic started. The state endured more than 1,000 new resident deaths for three consecutive weeks in early August, reaching a peak of 1,343 from Sunday, Aug. 9, to Sunday, Aug. 16. The state has not seen fewer than 100 deaths reported per day since Dec. 29. Florida has seen about one in 811 of its residents die from the virus. Total deaths in Florida attributed to COVID-19 amount to .10% of the state population, a 1.54% death rate.TestingThe rate of testing statewide has increased over the past few weeks, but the week-to-week numbers appear to be coming down. The state saw nine consecutive weeks of more than 300,000 people tested per week since late November. From Sunday to Sunday, 222,744 people were tested, down from the previous week’s figure of 358,701 people. Roughly 48,000 people were tested every day this month. In December, that number was more than 49,000, and in November about 38,600 people were tested per day. To date, 10,191,651 people have been tested in Florida, 290,437 more than last Sunday’s total. The positivity rate among those newly tested climbed above 10% many times in January, but dropped to a low of 5.54% on Sunday for Saturday cases. It fluctuated between today’s low and 14.47% over the past 14 days. That’s for new cases only and excludes anyone who previously tested positive. For all cases including retests of those previously infected, the latest positivity rate is 7.60%. The weekly positivity rate for Jan. 24 to 30 was 9.26%, below the 10% threshold where it has not been since the week of Dec. 20.HospitalizationsFrom Sunday to Sunday, the state reported 2,113 new resident hospitalizations, compared to the previous week’s total of 2,184. Current COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining from a high of more than 7,600 earlier this month. They were climbing toward mid-July highs of over 8,000. By early October, they had fallen to around 2,000, but recently climbed back to more than 6,000. Last Sunday, about 6,276 people were reported hospitalized across the state. This Sunday, 6,011 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Jan. 31, 2:11 p.m. including 219 in Orange County, 142 in Osceola, 133 in Lake and 103 in Seminole. The state’sonline toolupdates several times throughout the day. To date, 72,294 residents have been hospitalized in Florida, according to the detailed information on cases reported to the state. Central and South FloridaCentral Florida added 1,512 cases on Sunday for a total of 300,806: That includes 440 more in Orange for 103,337; 273 more in Polk for 50,474; 161 in Osceola for 33,608; 211 in Volusia for 30,961; 168 in Brevard for 29,345; 98 in Seminole for 24,153; 127 in Lake for 21,824; and 34 in Sumter for 7,104. There were 5 new deaths across all eight Central Florida counties bringing the region’s toll to 4,454. Polk County has the most coronavirus fatalities in the region with 967, followed by 940 in Orange, 654 in Brevard, 535 in Volusia, 373 in Seminole, 425 in Lake, 374 in Osceola and 186 in Sumter. Central Florida accounts for over 17.5% of the cases statewide and over 16.8% of the deaths. (See details on all Central Florida cases here). South Florida, home to 29% of Florida’s population, accounts for 37.9% of cases with 652,226. That includes 2,811 new cases reported Sunday among Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. South Florida’s reported deaths rose by 39 for a total of 9,132, about 34.5% of the state’s total. The most recently available breakdown of Florida’s coronavirus cases can be foundhere.

S. and the globeThe virus has infected over 102 million people and has killed more than 2 million worldwide, according to theJohns Hopkins University & Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center. Nationwide, over 26 million people have been infected and more than 440,000 have died. Nationwide,hospitalizations have been slowly declining this month. 97,561 people were listed as currently hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Sunday, according to theCovid Tracking Project, which updates hospitalization data once a day. The number surpassed 100,000 on Dec. 2, climbed to a high of more than 132,000, but has since dropped. It was over 120,000 from Dec. 28 to Jan. 20. Florida ranks third in the nation in known virus infections, surpassing New York. California leads with 3.2 million, according to COVID-19 Tracking Project. Within the U. S., California has the most deaths with about 40,000, followed by Texas with about 36,000 and New York with about 35,000. Florida is 4th overall, but ranks 26th per capita,according to an analysis of COVID-19 Tracking Project numbers by the Sentinel.Nationally, one in 746 people has died from the virus. Worldwide, about one in 3,507 of the planet’s 7.8 billion population has died. Brazil has the second-most fatalities with more than 223,000, Mexico with more than 158,000, India with more than 154,000, the United Kingdom with more than 106,000, Italy with more than 88,000, France with more than 76,000, Russia with more than 72,000, and Spain with more than 58,000, and Iran with more than 57,000, according to John Hopkins University. The national death toll amounts to .13% of the population, with one in 59 infected dying, a 1.69% death rate. Globally, the number of deaths is at .03% of the world’s population, with one in 46 infected dying, a 2.16% death rate. Death rates have actually gone down as more cases have been reported, and more people recover with improved treatments, even though the overall death toll continues to climb. That rate would be even lower as the actual number of cases around the world is believed to be much higher than reported — perhaps 10 times higher in the U. S., according to the CDC — given testing limitations and the many mild cases that have gone unreported or unrecognized. Have a comment about this story?Share it on our Facebook page.

Now, he will no longer greet students with a big smile when they arrive at Celebration K-8 school and will never be able sing in the car with his daughter. Juan Carlos died on Aug. 30 at age 57. His family believes he was infected with coronavirus after he celebrated his birthday at the school where he was a custodian. Deborah Denise Henson spent much of her adult life in pain— the result of a freakish accident that left her with plates and screws in her back. But you wouldn’t have known it from her smile. She survived a host of medical problems before succumbing to COVID-19. Pong Hui Chartier, known as “Connie” to customersat the dry cleaning business she operated in Ocoee, liked to do things her way. “She’s never been someone that rested. She was always go, go, go. If anyone was going to live to be 100, it would be my mother,” her daughter said. At 79, Pong Hui took only one medication — for her thyroid. But in early March, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. Weeks later, she died as a victim of coronavirus. See more Central Florida coronavirus obituaries here. Symptoms? Do thisAre you feeling stressed or depressed from the COVID19 outbreak?

165,Kamala Harris exaggerates food and water laws for voters,0.0,48.0,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/15/kamala-harris/fact-checking-kamala-harris-claim-food-water-hando/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"Vice President Kamala Harris said that state lawmakers have proposed hundreds of laws that will suppress or make it difficult for people to vote, and that one way state lawmakers have sought to curtail access to the ballot is to cut off food or water to voters in line.""They are punishing people for standing in line to vote,"" Harris told Soledad O’Brien during an interview on BET. ""They are saying ‘Well, if you are going to be standing in that line for all those hours, you can’t have any water or any food.’""A White House spokesperson said Harris was referring to a bill that passed inGeorgiaearlier this year, arestriction passed a few years ago in Montanaand aproposed billin Florida. We found that Harris’s comments have some basis in fact, but she also exaggerates how restrictive some of the laws are. Nationwide, we found laws that expressly ban distributing food and water to voters are scarce. And of course, voters are always free to bring their own food or water. Giveaways of food and water to voters waiting in line are fairly common where allowed, though. Voting rights advocates have long organized efforts to give away bottles of water or food near polling sites where residents wait in line for hours to vote, especially inBlack-majority neighborhoods. Activists call this ""line warming"" and say that it helps voters withstand the wait to cast a ballot, sometimes in hot weather or during lunch or dinner time. But states also commonly ban bribing voters or ban electioneering within a certain distance of polling places, to prevent undue influence on voters. States routinely set up perimeters at polling sites to allow voters to stand in line to vote without campaign workers handing them literature on behalf of candidates. The most restrictive law we could find about food and water for voters is in Georgia. The statepassed a law in 2021that says, in part, no one shall give ""any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink"" within 25 feet of voters standing in line. Violations of this law are a misdemeanor and punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. The bill also states that poll workers can make available ""self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote."" But nothing in the law requires poll workers to make water easily available to voters in line. A previous statelawalready made it a felony to give gifts ""for the purpose of registering as a voter, voting, or voting for a particular candidate."" That provision doesn’t mention food or water specifically, but in 2020Secretary of State Brad Raffenspergerinterpreted it to include food or water. Laws in Montana, New York and Florida are not as stringent as GeorgiaMontana’s 2015 law, signed by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, bans candidates and individuals working on their behalf from distributing food or drinks to voters at or near a polling place. A Montana court used an earlier statute to remove a sheriff from office following the1938 electionbecause he handed out ""large quantities of beer, by the bottle and by the keg.""The White House pointed to aproposed bill in Floridathat initially banned giving ""any item"" to voters. But thelawthat ultimately passed instead expands the pre-existing solicitation ban to include zones around dropboxes and ""engaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter."" While that law doesn’t mention food or water, critics of the law fear it could be interpreted that way. We found thatNew York’s lawbans giving ""meat, drink, tobacco, refreshment or provision"" to voters unless it has a value of less than $1 and is given without any identification of the person or group supplying it. The law has been on the books fordecades, with the $1 cap being added in 1992. New York’s law would allow someone to buy bottles of water or cheap snacks in bulk and hand them out anonymously to voters. Georgia’s law makes no such exceptions. It is possible for a court to interpret an electioneering ban to include food handouts to voters at the polls, but it doesn’t happen often. Snopesfound that the Supreme Court of Kentucky in 1997ruledthat an alderman running for election wrongly handed out food at voting precincts that was intended for poll workers, although the alderman acknowledged that anyone at the sites could take the food. The court ruled that the candidate handing out free boxes of chicken while speaking to voters amounted to electioneering near the building. Harris said new or proposed state laws on voting mean ""if you are going to be standing in that line for hours, you can’t have any water or any food.""This is an exaggeration. People voting in line can still eat or drink. In some places, they may have to bring their own food and water. What Harris is talking about are laws aimed at stopping organized food and water giveaways. Georgia passed a law this year that bans handing out food and water to voters in line. Montana passed a law in 2015 that bans candidates or people on their behalf from distributing food and water to voters in line. A law that passed in Florida this year bans engaging in any activity to influence a voter, but it doesn’t specifically mention handing out food or water. It’s important to note that these laws are rare. And, they don’t literally ban eating or drinking in line; rather, they ban organized giveaways that violate anti-electioneering rules spelled out in state law. We rate this statement Mostly False.

166,America’s Left and the Confiscation of Wealth,15.33,31.0,https://spectator.org/americas-left-and-the-confiscation-of-wealth/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,23,"America’s conservatives should be those least amazed by our left’s calls for wealth confiscation. The only surprise here is the flaunting. After all, wealth confiscation is what the left everywhere has always done. Once in power, it is the only way the left’s policies can survive. As 2020 nears and the pursuit of increasingly restive radicals increases, the politicians courting them aggressively seek more extreme positions. The fear of the “liberal” label is long gone and the “socialist” sobriquet is all the rage among those who rage. With the Marxist moniker come the policies. Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations are already passé. It is no longer enough to tax the wealthy more via their income. Now the target is their wealth directly. Calls for such blatantly confiscatory policies are still shocking to most Americans. However, as we have been repeatedly taught by the left globally, such sensibilities are hopelessly out of step with the new “progressivism.” In one sense America’s left is right in its calls: The only shocking part is their explicit nature. Usually America’s left does not admit it aims, pursuing them instead silently. The left pursues confiscatory policies not just because it supports them in its own right — though assuredly it does — but because it inevitably must. The left always starts with enemies. The question is how broadly it defines them and how stringently it pursues them. The answer depends on the amount of power the left has. Depending on place and parlance, the left’s enemies range from “the rich” and corporations, to capitalists, the bourgeoisie, and “enemies of the state.” Confiscatory policies are aimed at them because, in the words of the bank robber Willie Sutton, “that’s where the money is.” Initially these strike a blow, but they also stake the left’s expensive spending policies. But the more the left’s policies are implemented, the more they fall short. If implemented broadly enough, the economy itself falls short. Regardless, increased resources are needed to make up the shortfall. The phenomenon is akin to the Laffer Curve, albeit beyond tax revenue alone. The economist Arthur Laffer described how increasing rates of taxation, once they hit the inflection point, actually result in declining tax revenue. This creates the potential for reversal: Cutting tax rates above their inflection point results in increased revenues. This observation can be applied to the left’s policies. Entitlement programs continue to escalate — either through increasing benefits, increasing utilization, or both — until they become unaffordable, requiring additional resources or rationing. Subsidies become utilized until too costly and the product subsidized goes into short supply or is rationed. Regulations mount to an extent that the activity regulated becomes less available or less desirable. Given sufficient power, the left can inflict this across an entire economy. There is no shortage of examples of this happening in individual programs here, and no shortage of this happening economy-wide abroad. It is an economic tenet that resources are limited. It is a political tenet that the left’s reach is unlimited. The only way to square this circle is to take more through confiscation. Of course, even compulsion can swim only so long against the economic tide — as the drownings of so many socialist and communist countries prove. The left has never been able to solve the question why those being increasingly confiscated from would indefinitely consent to producing more. The overall effect is analogous to a farmer eating his seed corn. Faced with a disappointing harvest, instead of curtailing consumption the farmer decides to dip into the stock he should set aside for next year’s planting. When spring comes, he sows less, and when harvest time comes, his yield is even shorter. Repeating the cycle, each year falls shorter and shorter. Eventually, he has only enough to eat, but none to plant. So it is with the left. It must make up its shortfall from others — confiscating what it lacks — until all fall short. If this sounds preposterous, look back to the left’s own past — the Soviet famine of 1932-33 and Communist China’s Great Leap Forward — or simply look at its present in Venezuela and North Korea. Or take its programs in isolation and see their inability to meet demand or be self-sufficient. Without external subsidization, they fail. This is only new to America. Here, the left’s programs are subsidized from the general budget and the budget shortfall is borrowed. Hidden from view, there has been a quiet truce: The left pursues its course in incremental steps, accepts its subsidies, and in return does not explicitly call for confiscation. However, America’s New Left reject this historical accommodation and its incrementalism. Emboldened it seeks bigger prizes — a Green New Deal, Medicare for All — and its needs (and wants) bigger prey. Confiscatory policies are now explicit. To the rest of the world — particularly those who have endured the left — such confiscatory calls are all too familiar. Far from new and novel, they are very old indeed — both chronologically, and in the sense of being worn out. They trace back to the 19thcentury and were tried repeatedly in the last century. Each time they were miserable failures — literally — leaving those subjected to them in misery. Far from being “progressive” — today’s trendy attempt at rebranding — they are actually regressive. These policies are throwbacks in time, just as they are throwaways philosophically, economically, and politically. America has not known this in the sense of living it. Knowing it intellectually, that it actually occurred elsewhere, is not the same. To America’s collective mind, it has remained a foreign affliction — like leprosy or the plague — that does not, cannot, actually occur here. America’s only real encounter has been the momentary quadrennial contact with some crank running for president as a communist or socialist. At best, such candidates pick up a comparative handful of votes and curiosity. They are the crazy aunt who mercifully shows up only for major family gatherings. Only this time, she has brought friends. We have emotionally felt that socialism and its wealth confiscation could not happen here. It can, of course. These policies now being so candidly bandied about are exactly what it would look like. And these proposals are just the beginning of what the left will do, if given the chance.",1,Questionable,0.0466191108161911,0.4049877555534489,1406,0,The American Spectator

(AP) — A man killed by sheriff's deputies after he shot and wounded a deputy in a centralCaliforniacemetery on Thursday has been identified as a convicted felon and white supremacist gang member, authorities said. The man opened fire on deputies while hiding behind bushes after he ran from his car in Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo County’s Sheriff Ian Parkinson said at an afternoon news conference. Shortly before 10:30 a.m., a deputy on patrol noticed the suspect's vehicle parked on a downtown street in the city of about 30,000 residents in a wine region on California's central coast.“He recognized the vehicle as belonging to a wanted felon,” Parkinson said. The deputy made a U-turn and found the vehicle unoccupied, Parkinson said. The suspect was spotted walking nearby and when the deputy asked to speak with him, the man sprinted into Templeton Cemetery and hid behind thick shrubbery, Parkinson said. Additional deputies arrived and when they approached, the suspect ambushed them, the sheriff said.“The suspect shot multiple rounds at the deputy, striking one deputy in the lower leg. And the deputies returned fire,” Parkinson said. By that time more deputies arrived and they ""engaged in a gun battle where the suspect was struck and pronounced dead at the scene,” Parkinson said. The deputy was in stable condition at a hospital, the San Luis Obispo Tribune reported. The suspect is a convicted felon with an outstanding felony warrant, a history of weapons charges and a member of white supremacist gang, Parkinson said. A handgun was recovered at the scene. The man's name was not immediately released. “He was known by us, he was wanted by us and he was considered armed and dangerous,” Parkinson said",3,Reliable,-0.0428571428571428,0.4357142857142858,393,3,US News and World Report

S. Capitol in an attempt to block the certification ofJoe Biden’s win, former vice presidentMike Pencehas been weirdly understanding about the fact that his old boss nearly got him killed. For one thing, herefusedto speak out at Trump’s (second) impeachment trial, despite the fact that, at a “Stop the Steal” rally just prior to the attack on the Capitol, Trump whipped his supporters into a frenzy, repeatedly attacking the V. P. throughout his speech and suggesting to the crowd that it was possible that Pence might come through and stop Biden from becoming president, “elevating,” asWashington Postput it, “the suspense and eventual shock among his supporters at Pence’s perceived betrayal when the [congressional] session opened” and Pence did no such thing. “Mike Pence,” Trump said, “I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you.”Meanwhile, when Pencespoken about January 6, it’s to merelysay things like, “I don’t know if [Trump and I will] ever see eye to eye on that day,” which is a weird way to describe a situation wherein he came perilously close to a bloodthirsty hoard that’d been egged on by the 45th president, which would have,according to an FBI affidavit, “killed [the] vice president...if given the chance.” (As it happens, the rioters marched through the buildingchanting, “Hang Mike Pence.” These are the same people that, later in the day, Trumptold“we love you” and “you’re very special,” before writing in his last tweet before being kicked off the platform that the attack was justified. “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,” he said. “Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”)On Thursday evening, though, Pence seemed to…almost, kind of grow a spine!Speaking at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, the former V. P.saidthat he was thrilled he was able to officially certify Biden’s win following the attack, a declaration that will no doubt enrage Trump, who is reportedlystill trying to overturn the results of the election. “I will always be proud that we did our part on that tragic day to reconvene the Congress and fulfilled our duty under the Constitution and the laws of the United States,” Pence told the group assembled, pushing back on the idea,held by Trump, that he had any authority to reject the votes submitted to Congress. He added: “The truth is, there is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.”This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Of course, Pence hasn’t entirely turned his back on Trump:He spent much of his speech reciting what he said were Mr. Trump’s accomplishments on many issues, including free trade, border security and relations with China. “President Trump changed the national consensus on China,” he said. Mr. Pence also compared Mr. Trump to former President Ronald Reagan.“He too disrupted the status quo,” Mr. Pence said. “He challenged the establishment. He invigorated our movement and set a bold new course for America.”Trump, who has probably already reacted to the remarks in a pitch only dogs can hear, will presumably just focus on the “Biden is the rightful president” bits, though. Okay definitely not, but the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who earned the ire of Republicans this week foracknowledging systemic racism is real,be commended for reportedly tellingto sit down and STFU. PerCNN, which obtained a copy of a forthcoming book on the matter,Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost,byWall Street JournalreporterMichael Bender:During one Oval Office debate, senior Trump adviserchimed in, equating the scenes unfolding on his television [during the 2020 racial-justice protests] to those in a third-world country and claiming major American cities had been turned into war zones. “These cities are burning,” Miller warned, according to the excerpts. The comment infuriated Milley, who viewed Miller as not only wrong but out of his lane, Bender writes, noting the Army general who had commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan spun around in his seat and pointed a finger directly at Miller. “Shut the f--k up, Stephen,” Milley snapped, according to the excerpts. It’s not clear how Miller responded though it’s likely that he spent the rest of the meeting sulking in the corner before going home to retire to the coffin he sleeps in. Which seems reasonable given the latter basically drove the formeroff the road last summer:The complaint was filed on behalf White House staffer,former Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis;former Biden campaign volunteerEric Cervini;and the driver of the Biden campaign bus,Timothy Holloway. The plaintiffs wrote in their complaint filed in the Western District of Texas that on October 30, the Trump supporters “terrorized and menaced the driver and passengers on the Biden-Harris Campaign’s bus” for at least 90 minutes, forcing the bus to slow to a crawl on a major highway while swerving in front of the bus to block its path. “They played a madcap game of highway ‘chicken,’ coming within three to four inches of the bus,” the lawsuit alleges. “They tried to run the bus off the road,” referring to the defendants. The complaint alleges that the defendants—named asand a Jane and John Doe—conspired beforehand to surround and block the bus in violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act, passed by Congress in 1871 to prohibit the obstruction of free and fair elections via the coordinated intimidation of voters. As a result of their actions, they claim, the campaign was forced to cancel its stops in San Marcos and Austin out of fear for their safety. Davis, who at the time was serving as a Biden campaign surrogate, filmed the incident from the inside of the bus. The previously unseen footage, which was provided exclusively to CNN, shows several vehicles with Trump flags surrounding the Biden campaign bus, cutting in front of it, and abruptly braking to slow the bus down as it traveled from San Antonio to Austin for a campaign event. Davis’ recording also shows one truck with Trump flags—allegedly driven by Cisneros—sideswiping a campaign staffer's SUV as they accompanied the bus. “That was me slamming that f---er.... Hell yea,” Cisneros later posted on Facebook…. CNN has reached out to the defendants in the suit. None of them have been criminally charged in the incident. The lawsuit references an October 28 video posted to Twitter byencouraging Trump Train members to “get together and head down to McAllen and give Kamala Harris a nice Trump Train welcome,” which he’ll presumably now claim meant that they should greet the Biden-Harris camp with coffee and Danishes. Following the incident, his father tweeted out a video of the highway altercation with the caption, “I LOVE TEXAS!” The plaintiffs claim that, in addition to violating the Ku Klux Klan Act, the Trump Train people engaged in civil assault, “intentionally and/or knowingly” threatening the Biden-Harris bus “with imminent bodily injury by engaging in aggressive, dangerous, and reckless driving that put Plaintiffs and others on I-35 in physical danger.”Davis told CNN, “Though I’ve been involved in many political campaigns for myself and others over the past couple of decades, I have never before experienced the threat or fear I felt when the ‘Trump Train’ surrounded our bus. I’m a part of this suit because I’m worried that this sort of dangerous behavior threatens to become the new normal if we don’t stop it.” Gins told the network, “The experience of those 90 minutes on I-35 is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Elections are partisan and can get heated, but we cannot allow violence to become part of our great democracy",2,Generally Reliable,0.0544424325674325,0.478475690975691,1869,2,Vanity Fair
169,Carnage in Sri Lanka - Global jihadists increasingly strike at religious targets,1.0,49.33,https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/23/global-jihadists-increasingly-turn-against-religious-targets,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-economist-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-23,25,"Editor’s note (April 24th 2019):This article has been updated since it was published on April 23rdTWO DECADES ago al-Qaeda made its name by mounting a succession of bombings against America across the world. These included the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; an American destroyer moored in Yemen in 2000; and, most bloodily of all, the attacks of September 11th 2001 on American soil. Though Osama bin Laden, the group’s founder, had long railed against “Jews and Crusaders”, so giving a religious sectarian dimension to his global jihad, his central target was clear: “kill the Americans and their allies”. Twenty years on, jihadists have changed their focus, particularly under the new generation of extremists affiliated with Islamic State (IS). The Easter Sunday bombing of three churches as well as hotels in Sri Lanka—claimed by IS, albeit without clear proof—constituted the largest co-ordinated terrorist attacks in Asia in recent times, taking the lives of more than 350 people. This reflects a broader trend in terrorism directed against religious targets. The number of people killed in attacks on mosques, churches and the like has increased sharply in the past decade—and faster than attacks on other targets. According to an analysis byThe Economistof data on worldwide terrorism compiled by the University of Maryland, there were 620 deaths in 240 attacks on religious targets in the five years between 2000 and 2004. That number has since risen sharply, to more than 4,000 deaths in 1,400 incidents between 2013 and 2017 ( the five most recent years for which data are available.) Two-thirds of these recent deaths have taken place in just four countries: Pakistan, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Egypt. These numbers exclude terrorist incidents in Iraq and Syria, where the civil wars distort global figuresWhy is this so? One reason may be the baleful influence of IS which, in its formative years as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), deliberately aimed to kill Shias, the country’s largest group, with the intention of polarising the population and driving Sunni Muslims into its arms. It took up that strategy so vigorously that it alarmed al-Qaeda’s leadership. In 2005 Ayman al-Zawahiri, then Mr bin Laden’s deputy and now al-Qaeda’s leader, warned AQI that it was alienating people: “the sectarian and chauvinistic factor”, he said, “is secondary in importance to outside aggression”. AQI paid no attention. In 2014, rebranded as Islamic State (IS), it swept through large parts of Iraq and Syria using untrammelled violence and persecution of opposing sects. It also encouraged its acolytes around the world to conduct freelance attacks—something that al-Qaeda, with its more rigid hierarchy, was more reluctant to do. The pattern of attacks reflected IS’s preference for theatrical assaults on a wider range of targets. To be sure, IS’s European followers have not stopped attacking transport hubs and concert-goers, much as al-Qaeda did a decade ago. But its devotees have also picked out religious sites, notably in the Middle East and Asia. In part they have been incited by IS propaganda, which claims Islam will defeat Christianity and take over Rome. IS’s Egyptian branch is responsible for an onslaught of bombings against the country’s Coptic Christian minority (as well as Sufi Muslims). Its devotees in the Gulf have attacked Shia mosques. IS has also been linked to church bombings in Indonesia last year and in the Philippines in January.“Terrorism of course is meant to shock and terrorise. Its power is thus heightened when holy places are singled out and innocent worshippers and clerics slaughtered,” says Bruce Hoffman of Georgetown University. “IS understands the outsized impact of attacking such targets.”In a sense, IS’s tactics mark a return to the jihadists’ war against the “near enemy”, in which extremists often treated minorities as supporters of local dictators. Coptic churches were attacked in the 1980s; monks were beheaded in Algeria in the 1990s. “You can mobilise against others if you can declare them apostates,” says Raffaello Pantucci, of the Royal United Services Institute, a defence think-tank in London. “Once you have done that it’s easy to slaughter them en masse.”Al-Qaeda itself has not been averse to acts against religious targets, such as the bombing of a synagogue in Djerba, in Tunisia, in 2002. Yet al-Qaeda’s leadership is still committed to the war against the “far enemy”, ie, America and the West, and finds IS’s overt sectarianism too much to stomach. According to Paul Cruickshank, editor of CTC Sentinel, a journal focused on terrorism, a month ago al-Qaeda’s leadership instructed followers to shun attacks on places of worship. Sam Heller of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, argues that al-Qaeda and IS share similar beliefs and objectives, but disagree on how to achieve them; they also compete for both recruits and the support of Muslims more broadly. Al-Qaeda’s “far enemy” strategy is hampered by the fact that it has become harder for it to hit American targets. IS’s more indiscriminate actions are easier to understand for recruits who seek “visceral violence, death, conquest and sectarian unrest”, says Mr Heller. And this outlook appears to be ascendant. That is in large part because Islamic State’s spectacular—though brief—seizure of territory and the creation of a “caliphate” in 2014 gave it worldwide cachet among extremists, who absorbed its nihilistic message and unshackled choice of targets. As the caliphate has collapsed, nearly a fifth of the 40,000-plus foreign fighters who had flocked to Iraq and Syria from more than 80 countries, have headed home—bringing with them contacts, expertise and sectarian fervour. The latest bombings suggest that religious sites in all countries, even those with little history of anti-Christian attacks such as Sri Lanka, have become fair game for jihadists.(Picture: AFP)Liberalism is under threat in the world’s third-largest democracyThat holds future lessons for AmericaThe message is clear: don’t bother voting for his party",3,Reliable,0.0995261495261495,0.3570460882960882,1363,3,The Economist

J. B. Pritzker on Wednesday painted what he called a “grim picture” of Illinois’ ongoing battle with the coronavirus. COVID-19 infections have skyrocketed, the death toll continues to rise and hospitalizations have more than doubled in the last month. Public health officials announced 7,538 new COVID-19 cases, the state’s second-highest daily case count of the pandemic. The record high daily count was set on Halloween at 7,899. The next highest tally was the next day: 6,980 cases. The seven-day statewide positivity rate — the figure showing how rapidly the virus is spreading — was 8.5%, up from 8.2% on Tuesday, the Illinois Department of Public Health said. An additional 55 deaths were reported Wednesday. The state is averaging 45 coronavirus-related deaths each day so far in November — up from 23 at the beginning of October. Illinois has also seen a rise in inpatient care for those with COVID-19, as hospitals continue to treat the most coronavirus patients they’ve seen since the end of May. As of Tuesday night, 3,761 people were hospitalized in Illinois with COVID-19, with 776 of those patients in intensive-care units and 321 on ventilators, officials said.“The virus is spreading and every region is suffering from its insidious invisible contagion,” Pritzker said Wednesday during a press briefing. “Make no mistake: This pandemic isn’t over, not by a long shot. ... We have to act differently.”As of Wednesday, which marked the eighth consecutive day the state has reported more than 6,000 new coronavirus cases, all 11 of the state’s regions are operating under tighter state-imposed COVID-19 restrictions, including bans on indoor services at bars and restaurants. Those mitigations were put in place after each region saw “severe increases” in positivity, ranging from a low of 10% in regions 5 and 6 to a high of 15.7% in region 1, which covers northwestern Illinois, Pritzker said. Both Pritzker and Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said it’ll take a collaborative effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the state. Both encouraged people to wear masks, maintain proper social distancing and to get tested after possible exposure.“The virus is spreading rapidly,” Ezike said. “We are fully into the second wave or second surge and the cases are increasing exponentially. ... Please help stop the spread of the virus, wear a mask, wash your hands, and watch your distance.”",3,Reliable,0.049079254079254,0.3393240093240092,582,3,Chicago Sun-Times
171,Kavanaugh's vote to restrict abortion thwarted as Roberts joins liberals to reject Louisiana law,-17.0,39.32,https://www.salon.com/2020/06/29/kavanaughs-vote-to-restrict-abortion-thwarted-as-roberts-joins-liberals-to-reject-louisiana-law/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-29,25,"The Supreme Court on Monday struck down abortion restrictions in Louisiana as Chief Justice John Roberts aligned himself with the high court's four liberal justices to uphold precedent. The 5-4 ruling rejected Louisiana's law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Two Louisiana doctors and a medical clinic that sued to get the law overturned argued itwould have left only one doctor at a single clinicto provide abortion services for nearly 10,000 women per year. But there was no legitimate legal reason for this case to be in front of the Supreme Court in the first place. In the2016decision, the court already ruled against an identical law in Texas. In that case, the Lone Star State argued in favor of a series of regulations applied to abortion clinics, which had no basis in medical science and were obvious pretenses to force clinics to shut down. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion striking down the Texas law, arguing sensibly that prior to the frivolous regulations, ""abortion was an extremely safe procedure with very low rates of complications and virtually no deaths,"" and there were ""no significant health-related problem for the new law to cure."" Because the state did not establish that the law served the state interest in protecting women's health, the law constituted an undue burden on women's right to abortion. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concurred, writing: ""When a state severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners."" Thus, such regulations put women at risk. So what changed? Nothing about the illegal restrictions that Louisiana adopted, which were cribbed directly from the Texas law. No, what changed was the presence of one Justice Brett Kavanaugh, accused sexual assailant andworld-class champion in the sport of self-pity. The majority opinion in Whole Woman's Health was due to the presence of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is no fan of abortion but had enough honesty and self-regard to know that the Texas law was disingenuous nonsense. However, he retired and was replaced by Kavanaugh, who anti-choice activists were betting was not burdened by concerns about good faith or fair legal procedure. Both Kavanaugh and Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch voted in favor of the restrictions. Kavanaugh's vote came in spite of the repeated insistence of Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that he viewed abortion rights as""settled law.""It marks the third high-profile case this term in which at least one of the court's conservative justices sided with the liberal minority. Roberts similarly joined the liberals toreject President Donald Trump's attempt to dismantle DACA. The chief justice and Gorsuch both sided with the liberal justices to rule thatgay and transgender workers are protected from employment discriminationby the Civil Rights Act. The rulings drew criticism from Trump. The Department of Justice backed the losing side in both cases, as well as the abortion ruling. Robertswrote in a concurrent opinionthat the Louisiana law was effectively the same as the Texas law already struck down by the high court.""The legal doctrine of stare decisis requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike,"" he said. ""The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore, Louisiana's law cannot stand under our precedents . . . The result in this case is controlled by our decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law.""The2016 ruling said that Texas' admitting-privilege requirement""provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions and constitutes an 'undue burden' on their constitutional right to do so.""Roberts did not join the court's four liberals in the majority opinion. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the majority opinion that the law ""imposes an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to choose to have an abortion.""""The impact of those increases would be magnified by Louisiana's requirement that every woman undergo an ultrasound and receive,"" he added. ""Both experts and laypersons testified that the burdens of this increased travel would fall disproportionately on poor women, who are least able to absorb them.""Despite the ruling, abortion advocates expect the court to chip away at reproductive rights.""We're relieved that the Louisiana law has been blocked today but we're concerned about tomorrow. With this win, the clinics in Louisiana can stay open to serve the one million women of reproductive age in the state,"" Nancy Northup, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. ""But the court's decision could embolden states to pass even more restrictive laws when clarity is needed if abortion rights are to be protected.""""Unfortunately, the court's ruling today will not stop those hell-bent on banning abortion. We will be back in court tomorrow and will continue to fight state by state, law by law to protect our constitutional right to abortion,"" Northup continued. ""But we shouldn't have to keep playing whack-a-mole. It's time for Congress to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, a federal bill that would ensure the promise ofis realized in every state for every person.""",2,Generally Reliable,0.0947405761879446,0.4280761246550719,1137,2,Salon
172,"Kamala Harris isn’t getting any honeymoon, and some Democrats are fretting",-4.33,38.67,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-07-02/kamala-harris-isnt-getting-the-same-honeymoon-as-joe-biden-and-some-democrats-are-worried,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"Hours after Vice President Kamala Harris snapped at NBC News anchor Lester Holt last month in an interview from Guatemala, she was still showing signs of exasperation with questions about why she was not also going to the U. S.-Mexico border in her role dealing with waves of migrants to the U. S.“Listen,”she saidanimatedly to reporters who’d accompanied her. “I’ve been to the border before. I will go again. But when I’m in Guatemala ... I think we should have a conversation about what’s going on in Guatemala.”It was the kind of moment that has even supporters questioning her political acumen — underscoring why Harris, nearly six months into her term as a history-making vice president, consistently lags in polls behind President Biden, has failed to get the same honeymoon with voters, draws more critical media coverage and stands as a bigger target for Republicans.“Just in terms of the public-facing stuff, it hasn’t been a stellar six months,” said David Axelrod, formerly the senior campaign and White House advisor to President Obama.“You have limited opportunities to play the featured actor,” he added. “Mostly, you’re playing a supporting role. So if something goes wrong during those limited opportunities, they are magnified.”Harris ended upgoing to the borderlast week, but the controversy over whether she would go provided grist for Democrats who see her flailing in the face of the Republicans’ attacks. That Harris’ public support trails that of Biden, who is favored by a slight majority in most polls, is fairly typical for vice presidents, who by definition play backup roles, are less well known and sometimes serve as heat shields for their bosses. Harris, as a Black and Asian woman, also is subject to racial and gender prejudice that neither Biden nor her predecessors faced. Women in public or private jobs, especially women of color, are often judged more harshly and held to higher standards than white male colleagues in high-level positions. Still, some Democrats are beginning to worry that her sluggish approval numbers are indicative of a bigger problem for Harris, who as vice president ranks as the party’s potential heir to Biden, the oldest president in U. S. history at 78. They have many of the same doubts that have long dogged her, and contributed to her failed campaign for Democrats’ 2020 presidential nomination — about her style, political instincts and treatment of staff. Politicoreported last week about increased tensions within her office — including aides’ frustrations with Chief of Staff Tina Flournoy — while Axios followed withan articleabout friction between Harris’ staff and Biden’s. At least three Harris staffers have left in recent weeks and others are said to be considering the same. For now, those who’ve departed have been fairly low-level aides, and some churn is expected given the stress that comes with White House jobs. Still, Harris has long had a reputation for high staff turnover, and as vice president she is working with an almost entirely new group of advisors, no longer in close touch with much of the political team in California that helped propel her career. Allies say the hand-wringing is overwrought. Some complain that Harris has been hemmed in by the White House, even as Biden has given her thorny, perhaps impossible, tasks — notably, to seek ways to deter migration from Central America and to lead Democrats’ fight to expand access to voting. Mark Buell, who has been Harris’ chief fundraiser since her first race for district attorney of San Francisco, said the White House seems to be giving her the toughest jobs without the full license to make her own mark.“The administration needs to give her real authority, where she can hold a press conference and say, ‘Here’s what I think and here’s where I’m going,’” Buell said. Administration officials say Harris is a valued voice behind the scenes and that her polling numbers should not be a surprise, given that she is playing a supporting role and lacks Biden’s decades on the national stage.“She’s actually doing the hard work that a vice president does and not getting the credit for it because people have this sense that she should be out there doing something different,” said Anita Dunn, a senior advisor to Biden. A senior administration official who would not agree to be quoted by name acknowledged that it’s “always part of the vice president’s role” to “take some of the heat” for the president, and called it “insulting” to suggest Harris’ assignments are too hard, as if “she needs to be protected.” The most important thing, the official added, is that the vice president is a trusted advisor and public messenger. Harris is viewed favorably by an average of 44% of voters and unfavorably by about 47%, according to theReal Clear Politics average of recent polls. Biden, by contrast,is viewedfavorably by 51% of voters, with about 43.5% disapproving. The difference in approval between them, in the high single digits, has been fairly consistent over past months. A recent YouGov poll showed some of the factors behind the numbers. Biden did better than Harris among white voters across the board, but especially among white women with college degrees. While both get high approval from Democrats and low approval from Republicans, the intensity of support or opposition is different: More Democrats said they “strongly approve” of Biden than said the same about Harris, and fewer Republicans said they “strongly disapprove” of him. Those differences reflect on the one hand Harris’ lukewarm support from the Democratic Party’s base, a problem since the 2020 presidential nomination race, and on the other the relentless attacks against her from conservative politicians and media.“She’s not going to have a thermometer rating that matches the president’s. She just isn’t,” said former Obama pollster Cornell Belcher, referring to his own polling data. “She is subservient to the No. 1, just like he was subservient to the No. 1 when he was behind Obama.”Donna Brazile, a friend and former Democratic Party chief, said it’s too early for Harris to worry about the polls. If they look the same a year from now, Brazile went on, then Harris should look at increasing her prominence. But for now, she should continue to literally stand behind or beside Biden at public events while advising him privately, Brazile said. Perhaps the biggest challenge for all vice presidents is showing the public that they are capable of leading as commander in chief. For Harris, that challenge is all the greater, given that she is the first woman and the only woman of Black and Asian descent to hold the job.“Middle white America” — people between the coasts — “they’re comfortable with an older white guy, and I don’t think I’m saying anything insane when I say that,” said Belcher, who is a Black man. But he pointed out that Harris’ barrier-breaking identity is also a political asset, which will only be more valuable by 2028, when Biden, if he runs and wins reelection, would be ending his presidency. By then, given demographic trends, “we have an electorate that is probably about eight [percentage] points browner,” Belcher said. Bakari Sellers, a co-chair of Harris’ presidential campaign and a CNN political commentator who remains a confidant, said Harris gets more scrutiny than her predecessors and less leeway than Biden. For example, he said that Biden’s recent comments that put the administration’s infrastructure packagein jeopardywere greeted as a “faux pas.” But, he added: “If Kamala Harris had done that, it’s stories about ‘Is she prepared?’”Sellers does have advice: Harris should “stop advisor-sourcing information and just fall back on her gut.”He said that Harris did not look comfortable when she said in Guatemala that would-be migrants should “stay home.”“I’m pretty sure that came from the White House,” Seller said, “and that’s why it didn’t sound natural.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.0476255729564553,0.3959321152703505,1740,3,LA Times

Not only has DJI dominated the drone business for years, but Chinese companies dominate significant parts of the drone supply chain. So DJI might not have as much trouble sourcing components from domestic supply chains.

Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said his priority is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible so that COVID-19 is no longer a threat.""You're indicating liberty and freedom. I look at it as a public health measure to prevent people from dying and going to the hospital,"" he said. Jordan interrupted Fauci when the doctor was explaining quarantine measures would ""end for sure"" when the level of infection was low enough to prevent another surge of the virus, insisting Americans' liberties had been assaultedr.""Your right to go to church, your right to assemble, your right to petition your government, freedom of the press, freedom of speech (has) all been assaulted,"" he said.""I think you're making this a personal thing, and it isn't,"" Fauci told Jordan.""It's not a personal thing,"" Jordan said.""No, you are. That is exactly what you're doing,"" Fauci said in an exasperated tone. Jordan said he wanted a clear standard for when to lift COVID-19 restrictions because Fauci's recommendations carry ""a lot of weight.""""We just had the chair of the Financial Services Committee say she loves you and you're the greatest thing in the world,"" he told Fauci. Waters, a California Democrat and chair of the Financial Services Committee, told Fauci ""I love you"" after thanking the medical experts present at the hearing..""As you know, my sister was one who was infected and died from COVID-19, and all that I had to depend on was Dr. Fauci,"" Waters said. ""I would like to tell Dr. Fauci that you literally saved millions of folks who would only listen to your advice based on what was happening with the Trump administration.""Fauci said his recommendations were in line with guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control.""Right now, we have about 60,000 infections a day, which is a very large risk for resurge. ""We're not talking about liberties,"" he said. ""We're talking about a pandemic that has killed 560,000 Americans. That's what we're talking about.""The back and forth between Jordan and Fauci continued even after Committee Chairman Jim Clyburn, D-S. C., announced Jordan's time had expired.""You need to respect the chair and shut your mouth,"" Waters told Jordan from across the room. USA TODAY reached out to representatives for Jordan and Waters for comment. Later in the hearing, Fauci accused Jordan of ""ranting again"" when the congressman resumed his line of questioning.

176,The COVID Tracking Project is (nearly) gone. Can we see clearly now?,-4.0,45.0,https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/the-covid-tracking-project-is-nearly-gone-can-we-see-clearly-now.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,18,"Alexis C. Madrigal and Robinson Meyer, colleagues at, set out to answer a simple question: how many people had been tested for the coronavirus in the US so far? The answer, it turned out, was actually quite complicated: in the absence of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was hard to tell whether low reported case rates to that point reflected lowincidenceor lowtesting. Madrigal and Meyer sent a form email to health officials in every state; they soon found out that the answer was the latter, and that the federal government did not have a handle on the numbers. As Emily Sohn reported for CJR, Jeff Hammerbacher—a data scientist who had been working to track the same information, and who knew Madrigal from college—saw their work and reached out. They teamed up, and soon, the COVID Tracking Project was born. It was meant, initially, as a short-term gap-filler. “Every day,” Erin Kissane, its managing editor, told Sohn in late March, “we hope the CDC will put us out of business.”But the days went by, and the CDC did not, leaving the Tracking Project’s collective of journalists and tech folk to serve,in their own words, as “a de facto source of pandemic data for the United States.”agreed to host the project; its team grew to include hundreds of volunteers, and the project’s founders solicited philanthropic donations to pay some of them. “It just got really complex,”Madrigal told CNN’s Brian Stelter recently. “At first, we just thought you could pull numbers off dashboards and that was gonna be the main process. As it turned out, we actually needed to do deep research. We made hundreds and hundreds of contacts with state officials… We added race and ethnicity data, we added outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths, we added tracking of long-term care facilities. So all of those things came together to just require tons of labor; I mean, tens of thousands of hours of people’s time.” State and federal officials cribbed the project’s data. Other journalists became reliant on it. Now, finally, the project is winding down. It stopped collecting data ten days ago; it plans to spend the next couple of months on analysis work and archiving before shuttering completely. The analysis will mainly focus on data streams—around race and ethnicity, for instance—that are still insufficient, but the project’s founders are confident that federal officials are finally adequately replicating much of its core data, and, crucially, that the new Biden administration can be trusted not to turn off the lights at a moment’s notice. Writing last week, however, Madrigal and Kissane warned that the landscape of coronavirus data is “persistently messy.” The pandemic response “has been nominally or actually based on the idea that we know what is happening across the country to a precise degree,” they wrote. “And although this idea—that we have solid data about the movements of the pandemic and the effects of the response—is much closer to truth now than it was a year ago, it’s very far from universally accurate.”This week, Madrigal and Meyer expanded on that themein an essay for, pinpointing key truths about pandemic data and officials’ handling of it. The initial pandemic response plan assumed the presence of good data, and failed to account for kinks at every part of the data-production pipeline, from the local, to the state, to the federal. We now have much better national-level data on cases, tests, hospitalizations, and deaths—but this still offers a rather messy compilation of snapshots and time lags, not a real-time “window” into the current state of the pandemic, as officials sometimes imply. (Deaths often substantially lag cases, and commonly go unreported for weeks.) At least five states still “have disturbingly incomplete testing data”; nationally, tens of millions of rapid antigen tests appear to be unaccounted for. “Datamight seem like an overly technical obsession,” Madrigal and Meyer write. “But data are how our leaders apprehend reality.”The press, too. Over the course of the pandemic, responsible news organizations have pledged to “follow the science” and extolled the virtues of data-driven analysis, but as Madrigal and Meyer note, looking at data is less like “peering into a crystal ball” than “watching city sewers empty into a wastewater-treatment plant”—it’s more useful than not looking, “but you shouldn’t delude yourself about what’s in the water.” And yet,as I wrote in the early days of the pandemic, reporters moved quickly to paint unduly certain pictures with extremely incomplete information; reported cases and deaths, for example, were routinely relayed as “totals,” not as clear undercounts, which, of course, they were. Over time, data flows improved; testing, in particular, expanded, even prior to the election of a president who doesn’t view it asa conspiracy to make him look bad. But testing remains highly imperfect. Per the Tracking Project, reported daily tests hit a high-water mark close to 2.3 million in December—a figure,some experts then calculated, that was adequate tomost symptomatic COVID cases and close contacts, but still fell well short of the daily rate that would be needed to properlycontrolviral spread by identifying asymptomatic people. From a public-health standpoint,these metrics are subject to healthy scientific debate; from a journalistic standpoint, every additional test is an extra confirmed truth about the world, and yet media-industry leaders have never pushed with any real consistency or urgency to frame expanded testing,as I suggested last year, as a freedom of information issue. (We’re better at demanding to see information the government is hiding than information the government is failing to collect.) In the absence of a further massive ramp-up, thepercentageof tests coming back positive often offers more useful insights than flat numbers, yet many outlets haven’t pivoted to this metric with any consistency either. And in recent weeks, testing rates have generally declined. This could be a function of fewer people needing one (though, again, it depends how you define “need”), but it could also reflect public exhaustion with mitigation measures, bad weather, states’ shift to vaccine infrastructure, and other contingencies. As I wrote recently, journalists covering the pandemic still have to grapple, over a year in, with massive uncertainty. We still haven’t figured out how best to communicate this—not only around new challenges like vaccines and variants, that currently attract the bulk of our attention, but around the very basic building blocks that we use to define and measure surges and lulls, sickness and death. The visibility of these underpinning realities is still murky. Some outstanding journalists—not least at the Tracking Project—have focused on finding outlines of clarity, and for that we owe an enormous debt of gratitude. Many of us have instead acclimated to the murk, preferring to see what’s in front of us, even though it isn’t the full picture.

177,Who are the out-of-state billionaires backing ranked-choice voting in Massachusetts?,-5.0,47.33,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/25/metro/who-are-out-of-state-billionaires-backing-ranked-choice-voting-massachusetts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-25,25,"In April of last year, John Arnold warned in a Houston Chronicle op-ed that democracy at the local level was in “crisis.” A former energy hedge fund manager and Enron trader turned philanthropist, Arnold argued that a ranked-choice voting system, in place of runoff or two-round elections, could help spur more competition and, perhaps, voter interest.“Houston,” thebillionaire wroteof his hometown, “should aim to lead the way in bringing it to Texas.”Eighteen months later, it’s voters in Massachusetts and Alaska — not Texas — weighing whether to push into a new frontier of voting this November. It’s also still Arnold helping drive the case for why they should. AdvertisementArnold and his wife, Laura, are among a network of wealthy out-of-state donors helping fuel ranked-choice voting ballot initiatives in Massachusetts and beyond, by seeding local committees with millions of dollars and, in the Arnolds’ case, buttressing research on the system’s potential impact. Through their Action Now Initiative, the Arnolds have committed nearly $3.4 million in support of the Massachusetts ballot proposal, known as Question 2. Kathryn Murdoch, the daughter-in-law of Rupert Murdoch, has personally given $2.5 million since early September. The Denver-based nonpartisan group Unite America, which she co-chairs and has seeded with millions toward supporting democratic reforms, has contributed $445,000. Neither the Arnolds nor Murdoch agreed to interview requests sent through the respective organizations they lead, which instead offered on-the-record statements. In all, of the $9.8 million the Yes on 2 committee has raised, just 19 donors — 12 of whom hail from outside Massachusetts — gave a combined $9.2 million. Donors outside the state make up 84 percent of all the cash it has reportedly collected. It’s a similar story elsewhere. In Alaska, where voters are weighing athree-pronged initiative, including using ranked-choice voting in general elections, the Arnolds and Unite America have given a combined $4.6 million, the vast majority of what Alaskans for Better Elections has raised. The Arnolds also put more than $1 million behind two separate, and successful, ranked-choice voting efforts in Maine, as well as$1 million morein the successful effort last year to adopt it in New York City, making Action Now Initiative its leading donor. That financial heft underscores the intense interest, and faith, that national advocates say they have in the system, as well as the role that states, including Massachusetts, could play as a bellwether in its adoption on a wider scale. Fewer than 20 cities or countiescurrently use ranked-choice voting, and Maine is the only state where it is deployed for statewide and federal races.“We’re a very important bell cow,” said Michael Porter, a Harvard University professor, Brookline resident, and, with $450,000 in donations, Yes on 2′s biggest in-state contributor. “I think Massachusetts will be one of the next rounds of states that are serious and are putting this measure in place because we believe that political innovation has to happen in America.”But the spigot of out-of-state funding has also drawn skepticism from ranked-voice voting’s critics, who have used the heavy reliance on national cash as a key plank in their opposition to something that would have a profound effect on Massachusetts elections. It remains to be seen whether that sways voters’ feelings forthe ballot question, which has run even oraheadin scant public polling. Advertisement“Money flows around the political system all the time. This thing will either win or lose on the strength or weakness of the arguments, and whether, more broadly, people view it as a solution to a problem that exists,” said Jack Santucci, an assistant teaching professor at Drexel University who has researched ranked-choice voting. “You can’t create demand for this stuff. And you can’t purchase demand for it.”As proposed inQuestion 2 on Massachusetts' ballot, ranked-choice elections would give voters the option of ranking candidates for an office in order of preference. If a candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-choice votes, he or she isthe winner. But if no one does, the candidate with the fewest votes is stripped away and those voters are reallocated to the remaining candidates based on their second choice. The process goes for as many rounds as it takes for one candidate to earn a majority of votes. If approved, the new system would be used for primary and general elections for statewide offices — governor, attorney general, and more — as well as congressional, state legislative, and district attorney offices starting in 2022. It would not apply to presidential elections or municipal elections. The Arnolds’ group began seeding such efforts beginning in Maine, struck by what it has described as paralysis in lawmaking and frustration with the status quo. Sam Mar, a vice president at Arnold Ventures, said that in Massachusetts and elsewhere, the Arnolds donated money because there already was a base of local support and volunteers behind the ranked-choice initiatives. Advertisement“Ultimately we’re all part of this country, and we should all be pitching in to help voters strengthen our democracy, regardless of where we live,” Mar said. That has included pumping money into political reform research, including$500,000to the think tank New America. (Santucci, the Drexel professor, is among the researchers who have a contract with New America, under which he is studying whether ranked-choice voting promotes more women and people of color to run.)The Arnolds also aren’t strangers to Massachusetts’ political landscape. In 2016, John Arnold gave $250,000 to an unsuccessful effort to lift the cap on charter schools in Massachusetts, and they poured more than$500,000 into a PACthat helped bolster Governor Charlie Baker’s reelection in 2018. Last year, Patients For Affordable Drugs Now, a bipartisan political group that the couple has funded, put hundreds of thousands of dollars into anad campaign backing a Baker proposalto control prescription drug costs. Those helping lead the ranked-choice ballot initiative argue that despite the out-of-state help, the push is rooted in local support. Evan Falchuk, Yes on 2′s chairman, said he first joined the effort in 2017, and the ballot question has the backing of prominent Massachusetts officials, from former governors Deval Patrick and William F. Weld to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey, among others. AdvertisementPlus, the committee directly solicited the out-of-state financial help, saidMike Zarren, the assistant general manager of the Boston Celtics and a Yes on 2 board member.“We reached out to a bunch of democracy activists. They all didn’t find us,” Zarren said, arguing that the outside donors have no financial incentive to see ranked-choice voting pass. “If you care about this nationally, you sort of have to do it state by state.“Still, the zip code of the donors has provided a consistent rallying cry for its opponents.“Why are they so interested in Massachusetts voting system?” said Anthony Amore, a former Republican candidate for secretary of state who has acted as an informal volunteer spokesman for the committee opposed to Question 2. Asked what he believes the motivation is, Amore said he is hesitant to speculate.“It should give people pause, as it should for any political candidate or ballot initiative, of who is funding it,” he said. Some Democrats, too, have preached wariness. Kevin Connor, an aide to state Senator Harriette L. Chandler, warned in aCommonwealth Magazineop-ed that Murdoch’s endorsement of ranked-choice voting as a way to help alleviate extreme partisanship “erases the impact of progressive champions like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley.”He added that “for Massachusetts progressives fighting the status quo, a voting regime that drags election results to the center should be viewed with skepticism — especially when moneyed interests are so supportive.”Nick Troiano, the executive director of Unite America, which Murdoch co-chairs, said in a statement that it is backing ranked-choice in Massachusetts because it can give voters “more power in their elections and more choice on their ballot.”The narrative isn’t limited to Massachusetts. In right-leaning Alaska, the state Republican Party, as well as groups such as Planned Parenthood, oppose the ballot measure there, which also would create so-called open, or nonpartisan, primaries. Alaskans, known for their libertarian and independent streak, often bristle at the specter of outside influences, said Alex Hirsch, an associate professor of political science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.“If outside money gets identified as an influential force,” Hirsch said, “that often backfires.”Correction: Because of a reporting error, an earlier version of this story incorrectly identified John and Laura Arnold’s connection to Patients For Affordable Drugs Now.

Sign up forour Top Stories newsletter, sent to your inbox every weekday morning. To support journalism like this, pleasedonateor become asubscriber. An 82-year-old inmate who had tested positive for the coronavirus died at the Draper prison Wednesday morning, prison officials said. He is the first incarcerated person in Utah to die after testing positive for the virus. Prison officials noted that the man had other “complicating comorbidities” that likely contributed to his death, and said a medical examiner will determine his cause of death. The inmate tested positive Friday, as part of mass testing after aninmate in the Oquirrh 5 unit complained of symptomsand subsequently was determined to have the virus. Prison officials said the man was found dead in the Oquirrh 5 unit early Wednesday. They said he reported no symptoms prior to his death.[Tell The Tribune:Do you know someone at the Utah State Prison affected by the coronavirus outbreak?]The Oquirrh area, prison officials have said, is where the “most medically vulnerable” inmates live, and where they have taken the greatest precautions to keep the virus out. Officials said Wednesday that medical officials will continue to “heavily monitor” this area as they react to the virus spreading within the facility. Prison officials did not release the name of the man who died, but said family members had been notified. The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, which sued prison officials in April over their coronavirus response, expressed frustration Wednesday, saying the prison and parole board still haven’t been doing enough to keep inmates safe, or release those that are medically vulnerable.“This was preventable,” said Sara Wolovick, an ACLU Equal Justice Works fellow. “This is precisely why we sued back in April. This is what we were trying to prevent.”The ACLU’s lawsuit didn’t go far, however. The Utah Supreme Court dismissed the litigation, saying the group didn’t have proper legal standing to bring it to court. Wolovick didn’t rule out the possibility that the ACLU will sue again, saying the prison still hasn’t taken the proper steps to respond appropriately to an outbreak that has spread throughout both its facilities. Wolovick said she didn’t know if the man who died had sought an early release, but said there are still elderly inmates and medically vulnerably people incarcerated who should be considered for release. She said the ACLU tried to ask prison officials to release some inmates on medical furlough so they would not be housed in communal living facilities, but the Department of Corrections didn’t respond to that request. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases have exploded at the Utah State Prison over the past few weeks. There have now been 572 confirmed cases at the Draper facility, according to the prison, and 22 at the Gunnison facility. The initial outbreak at the prison began in October, and was believed to be tied toa medic who treated several inmateswho later tested positive. While that outbreak was contained to one area, the virus has spread to almost every other housing unit — including Oquirrh 5, Promontory, Lone Peak and in at least three blocks of the Wasatch facility. Positive cases have also been reported in at least two housing units at the Gunnison facility. Family members of those incarcerated told The Salt Lake Tribune that their loved ones have been calling them in tears, saying they feel sick and haven’t been able to get any medication to ease their pain. Haylee Powell’s husband, who is in the Promontory section, tested positive Tuesday. She said he told her that he’s quickly become weak and has had pain in his chest and racking coughs. His bunkmate, he told her, had been curled up in a ball crying in their shared space.“He’s been in there a really long time, 13 years,” she said. “He’s a pretty tough dude. For him to cry to me, it’s pretty serious. I’ve never heard him cry.

Butcountries,lawmakers, and President Trump say the app – owned by Chinese internet company ByteDance – is not goodFor You. And last Friday, Trump said he wouldban it. Because ofnational security concerns. US officials haveaccusedthe company of sharing users' data to spy on US citizens and potentially eveninfluencethe US election. They're also worried about intellectual property theft, which has already cost the US billions of dollars. One US senator called it a ""Trojan horse."" But TikTok says 'don't worry' – US user data is under ""strict controls"" and only stored in the US. Now, Microsoft is entering the chat. Last week, rumors that Microsoft was looking to buy TikTok's American operations spread faster than you scrolled through its bite-sized videos. After speaking with Trump, Microsoft said the deal with ByteDance was stillon the table, pending a security review. And that it would build on the app's current structure but with enforced ""world-class security, privacy, and digital safety protections.""It's not the first time the US has taken steps to ban a Chinese company over national security concerns (see:Huawei and ZTE). And TikTok's already been banned byUS military branches. But now that an American company's offered to buy it up, some believe the security concerns will be a thing of the past. Others are still worried about the ever-growing power ofBig Tech. A ""new phase"" of COVID-19. Yesterday, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said the US entered a ""new phase"" in the fight against the virus, calling it ""extraordinarily widespread"" across rural and urban areas. She stressed the ongoing importance of social distancing and wearing masks...evenpotentially at home(for people who live with someone who is at risk). It comes as cases in the South and Midwest have skyrocketed in recent weeks. And as California became thefirst stateto report more than 500,000 cases. In all, the US has reported more than 4.6 million infections and over 154,000 deaths. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's. Yesterday, President Trump called for the federal government to seek the death penalty for the Boston Marathon bomber. Reminder: In 2013, Tsarnaev and his brother planted homemade bombs at the finish line, killing three people and injuring hundreds. While his brother died in a shootout with police, Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges and faced execution. Butlast week, a federal appeals court threw out his death sentence. It argued the original jury wasn't fully vetted for potential bias and ordered a new trial to determine whether Tsarnaev should be executed. Now, Trump is saying that ""rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than"" Tsarnaev and is asking the gov to seek it once again. Ellen DeGeneres. Last month, nearly a dozen current and former employees of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" spoke to BuzzFeed News, accusing show execs and HR of racism and intimidation. Allegations included employees being fired for taking medical leave and racist comments toward a Black employee. WarnerMedialaunchedan internal investigation into the show and Ellenapologized, saying she's ""committed to ensuring"" this doesn't happen again. But these aren't the only accusations the show faces. Dozens of former employees have alsoaccusedthree of the show's exec producers of sexual harassment and misconduct including groping and soliciting oral sex. Two of the accused are reportedly denying the allegations. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken.

Under the guidance of special prosecutor Fred Franklin III, the grand jurors will ask questions, review evidence and determine whether Jake Gardner, 38, should face charges in Scurlock’s death. Gardner claims he fired in self-defense because Scurlock had him in a headlock or chokehold. The confrontation occurred during thesecond night of protests in Omahaover the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Minneapolis-area resident. Floyd died after former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for about eight minutes. Scurlock’s death — and Douglas County AttorneyDon Kleine’s decision to not charge Gardner— sparked demonstrations in Omaha. Kleine had concluded that he could not counter Gardner’s contention that he fired in self-defense. After critics bristled at that decision, Kleine relented, saying he’s not afraid of having a “second set of eyes” review his decision. Kleine himself petitioned for a special prosecutor and grand jury to convene. A law enforcement official with knowledge of the grand jury said about 40 Douglas County residents will fill out a questionnaire beginning Tuesday and will be questioned about their ability to serve on the grand jury. That pool will then be winnowed down to 16 grand jurors and three alternates. After hearing the evidence — and being instructed on Nebraska law — the grand jury will deliberate. Under state law, it takes 12 of 16 grand jurors to indict. If that happens, the case will be tried in Douglas County District Court. Depending on the pace of the probe, the grand jury’s investigation could spill into the following week. If there’s no indictment, Franklin has said he expects the grand jury to issue a report on the matter. People hold a vigil at the spot where James Scurlock was shot in 2020. More than a hundred people gather for a vigil to remember James Scurlock where he was shot.

182,Marjorie Taylor Greene Holocaust tweet was gift to Dems – The Forward,6.33,35.0,https://forward.com/opinion/470466/marjorie-taylor-greenes-holocaust-tweet-was-a-gift-to-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-27,25,"US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill on February 5, 2021 in Washington, DC. By Alex Edelman / AFP via Getty ImagesIn today’s political environment, where everyone is either a Nazi or communist — and, as ever, the Jews are unhappily stuck in the middle — it was almost bound to happen. Like so many discarded blue face masks spread across the asphalt of a shopping center parking lot, the gauntlet was thrown down on May 17th. That’s the day Food City — a Georgia supermarket chain — announced that employees who verify their “full vaccination” can work without facemasks if they display a vaccination “logo” on their name badges. That was something conservative Republican iconoclast Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congresswoman for Georgia’s 14th congressional district, could simply not resist. Taylor Greene, likemost Republicans, is skeptical of masking policies that seem to no longer have much empirical justification. Manyhave their doubts about Covid vaccines too. Most conservatives see the obsession with masks and vaccines as evidence that millions have ceded control over their personal lives to the government; the eagerness of the corporate world to keep the flocks in line rankles conservatives even more. It was not only her position that rankled the internet, but the way she expressed it:“Vaccinated employees get a vaccination logo,”tweetedGreene, “just like the Nazis forced Jewish people to wear a gold star.”To make her analogy clear, she continued, “Vaccine passports & mask mandates create discrimination against unvaxxed people who trust their immune systems to a virus that is 99% survivable.”These comments, and the outrage that followed, could not have appeared at a more opportune time for the Democrats. Facing growing political heat over silence as American Jews suffer violent attacks “sparked by” military clashes between Gaza Strip militants and Israel, Greene presented a perfect opportunity to score political points. In other words, if there were no Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Democrats would have had to invent her. But tempting as it is to say they did invent her — spun and distorted her into something she isn’t — they didn’t. Not that Greene is any more a “Nazi” than Schumer and Pelosi, beloved by Wall Street, are communists. Yes, her filter is poor and naive. Her choices of friends, theories of the universe and metaphors lack the sheen of consultancy guidance, focus groups or, often, much thought. She has a checkered, albeit brief, history — most of it rhetorical or notional — with Jews. Based on claims she is too friendly with “extremists” or “extremism,” in January, the House took the unusual step of stripping her of all committee assignments. In contrast, Democrats have done nothing to address the problems within their own caucus. While most American Jews are Democrats, those seriously involved in Jewish issues express growing concern that the Democratic Party is home to a substantial caucus committed to rabid anti-Israel sentiment and barely concealed antisemitism. That this small group holds outsized influence on the Democrats’ agenda towards Israel iscrystal clearto anyone paying attention. The contest is uneven. Unlike The Squad, whose supporters cheer at vileanti-Jewishrhetoric andtropes, Greene gains little politically by saying dumb things about the Jews. She does, however, embarrass the national party, which is committed to a consistently pro-Israel foreign policy and attracting increasingly politically conservative Jews, especially among the growing Orthodox segment. Greene’s yellow-star gaffe, then, fell like welcome rain for the Democrats. Quickly, the usual outrage jockeys made the usual condemnations and demanded the usual denunciations. But to those the outrage machine was hoping to shame, the tweet was of no lasting significance. The Republican Party quickly denounced the remarks, but more importantly, the tweet seems to have triggered virtually no outrage among most Republican Jews. The truth is that, since early 2020, the yellow-star and ghetto comparisons have been woven into more after-shul and Shabbat table conversations here in New York’s Orthodox community than I can count. How quickly we forget that New York’s governor was found to have violated Jews’ constitutional rights by creating Covid “red zones” around Jewish neighborhoods and institutions. The comparison to yellow stars and ghettos was inescapable to us. Online, the GOP was once again in its own usual spot between a rock and hard place, because the Democrats succeeded again — with a little help from Rep. Greene — in putting it there. Its only winning strategy was one it is incapable of deploying: ignoring the Democratic media playbook, changing the game and redrawing the frame. But the GOP lacks party discipline and self-respect, among other things. So instead, Republicans lined up for the usual condemnations, voted the usual votes, and headed together to wherever it is shepherds lead sheep.

183,"How ""SoHo Karen"" Miya Ponsetto's Privilege Dominated That Gayle King Interview",-5.33,38.67,https://www.popsugar.com/news/miya-ponsetto-gayle-king-interview-essay-48099874,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-10,25,"Many things about 22-year-old Miya Ponsetto's interview with Gayle King on Friday were puzzling and infuriating, and her choice of attire was one of them. Turns out,Ponsetto's lawyer suggested she remove her ""Daddy"" baseball capbefore the exclusive interview. ""We asked her to wear professional attire,"" attorney Sharen Ghatan told The Daily Beast. ""I specifically asked her to remove it before the interview."" But Ghatan described Ponsetto as ""defiant,"" ""insistent,"" and a ""very challenging client,"" so the cap stayed on. Notice the lawyer neglected to use the word ""racist,"" yet Ponsetto's attitude, actions, and, by extension, her outfit are charged with supposed superiority. There's privilege at work here. Ponsetto wasarrested on Friday in Californiaafter allegedly physically assaulting 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. on Dec. 26 at the Arlo Hotel in New York City. Onlookers (including Harrold Jr.'s father, renowned jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold Sr.)caught Ponsetto's tirade against the Black teen on camera, as she falsely accused him of stealing her cell phone and threw him to the ground. After the attack, the internet labeled Ponsetto as ""SoHo Karen"" when video of her aggression went viral. You'd hope that Ponsetto would've used her time with King on Friday to apologize and show remorse for her actions. You'd be disappointed. Ponsetto appeared on camera in a puzzlingly casual outfit, wearing a $16 Urban Outfitters baseball cap. If an outfit makes a first impression, one could assume Ponsetto was aware the message her indifference would send to King and to the world watching. ""[The hat] was important to her,"" Ghatan said, although she couldn't explain why. The lawyer admitted she's concerned for Ponsetto's mental health. Clearly, Ponsetto's obstinance indicated what was to come. She gaslit Harrold Jr. with insincere apologies, only acknowledging ""if I insulted him or hurt his feelings."" She danced around questions and leaned heavily on excuses in an attempt to spin the story as a victim. She ignored her lawyer's attempts at intervention. In an especially improbable exchange, she snapped at King. The seasoned interviewer tried to hold Ponsetto accountable by telling her, ""You're 22 years old, but you are old enough to know better."" Ponsetto responded with a wave of her hand, and said, ""All right, Gayle, enough.""Every second of Ponsetto's six-minute interview further emphasizes her immense privilege. She described herself as ""super sweet"" and then, in nearly the same breath, shushed an acclaimed journalist — and Black woman — on national TV. She treated the interaction as if it were barely worth her time, seemingly undaunted by the consequences of her actions. In fact, she appeared blind to her own actions entirely. ""I'm a 22-year-old girl. . . . How is a girl accusing a guy about a phone a crime? Where is the context in that?"" she asked. Despite Ponsetto's insistence, she's not a girl, she's a woman. A full-grown adult, actually. Harrold Jr., on the other hand, isn't a ""guy"" — especially in comparison to Ponsetto. He's at the beginning of his teen years, closer to childhood than whatever innocence Ponsetto tried to claim for herself. And for the record, making a false accusation is a crime if it's reported to the police. Privilege and assumed power like Ponsetto's are engrained over time. Society consistently reaffirms that just looking a certain way will fill in the gaps for any shortcomings. Frighteningly, Ponsetto's privilege acts as the same supposed ""shield"" that emboldens people likethe Donald Trump-supporting mobwho attacked the nation's Capitol. A MAGA hat and a ""Daddy"" cap never felt so eerily similar. Hours after Ponsetto acted invincible in her conversation with King, she got her mugshot taken. Much like Amy Cooper,the white woman who falsely claimed a Black birder was threatening her, Ponsetto will face charges, although it's unclear what they will be. Ponsetto still doesn't see her actions as racially charged, despite singling out the Black teen and refusing to relent. For the record, the hotel had her phone. Although Ghatan canceled her client's future interviews, there's still a chance Ponsetto could resurface to spin the same lies. Perhaps she would do well to heed her own advice: ""Alright, Miya, enough."" In the meantime, someone please pour Gayle King a glass of something strong and give her a raise. There isn't a paycheck big enough to cover the audacity she dealt with this week.",2,Generally Reliable,0.029020979020979,0.4413519813519815,1110,2,Popsugar

The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead, only grow stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve.”While the president did not mention his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, by name, he did extend well wishes to the incoming 46th president. “This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes and we also want them to have luck.”Giving special thanks to his family, Vice President Mike Pence and his family, his cabinet, the Secret Service, the White House Military Office, the United States Armed Forces as well as state and local law enforcement, Trump thanked the American people for the opportunity to serve as president: “To serve as your president has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege.”“We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation,” he added. The president alsocondemnedthe assault on the U. S. Capitol two weeks ago, describing political violence as “an attack on everything we cherish as Americans,” adding, “It can never be tolerated.” He urged the American people to “unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destiny.”After summarizing his achievements in the White House — passing ""the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history,"" record economic growth, replacing NAFTA with theUSMCA, achieving record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and women, wage growth, setting stock market records, expanding the child tax credit, rebuilding manufacturing, criminal justice reform, developing two COVID-19 vaccines,lowering prescription drug prices, allowing veterans to see doctors outside of the VA system, giving terminal patients theright to tryunapproved treatments, filling threeU. S. Supreme Court vacanciesand appointing nearly 300 federal judges, building more than452 miles of the border wall, creating the Space Force, negotiatingAbraham Accordsand not starting any new wars — Trump warned that “the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness.”He added, “A nation is only as strong as its spirit, we are only as dynamic as our pride, we are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history and heroes.”“These are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction, we must never forsake our belief in America.”Contending that “the key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity,” Trump stressed the importance of “focusing on what we have in common, the heritage that we all share.” He referred to “a robust belief in free expression, free speech and open debate” as “the center of our heritage.”“Only if we forget who we are and how we got here could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America,” the president asserted. “Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions. In America, we don’t insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes.”Trump rejected the notion that the U. S. was a “timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree.” Additionally, he described the U. S. as “a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history.”As his speech concluded, Trump remarked that “I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come.”The speech came weeks after the social media app Parler, a platform that many Trump supporters and conservatives had begun using in addition to Twitter, wastaken down by Amazon, Apple and Googlefollowing the Jan 6. riot at the Capitol. These big tech companies accused Parler of allowing those who were at the rally to communicate on its platform. The riot broke out at the Capital as Trump was delivering his speech at theSave America Marchheld at the Ellipse near the White House, over a mile away from the Capitol, that was peacefully attended by hundreds of thousands of his supporters. After his speech, thousands walked to the Capitol where a separate planned rally was to be held that afternoon. That event, however, never took place because the riot had already ensued. Those who died at the Capitol include an unarmed woman who was shot by Capitol police as she attempted to climb through a smashed door pane into the House chamber, a woman who was trampled on by the crowds, and Capitol police officerBrian D. Sicknickwho died on Jan. 7 after he suffered injuries while responding to the breach. Another Capitol police officer who responded to the riotdied by suicide. It’s unknown whether the riot and aftermath contributed to his decision to take his own life. Trump's social media accounts were alsosuspended onFacebook and Twitter indefinitely following the riot, which his critics argued was spurred by hisspeech. Similarly, Twitter also removed statements Trump posted on the @POTUS account.",3,Reliable,0.182625930901793,0.4801284603008742,1387,2,The Christian Post

187,The Day of Reckoning Is at Hand,30.25,20.5,https://spectator.org/the-day-of-reckoning-is-at-hand/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-12,23,"This week before the Senate Appropriations Committee Attorney General William Barr gave testimony that is guaranteed to induce panic throughout the D. C. swamp. Regarding spying on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, he testified as follows:ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN (D., NH):BARR:SHAHEEN:BARR:SHAHEEN:BARR:Coming from Barr, a most measured and serious man, this explosive testimony portends a bleak future for all those FBI, Department of Justice, and intelligence community operatives who used their official positions and enormous — bordering on limitless — governmental powers to undermine the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, and, failing that, to undo the results of the 2016 election. So it is that Barr’s description of the possibility of such political surveillance as a “big deal” is understatement of the first order. As “big deals” go, the stakes couldn’t be any higher. On cue, the Democrats and their wholly owned mainstream media subsidiary have tried to dull the impact of Barr’s testimony. One bedraggled party flak claimed on network television that, since Barr merelyspying had occurred, he had not confirmed that it had really, truly and actually happened. And, resorting to the left’s default position on all things Trump,Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin has called for Barr’s impeachment. These unhinged responses to Barr’s testimony are similar to the type of desperate, fantasy-based gibberish you might expect from a barricaded man facing imminent death at the hands of a SWAT team. Clearly the left knows that, with Barr running the show, trouble is on the way. Although Barr tried to avoid making any definitive statements about the ultimate outcome of the current and future investigations, he did let slip certain tidbits that should cause many sleepless nights throughout what we in the Justice Department used to call the Seat of Government. In that regard, Barr effectively stated that the investigation would be to determine whether the Obama administration had engaged in electronic surveillance of the opposing political party’s presidential campaign and candidate without a proper legal basis. When Barr questioned whether the spying on the Trump campaign was “adequately predicated,” he was obviously talking about the unverified and salacious Steele dossier that was used to obtain FISA warrants to intercept the communications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Such an investigation will necessarily encompass the genesis of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign’s bought-and-paid-for opposition research that constitutes the basis of the dossier, and its knowing, dishonest, and illegal use by James Comey’s FBI and Loretta Lynch’s Department of Justice to deceive the FISA court into authorizing the electronic surveillance of Page and by extension all of the persons in or out of the Trump campaign with whom he communicated. As we now know, in sworn testimony given in the United Kingdom, not even Christopher Steele would vouch for the dossier’s accuracy. And equally damaging, in testimony before Congress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page stated that, contrary to standard FBI procedure in counterintelligence operations, the Trump campaign, purportedly the target of Russian infiltration, had not been warned of the Kremlin’s nefarious efforts because the FBI did not deem the Steele dossier reliable enough to compel such a warning. Page’s testimony sets up an irresistible line of inquiry. If the dossier was not reliable enough to justify a warning to Trump’s campaign about the Kremlin’s plot, how could it even remotely serve as the basis for obtaining FISA warrants to spy on the campaign? By her benighted testimony, Page has framed the issue nicely and invited a full vetting of who, what, where, when, why, and how the dossier was used to dupe the FISA court. Barr also made clear that, beyond the FBI and Justice Department, the investigation will also be looking at “intelligence agencies.” This makes sense given that low level Trump campaign associates such as George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis were approached by foreign operatives with CIA ties in an effort to plant the seeds of the Trump-Russia collusion illusion. As for the FBI, Barr made clear that, while he does not think that there is an “endemic” problem at that agency, he thinks that “there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there, at the upper echelon.”No kidding. And, of course, any investigation into the spying must logically and inexorably lead to the clandestine state-sponsored plot to unwind the 2016 election and remove President Trump from office. In short, the subject matter of any proper investigation will necessarily encompass the first attempted coup d’état in our nation’s history. So here we are. After suffering through Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ comatose stewardship of the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s underhanded machinations, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s protracted rear guard action to protect the anti-Trump deep state conspirators, the day of reckoning is at hand. Attorney General Barr’s testimony portends a long overdue cleansing of the government temple the likes of which has never before happened in this country. This will be history in the making. In ancient times, when nations reached such dramatic inflection points, there were poets, authors, artists, and philosophers who formulated, explained, and preserved for posterity the meaning of events and their impact upon their societies. As I listened to Barr’s astounding testimony, I realized that America was at such an historic milestone. Who, I mused, will step forward to explicate and place these momentous events into their proper context? Does America have a Homer or a Cicero to properly express the gratitude and exaltation of our fellow citizens at the approach of long desired and overdue justice? And then the answer suddenly came to me as my shrinking brain flashed back to the immortal words of that long ago anthem of righteous adolescent retribution,, to wit:(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend’s back)You see him comin’ better cut out on the double(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend’s back)Here’sa link to The Angels’ singingon the Ed Sullivan Show. Their performance is at once entertaining and seemingly prescient. As you watch them sing, imagine that they are making eye contact with James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, Bruce Ohr, Lisa Page, Sally Yates, Glenn Simpson, Christopher Steele, and all the rest of the conspirators. It’s pretty amusing. To a remarkable degree, the lyrics are apt and convey the mood of all of us who have had a belly full of the deep state. As for all of those swamp dwellers who have corrupted and degraded our government to this historical low point, let me paraphrase the best line in the song:. Where at?

Uprisings in Portland have happened nightly since the end of May, in response to police violence against Black Americans, including renewed attention to Jason Washington, a Black resident of the city who was shot and killed by police in 2018. Tensions have escalated in recent weeks as federal officers began appearing at the events. Last week, there were reports of agents in unmarked vans stopping next to protesters, whisking them away in the vehicles without stated justification and without identifying who they were. Those actions prompted outcry from Portland residents, and action from a group of mothers who appeared over the weekend to protect demonstrators by standing between them and officers. Those individuals, known as the Wall of Moms for their way of interlocking arms as a means to protect protesters, were themselves attacked by officers with tear gas during their peaceful demonstrations. On Monday, several social media posts from the group known as “PDX Dad Pod” encouraged its members and others to appear with leaf blowers, even telling users who followed them on social media that it would be a great purchase to support local businesses. Video from confrontations between demonstrators and officers on Monday night into Tuesday morning highlighted how protesters used hockey sticks to scoot tear gas canisters back toward those who fired the m, and the leaf blowers as a means to dissipate clouds of chemicals away from protesters. Smaller leaf blowers were also used to help get chemicals off people’s bodies, video also showed. A creative protester at Riot Ribs uses a leaf blower to get tear gas off other protesters.

When they started snatching people [off] the street, it becomes apparent that the federal government is just … not in check,” Turner said. “It was even tampering down, and the n the feds get involved and lit it up. It’s like throwing gas on a fire.” After word reached the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about the use of leaf blowers against tear gas, an official within the department told Washington Post reporter Nick Miroff that they were frustrated with efforts by protesters to do so, and astonished that they’d return the chemicals back toward the federal officers who initially fired them off. That prompted a number of responses, some comical and some in disbelief, from users on social media over that official’s bewilderment.

A protester who goes by the alias “Doug Smith” and who spoke to Truthout about the events in Portland also responded to that DHS official’s complaints “This dad expresses disdain for Trump using so-called ‘elite’ border patrol agents to brutally assault and abduct peaceful American people in an American city,” the protester said Smith also explained that the use of leaf blowers to counter the use of chemical agents used against demonstrators could be more effective, if even more protesters showed up with them “Honestly, I think you’d need scores of leaf blowers with a phalanx of dads holding their ground under pretty perfect conditions to use them effectively in the dispersal of chemical agents,” he said. “But they are an iconic symbol of a tool dads use to clean up messes.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.1085858585858586,0.4298611111111111,935,1,Truthout

Biden was judged positively for beating Robert Bork’s nomination for the Supreme Court in 1987, and negatively for not helping Anita Hill enough to defeat Clarence Thomas in 1991. On Bork, Totenberg gushed “I have to say, having watched the Senate Judiciary Committee over the years, this is the one time where senators who were on offense actually were prepared. They asked good questions. They knew a lot about Bork. And Joe Biden led the charge.”But then came the Thomas nomination in 1991. LISA DESJARDINS: Biden was still [Senate] Judiciary chairman. The committee learned about charges of sexual harassment against Thomas from his former assistant, Anita Hill. BIDEN: Tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?ANITA HILL: I do. DESJARDINS: Other women came forward to testify but Biden agreed with Republicans to limit the testimony to Hill alone. The televised hearings gripped the nation. HILL: His conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals, and films showing group sex or rape scenes. This, almost 30 years later, is still an unfounded smear. PBS didn't air any footage of Thomas passionately denying Hill's account. They didn't care about who was telling the truth then, and they still don't. It was just about winning. They didn't note tens of other female co-workers of Thomas who spoke and even testified before the Senate in his defense. PBS stuck to the one-sided feminist bubble:DESJARDINS: It all would make a searing impression on some women watching, like Aimee Allisson, the founder of theAIMEE ALLISON: I was an undergraduate and I went to the common room in our dorm to watch the hearings. I saw the way she was being treated by the white men on the Judiciary Committee, both Democrats and Republicans. Joe Biden was among them. DESJARDINS: Biden stressed he would run a fair hearing. BIDEN: I have not made my judgment based on this proceeding, because we have not heard all the evidence. DESJARDINS: But his handling of it and theNINA TOTENBERG: Just as the Republicans were really unprepared for the Bork hearings,Biden thought, my job is to be fair, but his fairness in the end was in many ways unfair to Anita hill. BIDEN: This entire proceeding has ended. DESJARDINS: Biden spoke about the hearings last year. BIDEN (ON ABC) As the committee chairman, I take responsibility that she did not get treated well. I take responsibility for that. PBS never quite explained that taxpayer-subsidized Totenberg was one of the very cooperative vessels for liberal Democrats seeking to destroy the nomination with Hill's never-substantiated charges, just as Totenberg successfully ruined the nomination of Douglas Ginsburg to the Supreme Court in 1987 (over smoking some marijuana) after Bork's nomination failed. This led to swing-vote justice Anthony Kennedy. On PBS, Biden is being criticized.... from the hard left.",1,Questionable,0.0952533143939394,0.4641808712121212,742,1,NewsBusters
191,Tennessee's top vaccine official got glowing reviews before her firing,-1.2,44.8,https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/15/tennessee-top-vaccine-official-got-glowing-reviews-before-being-fired/7980386002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tennessean-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,20,"A top Tennessee health official called last week for the firing of the state's then-vaccination chiefDr. Michelle Fiscus, criticizing her leadership and management skills, newly released documents show. But Fiscus' termination, which touched off a national media firestorm, followed years of glowing performance reviews ultimately approved by the very same official, additional records reveal. Tennessee Department of Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tim Jones sent a memo to Commissioner Dr. Lisa M. Piercey dated Friday, recommending Fiscus' termination, according to the document released Thursday by the state health department. In it, Jones wrote Fiscus should be fired because of a ""failure to maintain good working relationships with members of her team, her lack of effective leadership, her lack of appropriate management and unwillingness to consult with superiors and other internal stakeholders.""Fiscus denies the claims of inappropriate behavior. Her husband said Thursday she did not know of it before the department made the document public.""We're not gonna sit back and allow these falsehoods to be presented when she didn't have any chance to respond,"" Fiscus' husband Brad Fiscus said Thursday. Tennessee top vaccine official received muzzle in mail at office before she was fired'I am afraid for my state'In performance evaluations from the 2019-2020 review period her bosses said she had ""been attentive to her team,"" ""exceeded expectations in managing"" programs and did an ""outstanding job.""""Dr. Fiscus is a trusted and reliable advocate to promote vaccination in Tennessee,"" her manager John Dunn wrote. ""Dr. Fiscus has been a strong leader for the VPD team and has been an integral piece of the COVID pandemic response. Her leadership and efforts in multiple areas have been critical.""Jones signed off on the review process on Feb. 18, 2020, July 7, 2020, and Oct. 12, 2020, according to the records. Tennessee abandons vaccine outreach to minors — not just for COVID-19Fiscus was fired from the role Monday in a move she believes was politically-motivated. She'd worked with the vaccination team since 2016. She said she believes she was made a scapegoat and was terminated to appease state lawmakers angry about the department's efforts to vaccinate teenagers against coronavirus. The state agency has been dialing back vaccination outreach efforts targeting teenagers since June. Adolescent vaccine outreach for all diseases was halted amid pressure from Republican state lawmakers, reports showed this week. The health department released three documents responsive to news media records requests, including Jones' memo, but did not include any performance reviews. Michelle Fiscus released the documents to the Tennessean after she was fired. Reports on Fiscus' performance from the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 review periods are equally positive on her leadership and outreach work. Then-manager Dr. Morgan McDonald praised Fiscus' work on building opportunities for her team and ""consistent leadership,"" as well as calling her an ""excellent manager.""Fiscus could not find a copy of her 2018-2019 review and has requested a copy from the department, Brad Fiscus said Thursday. Focus on Michelle Fiscus, who had until then largely operated in the background of the state health department, grew in mid-June when lawmakers became angry about a letter Fiscus sent to medical providers who administer vaccines. The May letter was in response to questions from vaccine providers related to the state's “Mature Minor Doctrine,"" a legal mechanism by which they are allowed to vaccinate certain minors above the age of 14 without consent from their parents. Fiscus said the language in the letter was provided to her by the health department's attorney, who said at the time it had been ""blessed by the governor's office.""Later, lawmakers expressed concern the letter was unduly encouraging adolescents to get vaccinations without parental consent. The department has couched the steps taken to stop targeting minors with vaccination outreach as the result of a temporary evaluation to ensure it is aimed squarely at parents.""There has been no disruption to the childhood immunization program or access to the COVID-19 vaccine while the department has evaluated annual marketing efforts intended for parents,” Piercey said in an email release on Thursday. “The Tennessee Department of Health not only supports immunizations but continues to provide valuable information and access to parents who are seeking vaccinations for their children. COVID-19 infections triple as Tennessee backs off vaccine outreachWhen Fiscus was given a 10% raise in 2019, a document on file with the state indicates her role is to be the ""department's representative to the legislature"" on the state's immunization program, and to work with outside agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fiscus' performance reviews list specific goals for her to work toward, which last year included a mandate to ""promote the importance of immunizations to public health"" and to ""represent the Tennessee Immunization Program to outside partners and stakeholders.""She received an overall rating of ""outstanding"" across the combined review with no assessment lower than ""advanced.""Jones' letter cited a report Dunn had heard complaints ""of disrespectful treatment and ineffective management"" that both attempted to mediate with Fiscus. He disputed Fiscus' explanation of the source of the information in the May letter, claiming it was not properly run past leadership and departmental legal counsel.""These examples clearly demonstrate that Dr. Fiscus’s performance in this role has led to strained relationships with internal and external stakeholders at multiple levels, and to an ineffective and noncohesive workplace. Her leadership and management of her team does not foster the culture or environment expected at the Tennessee Department of Health,"" Jones wrote. The memo also claims Michelle Fiscus improperly set up a nonprofit for which she requested funding to support immunization programming. Brad Fiscus indicated his wife has received no money herself from the program and set it up under CDC guidelines ""as part of her job.""""Part of the grant from the CDC that they receive is to engage vaccine coalitions in their states or to create a vaccine coalition if there isn't one for the sole purpose of making creating vaccine awareness, dispelling misinformation about the effectiveness or the harm of vaccines, and so on,"" he said. Fiscus' firing and the state's about-face on youth immunization outreach have captured national attention at the same time Tennessee's COVID-19 infection rates tripled in a matter of weeks. Colleagues at the American Academy of Pediatrics spoke out this week in support of Fiscus, a member of the organization's board of directors, in a statement noting she does ""vital work.""“Pediatrician public health officials are medical experts who are trusted by the communities they serve. Dr. Fiscus’s termination is the most recent example of a concerning trend of politicizing public health expertise,"" the organization's president Dr. Lee Savio Beers, wrote. “Actions like this only increase the likelihood that we’ll see other outbreaks of these diseases even as we continue to fight COVID-19.""",3,Reliable,0.0892011634199134,0.3535807291666666,1558,3,Tennessean
192,What’s New in Bernie Sanders’ New Medicare for All Plan,-0.67,45.33,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/10/What-s-New-Bernie-Sanders-New-Medicare-All-Plan,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-10,25,"Saying he wants to end the “international embarrassment” of the U. S. being the only wealthy country that doesn’t provide universal health coverage, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released a new version of his Medicare for All plan Wednesday. The bill’s 14 co-sponsors include Sanders’ fellow presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The revamped health care proposal is similar to the plan Sanders released in 2017, though it adds a long-term care benefit for Americans with disabilities. Overall, the bill would transform the $3.5 trillion health U. S. care system by replacing private health insurance with a single-payer system that covers primary and preventive care, hospital stays, mental health, dental and vision services, and prescription drugs for all Americans.“It is not a radical idea to say that in the United States, every American who goes to a doctor should be able to afford the prescription drug he or she needs,” Sanders said. “If every major country on earth can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita than we do, it is absurd for anyone to suggest that the United States of America cannot do the same.”Vox’s Sarah KliffsaidSanders’ plan “includes an exceptionally generous benefit package” compared the country’s peers, including Canada, which does not cover vision, dental or prescription drugs. Here are some key features of Sanders’ plan:Sanders left the big question – how to pay for his proposal – largely unanswered, although he did provide a list of suggestions, including a 4% tax on employees (exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four), a 7.5% tax on employers (exempting the first $2 million in payroll) and a new tax on “extreme wealth.”The Trump campaign criticized the plan as a “government takeover of health care” and said that “free market policies” would be a better alternative. “So-called ‘Medicare for All’ means private insurance for none, kicking 180 million Americans off of their current plans,” said Kayleigh McEnany, spokeswoman for Trump’s re-election campaign. “‘Medicare for all’ is a euphemism for government takeover of healthcare, and it would increase wait times, eliminate choice, and raise taxes.”The bottom line:The 2020 presidential election could turn on the question of health care, and with another iteration of his Medicare-for-All plan, Sanders has underscored his position as the leading progressive in the race for the Democratic nomination. The details of the plan may matter less than the simple fact that the two main U. S. political parties will likely offer voters a clear alternative on this defining issue.",3,Reliable,0.09757371007371,0.4211594711594711,618,3,Fiscal Times
193,‘The Masked Singer’ Reveals the Identity of the Russian Dolls: Here’s the Band Under the Masks,0.0,42.0,https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/the-masked-singer-reveal-season-5-episode-11-recap-russian-dolls-1234971853/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-12,21,"Hansonhas been mmm-bop’ed off “The Masked Singer.” The pop star brothers were unmasked on Wednesday’s episode as the Russian Dolls. The trio became the first group to compete on the show; last season, the couple Clint Black and Lisa Hartman performed as a duo under the Snow Owls costume. But the Hanson brothers told Variety they were attracted to the idea of pulling off another “Masked Singer” first. Early on, the show’s panelists couldn’t even figure out how many performers were on stage.“It was very clear from the beginning they loved the idea of playing the game,” Zac Hanson said. “It was, ‘Hey, let’s play with this idea of how many people are on stage.’ Whenever we could, we tried to keep playing that game. Because we know, part of the show is the spectacle of the costumes in the game of guessing. And the other part is the quality of the music and the performances. And so you want to do both as much as you can. So there were cases where there were two dolls on stage but we were all three still there, we would put two people in the big doll, which was very claustrophobic.”Added Isaac Hanson: “We may be brothers but we don’t really need to be brothers that know each other’s smell.”Among panelists, Nicole Scherzinger got it right for a second week in a row with Hanson, which Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg also guessed correctly. Ken Jeong went with a different family: the Jonas Brothers. Robin Thicke chose Sugarland. Guest panelistRob Rigglehopped on the Hanson train as well, after initially guessing Devo. Adding to the guessing game: Sometimes four Russian Dolls would be on stage. “There are certain kind of rules they’re trying to play by,” Zac Hanson said. “You don’t really want to have extra performers that are part of the actual contestant outside of the dancers and so we try to use the dancers to move the dolls, when they were off camera. There were a couple of cases where the dolls were moved on camera, or the large doll was stationary, and you didn’t really know, is there somebody in there? That was just trying to make the game more fun. At one point, there was going to be a robotically controlled fifth doll, but it apparently broke the rules. It was too much.”Isaac Hanson said it was difficult being in the Russian Dolls, but he was thankful he didn’t have to learn any choreography: “I would say the most difficult thing about it was just being able to see where you’re going,” he said. “Your actual range of motion with regard to your feet and stuff is actually pretty limited because of the way that costume was. So in some sense, that actually played to my lack of coordination well. I wouldn’t have wanted to be asked to do much more than we did because I kept screwing up the simple things that we were doing. But the hardest part was not getting disoriented.”Previous episodes had the panelists guessing Boyz II Men, Vanessa Hudgens, Darren Criss, Matthew Morrison/Kevin McHale/other “Glee” stars, Gwen Stefani and No Doubt guitarist Tom Dumont, Sugarland, Jacksons, Pentatonix, the Jonas Brothers, 98 Degrees, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nickelback. But the Internet figured out it was Hanson really fast.“It’s kind of goes both ways,” Zac Hanson said. “On the one hand you’re proud of being able to trick people into thinking you’re somebody else. And the other hand if you have three people up there singing and harmonizing and at some point pretty quick, they don’t compare you to yourself, you’re like, ‘Hey, haven’t you thought of Hanson?!’ I think it was cool to have comparisons to really great artists from the Jacksons to Boyz II Men. There’s all kinds of different great singers that they threw out there, But I will say this, I was not expecting the public to as clearly just immediately proclaim in the chatter online you can see like episode one, they were like, ‘this is Hanson.’”Hanson performed “I’m Still Standing” by Elton John for their final song; before that, they sang “Man in the Mirror,” by Michael Jackson; “Wonder,” by Shawn Mendes; “Want to Want Me,” by Jason Derulo; “24K Magic,” by Bruno Mars; and “Shallow,” by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. And who knows, the group said they may add some of those tracks to their tour once they hit the road again.“’Man in the Mirror’ is a song we love and to get to do Michael Jackson, it was a really big deal,” Zac Hanson said. “That was great because it felt like an opportunity to start strong with something that is just kind of a timeless song that we love singing. ‘24K Magic’ was one where we were really excited to do it but we definitely questioned whether we felt like we could execute it well.”Taylor Hanson said the group also enjoyed “stretching different muscles as arrangers. We could throw to one person singing one part, and do lead switching and also bring something different to the show. They hadn’t had harmony, or harmony within a group because there had never been more than two people. So we just felt like that combination of elements, really did appeal to the opportunity that also presented itself by us not being in a regular time where oftentimes we’d be on tour, and go from city to city.”Hanson should have been on tour in Australia right now, but the pandemic has kept them at home in Oklahoma. Instead, they’re now releasing new music — a song every month — that will eventually be compiled into a new album, “Against the World.” The group notes that they’re also about to celebrate their 30th anniversary performing together.“All of these songs on ‘Against the World,’ they do talk about hard issues and there’s a hopeful quality to it, but about conflict and challenges, and overcoming yourself,” Zac Hanson said. “And I think it’s a great project to let people look at each song for a little longer to linger on each story, because they do have something to say.”Hanson as the Russian Dolls joined previously unmasked celebrities Tyrese Gibson (Robopine), Bobby Brown (Crab), Tamera Mowry (Seashell), Mark McGrath (Orca), Nick Cannon (Bulldog), Logan Paul (Grandpa Monster), Danny Trejo (as Raccoon), Caitlyn Jenner (as Phoenix) and Kermit the Frog (as Snail). The Season 5 contestants boast a combined 26 Grammy nominations, nine multi-platinum singles, four Academy Award nominations, three Super Bowl appearances, six gold medals and two world records. New this season is the masked celebrity “Cluedle-Doo,” who has been offering additional hints about each contestant. Scherzinger guessed it might be frequent guest panelist Joel McHale. The show’s panelists are also once competing for a “Golden Ear” trophy based on their first impressions of each masked performer (which McCarthy won last time). Jeong and McCarthy Wahlberg each had two points heading into this episode. Scherzinger’s initial guess was the entire cast of “Glee.” Thicke went with the Black Eyed Peas (specifically, Will.i.am and Fergie). McCarthy Wahlberg named Boyz II Men. Jeong’s first impression was Donny and Marie Osmond. No one picked up another point.

194,Whitmer: Indoor and outdoor sports allowed; Michigan gyms can reopen,0.0,49.0,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/09/03/whitmer-indoor-outdoor-sports-allowed-while-michigan-gyms-can-reopen/5686314002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"— Gyms can reopen at limited capacity and organized sports can resume in Michigan under new executive orders that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer released Thursday, but one directive clashed with a recommendation by the state Department of Health and Human Services. The long-awaited orders, Nos. 175 and 176, allow for organized sports with limitations on mask use and crowd size, despite guidance from Whitmer's health department recommending against contact sports, including football, soccer and wrestling. They came on the same daythe governor extended through Oct. 1 the state of emergency, which is what gives her the ability to make unilateral actions to combat the virus, such as closing businesses or penalizing those who don't wear masks. The order allowing for contact sports in spite of the health department's recommendation concerned at least one epidemiologist, who opined it would almost surely lead to further virus spread. The orders would allow Michigan gyms and pools to reopen at 25% capacity starting Wednesday with strict protocols in place, including mask use at all times and distancing of 6 feet between workout stations and individuals participating in classes. Gym patrons must provide their name and phone number, or they will be denied entry. Saunas and hot tubs must remain closed. Indoor pools will be capped at 25% capacity, while outdoor pools remain capped at 50%.“I urge everyone who plans to hit the gym after these orders go into effect to take these precautions seriously and do everything in their power to protect themselves and their families,"" Whitmer said in a Thursday statement. ""Be smart, and stay safe.”Indoor organized sports also can resume, but guests will be limited to two per athlete. Outdoor organized sports would be limited to up to 100 guests. Athletes will be required to wear masks, except when swimming, and should maintain 6 feet of distance when ""compatible,"" according to Whitmer's order. Bowling and ice rinks may only open for organized sports, according to the order. The executive orders were followed closely by anannouncement from the Michigan High School Athletic Associationthat reinstated the fall football season after it had been postponed to the spring. Games can begin Sept. 18, the league said. The association also noted competitions could start immediately for boys soccer and on Wednesday for girls swimming, diving and volleyball. There is no mention in the orders of the reopening of movie theaters or banquet facilities in lower Michigan, where they have been shuttered since March. The state Department of Health and Human Services rules that were issued in tandem with the orders recommend against contact sports such as football, wrestling or soccer at schools and universities. But the department said the guidance could be adjusted with updated epidemiological data. The health department's guidance recommends frequent hand-washing, proper disinfecting of facilities or shared equipment, avoidance of shared items such as towels or water bottles, avoidance of post-game high fives or handshakes, and limitations on carpools. There have been at least 30 outbreak investigations in recent weeks linked to sports teams, clubs and gyms, according to the state health department. The outbreaks can easily spread beyond the team and to the community.“Individuals can now choose whether or not to play organized sports, and if they do choose to play, this order requires strict safety measures to reduce risk,” Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said Thursday. ""Based on current data, contact sports create a high risk of COVID-19 transmission and MDHHS strongly recommends against participating in them at this time.""The orders do not detail exceptions for ancillary activities such as marching band or cheerleading, but noted the ""elevated risk"" that accompanies “shouting, singing or breathing forcefully.”So long as gyms adhere to the restrictions in Whitmer's order, the activity should be ""part of the universe"" of openings that can occur with controlled risk, said Nigel Paneth, a professor at Michigan State University's Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and Pediatrics and Human Development. But Paneth was less confident about the order allowing organized sports, calling it a ""mistake"" that has been proven to lead to virus transmission among athletes in contact sports.""I'm with the health department,"" said Paneth, referring to the department's recommendation against high school sports. ""These kind of group activities just are not working.""Even mask use is no guarantee that the virus wouldn't spread among athletes, he said.""Helmets fall off. Shoulder pads fall off. You think a mask is going to stay on?” Paneth said. ""I think it’s a step too far because it really is going to almost surely promote the spread of infections.""Whitmer's administration has been hinting at the reopening of gyms and other shuttered businesses for about three weeks as calls to reopen the facilities have mounted. Most businesses in Michigan closed abruptly March 23 when Whitmer issued her Stay Home, Stay Safe order in an attempt to control the spread of the virus. She gradually loosened the restrictions, allowing 17 northern Michigan counties and the Upper Peninsula to reopen restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters in May. She re-tightened bar restrictions there in July. Lower Michigan restaurants reopened in June. Last month, Whitmer allowed Detroit's three casinos to reopen at 15% capacity. The Michigan Fitness Club Association said Thursday it appreciated the reopening and committed to the ""health and safety"" of members and the public.""We are well-prepared to ensure a safe, clean environment and we are excited to offer Michiganders the opportunity to resume their exercise routines,"" the group said. ""We look forward to working with Gov. Whitmer and her administration to help build a healthy Michigan.”For others, the executive orders were lacking key permissions that struggling, still-closed businesses sought. The ongoing closure of banquet halls will decimate facilities across the state, said Alex Lozovoj, general manager of the Italian American Cultural Society in Clinton Township. Lozovoj has canceled weddings and events, run through a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan and is about to start construction on a 3,000-square-foot outdoor platform to hold events.""We have no end in sight on this,"" Lozovoj said. ""We’re crying, we’re begging the government to open us back up because we’ve already lost all our peak time.""If this doesn’t end soon, I can’t imagine any of the banquet halls in the state being able to survive.”For Mike Lucente, owner of Harbor Lanes Bowling Center in St. Clair Shores, the news that he can reopen is well-timed.“This is our normal start-up time either before or after Labor Day,” he said. “I just had a league meeting (Wednesday) night. … They are ready to go. They want to bowl.”Lucente said that league play makes up 75% of his business. He missed the summer league, which would have run for about 14 weeks. Lucente has had concerns about losing business due to the closure.“I might lose these people forever,” he said. “Once they find other things to do, you can’t get them back.”Ken Welch, owner of Pointe Fitness and Training Center in Harper Woods, said Thursday he’s relieved he will be able to reopen his gym. The decision is long overdue, he said.“If you design it in a more structured way to limit the crowd, we could have been doing this,” Welch said. The fitness center owner now needs to decide which approaches he’ll take to limit capacity, which could include an appointment-based system, shortened hours and limited session times.“We have a conscientiousness membership that’s very aware of all of these things,” Welch said. “It’s not going to be a hard sell.”Although Pointe Fitness and Training Center has lost clients, Welch said he has retained a core group of members he expects to return.“Financially, I think we’re going to be OK,” Welch said. “We did get a little bit of government money. I’m not going to go into detail, but that’s helped us out to kind of weather this. All small gyms have that kind of thing. If you’re not working another job or didn’t get your loans from the government, you’re hurting.”Kathy Chester, owner of Disrupt Fitness Gym in Berkley, said she’s excited to work out with her clients.“Our kids, our clients need to be physically moving for their mental well-being and everything,” she said. “I think it’s so important.”Chester said she has concerns about the use of masks indoors. She’s been doing cardio workouts outside in the park. Some participants have worn masks, some haven’t.“That’s incredibly difficult to be working out in masks,” she said. “And so I want them to be able to do that in a place where they can get enough airflow and not get so overwhelmed. I can’t imagine running on a treadmill.”She recommends clients purchase high-quality athletic masks. There likely will be more of a focus on personal training instead of fitness classes, Chester said.“I don’t think clients are going to be able to go into a class…,” she said. “I think that will nerve them up.”",3,Reliable,0.0993275686898136,0.4370693818653002,2030,3,Detroit News
195,Dallas County adds 20 COVID-19 deaths; 183 deaths in 7 days shatters record set only a week ago,0.0,48.0,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2021/01/30/texas-reports-19569-more-covid-19-cases-332-deaths-tarrant-county-adds-1862-cases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-30,25,"Updated 6:15 p.m.:Revised to include data from Dallas County. Dallas County on Saturday reported 1,407 new coronavirus cases and 20 more deaths from COVID-19. This marked the deadliest week of the pandemic so far, with 183 deaths, County Judge Clay Jenkins said. That shatters the previous high of 138 set only the week before. The latest victims — mostly in their 60s or older — included 10 people from Dallas, two each from Farmers Branch, Garland and Irving, and one each from Cedar Hill, DeSoto, Duncanville and Richardson. Nearly all had been hospitalized, and all but one had underlying health conditions. Get the latest coronavirus and public health updates. Jenkins said while COVID-19 hospitalizations have fallen slightly over the last few weeks, county health officials are concerned about themost recent projections from UT Southwestern. Their forecast model predicts between 910 and 1,390 people will be hospitalized in Dallas County by Feb. 9. That’s lower than past projections but will still be an “immense strain” on health care systems, the county said in a news release. Of the new cases reported Saturday, 1,170 were confirmed and 237 were probable. The county has reported 256,900 cases overall, including 226,452 confirmed and 30,448 probable. The death toll is 2,179. Health officials use hospitalizations, intensive-care admissions and emergency room visits as key metrics to track the real-time impact of COVID-19 in the county. In the 24-hour period that ended Friday, 989 COVID-19 patients were in acute care in hospitals in the county. During the same period, 512 ER visits were for symptoms of the disease. According to the state’s data, 136,028 people in Dallas County have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 30,650 are fully vaccinated. Across the state, 19,569 more COVID-19 cases were reported Saturday, including 18,109 new cases and 1,460 older cases that were recently reported by labs. The state also reported 332 COVID-19 deaths, raising its toll to 36,320. Of the new cases, 14,969 were confirmed and 3,140 were probable. Of the older cases, 1,068 were confirmed and 392 were probable. The state has now reported 2,349,262 cases overall, including 2,049,055 confirmed and 300,207 probable. (The state also removed 335 cases from the total confirmed cases due to a data audit in Hays County.)There are 11,473 COVID-19 patients in Texas hospitals, including 3,173 in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. On Friday, 19% of patients in the hospital region covering the Dallas-Fort Worth area were COVID-19 patients — above the 15% threshold the state has used to define high hospitalizations. The seven-day average positivity rate statewide for molecular tests, based on the date of test specimen collection, was 14.77% as of Friday. For antigen tests, the positivity rate for the same period was 7.93%. A molecular test is considered more accurate and is sometimes also called a PCR test; an antigen test is also called a rapid test. Gov. Greg Abbott has said a positivity rate above 10% is cause for concern. Texas is set to receive a significantly higher number of COVID-19 vaccines in the coming week, the state health departmentsaid. Providers will receive 520,425 first doses of the vaccine and 188,225 second doses for people vaccinated a few weeks ago. The additional doses are largely due to a 30% increase in the number of Moderna vaccines being provided by the federal government, the state said. The increase is also due to an additional 126,750 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which were initially set aside for the federalPharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, being returned to the state. The program overestimated how many doses it would need, the state health department said. The state said it is working with providers to ensure they have enough second doses for patients vaccinated a few weeks ago. People should be able to return to the provider that gave them their first dose, the state said. According to the state’s data, 1,842,287 people in Texas have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 448,649 are fully vaccinated. Tarrant County reported 1,862 coronavirus cases and 16 deaths Saturday. The latest victims — mostly in their 60s or older — included seven people from Fort Worth, two from North Richland Hills and one each from Arlington, Euless, Haltom City, Hurst, Mansfield, Saginaw and Watauga. All had underlying health conditions, the county said. Of the new cases, 1,560 were confirmed and 302 were probable. The county has now reported 216,910 cases overall, including 187,038 confirmed and 29,872 probable. The death toll is 2,176. According to the county, 1,177 people were hospitalized with the virus as of Friday. According to the state, 104,775 people in Tarrant County have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 17,729 are fully vaccinated. The state added 505 coronavirus cases and seven deaths to Collin County’s totals Saturday. No details about the latest victims were available. Of the new cases, 331 were confirmed and 174 were probable. The county has reported 72,370 cases total, including 61,854 confirmed and 10,516 probable. The death toll is 573. According to the county, 496 people are hospitalized with the virus. According to the state, 51,046 people in Collin County have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 13,339 are fully vaccinated. Denton County reported 306 coronavirus cases and no deaths Saturday. The county has reported 53,554 cases overall, including 42,349 confirmed and 11,205 probable. The death toll is 318. According to the county, 171 people are hospitalized with the virus. According to the state, 28,383 people in Denton County have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 7,953 are fully vaccinated.

196,Federalizing Elections: 2020 on Steroids?,26.67,26.33,https://www.libertynation.com/federalizing-elections-2020-on-steroids/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-08,18,"With the latest entry in his record-shattering succession of executive orders, Joe Biden has attempted to federalize elections, facilitating the permanent implementation of the type of changes to election law that are widely believed to have produced his own victory in the 2020 presidential election. And to affirm his position further, he came out in support of abillthat has passed the House,expandingvoter registration even further than in 2020, when it was reported that an almost inconceivable total of 159 million votes were cast. This full-court press designed to have our betters in Washington overrule the states’ constitutional prerogative to decide election law for themselves leads us to a serious question: to what degree does our constitutional republic remain intact? Have we crossed some sort of rubicon? For many, the takedown of Donald Trumpis living proof we have inched ever closer to that territory which is neither democracy nor tyranny, but a gray area somewhere in between. And the worst part is that such middle ground actually draws upon the worst elements of both systems. It’s called oligarchy, and if you’re not familiar with the term, now would be a good time to get up to speed. This form of governance dates back more than 2,500 years to the Greekcity-statesofSpartaandAthens, ruled by an elite group of educated aristocrats. It means that control of a country, organization, or institution rests in the hands of a small group of people. It is governance by the few, but it is the type of elite conduct which can touch – and ultimately control – any form of government, from democracies to dictatorships. The privileged class is generally known for characteristics such as wealth, family, nobility, corporate interests, religion, politics, or military power. No country has ever declared itself an oligarchy, for many reasons. First, it is essentially a term of art, not an invented form of governance. Second, much like the term dictatorship, it is a pejorative, one which the oligarchs themselves would fervently deny. They generally distinguish themselves from tyrants by citing free elections and free enterprise. But elections in oligarchies are never actually free because competing candidates are subject to unrelenting vilification by state-controlled media and even political persecution at the whim of – you guessed it – the oligarchs. And enterprise is only free for the chosen – and tightly connected – beneficiaries of government largesse. Iran, Saudi Arabia, andChinaare widely viewed as oligarchies. But Exhibit A would be Russia and Vladimir Putin, who has accentuated his country’s centuries-long oligarchical heritage by jailing his political enemy, Alexei Navalny, for “disturbing public order” and “leading unsanctioned protests.”But halfway across the world, we have borne witness to a deep state tearing apart, limb from limb, a man who delivered stunning results for the United States before a plague hit the land. What president would not in any other circumstance glide to re-election on the strength of full employment, a booming economy, energy independence, multiple Middle East peace accords, and trade deals, among other things? Well, it would be one who dared take the most aggressive steps ever taken to neutralize the deep state from whence these oligarch wannabes draw their strength. After all, civil servants, the permanent bureaucrats who fill the halls of official Washington, cannot be fired except under extraordinary circumstances. They tend to view every president as a mere transient, someone they will outlive in the Swamp. But in Trump, their outspoken – and often hidden – resolve in protecting their cratering credibility was taken to a whole new level – that of a resistance movement. Consider also the continuing inability of tens of millions of people to make sense of an election that defied logic. It pitted a man who created a movement and stirred legendary enthusiasm in delivering everything he promised and more in an audacious reform agenda versus an aging and enfeebled career politician with virtually nothing to show for his almost five decades in the deep state Swamp. Anyone dropped in from Mars, examining, would conclude that the outcome should be obvious. So, absent the unceasing depiction of Donald Trump as Hitler redux, an evil and irredeemable white supremacist – by a media transparently doing the bidding of the Trump-deranged self-appointed oligarchs – would we have gotten the result the martian would fully expect? Instead, a small group of inside-the-beltway power brokers, joining forces with an activist media and an increasingly oligarchical big tech and corporate empire, succeeded in slaying the dragon that threatened them and placed a compliant yes-man in the Oval Office. One of the popular theorems about oligarchy among scholars is the so-called “iron law of oligarchy,” which asserts that all political systems – from democracy to despotism – eventually evolve into oligarchies. With the events we have witnessed over these last four years, it certainly begs the question of whether America has indeed crossed that rubicon.~.",1,Questionable,0.0420470230252838,0.4632128740824392,1094,0,Liberty Nation

The justices ruled 8-1 that an appeals court improperly let the lawsuit against the food companies go forward. The companies had been sued by a group of six adult citizens of Mali who claimed they were taken from their country as children and forced to work on cocoa farms in neighboring Ivory Coast.""Although respondents' injuries occurred entirely overseas, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents could sue in federal court because the defendant corporations allegedly made 'major operational decisions' in the United States. The Ninth Circuit erred by allowing this suit to proceed,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a majority opinion for the court. The case had been twice dismissed at an early stage before being revived by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. When the case was argued in December, then-President Donald Trump's administration backed Nestle and Cargill. The Malian citizens had argued that Minneapolis-based Cargill and the American arm of Switzerland-based Nestle ""aided and abetted"" their slavery as children by, among other things, buying cocoa beans from farms that used child labor. The group sued, seeking to bring a class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves, as well as who they say are thousands of other former child slaves. Nestle and Cargill have maintained throughout the case that they have done nothing wrong and that they have taken steps to combat child slavery. In statements following the ruling both Nestle and Cargill repeated that they remain committed to working to combat child labor in the cocoa industry. The case involves a law enacted by the very first Congress in 1789, the Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreign citizens to sue in U. S. courts for human rights abuses. But Thomas said this case wasn't properly in U. S. courts.""Nearly all the conduct that they say aided and abetted forced labor — providing training, fertilizer, tools, and cash to overseas farms — occurred in Ivory Coast. ... But allegations of general corporate activity — like decisionmaking — cannot alone establish domestic application of the ATS,"" he wrote. Attorney Paul Hoffman, who argued the case for the Malian citizens at the high court, said in a statement that he was ""disappointed that the Court has delayed our clients' long quest for justice."" But he said it was not the end of the case. He said intends to ask a lower court to be allowed to amend the group's lawsuit and allege that Cargill and Nestle ""controlled the system of forced labor from the United States.""The high court in recent years has limited the use of the Alien Tort Statute. In 2018, the court ruled that foreign businesses cannot be sued under the law. In that case, the court rejected an attempt by Israeli victims of attacks in the West Bank and Gaza to use U. S. courts to sue Jordan-based Arab Bank, which they said helped finance the attacks. The case is Nestle USA v. Doe I, 19-416, and Cargill Inc. v.

But let us not forget to name what happened yesterday. There was a terrorist attack by an insurgent white supremacist anti-American sect, ordered by Donald Trump, an insane autocrat trying to seize power, mostly so he can avoid prison. That's it. How we talk about it matters. And it also matters that we name those who supported this act, this attempted overthrow of American democracy, by baselessly objecting to the electoral vote counts in states that failed to support their Dear Leader, attempting to disenfranchise millions of Americans they don't considerAmericans — Black voters, brown voters, LGBTQ voters, white voters they consider race traitors because they don't vote for white supremacy. So let us name them, may their actions follow them around for the rest of their seditious piece of shit lives. At the top of the heap of people whose names shall live in infamy are GOP SenatorsandTed Cruz, who led the coup in the Senate to overturn the will of the people. After the fires started burning, Ted Cruz very poorlypaid lip serviceto trying to cool things down, after he had helped commit the arson. Hawley could hardly be bothered to do that.

In the Senate, it was only those assholes. In the House, though? Holy shit. They objected to Arizona and somehowvoted to sustain the objection to Pennsylvania in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, as if yesterday's terrorism put a spring in their step, as if the blood in the hallways of the Capitol gave them sustenance. Again, all of this was. And in the House it wasn't just Arizona and Pennsylvania either. Reps like Louie Gohmert stood up to object to other states too, even though the GOP senators who had originally planned to support those challengeshad put down their gunsand agreed to end the standoff peacefully. (It was particularly pleasing to watch Vice President Mike Pence glare at Gohmert, who just got finishedunsuccessfully suing Penceto make him overturn the election, and tell him his objection to the electors in Wisconsin ""MAY NOT BE ENTERTAINED,"" since he couldn't get even the Senate's dumbest Republican Ron Johnson to sign his treason permission slip anymore.)Overall, 139 House GOP members voted to object to the electors from Arizona and/or Pennsylvania. These are their names. They should not be allowed around your children, you should kick them out of your chicken restaurant, and they should always and forevermore be referred to as seditious traitors to democracy in the United States of America.

200,There’s One Far-Right Movement That Hates the Kremlin,-2.0,47.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/17/theres-one-far-right-movement-that-hates-the-kremlin-azov-ukraine-biletsky-nouvelle-droite-venner/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,25,"KIEV, Ukraine—If you’ve ever been to Paris, you’ve probably snapped a photo of the very spot that’s a symbol for a far-right movement more than 1,000 miles away. KIEV, Ukraine—If you’ve ever been to Paris, you’ve probably snapped a photo of the very spot that’s a symbol for a far-right movement more than 1,000 miles away. It’s here along the banks of the Seine, at Notre Dame Cathedral, that an aging French man decided to make what he called a “sacrifice” a few years ago. Before Tuesday’s devastating fire it might have been the most recent time the centuries-old cathedral made such shocking news. On May 21, 2013, 78-year-old Dominique Venner, a man known in France as a “nationalist extremist” and a “militant populist with a violent past,” walked into the 12th-century cathedral, stood next to the altar, pulled out a revolver, and shot himself. Outside of France, few knew Venner’s name. But right-wing nationalists in Ukraine certainly did. The far-right Azov movement was founded in 2014 to help defend Ukraine against invasion by Russian-led proxy forces. It began by recapturing the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, near the annexed Crimean Peninsula, from Russian proxies. (Russia has since partiallyblockaded the Kerch Strait, harassing Ukrainian vessels and nearly cutting off the Azov coast from the rest of Ukraine.)The Azov movement’s early victories also earned it a reputation as a place where far-right extremists and self-confessed neo-Nazis could make themselves at home. In more recent months, it has become better known for its street battles against incumbent President Petro Poroshenko, injuring almost two dozen police officers in one violentprotestagainst alleged corruption in Poroshenko’s inner circle. Members of the Azov movement have made Venner a martyr. On the anniversary of his death in 2015, Azov members laid flowers and lit a candle for him in front of the French Embassy in Kiev. They give lectures on his works, post quotes from him on social media, and even sell bookmarks with his face and name emblazoned on them. Venner is one of several icons of France’s Nouvelle Droite (New Right) who, beginning in the late 1960s, started laying out a new strategy for the postwar far-right. And while the Azov movement is a relatively new player on the global far-right scene, the key to understanding it has its roots nowhere near Ukraine. Venner was a writer and historian known for his works on themes popular with the far-right in France and beyond, from conspiracies to destroy Europe with Muslim migration to apologetics for France’s Nazi-collaborating Vichy regime. In a note found on his body, he lamented what he called “the crime of the replacement of our people” by Muslim immigrants. It’s a clear nod to the so-called “great replacement” theory promoted by fellow Frenchman Renaud Camus, a theory thatcontinues to inspireright-wing extremists—including the Christchurch terrorist, who plagiarized the title of one of Camus’s books for the title of his rambling manifesto. Venner’s final blog post before his death was an anti-LGBT rant: France was, at the time, in the midst of a heated debate over same-sex marriage. But Venner made a far-right name for himself decades before. In 1962, he was released after spending 18 months in jail for being part of the Organisation Armée Secrète (OAS). A right-wing terrorist group that was formed to try to prevent Algerian independence, the OAS killed an estimated 2,000 people in just over a year and tried to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle several times. Nostalgia for the lost Algerian cause—the failed effort to keep Algeria a part of France—became a core cause of the French far-right. Former OAS members, including Jean-Marie Le Pen, were instrumental in setting up the far-right National Front, the party now called the National Rally, and led by Le Pen’s daughter, Marine Le Pen. That year Venner wrote, a work that the Mexico-based political scientist Tamir Bar-On, the author of two books on the French New Right, calls a far-right version of Vladimir Lenin’s “What Is to Be Done?”This book helped pave the way for what would become known as the Nouvelle Droite in the late 1960s. Alongside figures such as Alain de Benoist and the late Guillaume Faye, Venner and others at GRECE (“Research and Study Group for European Civilization,” spelling out the French word for Greece) began laying the groundwork for how more palatable far-right movements could gain currency in the wake of Nazism. The 1930s-era politics of unabashed racism, unguarded language, and unsubtle advocacy of imperialism and authoritarianism were, to say the least, poisoned by the legacy of World War II and French colonial wars in then-French Indochina and Algeria. Authors such as Venner called for a new approach; far-right nationalists needed to clean up their image and cast aside violence, overt racism, extreme rhetoric, and even electoral politicsto some extent and focus more on what Bar-Oncalls“the long route through the wilderness.”The goal for this new far-right was to shape attitudes and beliefs over a much longer period of time and spend less time fretting about getting votes and achieving immediate political power. “The approach,” Bar-On told Foreign Policy, “was basically, ‘We have to challenge the left by capturing the laboratories of thought.’”With its roots in a still-smoldering war, this might not sound like familiar territory for Ukraine’s Azov movement. It was originally formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 as a response to Vladimir Putin’s proxy invasion of eastern Ukraine while Ukraine’s army itself was a shambles. It didn’t take long for the Azov Battalion to become known for having some of the fiercest fighters on the Ukrainian side—but it also quickly became known for its embrace of self-confessed neo-Nazis into its ranks. While most observers tend to associate anyone far-right with pro-Kremlin sympathies, there was and continues to be a core of far-right extremists and outright neo-Nazis who have no time for Putin. According to Azov, Russia is a multicultural, multiethnic land, one filled with migrants and Muslim minorities and led by a man with no actual interest in preserving what one Azov ideologist euphemistically called “ethnocultural values.”Five years later, the battalion itself is now an official part of Ukraine’s National Guard. Azov formed a political party, the National Corps, in 2016; it’s headed by Andriy Biletsky, who was once the leader of the neo-Nazi “Patriot of Ukraine” organization. Last year, Azov introduced the National Militia, a paramilitary group whose existence continues to worry a number of human rights groups, given their propensity for street violence and vigilantism. With a claimed 10,000 members, Azov looks set to be a fixture on the Ukrainian political scene for a while yet. The Azov movement is not seeking to gain power through elections or realistically wrest territory back from Russian control. It is doing something far more subtle. There’s a word for what the Azov movement is doing, a common one in the parlance of the French New Right: metapolitics—or, inBar-On’s words, “the capture of cultural power [as] the precondition for the capture of political power.” In less academic phrasing: The movement focuses on playing a longer-term game and worries less about poll numbers and popular support and more about whether the mainstream is shifting closer and closer to its turf. The French New Right built the idea of metapolitics, ironically, on foundations laid by a left-wing icon—the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. He argued that controlling culture was the key to controlling power and that those who controlled the institutions of thought effectively controlled society. Azov’s leaders are certainly familiar with the term “metapolitics.” The movement’s international secretary and one of its chief ideologues, Olena Semenyaka, peppers her speech and writings online with references to it. Speaking toFPin Kiev, Semenyaka was transparent about the French New Right’s influence on Azov’s work and the idea of metapolitics. Azov’s strategy, Semenyaka said, is to build “cultural hegemony”—a term of Gramsci’s—“or cultural revolution as a means of gaining political hegemony.”The goal, according to Semenyaka, is to pull Ukrainian society closer to Azov’s side of the political divide. “We want to bridge this gap between nationalism and the rest of society,” she said. And even as the National Corps barely registers in polls—Biletsky announced in January that he wasn’t going to take part in March’s first-round presidential elections—the movement is following a decades-old script laid out in France. Semenyaka brags about everything the Azov movement does, from mixed martial arts sessions and weapons trainings with military equipment to hosting a network of youth camps and support groups for veterans of the ongoing war with Russian-backed forces in the country’s east. It’s part of what Semenyaka calls an effort to neutralize resistance to far-right ideas in Ukrainian society. Ukrainians support their initiatives without knowing they’re linked to the Azov movement, she said, and are happy to support the movement when its sponsorship or involvement is revealed. It doesn’t hurt that it’s easier to garner support for a movement when it’s still associated in much of the public mind with a heroic defense of the country against foreign invaders. “They don’t associate it with some far-right radicals who do some violence in the streets,” she said. Instead, the hope is that they will think, “‘These guys are OK. They’re doing something for us. The government doesn’t have such programs for us—why wouldn’t we support them?’” and end up backing the movement. “We just want to overcome this demonized image,” she added. That demonized image is one thing that Azov doesn’t want people to notice. Despite Semenyaka’s protestations toFPthat the movement was far from neo-Nazi-friendly, it doesn’t take much scratching of the surface to find the darker paint beneath. Azov has hosted neo-Nazi concerts replete with swastikas, tried torecruitforeign far-right extremists, openly assaulted feminist, LGBT, and leftist activists, and cleared a Roma camp with hammers and axes. Azov’s less cunning edges aren’t hard to find, even if it’s something it doesn’t like to talk about; Semenyaka herself has been photographed giving a Hitler salute with a swastika flag behind her. The French New Right, however, has long been much more subtle than this. Azov is trying to borrow from this playbook. Semenyaka toldFPabout a project inspired by the French New Right theorist Guillaume Faye, who wrote a dictionary explaining New Right terms—an effort to turn anti-democratic, xenophobic, or even racist ideas into something much more palatable for the mainstream.“He doesn’t say what ‘chauvinism’ is, as leftists would do,” Semenyaka said. “He explains what ‘ethnomasochism’ is for instance. He would say that whites are always guilty, and by definition you have to embrace multiculturalism, create a single human race.” References to European culture rather than “the white race” is another popular euphemism in these circles. Semenyaka said the movement has plans to create a video based on terms in Faye’s book for a Ukrainian audience, an idea that she said has the backing of Biletsky. “It’s quite a witty way to gain political hegemony,” she said. Political power, however, isn’t anywhere near the horizon for Azov. With Biletsky’s withdrawal from Ukraine’s presidential race—he had been polling at less than 1 percent—Azov’s National Corps party is focusing on October’s parliamentary elections, where it hopes to surpass the 5 percent threshold to get into Ukraine’s parliament. (It currently holds two seats from single-member districts and is polling around 1 percent.)Semenyaka didn’t sound worried. It’s all an opportunity, she claimed, to gain new contacts, new “political technologists”—a term common in the post-Soviet sphere to describe the art of political manipulation—new supporters, and, eventually, to become what she called “a party of ideas.”Besides, there isn’t time for campaigning at the moment. Azov’s leading lights are too busy building relationships with far-right figures from across Europe and beyond—at least those who aren’t pro-Kremlin. It’s not the easiest task, considering that much of the European far-right, from France’s National Rally and Germany’s Alternative for Germany to theupstartThierry Baudetin the Netherlands, seem to be firm fans of the Kremlin. Still, groups such as the neo-Nazi Third Way and the Nordic Resistance Movement—a group now banned in Finland—and figures such as the American white nationalist Greg Johnson have visited Azov in the Ukrainian capital in the past few months. Members of Azov, including Semenyaka, regularly travel across Europe to connect with other far-right groups, from Italy’s CasaPound to Germany’s National Democratic Party, which German authorities have tried to ban. And while some members of these movements are more sympathetic to the Kremlin than to Kiev, Azov’s ideologists sound confident that they can convert more than a few of them to their side and build a different transnational far-right movement with themselves at the center. Azov is also forming connections with less subtle, and openly violent, far-right extremists whom Venner might have warned it to ignore. U. S.-based white supremacists from the Rise Above Movementvisited Kievlast year before being arrested back in the United States for a number of violent attacks they perpetrated in 2017. Hendrik Möbus, aconvicted murdererand founder of the German neo-Nazi band Absurd, spoke at an Azov event last December. But in Venner’s home country, Azov hasn’t had much luck with the mostly pro-Kremlin French far-right; Semenyaka freely admits that her efforts to make connections with members of the National Rally have gone nowhere. It has left the group little recourse but to find allies among the most violent fringes, especially the Social Bastion movement. Over the last two years, Azov’s friends in Social Bastion havebeatenpeople with metal bars while calling them “dirty Arabs” andbrokena man’s jawwhen they mistook him for a local anti-fascist activist. Last year, as a group of men walked past a Social Bastion hangout in the central French city of Clermont-Ferrand, one of them joked to his friends, “” (“This is the fascist local”). Members of Social Bastion emerged and attacked the men,breakingone of their legs. It’s hardly the more sanitized, more respectable face of the far-right that Venner would have wanted. As Notre Dame continued to smolder earlier this week, Azov made it perfectly clear what it meant to them. An Azov-affiliated record label posted the message “Europe is falling apart” on social media alongside a drawing of Notre Dame burning. “First, Venner’s sacrifice, now the fire,” the post stated. Azov’s French-inspired march through the wilderness has impressed its far-right friends abroad, many of whom are more than happy to work with Azov to try to build a newinternationalfar-right movement. Azov benefits from a unique situation for an ambitious far-right group—an ongoing war started by an imperial neighbor, an already conservative and nationalistic political climate, and the alleged protection of one of the country’s most powerful politicians, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who is widelybelievedto be Azov’s patron. Above all, however, Ukraine’s political climate is one where Azov’s outright violent actions don’t often get the scrutiny they deserve.

201,Methane-eating microbes in the ocean help moderate Earth's temperature,0.0,50.0,https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2021/06/14/Methane-eating-microbes-in-the-ocean-help-moderate-Earths-temperature/9061623703088/,https://adfontesmedia.com/upi-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-14,25,"June 14 (UPI) --Methane-eating microbes in the planet's oceans play an unappreciated role moderating Earth's temperature, according to a new study published Mondayin the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant and famous greenhouse gas, but methane is plentiful and its warming effect is more than 30 times more powerful. AdvertisementMost methane that ends up in the atmosphere is released by human activities, but several natural processes also produce methane: volcanic activity, subsurface water-rock interactions and microbial metabolism. The majority of naturally produced methane on Earth is produced by microbes, and much of that is in the ocean. Over the last decade or so, a number of studies have shown the planet's oceans to be home to a lot more methane than scientists previously thought. RelatedStudy: Models underestimate amount of carbon absorbed by Earth's oceansArctic Ocean acidification will be worse than scientists thoughtCoral parents pass algae to their offspring to help cope with climate changeInterestingly, studies suggest very little of that methane is making it into the atmosphere. AdvertisementAccording to the latest study, an abundance of methane-hungry microbial communities on the bottom of the ocean are responsible for keeping much of that methane locked up in marine ecosystems. Without these microbes, scientists surmise Earth's atmosphere would host more methane -- making it even warmer than it already is. When scientists surveyed microbe communities surrounding seven geologically distinct seafloor seeps, they found the group colonizing carbonate rocks was responsible for the highest rates of methane consumption ever recorded.""The microbes in these carbonate rocks are acting like a methane bio filter consuming it all before it leaves the ocean,"" senior study author Peter Girguis, professor of organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University, said in a press release. Though carbonate rocks are common on the ocean floor, they only sometimes form the kind of porous, chimney-like structures found rising from the seabed at a deep sea site just off the coast of Point Dume, California. That's where scientists found the record-setting microbes.""We measured the rate at which the microbes from the carbonates eat methane compared to microbes in sediment,"" said Girguis. ""We discovered the microbes living in the carbonates consume methane 50 times faster than microbes in the sediment.""Advertisement""We often see that some sediment microbes from methane-rich mud volcanoes, for example, may be five to ten times faster at eating methane, but 50 times faster is a whole new thing. Moreover, these rates are among the highest, if not the highest, we've measured anywhere,"" Girguis said.""These rates of methane oxidation, or consumption, are really extraordinary, and we set out to understand why,"" co-author Jeffrey J. Marlow, former postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, also said in the release. By efficiently capturing methane as it seeps out of seafloor vents and converting it into bicarbonate, microbes help construct these unusual carbonate rock chimneys. Scientists suspect the carbonate chimneys they call home -- and their mineral surroundings -- are key to their unprecedented metabolic capabilities. Researchers found some of the microbial communities colonizing carbonate rocks are surrounded by pyrite, which is electrically conductive. Efficient electron exchange, the researchers hypothesized, may explain why these microbes can eat so much methane so quickly.""These very high rates are facilitated by these carbonates which provide a framework for the microbes to grow,"" Girguis said.""The system resembles a marketplace where carbonates allow a bunch of microbes to aggregate in one place and grow and exchange -- in this case, exchange electrons -- which allows for more methane consumption,"" Girguis said. AdvertisementGirguis, Marlow and their research partners recently recreated a diversity of seafloor environs in the lab and are now studying how microbes metabolize methane under varying conditions. Researchers hope their ongoing experiments will reveal how different characteristics of the carbonate environment influence metabolic rates among the methane-eating microbes.""First, we need to understand how these microbes sustain their metabolic rate, whether they're in a chimney or in the sediment. And we need to know this in our changing world in order to build our predictive power,"" Marlow said.""Once we clarify how these many interconnected factors come together to turn methane to rock, we can then ask how we might apply these anaerobic methane-eating microbes to other situations, like landfills with methane leaks,"" he said.",3,Reliable,0.1948255928853755,0.5087555994729909,1039,3,UPI
202,Justice system that caters to elites is in desperate need of reform,1.0,31.67,https://dailytorch.com/2021/01/justice-system-that-caters-to-elites-is-in-desperate-need-of-reform/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-torch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,15,"ByRichard McCartyOur legal system has failed; it works well for the elite, but it is difficult or impossible for millions of Americans to obtain justice. The high cost of law school educations prevents many people from entering law and is part of the reason why thenational average hourly ratefor lawyers is $225. Due in part to the unaffordability of lawyers, it has been estimated that30 millionpeople go to court each year in the United States without a lawyer. All too often, theselitigants find themselves lost and hopelessly outmatched in our confusing legal system. One of the key problems with our legal system is that the American Bar Association (ABA) accredits the vast majority of law schools in the country, and its accreditation standards are very expensive. For example, ABA standards require that law programs last three years and that classes be taught by full-time faculty with lighter teaching loads. Of course, just as one size does not fit all, so many students cannot afford a gold-plated ABA-approved education. To help reduce legal education costs, states should allow all law school graduates – not just those from ABA-approved schools – to take the bar exam. Such a move would exert downward pressure on tuition costs at ABA-approved schools because it would make cheaper non-ABA schools more appealing to students. Presumably, downward pressure on tuition costs would be welcomed by law school graduates who, on average, have been leaving law school withmore than $164,000of student debt, according to a recent ABA survey. To address the unaffordability of legal services, states should promote competition among legal service providers. First of all, states should allow non-lawyers to own law firms, which should bring more capital and new ideas to the legal profession. Secondly, states should allow experienced paralegals to assist clients with simple contracts and wills, bankruptcies, divorces, and court filings. Several years ago, Washington State set up a program to allow non-lawyers to help clients with family law problems. Unsurprisingly, these legal professionalscost much lessthan attorneys. Courts should be more helpful tolitigants (those who serve as their own lawyer). Rather than expectpro selitigants to write their own court filings from scratch, courts should create simple forms for them to fill out whenever possible. Judges should be patient withpro selitigants, calmly explain court rules to them, and avoid using legal jargon as much as possible. Furthermore, when a judge observes that apro selitigant is skipping over a key argument, the judge should intervene and ask questions until the relevant facts are brought to light. Additionally, court clerks should answer legal questions forpro selitigants. While clerks should not tell them what they should do, clerks should tell them what their options are. As it is, clerks routinely refuse to answer basic questions forpro selitigants, in part, because they do not want to be accused of the unauthorized practice of law; but those same clerks will happily tell lawyers almost anything that they want to know. Those interested in learning more about legal reform should study the deregulatory actions of Britain and the State of Utah. Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s Parliament passed legislation to begin deregulating the legal profession; further deregulatory legislation passed in 2007. In Utah, the state’s Supreme Court established aregulatory sandboxfor the legal profession. For those unfamiliar with the term, regulatory sandboxes are created by regulators to allow innovations that are otherwise prohibited. For example, a lawyer can share fees with a non-lawyer in Utah’s sandbox even though that is currently prohibited outside the sandbox. In summary, the legal system is in desperate need of reform. To improve the system, states should work to assist those who represent themselves in court; and states should reduce unnecessary barriers to entry into the field of legal services, which should increase competition and bring down legal costs. If states will take these steps, millions of Americans will have greater access to justice.",1,Questionable,0.1238677823006181,0.4713838814585081,862,0,Daily Torch
203,Biden wants millions of electric vehicles on the roads. Can the power grid handle it?,-4.0,40.33,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/energy/biden-wants-millions-electric-vehicles-roads-can-power-grid-handle-n1271289,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-18,25,"Four months after an unexpected ice storm caused much of the Texas power grid to crash, state regulators warned this week that a June heat wave is causing a “high number of forced generation outages.”The twin Texas crises have put the spotlight not only on the Lone Star State but on the entire U. S. electric grid. And that, in turn, comes at a time when the energy infrastructure faces growing demand from the electric vehicles expected to roll out by the millions over the course of the coming decade. The U. S. reached “the tipping point” this year, said Mary Barra, chairman and CEO of General Motors. Demand for battery-electric vehicles is growing at a record pace, spurred in part by the debut of an assortment of new models. But not everyone is convinced she’s right. Studies find consumers are still reluctant to buy electric cars due to high costs, lack of a nationwide charging network — and growing concerns about the energy grid. Those are all issues that President Joe Biden aims to address, among other ways, through the proposed infrastructure bill that would set aside $170 billion to directly back the shift to battery-electric vehicles. About 10 percent of that funding is earmarked for a coast-to-coast charging system to rival today’s ubiquitous network of gasoline stations.“We need to jam on the accelerator here,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said during a recent online seminar outlining the administration’s desire to promote battery electric vehicles — with an emphasis on designing, engineering and producing them domestically.“We’re going to double down on our R&D in the technologies that will make EVs easier to manufacture, easier to deploy, easier for the American people to access,” the former Michigan governor said. There are a number of reasons behind the administration’s push for battery-car technology. There’s the need to reduce CO2 emissions in order to meet global warming targets. There’s a desire to reduce America’s dependence upon petroleum imports, and there’s also a growing concern that China will wind up dominating the EV segment — something that raises defense, as well as economic, concerns. China is not only the world’s largest electric vehicle market but also has the largest network of lithium-ion battery plants, 93 compared to just four in the U. S., according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The data service forecasts that China will have 140 of these “gigafactories” in place by 2030, compared to as few as 10 in the U. S. In a new National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries, the Department of Energy has laid out a variety of steps to promote more U. S. production. That starts with greater access to raw materials. Internally, the administration has been debating whether to promote greater domestic mining or ally with friendly trade partners, such as Canada and Australia, to build up stocks of critical raw materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel. Then there’s the carrot-and-stick of incentives. The administration is expected to offer direct financial incentives to prop up the business case for building both battery and assembly plants in the U. S. A proposed Senate bill would increase today’s $7,500 tax credits on electric vehicles to as much as $12,500 — but there’s a catch. The higher figure would, in part, be reserved for vehicles that are domestically produced. There are signs that manufacturers are listening. General Motors will open its first U. S. battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, later this year. It recently announced one in Spring Hill, Tennessee; and on Wednesday GM also said it will add two more plants as it upgrades its electrification plans, increasing its investment to $35 billion through 2035. Ford CEO Jim Farley last month indicated the second-largest domestic automaker is likely to commit to battery production, as well. Tesla’s Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, is today one of the world’s largest sources of lithium-ion batteries and will add capacity alongside the assembly plant it is erecting in Texas, with CEO Elon Musk indicating other production operations will follow. Production of electrified vehicles could also see a big growth spurt as a response to U. S. incentives. GM now plans to produce BEVs at two Michigan plants and another in Tennessee — though it also will produce some models in Mexico and Canada. Ford, Volkswagen, Nissan and Volvo are among the automakers who either are or will produce plug-based models in the U. S. While the White House has focused much of its attention directly on electric vehicles and the battery manufacturing process, there is another area that will need attention in any final infrastructure bill, experts emphasize.“We have to recognize that the (electric) infrastructure in parts of this country has fallen behind that in many other parts of the world,” said Scott Hinson, chief technology officer at Pecan Street, an Austin, Texas-based energy research project. While the problem is ""fixable,” Hinson said, he noted that the U. S. has a tendency not to ""work on things until they’re a big problem.”Power companies have struggled to deal with a number of challenges, from tightening their cybersecurity in the face of ransomware attacks such asthe Colonial Pipeline shutdown last month, to disrupting power in order to prevent downed wires from setting wildfires in California. That state also faced rolling blackouts a few years back due to energy shortages. A 2019 study by the U. S. Department of Energy estimated that increased demand for electricity — much of that for electric vehicles — could see a 38 percent increase in energy demand by 2050. While there seems little doubt that electric vehicles will increase the nation’s grid load, “the transition…will be slow,” said Pat Romano, CEO of ChargePoint, one of the nation’s largest charging companies. Around 80 percent of EV owners charge their vehicles at night, and mostly from home, taking advantage of a general surplus of off-peak generating capacity. But, even in off-hours, the already creaky grid is likely to become still more stressed, requiring plenty of upgrades, on top of new generating capacity — whether fossil-fueled or renewable. Paul A.

WASHINGTON — Boeing, General Atomics and Kratos willcreate prototypesfor the Air Force’s Skyborg program and have a mere five months to build the first test vehicles of the autonomous combat drone. As part of the Skyborg program, the Air Force hopes to build a family of low-cost, attritable drones that can be reused, but are cheap enough that losses in combat can be financially and operationally tolerated. The project is meant to produce a family of uncrewed aerial systems that can move into contested spaces and conduct aerial missions that might be too dangerous for human pilots to perform. The Air Force announced contract awards Dec. 7 for the three companies that will produce prototypes for the air vehicle portion of Skyborg and compete in a series of experiments in the hopes of winning a production contract. Three companies are under contract for a two-year period of performance:• Boeing, which received $25.7 million;• General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which received $14.3 million;• Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems Inc., which received $37.8 million. Military officials expect the first prototypes to be delivered no later than May 2021 for initial flight tests. The prototypes will then proceed into flight experiments beginning in July 2021 that will test each drones’ ability to team with manned aircraft, the service stated in a news release.“This award is a major step forward for our game-changing Skyborg capability — this award supporting our operational experimentation is truly where concepts become realities,” said Brig. Gen. Dale White, head of the Air Force’s program executive office for fighters and advanced aircraft, which manages the program alongside the Air Force Research Laboratory. One key differentiator between Skyborg and past combat drone programs is the development of artificial intelligence that will allow the aircraft to operate autonomously and potentially learn from prior training missions. Over the past several months, the program has focused on developing the technologies necessary for the “Autonomous Core System,” the hardware and software that will enable the Skyborg drone to operate semi-independently from a human operator, who will be able to issue commands but will not have to physically fly the system. The system is being designed by Leidos, using input from the Air Force and other Skyborg vendors. After prototypes are delivered, the Air Force will outfit them with that autonomy module. The three prototype manufacturers must also prove their aircraft is capable of incorporating payloads and mission systems being supplied by the other 10 companies on contract to potentially supply capabilities for the Skyborg program. In July and September, the Air Force awarded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract worth up to $400 million toestablish a pool of 13 vendorsthat would compete to offer Skyborg hardware and software — everything from the drones themselves, to sensors, weapons and algorithms. Those companies include: AeroVironment Inc., Autonodyne LLC, BAE System Controls Inc., Blue Force Technologies Inc., Fregata Systems Inc., Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, NextGen Aeronautics Inc., Northrop Grumman, Sierra Technical Services, and Wichita State University, as well as the three companies tapped to build air vehicle prototypes.“There will be competition throughout the entire period of performance of these awards. The effort will consist of multiple phases, meant to continue evaluation of the performance of the vendors,” the service stated. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

205,‘Step one of our recovery efforts’: Baltimore-area systems look to summer school to begin repairing academic losses from pandemic,0.0,46.67,https://www.baltimoresun.com/education/bs-md-summer-school-pandemic-20210603-20210604-cdabqccfajalbjrcj35krdxgya-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-04,24,"Baltimore-area school systems are greatly expanding summer school programs to offset the disruption to learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but officials caution it could take years to fully counter the long-term impact on students. An influx of tens of millions of federal COVID-19 recovery dollars is helping to pay for the increased costs of summer school. Some systems are trying to double the number of seats for students this summer. School officials say the summer programs will target a wide range of student needs, including boosting social and emotional well-being, providing academic support and mitigating the usual summer learning loss.“In a lot of ways, summer is step one of our recovery efforts,” said Lara Ohanian, who oversees summer programs for Baltimore City schools. “What I really want is for families, kids and teachers to see summer as the beginning of next year, the start of normalcy. I think people are exhausted now, and I want summer to be a jump-start to be happy and excited again.”To staff expanded summer programs, school systems are having to pay teachers more after a challenging year of pandemic education. In Baltimore, the teachers union is negotiating with the system to get wages bumped up to a daily rate akin to what teachers would earn during the school year.“The district is committed to providing an increase from what teachers were paid last summer” while balancing other needs, the school system said in a statement. Caroline Walker, who oversees summer programs in Howard County, said her system had hoped to double its offerings but expects to scale back that plan because it doesn’t have enough teachers.“It will be significantly expanded, but maybe as not as much as I would like,” Walker said. “We still need to find more staff.”Howard has offered better pay and a $1,000 bonus for some teachersas an incentive. Educators acknowledge that summer programs are not a panacea for the pandemic’s negative impacts on learning. Still, they hope the offerings will help many kids take the first step of getting reacquainted with classrooms. In the Baltimore region, only about half of students have returned to schools for in-person classes, and the state remains 46th in the nation for the percentage of its students back in classrooms as the school year ends, according to Burbio Inc., a company tracking school returns. Teachers have reported many students did not engage in learning online either because they didn’t have reliable internet or couldn’t learn well outside a classroom. As a result, failing grades doubled and sometimes tripled in school systems across the state. Maryland’s General Assembly passed legislation in Aprilrequiring systems to establish summer school programs to address the effects of the pandemic. The law also requires schools to assess each student at the beginning and conclusion of the summer program. Carroll County school administrators plan to closely analyze this data over the next year to determine whether there was a “return on investment” for their newly created summer school program, said chief academic officer Jason Anderson. The system has not offered a traditional summer school option in recent years. Carroll’s schools saw six times more failing grades in the fall semester compared to the same period a year earlier. The number of failing grades diminished as the rural school system brought students back to classrooms later in the school year, Anderson said. About 2,600 students in Carroll’s general education track have signed up for the summer learning program. In the city, summer school should help alleviate some of the learning gaps left by the pandemic, said Ohanian, but the summer programs aren’t intended to close all those gaps. Baltimore will offer slots for 16,000 students — up from 9,000 before the pandemic — for six weeks this summer. Ohanian said about 100 schools will have summer offerings, everything from courses for elementary students who need a mix of academics and enrichment classes to middle and high school students who need to make up credits. Some programs will offer the arts, including an Alvin Ailey Dance Camp at Towson University. The city will first focus on students whose teachers feel they need extra help, particularly seniors and high school students who need to catch up. The school system will run intensive three-week sessions for those seniors so they can gather enough credits to graduate. Beyond the system’s efforts, local foundations and city money have provided $3 million to give about 10,000 more children academic and enrichment activities this summer. Across systems, educators are hoping to reintroduce school to students who have been at home for more than a year. Many students had little interactions with their classmates and teachers. Some students turned off their laptop cameras during class and the teachers couldn’t see them.“If you are used to not having the attention on you … you are suddenly in school and teachers are right there and seeing what you are doing,” said Howard County’s Walker. “It is going to be reawakening for some students.”Younger children will have to learn to take turns and to sit at a desk. Some rising seventh graders and rising 10th graders have never been inside their middle or high schools. Summer school can help students make those adjustments.“Relearning the habits of being a student is a very important part of education, too,” said Walker. In addition to in-person camps and summer schools, many systems are offering online courses for families who want them. Baltimore County’s summer school option will look similar to what the system has planned for the fall — a choice for families between online or in-person classes. Administrators say they’re moving away from the hybrid schedule they used during the spring semester that required teachers to work simultaneously with students in both settings. The summer programs, as in the past, will be focused on closing gaps and preventing summer learning loss, said Mary Boswell-McComas, chief academic officer for the system.“I think this summer is just a heightened intensity,” Boswell-McComas said. About 17,000 Baltimore County students have signed up for an extensive variety of systemwide programs, which are anchored in academics but include wraparound services that target the emotional well-being of children, she said. The Harford County system has planned both a traditional summer school focused on student academics as well as a “Stars of Summer” program, which features about75 unique academic experiences based on proposals submitted by teachers. Anne Arundel County has increased by fourfold enrollment in its summer camps, which are a mix of academics and fun, according to school system spokesman Bob Mosier. Summer school will be for about 1,000 middle and high school students who need to make up classes they have failed. While some students and teachers need a break from a stress-filled year of learning, others are ready to get back into a normal routine during summer school. Walker said some teachers are begging: “Please, put me in front of kids.”",3,Reliable,0.1180233079928202,0.3622999155316227,1435,3,Baltimore Sun
206,"Americans Are Worried About Crime, But That Doesn’t Mean They’re Blaming Democrats",-6.67,41.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-25,25,"Welcome toPollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup. Rising murder, aggravated assault and auto theft rateshave increased concern about crime among the American public. According to polling fromYouGov/The Economist, the share of Americans who say crime is the most important issue facing America has increased since President Biden took office — to a greater degree than any issue except national security. Relatedly, a May 22-25Fox News pollfound that 73 percent of registered voters thought there was more crime nationwide than there was a year earlier. Only 17 percent thought there was less crime, and 7 percent thought the level of crime had stayed about the same. Fewer, but still a majority, believed crime was up in their local area, too: 54 percent, compared with 28 percent who thought there was less crime in their area and 15 percent who thought it was about the same. (It’s worth noting, though, that Americans perpetually believe that crime is on the rise,even when it is not.)AGallup pollearlier this year also found that only 27 percent of Americans were satisfied with the nation’s policies to reduce or control crime, and that 65 percent were dissatisfied. That’s a big change from 2020, when 47 percent were satisfied and 49 percent were dissatisfied. Altogether, this hassparked a narrativethat the rise in violent crime poses a political problem for Democrats, who are the ruling party and also traditionally perceived assofter on crime. But at this point, it’s not really clear that the crime issue will hurt Democrats and anti-police progressives politically. For starters, Americans are actually pretty divided on what the best solution to stopping crime is. In aYouGov/Yahoo News pollfrom May 24-26, 32 percent of adults said that law enforcement is not tough enough on most offenders — but about the same amount, 27 percent, said law enforcement istough on most offenders. (Eighteen percent thought law enforcement’s level of toughness was about right, while 22 percent weren’t sure.)The public is also pretty sharply divided on whether Democrats or Republicans are better on the issue of crime. When asked whether Biden or former President Donald Trump has done a better job handling crime, 34 percent of respondents to the YouGov/Yahoo poll said Trump, while 32 percent said Biden. (Fifteen percent thought the two were about equally good on crime.) Of course, this just mirrors people’s existing partisan preferences — a majority of Republicans preferred Trump’s handling, while a majority of Democrats preferred Biden’s — but that just bolsters the theory that crime isn’t an issue that’s changing anybody’s mind. Similarly, in elections so far in 2021, it also doesn’t look like crime is driving voters toward more conservative candidates. True, this week’s Democratic primary for mayor of New York Cityfocused heavily on crime, and thewinner was most likelyBrooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, arguably the race’s most pro-police candidate. But there are plenty of counterexamples: In the Democratic primary for Philadelphia district attorney, incumbent Larry Krasner — the George Washington of the progressive criminal-justice movement— handily defeated a moderate who attempted totie Krasner’s policies to Philadelphia’s rising crime rate. And in this month’s special election forNew Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, the Republican candidate ran what was virtually a single-issue campaign on crime and policing issues; Democrat Melanie Stansbury ended up winning by 25 percentage points, exceeding the district’s D+18partisan lean.1It’s possible crime emerges as a wedge issue in the 2022 midterms. But so far, there’s little evidence that it is helping one party over the other. According to FiveThirtyEight’spresidential approval tracker,252.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 42.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +10.5 points). At this timelast week, 51.9 percent approved and 42.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +9.9 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 54.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 40.3 percent, for a net approval rating of +14.0 points.",3,Reliable,0.1814972885537402,0.4918551878229297,934,3,FiveThirtyEight
207,"Young Voters, Motivated by Climate Change and Environmental Justice, Helped Propel Biden’s Campaign",-11.67,44.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07112020/young-voters-climate-change-environmental-justice-joe-biden/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,21,"If Joe Biden wins the presidency, young voters between 18 and 29 will have played a critical role in his election, turning out in force and favoring the former vice president over President Trump by 61 percent to 36 percent, according to ananalysisby the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning at Tufts University. The Center concluded that those young voters, and particularly young people of color and women, may have helped put Biden over the edge in crucial battleground states, based on ananalysisof votes counted by midday Friday. The Tufts’ center estimated the youth share of the vote in the 2020 election at 17 percent, compared to 16 percent in the 2016 presidential election and13 percentin the 2018 midterms, based on the 2020 VoteCast from the Associated Press, the National Election Pool exit poll from Edison Research and its own analyses of census population data. That figure could change as more data becomes available and the election comes to a close. The center, a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement, also projected that once all votes are counted, youth turnout may rise to 53 to 56 percent, compared to46 percentin the 2016 election and36 percentin the 2018 midterms. That would represent the highest youth voter turnout since at least 1984. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Young Black, Asian and Latino voters supported Biden over Trump by margins of 77, 72 and 49 points respectively. By comparison, young white voters supported Biden over Trump by a margin of only 6 points. Support for the two candidates also divided along gender-based lines within racial and ethnic groups, with young white women preferring Biden over Trump by a 13-point margin, while young white men preferred Trump over Biden by a 6-point margin. The center’s analysis also found substantial pro-Biden youth voter turnout in key battleground states, including in closely-watched Georgia, where youth comprised 21 percent of the vote and gave Biden a 19-point edge over Trump. Specifically, young Black voters, who favored Biden over Trump by an 82-point margin, “put Georgia in play,” the center said in its analysis. With a recountunderway, Biden currently leads in Georgia by just over 4,000 votes. The center estimated that youth voter turnout across the 11 crucial battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Montana, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas and South Carolina could rise to 51 to 53 percent by the election’s end.“In many ways, the energy young people have brought throughout this election cycle—that will have catapulted Joe Biden into the presidency if we get that result” and given him a “climate mandate” in office, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate organization, said at a press conference on Thursday. Prakash added that Sunrise and allied climate and progressive organizations played a critical role in making a youth-powered Biden victory possible by pushing for the Green New Deal and advocating for climate more broadly. For young voters across the political spectrum, she said, climate is “essentially a litmus test for the 2020 election.”Garrett Blad, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, said Biden’s use of climate change as a “closing argument” in advertisements in swing states down the election’s final stretch testified to the group’s success in shaping climate as a dominant issue in the Democratic Party and national political dialogue.“This is going to sound so simple but when a campaign is actually talking with young people publicly, I think that matters a lot,” said Abby Kiesa, the Tufts’ center’s deputy director, who attributed Biden’s favorability among young voters in part to his effort to appeal directly to youth from early on in his campaign after the primary. Kiesa added that young voters could distinguish authentic appeals from political rhetoric. “Young people aren’t dumb; they know when someone’s just out to get their vote,” she said. Blad offered a similar analysis. “To Biden’s credit, like a lot of politicians don’t do, he listened to young people,” said Blad. He said he thought Biden’s heavy communications about climate change was a driving force behind thevast uptickin his favorability among young voters between May and October. Zanagee Artis, co-founder of Zero Hour, a youth climate justice organization, said the Unity Task Force on Climate Change Biden formed with Sen. Bernie Sanders, which included Green New Deal champions Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sunrise’s Prakash, signalled the former vice president’s willingness to listen to and work with young people. Though Biden’s refusal to commit to a ban on fracking and fully embrace the Green New Deal frustrated many young progressive climate activists, Artis said he felt encouraged by how successful the youth climate movement had been in pushing Biden to adopt a much bolder climate policy plan than he would have otherwise. Artis was among several climate activists who said youth helped propel Joe Biden into office on the promise that his presidency would deliver not only bold action, but specifically climate justice. Rather than talk strictly about science or decarbonization, Biden spoke about climate in terms of green job creation and investment in marginalized communities—language that helped energize young people who had coalesced around Sanders in the early Democratic primaries.“Climate is a mobilizing issue because climate is an intersectional issue,” said Saad Amer, an environmental activist and director of Plus1Vote, a youth voter mobilization organization. He said climate was inseparable from racial justice and health equity. Alex Leichenger, strategic communications manager at NextGen America, an organization of young voters created to elect pro-climate Democrats, said Biden’s focus on environmental justice as part of his climate policy may help explain his higher support among young people of color and young women. Research has found thatpeople of colorand specifically,young people of color, are more likely to be concerned about climate change. The center’s analysis of APVoteCast datashowsyoung Biden voters were more likely than young Trump voters to say coronavirus, racism and climate change were top issues facing the country by 21-point, 14-point and 9-point margins, respectively, with young Trump supporters being significantly more likely to prioritize the economy and jobs. That disparity reflects the gap between Biden, who linked climate to health and environmental racism, and Trump, who has continuously denied the science around the climate and Covid-19 crises while painting climate action as a threat to people’s jobs in the fossil fuel industry. Leichenger said he looked forward to seeing more data on the breakdown of youth voter turnout to better understand how racial and gender disparities affected young people’s support for Biden over Trump, along with any disparities between Gen Z and millennial voting trends. Beyond having the right messaging, Biden’s campaign may have benefited substantially from concerted organizing efforts by young climate activists to get out their peers’ votes. Danielle Deiseroth, a climate data analyst for the progressive think tank Data for Progress, said hundreds of thousands ofpostcardsSunrise sent out to young voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Florida were emblematic of the large-scale, youth-led organizing that may have played a critical role in swaying the election. Blad said Sunrise made a total of 1.8 million phone calls, sent 2.5 million texts and mailed 778,000 postcards to eligible voters, reaching 3.5 million unique voters just since the end of the presidential primary. Digital technologies may also have played an important role in mobilizing young voters, both Leichenger and Amer said. With in-person campaign events next to impossible because of the pandemic, they said, youth took advantage of their social media and internet savvy to get out the vote using platforms like TikTok and Instagram. And for many climate organizers, this year’s powerful youth turnout is only the beginning. Youth have “shown that they are relevant, that they are here and they are going to have a say,” said Natalie Mebane, associate director of U. S. policy at 350 Action. Leichenger said he thinks Gen Z voters between 18 and 23 are “only at the beginning of exercising what can be very substantial power.”Ilana Cohen is a proud New Yorker and a rising junior at Harvard University studying philosophy and social studies.

210,'No regrets': Evangelicals and other faith leaders still support Trump after deadly US Capitol attack,-3.0,48.0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/12/evangelicals-donald-trump-capitol-riot-voter-fraud/6644005002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,22,"Like millions of other Americans, Franklin Graham watched the disturbing images of last week'sriots at the U. S. Capitolwith swelling concern and anger. Graham, son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and head of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said he was sickened to see ""people attack my Capitol and break down the doors of my Capitol"" and was dismayed to see howPresident Donald Trump riled up the protesters.""I don't think it was the president's finest moment,"" he said. But Graham said he doesn't expect the tumult at the Capitol to deter evangelical Christians from supporting Trump.""I don’t think he had any understanding in that moment of what was going to take place,"" he said. ""None of us did.""Graham added, ""He regrets it.""Since his victory in a very competitive Republican primary in 2016, Trump has relied on evangelical Christians and other influential religious groups aspowerful voting blocsto shore up his influence. He has appointed more than 200 federal judges and three conservative justices to the U. S. Supreme Court who support limits on abortion and gay marriage and other policies favored by many conservative religious leaders. In the presidential election in November, 76% of white evangelicals voted for Trump and 24% for Joe Biden, according to Edison Research exit polls. Thousands of protesters broke into the Capitol as Congress tried to finalize the Electoral College vote count and acknowledge Biden as the election winner. The attack led to five deaths andnearly 100 arrestsand motivated House Democrats to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump for allegedly inciting the crowds. During a speech before the violence broke out, Trump told his followers, ""We’re going to have to fight much harder.""“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said hours before rioters stormed the U. S. Capitol, threatening Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers. Tuesday,before leaving on a trip to South Texas,Trump said calls for his impeachment were divisive and his comments to supporters before theCapitolinsurrection were ""totally appropriate.""None of the turmoil has eroded much of his support among evangelicals, experts and religious leaders said. For the past four years, evangelical leaders created an ""echo chamber"" where they blamed all of Trump's digressions and missteps on the Democratic Party or the mainstream media, said Sarah Posner, an investigative journalist and author of ""Unholy: Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump.""After the deadly Capitol riot, evangelical leaders deflected blame from Trump, while those who have been critical of the president denounced the riots and blamed him for playing a role, she said. Evangelicals ""are so conditioned not to trust the media, it's going to be really hard to convince them of the truth of what happened on Wednesday,"" Posner said. In the wake of the Capitol riots, many evangelical leaders have continued fueling Trump's baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud in last year's elections, she said.""Because it’s the leaders who are again churning the same conspiracy theories, I don’t see a lot of progress in changing anybody’s minds,"" Posner said. Robert Jeffress, senior pastor of the 14,000-member First Baptist Church of Dallas, said Tuesday he had “absolutely no regrets” over his “enthusiastic support” of Trump over the past four years.“He is without doubt the most pro-life and pro-religious president in history,” Jeffress said in an e-mail. “The president has every right to hold the view that the election was fraudulent and to invite those who share that belief to peacefully protest. He neither called for nor condoned the despicable actions of those who invaded our Capitol and assaulted the police.”In an editorial published over the weekend on Fox News, Jeffress called the storming of the Capitol “not only a crime” but “a sin against God.”“Peaceful protest is a vital part of our political tradition, and it has long served us well,” he wrote. “What happened on Wednesday when a mob infiltrated the Capitol building was not a protest. It was lawlessness. … Celebrating evil is evil. It corrodes the soul.”Jeffress said he would discuss in his sermon Sunday how Christians dismayed by the election results should respond to Biden.“If we are ever going to heal our country,” he said, “we must learn how to lay aside the anger and bitterness that are tearing our country apart without demanding that people surrender their deeply held convictions.”Trump has also courted support from Orthodox Jewish leaders, who applauded when he moved theU. S. Embassy to Jerusalemtwo years ago. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, brokered the signing of peace accords with a handful of Mideast countries. According to asurveyby the American Jewish Committee published in October, Trump was preferred by 74% of Orthodox Jews. Biden was favored by 83% of secular Jews. Among the mob at the U. S. Capitol were Orthodox Jews who supported the president, even though there were anti-Semitic images in the crowd, including a man with a T-shirt emblazoned with ""Camp Auschwitz."" One rioter arrested Friday was the son of aprominentjudge in New York’s Orthodox Jewish community. Rabbi Mendy Mirocznik, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, a national organization that represents more than 900 Orthodox clergy members, called the events at the Capitol very painful. The Rabbinical Alliance of America does not endorse any political candidates for office.“This is more than the straw that broke the camel’s back,"" said Mirocznik, whose parents are Holocaust survivors from Poland. ""America needs to begin to heal.”Apollby the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization that tracks extremism nationwide, found approximately two-thirds of Americans say Trump and members of groups with white supremacist beliefs were responsible for the violence.“Most Americans now see the direct connection between the dangerous rhetoric from President Trump, others on the far right and extremist groups,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the ADL. During religious services this past weekend, Jewish clergy took to the pulpit to speak out against white supremacy, anti-Semitism and the attack on democracy. As Rabbi Rachel Timoner began reciting the blessing, “Baruch Atah Adonai,” to welcome the sabbath in Congregation Beth Elohim in New York City's Brooklyn borough, she attempted to comfort her congregation.“We are going to kindle light because the world needs light,"" she said, lighting two white candles. Joseph W. Daniels, Jr., pastor of Emory Fellowship, a United Methodist church in Washington, cited the attack on the Capitol during his sermon Sunday and urged congregants to call out wrongdoing when they see it.“For our nation to heal, for America to heal, we have to call out the fact that the behaviors and habits and attitudes of this past Wednesday were not of God but were of a white supremacy and privilege that are not healthy for anybody,"" Daniels said. “We cannot be afraid. We have to have courage. ... We have to call out demons.”Some conservative religious leaders called for the nation to move forward behind Biden. In an article in the online portal The Gospel Coalition, Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, condemned the attacks on the Capitol and called on Christians to reject the falsehoods surrounding the elections and embrace the truth.""Enough is enough – and indeed was enough a long time ago,"" Moore wrote. ""It will take decades to rebuild from the wreckage in this country. But, as Christians, we can start now – just by not being afraid to say what is objectively the truth. Joe Biden has been elected president.""He said, ""If Christians are people of truth, we ought to be the first to acknowledge reality.""For other evangelicals, Trump's role in the Capitol attack will be minimized because many see him not just as an elected official but one anointed by God, Posner said.""They feel he should remain president because God wanted him to be president,"" she said.",3,Reliable,-0.0040912593339777,0.4106253239748386,1791,3,USA Today
211,Pete Buttigieg’s Nomination Is History Making in More Ways Than One,-10.33,45.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/pete-buttigieg-transportation-secretary-nomination,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-16,23,"Two years ago,Pete Buttigiegwas the little-known mayor of South Bend, Indiana, about to launch a highly improbable run for the presidency. Now, after a campaign that briefly propelled him to front-runner status and then a media blitz that made him perhaps the most successful campaign surrogate for President-elect Joe Biden, he is on the cusp of being the next secretary of transportation—and the first openly gay person ever confirmed for a Cabinet post in the nation’s history. Biden announced on Tuesday that he would appoint Buttigieg to the post, calling his former campaign rival “a patriot and a problem solver who speaks to the best of who we are as a nation.” The pick was hailed by the Human Rights Campaign, which last monthurged the president-electto appoint LGBTQ people to senior posts in his administration. “His voice as a champion for the LGBTQ community in the Cabinet room will help President-elect Biden build back our nation better, stronger, and more equal than before,” Alphonso David, the president of the HRC, said in a statement issued after the news began to leak out. Buttigieg will technically not be the first openly gay person to fill a Cabinet-level post, but the person who holds that distinction—Richard Grenell, who briefly served as Donald Trump’s acting director of national intelligence—was never confirmed by the Senate. (Some conservative media outlets have criticized the first openly gay designation bestowed upon Buttigieg, saying it diminishes Grenell’s achievement. “Such claims amount to whitewashing President Donald Trump’s promotion of his administration’s first ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell, to serve as director of national intelligence from February to May this year–a Cabinet-level position,”The Federalist’s Tristan Justicewrote on Wednesday.)So far, Biden’s administration is shaping up to be one of themost diverse in history when it comes to LGBTQ representation. Karine Jean-Pierre, the chief of staff for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, was recently announced as principal deputy White House press secretary, and Pili Tobar, an immigration-rights advocate and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, was named deputy White House communications director. Carlos Elizondo, who was Biden’s social secretary when Biden was vice president, has been named White House social secretary. On Tuesday, Buttigieg tweeted his gratitude for the nomination:This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. And on Wednesday, his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, noted the historic nature of his appointment:This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. If confirmed, the 38-year-old Buttigieg will also be the first millennial to hold a senior position in the Biden administration and one of the youngest Cabinet members in history. Julián Castro was 39when Barack Obama appointed him housing secretary in 2014, and Alexander Hamiltonwas in his mid-30swhen he became the nation’s first secretary of the Treasury. In his remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday, before formally introducing his pick for secretary of transportation, Biden touted the diversity of his appointments so far, saying that, by the time he was through, his Cabinet would have the most women and the most people of color in history. It would be, Biden said, “a Cabinet of barrier breakers, a Cabinet of firsts.... A Cabinet that looks like America.”Buttigieg started off his speech by talking about his longtime love of trains, planes, and other forms of transportation, disclosing that he had actually proposed to Chasten in an airport terminal.

Then, in addition to pledging that under his leadership “the idea of Infrastructure Week is associated with results and never again a media punchline,” he talked about the significance of what was happening on this socially distanced stage of the Queen theater.“I’m also mindful that the eyes of history are on this appointment, knowing that this is the first time an American president has ever sent an openly LGBTQ Cabinet member to the Senate for confirmation,” Buttigieg said. He recalled watching the news, as a 17-year-old, when then president Bill Clinton tried to appoint an openly gay ambassador, only to have that pick vilified and ultimately tabled until Clinton could make a recess appointment. “Two decades later,” Buttigieg said, “I can’t help but think of a 17-year-old somewhere who might be watching us right now, somebody who wonders whether and where they belong, in the world or even in their own family, and I’m thinking about the message that today’s announcement is sending to them.”Buttigieg was a fierce and often highly critical opponent of Biden in the early days of the 2020 presidential campaign. But once he dropped out, right before Super Tuesday, Buttigieg became anequally fierce surrogate for the Democratic nominee, particularly in his appearances on Fox News, wherehe skillfully parried with the Trump-leaning hostsand matter-of-factly pointed out the repeated falsehoods being perpetrated by the president. Pete Buttigieg went from being one of Joe Biden’s fiercest rivals to one of his most effective surrogates on the campaign trail. One regular Fox viewer was apparently not happy with the airtime given to the young politician. “Hard to believe that @FoxNews is wasting airtime on Mayor Pete, as Chris Wallace likes to call him,” Donald Trumptweeted shortly before one appearancein May of last year. “Fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the Dems. They got dumped from the Democrats boring debates, and they just want in. They forgot the people who got them there.”",3,Reliable,0.1511309523809524,0.4294678469678469,1288,3,Vogue
212,Donald Trump cut off medical funds to nephew's sick baby because he was 'angry' over family feud,-5.33,41.0,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-revoke-cut-child-medical-bills-family-feud-a6795131.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/independent-bias-and-reliability/,2016-01-04,25,"Trump reportedly withdrew funds that paid for a sick child's medical bills after the parents sued his familyDonald Trump,frontrunner in the racefor the Republican presidential nomination, has faced fresh criticism after it was revealed in an interview that he allegedly withheld funds for the medical bills of a sick infant due to a family feud. The claim was made in arecentarticlewhich looks into Trump's relationship with his older brother Freddy, who died in 1981 at the age of 43 following years of alcoholism. The article mentions an episode which occurred after the death of Fred Trump Sr, Donald and Freddy's father, in 1999. Following the death of Freddy, his son, Fred III, got married and had a child. Shortly after birth, the baby began having seizures which later developed intocerebral palsy. The Trump family pledged to pay for the child's medical bills, but that came to an end after the reading of Fred Sr's will, which Donald Trump had reportedly helped draft while his father was still alive. In Fred Trump Sr's will, much of the inheritance, believed to be around $20 million, was divided between four of his five children and their descendants - leaving Freddy explicitly excluded from receiving any of the money.

RICHARDS | AFP | Getty ImagesGettyGetty ImagesAPAFPGetty ImagesReutersGetty ImagesPAGetty ImagesGETTYAfter this came to light, Freddy's children sued, claiming Donald Trump (their uncle) and his siblings had wielded ""undue influence"" over Fred Sr, who suffered from dementia in the last years of his life. It is alleged that a week later Donald retaliated by withdrawing the funds that were meant to pay for the healthcare of his nephew's ill child. Explaining this decision, Donald told the paper: ""I was angry because they sued,"" adding Freddy's exclusion from the will was down to his father's dislike for Freddy's ex-wife. Fred III did not offer a comment to the paper, but Donald said that the lawsuit over the will was settled ""very amicably.""He added that he was fond of his nephew, and had grown to appreciate his brother later in his life, telling the paper that Freddy ""would have been an amazing peacemaker if he didn't have the problem, because everybody loved him.""has contacted Donald Trump's campaign for a comment.

213,Vaccine skeptics are my people. Here's how to reach at least some of us.,0.0,36.0,https://www.upworthy.com/vaccine-skeptics-are-my-people,https://adfontesmedia.com/upworthy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-21,16,"Let me start by saying I will absolutely be getting the COVID-19 vaccine. No question. I'm pretty excited about it. I can't say that I always would have felt that way. When I started my family 20 years ago, I dove into the natural birth/parenting/health world pretty quickly. I gave birth to one of my kids at home (with a doctor who did homebirths) and had another at a birth center with a midwife. I treated my kids' earaches with garlic-steeped olive oil and their conjunctivitis with breastmilk. We keep elderberry syrup on hand for colds and flus and use ginger and turmeric tea as an anti-inflammatory. My husband has successfully used hibiscus tea to lower his blood pressure and acupuncture for prostatitis. That's not to say we ever shunned Western medicine. We use antibiotics for strep throat, Tylenol if a fever gets really bad, etc. There's a huge spectrum of approaches to health and wellness, and tossing any of them out completely is pretty silly. There's a lot of good stuff in the natural health world, including a lot that is backed up by traditional science. (See the links above.) There's also a lot of unsupported-by-science woo and misinformation, and that's only gotten worse in the age of social media. As for vaccines, I started out unsure of what to think about them. I had concerns about injecting my children with what I understood to be toxic ingredients in vaccines, such as thimerosal (a mercury-containing compound that was removed from vaccines in 2001) and aluminum. We had a family doctor who wasn't anti-vaccine but had some hesitancy about certain ones, so we took each vaccine on an individual basis with his input. We did immunize our kids, but we did it on a different schedule based on perceived risk. For example, we didn't do the Hep B vaccine at birth because the risk of our newborn baby being exposed to Hep B was incredibly tiny, so we figured that one could wait. We felt that our kids were healthy enough to get natural chickenpox immunity through infection, so we skipped that vaccine altogether. (Since we homeschooled, we were able to expose our kids purposefully in our own home and keep them isolated while the infection process ran its course. Totally understand if you cringe at that. I probably would now too.) If I could go back and do it again I'd likely make some different choices, but at the time we made informed decisions based on the information we had. I'm not sure where I would have ended up if I'd had the big, nutty world of social media at my fingertips. I was a vaccine skeptic, not a full-on anti-vaxxer, but it's a slippery road from one to the other. In reality, I think there are a lot of people like me out there, and I'm concerned that they're being swayed more and more toward conspiracy theories. Healthy skepticism and scrutiny over what we put into our bodies is, well, healthy. People have questions and concerns, and that's a good thing. How those questions and concerns get addressed is key. One thing not to do: Don't dismiss all vaccine skepticism as uninformed ignorance. There is some of that out there for sure, but there are also a lot of people who have solid reasons for their concerns, even if they aren't concerns for everyone. Most vaccine skeptics aren't ignorant conspiracy theorists just as not all people who work for pharmaceutical companies are greedy profiteers. If the people with the best scientific information roll their eyes at people for their questions, they will be lured down the rabbit hole of misinformation by those who welcome their skepticism. There are two truths we need to internalize it comes to understanding people's vaccine decision-making. 1) No one except people who study this stuff for a living has the time to wade through ALL of the information, so humility goes a long way. 2) Even though we all think we're informed, we base our decisions far more on who we trust—and don't trust—than on any specific information we have. That trust part is huge. It's The Big Key. Any conversation with a vaccine skeptic has to address trust first and foremost. If so simple to say, 'Just trust the science!' but the people who say that don't understand how many scientists and doctors there are in the anti-vaccine world who share studies and analyses and whatnot that makes the science seem pretty fuzzy. Which scientists are we supposed to trust? Which doctors? Which studies? The biggest source of distrust for most vaccine skeptics is 'Big Pharma' and the gargantuan profits pharmaceutical companies make. It's a mistake to dismiss that concern out of hand. We've all seen the price gouging of medications—are we supposed to believe these pharmaceutical companies have our best interest at heart? We've all seen medications get recalled because they found out they did some kind of harm—is this the science we're supposed to put our faith in? When people are starting from that place of distrust, it's a pretty short distance to the conspiracy theory rabbit hole. Once people go down that hole, it's virtually impossible to bring them back, so we have to find the off ramp before people get there. One step toward the off-ramp, which should come early in the discussion, is to help people establish just how rotten they think humanity really is. I know that sounds odd, but that one thing forms the foundation for everything that comes next. If you're talking to a vaccine skeptic, ask them these questions: Do you think most people generally do the right thing? Do you think most people go into their careers for the right reasons? Do you think most people want the world to be a place where everyone is happy and healthy? If they seem unsure, ask them to think about all of the people they know personally. Nearly everyone will answer yes to these questions when they think about the hundreds of people they know. The reason that's important is because our brains tend to generalize and dehumanize processes and industries that involve a lot of people. And the less we actually know about how a process or industry works, the more monolithic we make our generalizations. I see people do this all the time with 'the media.' As if 'the media' is one thing and not a bunch of competing companies that each have their own mission and culture and commitment to certain standards of reporting. Such monolithic ideas remove the individual, dedicated editors and journalists who really try to do their jobs to the best of their ability—the people who actually make up 'the media.' We do the same things with 'politicians' when we assume all elected officials are corrupt and power-hungry. We do the same thing with 'corporate America' when we assume that all corporations are 100% motivated by greed. Monoliths take humans out of the equation and replace them with a nefarious blob of malintent that isn't truly reflective of reality. When you make 'the vaccine industry' a monolith, it seems like this big, powerful machine that exists only to line the pockets of the people who run it. And yes, pharmaceutical companies make buttloads of money, because they can. Yay, capitalism. But break it down. The people in those companies who are responsible for profit-mongering are specific people in the marketing and financial executive departments—it's not the entire company. It's certainly not the individual researchers who spend their days studying virology and epidemiology and immunology. It's not the scientists who dedicate months and years to figuring out how to treat a disease or save humanity from an infectious pathogen. It's not the vaccine development teams or the teams running the trials or the teams analyzing the data. Generally speaking, those people don't have anything to do with the money-making side of the pharmaceutical business in any meaningful way. That doesn't mean every individual person is trustworthy, of course. Most of us would agree that there are some bad apples everywhere, but that's why we have professional organizations and review boards and standards, so that we minimize the likelihood of a bad apple ruining the bunch. And if you believe that most people do their best work for the right reasons, you have to believe that the vast majority of scientists around the globe who work on vaccines do everything in their power to make sure whatever they're developing is as safe and effective as possible. Breaking down these big industries into how they actually function and understanding that the scientists making the vaccine are not synonymous with the company selling it can go a long way toward building trust in the science, without actually having to go as far as trusting the companies themselves. Explaining that people pushing anti-vaccine information are also making money can also help. If people believe Big Pharma is bad, then everyone against Big Pharma seems good, even though there are a lot of quackos and grifters out there who profit big time off of people's skepticism and fear. Being anti-corporate-profiteering doesn't automatically make someone trustworthy. And though it may sometimes feel like too many people are too far down the rabbit hole to make a difference, helpful explanations of the science from scientists actually does help. For instance, this Twitter thread explains how the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine works in layman's terms. And the questions and answers that follow the main thread are helpful as well for minimizing fear. Acknowledging that people's questions and concerns are legitimate (even if you know their conclusions are not), is a good first step. Setting a baseline foundation for trust is the second. When you actually delve into those questions and concerns, do so in a way that doesn't just throw data or statistics at them, but actually addresses the underlying fear and distrust that can lead to conspiratorial thinking. Not everyone will be convinced, but we have to be as diligent as those pushing misinformation and keep putting out facts with calm confidence. So many of us are actually swayable by good information, especially when it comes from people we feel like we can trust.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1536271916173877,0.5019205830480334,2222,2,Upworthy
214,Texas Attorney General Sues Biden Administration to Stop ‘Unlawful’ Open Border Policies,17.0,26.33,https://bigleaguepolitics.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-biden-administration-to-stop-unlawful-open-border-policies/,https://adfontesmedia.com/big-league-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxtonannounced on Fridaythat his state is filing a lawsuit to stop President-imposed Joe Biden’s administration’s open border policies that are being enacted at breakneck speed.“In one of its first of dozens of steps that harm Texas and the nation as a whole, the Biden administration directed DHS to violate federal immigration law and breach an agreement to consult and cooperate with Texas on that law. Our state defends the largest section of the southern border in the nation. Failure to properly enforce the law will directly and immediately endanger our citizens and law enforcement personnel,” said Attorney General Paxton.“DHS itself has previously acknowledged that such a freeze on deportations will cause concrete injuries to Texas. I am confident that these unlawful and perilous actions cannot stand. The rule of law and security of our citizens must prevail,” he added. Paxton is accusing the Biden administration of violating the U. S. Constitution by suspending deportations of illegal aliens. He says that this illegal policy shift will hurt Texas citizens by leaving them vulnerable to dangerous third-world migrantsmore apt to commit violent crimes. Big League Politicshas reported on Biden’s unprecedented push for amnesty, which could mean the final death blow for the U. S. Republic:President-elect Joe Biden will introduce amnesty legislation for the more than eleven million illegal aliens residing in the United States on the first day of his presidency, according to pro-illegal immigration activists. The legislation will contain a means to provide citizenship to nearly every alien in the country, which they’ll receive through a glorified paperwork process. It’s expected that the illegals who will qualify for amnesty will be as many as eleven to twenty million, with estimates varying widely over the number of aliens in the United States. Biden haspledged to forego deportationfor any alien in the country, with the exception of those convicted of felonies. If the king-sized amnesty bill fails to get anywhere, Democrats have prepared a more reserved plan to legalize more than 5 million illegals they’re defining as essential workers. Congressional Democrats have varying opinions on the prospects of passing major immigration amnesty legislation, with Biden’s primary focus likely to be placed upon coronavirus relief, a split Senate, and a razor-thin Democratic House majority. Immigration activists have demanded that nearly every illegal alien in the country be provided United States citizenship within five years, while Kamala Harris reportedly revealed the Biden amnesty plan will require those who flouted the law to wait for eight years. Biden is likely to sign a glut of executive orders providing leniency to illegal aliens, including an extension of the DACA program that’s been continuously litigated over throughout Donald Trump’s presidency. Migrant caravans have already begun the journey from Central America to the United States, eager to receive free welfare and citizenship benefits from a incoming President who has promised to make generous concessions to illegal aliens. Texas is at least one state with a Republican Party that will stand up against the Biden regime. More states need to join them to even have a chance of stopping America’s downfall.

215,Serbia’s Protests Aren’t the Beginning of a Balkan Spring,4.25,35.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/serbias-protests-arent-the-beginning-of-a-balkan-spring-vucic-stefanovic-protests-belgrade/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. The protests, which started on Dec. 8 last year, have spread to several dozen cities across Serbia and have even inspired similar protests in Albania and Montenegro, where activists have risen up against their own crooked political classes. Last Saturday, on March 16, the demonstrations reached a new crescendo when protesters and opposition leaders in Belgrade stormed the headquarters of state broadcaster Radio Television Serbia, which led to their forced removal by riot police. That same night in Albania, protesters lobbed stones and clashed with police in front of the parliament building in Tirana. This blossoming of dissent has led some to wonder if this might be the beginning of a “Balkan Spring.”In Serbia, the protests were triggered by the beating of Borko Stefanovic, an opposition politician and leader of the Serbian Left party, in the southern city of Krusevac on November 23, 2018, where he was left bloodied and hospitalized after being assaulted by a group of assailants wielding blunt objects. The following day, one of Stefanovic’s allies, Dragan Djilas, told reporters that Vucic was “the main culprit” behind the assault. The first demonstration was held in Krusevac a week later under the banner of “Stop the Bloody Shirts” and was organized by the Alliance for Serbia, a coalition of various opposition parties that includes the Serbian Left and spans the entire breadth of the country’s political spectrum. The inaugural Belgrade protest took place the following weekend and was organized independently of the opposition alliance by a group ofstudentsfrom the University of Political Sciences. The assault on Stefanovic might have been the spark that lit the fuse, but the protesters took aim at a much greater foe than his attackers: Their target was the government in its entirety and Vucic himself, whom they blame for the deteriorating political conditions in the country. The protesters elicited a typically pigheaded response from the president, who claimed that he would not give into their demands, “even if there were 5 million people in the streets.” This was quickly adopted as their slogan: “One in 5 Million”. Although temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protests should be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011. Vucic has, lest we forget, seen out mass protests before, following his 2017 presidential election victory, when he finished 38 points ahead of his nearest competitor. For nearly two full months, citizens took to the street on an almost daily basis to protest “against the dictatorship,” as they called it. By the end of May the demonstrations had largelyfizzledout. The protesters opposed Vucic and his hegemonic rule, but they could offer no alternative. Only one opposition figure, the former ombudsman Sasa Jankovic, won more votes thana spoof candidatewho promised to build Serbia a coastline. Then, like now, the protesters lacked a serious strategy that would allow them to achieve their aims. They could mobilize a crowd, but they lacked a clearly defined path to victory, and it was inevitable that this aimlessness would eventually cause them to run out of steam. Today’s protesters have improved on their 2017 predecessors by setting out several concrete demands: They’ve called for the resignations of the interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic (a right-hand man Vucic frequently uses as an attack dog in public debates), and the health minister, Zlatibor Loncar (who allowed Vucic to pose for a hospital ward photo-op with critically ill children during a flu epidemic without wearing the appropriate medical attire and, critics allege, putting the children’s health at risk), as well astwo senior figuresat Radio Television Serbia, which is often accused of being a government mouthpiece. Protesters have also called for convictions in the unsolved 2018 assassination of Oliver Ivanovic, a Kosovo Serb politician and outspoken Vucic critic who had been a thorn in the side of the government, particularly when it came to denouncing organized crime. But it’s still unclear how they plan to extract these concessions. The protesters’ main problem is that they’re unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic’s stranglehold on national politics. Although the Alliance for Serbia has tried its hardest to attach itself to the protests, the weekly demonstrations aren’t formally affiliated with any single opposition party or political figure. The entirety of the anti-Vucic ideological spectrum is represented—from student Marxists to Bosko Obradovic, the ultranationalist leader of Dveri, a far-right opposition party of religious conservatives—sometimes causing scuffles among the protesters. This highlights the fragmented and impotent nature of the Serbian opposition, which is united by its opposition to Vucic but unable to agree on much else. The anti-Vucic movement is also hamstrung by the fact that all the opposition alternatives are deeply divisive and unpopular. The aforementioned Obradovic is a homophobe whose party opposes EU membership and wants to orientate the country towards Russia. In the 2017 election, Obradovic took 2.28 percent of the vote—four times less than the spoof candidate, Ljubisa “Beli” Preletacevic (a pseudonym for Luka Maksimovic who campaigned in character as Beli). Dveri currently holds the presidency of the Alliance for Serbia. The coalition was founded by Djilas, Belgrade’s former mayor and a key figure in the discredited Democratic Party that dominated Serbian politics between the overthrow of Milosevic and Vucic’s breakthrough 12 years later. Djilas, like other Democratic Party top brass, is widely perceived to have used his time in office to enrich himself by advancing his private business interests. Borko Stefanovic, whose beating triggered the protests, is also a Democratic Party alumnus. He served as chief negotiator in the 2008 sale of state petroleum company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), to Russia’s Gazprom Neft. The deal caused outrage for its closed tendering process and a final sale price that came out to only a fifth of NIS’s market value at the time. Many see it as a prime example of the crooked privatizations that followed Yugoslavia’s disintegration—and Vucic’s government launched an investigation into the sale in 2014. It’s deeply ironic and profoundly cynical that someone involved in the hawking of state assets now leads a party that bills itself as “Left.” Borko Stefanovic and his sometime Democratic Party colleagues need to shoulder some of the blame for the country’s current political malaise, because it was their failures in office that drove a disillusioned electorate into the arms of Vucic’s party. This considered, it should come as little surprise that the Serbian electorate remains unconvinced by the alternatives. My own grandfather is a reluctant Vucic voter who frequently complains about cuts to his pension. When I ask him why he continues to back the ruling Progressive Party, he responds with a shrug: “Who else am I going to vote for? Djilas? As if the opposition is any better.”This cuts to the heart of Serbia’s political malaise:It’s not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience a self-inflicted fall from grace. In contrast to their opponents, they still have political capital to spend. Until this changes, protesters will struggle to rally the sort of mass mobilization that finally pushed Milosevic out of power in 2000. At the moment, no one is able to present a radically different vision for the country. The Alliance for Serbia published a “30-point”political program, but two-thirds of these points are just single-line slogans. There is no Serbian Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders who can convincingly pledge to transform the country’s politics. Centrists can promise a freer media and less political violence, but for most people these are relatively minor tweaks to the status quo. Their main selling point is that they’re not Vucic. No candidate can realistically offer substantially better living standards because Serbia’s problems—an aging population, brain drain, poverty, corruption, a stagnant and left-behind economy that’s ill-equipped for the 21st century—predate the current government. Serbia’s neighbors, even ones that hold EU membership, like Croatia and Bulgaria, all face similar challenges. This would remain constant even if Vucic were to be deposed, and most voters understand that, which dents the opposition’s draw. The president’s domination over political life in Serbia also distracts from a much deeper rot in the country’s political system. Serbian politicians frequently switch parties. There have been more than 500 defectionssince the 2016 local elections, and some 45 percent of these have crossed over to Vucic’s Progressive Party. Smaller parties, like the Socialist Party of Serbia, repeatedly act as kingmakers in coalition talks, an arrangement that allows their politicians to remain in government in perpetuity. Ivica Dacic, the current foreign minister, is a prime example: a key figure in the Socialist party since the early 1990s, his closeness to Slobodan Milosevic earned him the nickname “Little Sloba.” Before taking up his current position, he served as both interior minister and prime minister in just the last decade alone. Dacic is hardly an isolated example: Zorana Mihajlovic, Maja Gojkovic, and Aleksandar Vulin are just three prominent government figures with similar resumes. This creates a malign sort of continuity in which each new government contains remnants of the one that preceded it, such that nothing ever seems to change. Even if Vucic were to step down, many of his cronies would remain in some capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint. This is why any talk of a Balkan Spring should be taken with a pinch of salt. There is no panacea that will end the country’s malaise, and meaningful, lasting change will only be achieved through a complete and total overhaul of Serbia’s institutions and political culture. Deposing Vucic might be the first step toward achieving this aim, but the challenges that follow would be much greater. The protesters should bear that in mind, otherwise this latest wave of demonstrations will amount to nothing more than a brief gust of warm wind in Serbia’s long post-Yugoslav freeze.

216,Senator Sarah McBride Won't Let Hatred Stop Her from Fighting Injustice,-8.67,41.67,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a35293172/senator-sarah-mcbride-interview/,https://adfontesmedia.com/harpers-bazaar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-26,16,"January 12, 2021, was a historic day not just for activist and politician Sarah McBride but also for the United States. McBride was sworn in as a Delaware senator, making her the country's first openly transgender senator and the highest-ranking elected transgender official. While the momentous occasion stood in stark contrast to the very different kind of history that was made less than one week earlier, when then president Donald Trump incited an insurrection at the U. S. Capitol, the Wilmington native—who is often credited with the passage of legislation in Delaware banning discrimination on the basis ofgender identityin employment, housing, and insurance—has spent the better part of her adult life maintaining focus amid stark portraits of pain, panic, or just plain pandemonium. While in college at American University, as she reckoned with her gender identity, McBride began pursuing politics with positions on former governorJack Markell's 2008 campaign and on then Delaware attorney generalBeau Biden's 2010 campaign. In 2012, just before graduation, she wrote an op-ed for the university newspaper introducing herself as a woman for the first time. It gained international thrall, and led to an internship in the Obama White House and, later, leadership roles atEquality Delawareand theHuman Rights Campaign. In 2016, she spoke at the Democratic National Convention, becoming the first openly transgender person ever to address a major party convention and shedding light on the important work that still remains in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. Now, as she begins her new role as a senator, McBride feels little fear about all the other firsts that lie ahead. Over the phone with.com, she discusses her legislative agenda, how a Biden–Harris administration will work for the LGBTQ+ community, and how she remains undeterred despite existing—and emboldened—bigotry and violence. First and foremost, it's been a whirlwind. I am filled with so much gratitude for the opportunity to serve. But even more than that, I'm filled with an incredible amount of hope. We are in a unique moment where we can tackle the big challenges that face our community and our state, and where we can make meaningful progress for the folks we have the privilege of representing. We have to ensure that Delaware continues to face the COVID-19 crisis in a science- and data-driven way, and moving forward, that we get the vaccine out as efficiently and effectively as possible to as many people as possible. But I believe, too, that the only way for us to fully recover from this crisis, for us to meet this moment and to learn the lessons of this crisis, is to ensure that our recovery is one that lifts all boats. As [President Joe] Biden says, “Build back better.” I think one of the central ways for us to do that is by passing legislation that supports and protects working families, from raising wages here in Delaware to ensuring universal paid family and medical leave for every worker. I think those are our next steps in the path toward a full and meaningful recovery. Long before January 6, there were certainly elements of hate and prejudice that didn't like seeing transgender people succeed in any capacity. As an advocate, as a candidate, and now as an elected official, they didn't begin a week ago. But the attack on the U. S. Capitol only gave further license to those who might commit violence against anyone they have a difference of opinion with or anyone who they believe to be lesser, whether that's people of a different political party or people of different backgrounds. There's no coincidence that January 6, as a culmination of years of escalating rhetoric on the part of the [former president Donald Trump] and his allies, also coincided with a rise in hate violence here in the United States. This Far Right-wing violence that we saw committed by insurrectionists at the U. S. Capitol was white supremacist violence. It was violence seeking to uphold the power of a particular community of people at the expense of the rest of the country. This violence is part and parcel of a larger, disturbing trend of increasing hate-based violence, of increasing hate-influenced violence, and of increasing prejudice and bigotry in our society. I'll be frank. From my perspective, if bigots are angry with me, I'm doing something right. I will not let hatred or even threats of violence prevent me from speaking out against injustice and pushing forward the kinds of policies that I believe benefit all of us as a society. I am clear eyed on the challenges. I am not naive to the barriers, and I'm certainly aware of the risks. But I can handle that. I'm lucky, and whatever risks I face pale in comparison to the challenges and the risks facing far too many people—trans or not—throughout our society. People are at risk of very real violence in their own communities every single day. People who have been on the receiving end of discrimination and violent attacks simply for walking out of their homes. So whatever risks I face and whatever stress that might cause me only motivates me to fight for dignity and safety and opportunity for every single person. I'm not only confident that the Biden–Harris administration will advance pro-equality policies, I'm certain they will. That means restoring protections that the Obama–Biden administration implemented that were undermined during the Trump–Pence administration. Of course, it also means pushing for the passage of the Equality Act through Congress in order to explicitly and undeniably protect LGBTQ people from discrimination throughout daily life. Joe Biden has made clear that that's a legislative priority for him and that he's eager to sign that legislation should it get to his desk. We first need to recognize the simple fact that trans candidates can not only run, but can run and win everywhere in competitive races. We saw that withDanica Roemin Virginia and withBrianna Titonein Colorado in 2018. Trans candidates are competitive candidates. Voters are hungry for political courage and for authenticity, and trans candidates bring both to the table, as well as the full range of experiences that any individual trans candidate brings beyond their identity. The second thing we need to recognize is that beyond the elected office, we need to see trans people appointed to positions of responsibility at every level of government. In Pennsylvania, for instance, there is an incredible secretary of health,Dr. Rachel Levine[President Biden's pick forassistant health secretary] who's worked with Governor [Tom] Wolf to oversee the state's COVID-19 response. She is an out transgender woman in a position of leadership in a gubernatorial administration. Finally, we need to pass the kinds of policies that ensure that LGBTQ people are not only clearly protected under law from discrimination, but are offered the same kinds of opportunities as every other person in our society. It's much more difficult to run for office and serve if you're also struggling with housing insecurity or unemployment, are without health care, and if you are fearful about walking down the street as your authentic self. Both legal and social changes are necessary for us to see more LGBTQ people in a position where they can run and to ensure that no matter the district, no matter the community, a transgender candidate can be judged on their ideas and their experiences, not just our identities. My interest in politics, government, and advocacy was never about a position or title. It was always about the fact that I felt like those were the spaces where I can help make the most change for the most number of people in the most number of ways possible. Even at a young age, when you're in the closet and struggling with whether to come out, you grapple with some of the most existential questions that you can face: What is an authentic life? What is a meaningful life? To me, a meaningful life is a life in service to others. it's a life dedicated to bringing about change. For the first 21 years of my life, it seemed that my dream of helping to make change and my identities were mutually exclusive. Since coming out, I've seen that at the end of the day, the only total limitation on our dreams is the capacity of our own imagination. I think back to seven years ago, when I stood on the floor of the Delaware State Senate [to testify on behalf of passing the Gender Identity Nondiscrimination Act] with tears in my eyes and my parents by my side fighting for my rights and the rights of thousands of other Delawareans, I looked out at a chamber where no one was like me. Now, to have the opportunity to serve in that same chamber, to stand on that same floor as my authentic self, fighting for dignity and opportunity for every single person is a small reflection of how far we've come and the knowledge that change is possible. In my campaign, I said that I wanted to be the health care senator and the paid-leave senator. Those were passions I had long before my relationship with Andy, but they were passions, informed and deepened by both Andy's life and his legacy. He spent his life fighting for more people to get the care they need. Of course, the circumstances of his life and passing deepened that commitment and illuminated for me even more how cruel our current system is for those without insurance and for those who are forced to give up their income in the face of illness. In this new role, I'm thinking every single day, as I always have since his passing, What would Andy do? His life and his legacy continue to motivate and inform my work, my service, and the change I hope to help bring about. The foundation upon which equitable care is provided is obviously training and education. We need more providers to go through training that prepares them to respectfully and effectively treat LGBTQ people, which should include recognizing that there isn't a special way to treat LGBTQ patients. Sometimes, the response LGBTQ people get for even routine traditional care is that the providers are unqualified to serve an LGBTQ person. Part of that training is also to reinforce that while there are certainly important ways to affirm an LGBTQ person, in many cases, the care that they need is identical to the care that any other person needs. We need providers who are trained and proficient in treating LGBTQ people respectfully but without presuming that their needs are so unique that that they're not qualified to provide care for them. At the federal level, I'm eager for the Biden–Harris administration to reinstate the regulations issued during the Obama–Biden administration protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination in health care. Re-implementing that regulation will protect our community and is a critical next step.

The nonpartisan agency estimated that revenue in January totaled $387 billion, while spending soared to $552 billion after Congress passed the $900 billion aid package. The most expensive provision in the legislation was the $142 billion in stimulus checks the federal government delivered in January. Spending on unemployment benefits rose to $34 billion last month from $28 billion in December. Spending on unemployment benefits, which were extended through mid-March in the latest relief bill, jumped to $34 billion last month from $28 billion in December and $3 billion in January 2020, before the crisis began. Payments on emergency rental assistance, meanwhile, cost the federal government $25 billion in January.""The largest changes in outlays compared with last year stem from coronavirus legislation,"" the CBO said.

When the people in question are believers of an insane conspiracy theory that even you couldn’t be cynical enough to concoct and expect others to believe, then it would be not only politically harmful but off-brand to deny their convictions that you are leading a secret battle against a gang of “deep state” pedophiles led by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and George Soros. Thus we have the gob-smacking sight of Donald Trump appearing at a press briefing today and not only refusing to denounce the group that has been designated a “domestic terrorism threat” by the president’s own FBI but welcoming them simply because he understands “that they like me very much, which I appreciate,” as Trump puts it. While he labels BLM marchers as terrorists, the people his own top domestic law enforcement agency are calling the true domestic terror threat are described as “people who love our country,” much like the “fine people” that he saw marching with tiki torches and Nazi symbols in Charlottesville, Virginia a few years back. Take a look for yourself, and lament the loss of logic, reason, and sanity as a pre-qualification for holding our nation’s highest office.

S. Senate race announced they would get tested. GOP U. S. Senate candidates Dr. Manny Sethi and Bill Hagerty, who have spent months campaigning while shaking hands, holding indoor events and not wearing masks, said Wednesday they would get tested for COVID-19. The dual announcements on Wednesday came after Hamilton County health officials said an attendee at a July 31 Republican dinner attended by both candidates had tested positive. The local department recommended anyone who attended the event to get tested and monitor their symptoms. Shortly after the announcement, Sethi said on Twitter he would get tested. Sethi's decision to get tested comes just days after he appeared at a West Tennessee event with U. S. Sen. Ted Cruz that was also attended by Decatur County Mayor Mike Creasy. On Tuesday, Creasy announced on Facebook he tested positive for COVID-19. During a Wednesday appearance on conservative talk radio host Hallerin Hill's show, Hagerty said he got tested and was waiting on the results. Minutes later, campaign spokeswoman Abigail Sigler told The Tennessean Hagerty's test results came back negative. The campaign also said staff members traveling with Hagerty were tested and their results also came back negative. Both Hagerty, who previously served as President Donald Trump's ambassador to Japan, and Sethi, an orthopedic trauma surgeon, have spent weeks holding and attending in-person events as they've campaigned for the GOP nomination. Neither have worn masks in public. Instead they have blamed the virus on China while stressing the importance of moving the state and the nation's economy forward. Hagerty and Sethi are both planning campaign events on Wednesday and Thursday. Hagerty's campaign said he will continue with his events as planned. Forrest Barnwell-Hagemeyer, Sethi's campaign manager, said the GOP candidate would be taking a rapid test moments before attending an event in Washington County Wednesday evening. He expected the results to come within minutes. Shortly before 9 p.m. central, Sethisaid on Twitterhis results came back negative as well. Barnewell-Hagemeyer said any members of Sethi's campaign staff who may have been exposed will also be tested. He further noted Sethi previously tested negative for COVID-19, although it was unclear when that test took place. James Mackler, who is seeking the Democratic Party's nomination, broadly criticized the GOP candidateson Twitter, saying, ""Real leaders don't put their own political gain ahead of the health/safety of those they seek to serve.""",3,Reliable,0.0210684430512016,0.289615987460815,591,3,Tennessean

Andrew Cuomo (D)signeda bill into law on Tuesday that places a two-year moratorium onfacial recognitionand other biometric surveillance in schools. The legislation will place a moratorium on public and private schools purchasing or using biometric surveillance technology until July 2022 or until a study about its use in schools is completed. Two companion bills were sent to Cuomo’s desk in July after they passed in New York’s state legislature. Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP) Executive Director Albert Fox Cahn noted that the law is the “first comprehensive ban on facial recognition” for kindergarten through 12th-grade schools in the country.“We thank Governor Cuomo for signing this historic facial recognition ban into law,” Cahn said in a statement. “Facial recognition is biased and broken, and it has no place in the classroom.”Cahn added: “This technology is documented to be more error-prone for Black and Latin/X students, compounding the human bias they face every day. We also call on New York to go further and permanently ban all government use of facial recognition.”The study in New York will have the state Office of Information Technology and the State Education Department seek feedback from teachers, parents, school safety experts, security and data experts, and student privacy experts, Cuomo’s office said. Ultimately, the study will “address specific considerations outlined in the legislation, including the technology’s potential impact on student civil liberties and privacy and how the data collected would be used.”The law was crafted and passed in the state’s legislature after Lockport Central School District activated an object and facial recognition system earlier this year.

226,Judge OVERTURNS California's 32 year ban on assault rifles after ruling it violates Second Amendment,-1.33,46.67,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9654343/U-S-judge-overturns-California-s-ban-assault-weapons.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-05,25,"A federal judge has overturned California´s three-decade-old ban on assault weapons, ruling that it violates the constitutional right to bear arms. U. S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego ruled Friday that the state´s definition of illegal military-style rifles unlawfully deprives law-abiding Californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states. He handed down the two page ruling in response to a lawsuit filed against the State of California by James Miller, Patrick Russ, Ryan Peterson and the the San Diego County Gun Owners Political Action Committee. The plaintiffs successfully argued that California's use of the term 'assault weapons' was 'a politically-concocted pejorative term designed to suggest that there is an inherently unlawful or illegitimate basis for owning otherwise common firearms protected by the Second Amendment.'They added that California banned guns which should have been lawful to own by designating them assault weapons using faulty rationales, such as a rifle's ammunition capacity. Arguing the case before Friday's ruling, the plaintiffs' ruler George M Lee said: 'The government cannot ban the constitutionally-protected firearms at issue in this case. U. S. District Judge Roger Benitez, pictured, has overturned California's 32 year-old ban on assault rifles after branding it unconstitutional'We look forward to proving that the state’s statutes, policies, and practices at issue in this case are both unconstitutional and irrational.'The lawsuit went on reference Judge Benitez’s earlier ruling that California’s ban on high-capacity magazines was unconstitutional. Benitez later stayed his own order. John Dillon, who also served as attorney for the plaintiffs', added: 'This is a straightforward case to protect our clients’ constitutional rights and property.'The state of California’s ban on these firearms will fail constitutional scrutiny for the same reasons that its ban on firearm magazines did.'California first restricted assault weapons in 1989, with multiple updates to the law since then. California has ended its ban on assault rifles after 32 years. Pictured are three variations of an AR-15 assault rifle handed in as part of a Californian amnesty in 2012California´s attorney general Rob Bonta argued that assault weapons as defined by the law are more dangerous than other firearms and are disproportionately used in crimes and mass shootings. But Benitez said the guns are overwhelmingly owned for legal purposes. The Golden State could see gun laws relaxed even more from next month, with Dillon also representing Matthew Jones and Thomas Furrh. They say California's ban on anyone under the age of 21 owning guns is age-discrminiation, and infringes on the rights of law-abiding young adults. That suit wants the law changed so that people aged 18 and over can buy a gun.",3,Reliable,0.091328197945845,0.4075863678804856,596,1,Daily Mail

Ron Wyden (D-OR). President Joe Bidensignedthe American Rescue Plan Act into law in March. It directs the Treasury Department to distribute billions of dollars in stimulus funding to local and state governments. Those funds can be used to improve broadband access, but the bill severely limits the eligibility criteria for such projects. The bill says that only unserved or underserved communities can use the federal funding to improve broadband access, asnotes. According to the Federal Communications Commission, communities with internet speedsof under 25 Mbps downand 3 Mbps up are underserved. That definition has remained the same since 2015. Wyden says those speeds are not nearly fast enough for current needs, calling that benchmark ""woefully outdated."" He wants communities where speeds are less than 100 Mbps up and down to be classed as underserved and to be eligible for upgraded internet infrastructure under this plan.“The mass adoption of video calling, streaming, and other bandwidth-intensive apps by Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that miserly speeds and data caps are holding back telework, remote education and telehealth capacity,” Wyden wrote ina letterto Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “Simply put, it is not possible for a family of four to telework and engage in remote schooling while sharing 3 Mbps of upload bandwidth.”Wyden went on to argue that a failure to address concerns “will further expand the digital divide and jeopardize our ability as a nation to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as you finalize the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Final Rule, I urge [Yellen] to clarify that underserved locations include anywhere affordable, reliable broadband of at least 100 Mbps symmetric is not available."" Wyden added that ""to be accessible, broadband must also be affordable.""Other lawmakers have been pushing the FCC to upgrade the definition of high-speed broadband to 100 Mbps up and down. Earlier this month, California announced a budget plan thatearmarked $9 billion for internet infrastructure, noting that ""service at speeds below 100 Mbps is not enough for households who are juggling the demands of distance learning, telework, and accessing health care online.""",3,Reliable,-0.0324074074074074,0.3596440596440597,539,3,Engadget
229,Twitter bots and memorialized users will become ‘new account types’ in 2021 – TechCrunch,-0.67,49.67,https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-verification-bots-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/techcrunch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,19,"After a period of public feedback, Twitter adjusted some its plans for anew verification process,set to roll out next year. The company suspended publicverification applications in 2017and since appears to have rethought a few aspects of what information the platform should signal to its users, blue checks and beyond. One big verification-adjacent change around the corner: Twitter plans to add a way of distinguishing bots and other automated accounts.“… It can be confusing to people if it’s not clear that these accounts are automated,” the companywrote in a blog post. “In 2021, we’re planning to build a new account type to distinguish automated accounts from human-run accounts to make it easier for people to know what’s a bot and what’s not.”Of course,not all bots are good bots, but automated accounts have flourished on the platform since its early days and bots remain some of themost useful,whimsicaland otherwise beloved sources of tweets. Twitter to relaunch account verifications in early 2021, asks for feedback on policyThe company is also working on a better way to handle accounts for users who have died, and plans to introduce a memorialization process in 2021. Twitter says that memorialized accounts, like bots, will become “a new account type,” making them distinct from normal users. The idea grew out of the same spirit asTwitter’s labels for political figures, which sought to provide contextual info about users that can be seen at a glance. Taking more than 22,000 pieces of feedback on the new verification process into account, Twitter will no longer require a profile bio or header picture to verify users, calling its former thinking “too restrictive.” It’s also redefined a few of its eligible verification categories, expanding “sports” to include esports and adding more language around digital content creators into the entertainment category. Twitter also apparently received a lot of suggestions calling for additional verification categories for scientists, academics and religious figures. Until it spins out more categories, those users can seek verification under the “activists, organizers, and other influential individuals” catch-all category. Verification applicants will need to apply under a particular category and provide links or other information supporting their application. The new “self-serve” verification process will be available through account settings on both mobile and desktop. Twitter will implement the new account verification policy on January 20, 2021, three years after freezing the process. The company did not specify when public verification applications will be accepted again, but it sounds like the wait won’t be too long and the company plans to share more soon. Starting on the 20th, Twitter will begin sweeping out inactive verified accounts and others that don’t meet its new bar for a “complete account.”In theadjusted policy, a complete account — and one eligible for verification — must have a verified email or phone number, a profile image and a display name. Anyone who’s verified but doesn’t meet those criteria will receive notifications of the required changes, which must be made before January 20. Twitter’s new policy also lays out the company’s right to revoke verification for accounts in “severe or repeated violation” of the platform’s rules. It sounds like new policy could lay a clearer path for the company to take against users who break the rules, though that ultimately will come down to enforcement rather than written policies.“We will continue to evaluate such accounts on a case-by-case basis, and will make improvements in 2021 on the relationship between enforcement of our rules and verification,” Twitter wrote in the post. Twitterpaused the verification processin November, 2017 following a public outcry over its decision toverify Jason Kessler. Kessler infamously organized the Unite the Right event in Charlottesville, Virginia that gathered neo-Nazis and white supremacists, ultimately leaving one peaceful counterprotester dead. The pause was extended the next year as the company decided to direct more resources toward election integrity. With the midterms and the general U. S. election behind it, Twitter has returned to its effort to rethink the verification process and what it symbolizes for users on the platform. The company is also experimenting with new features that could dial down harassment, toxicity and misinformation. Twitter recentlyadded friction to the retweet processin an effort to slow the spread of misinformation, though itrolled the change backafter the election. Twitter’s latest test: A new pop-up that displays shared interests and a profile bio when a user goes to reply to someone they don’t follow. Sometimes you have more in common than you think.

230,"Frozen but not forgiven, US student loans are coming due again soon",-12.0,45.67,https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2021/06/frozen-but-not-forgiven-us-student-loans-are-coming-due-again-soon.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-08,25,"For millions of Americans, there’s an unwelcome side of the return to business-as-usual after the pandemic: They’ll have to start repaying their student loans again. More than 40 million holders of federal loans are due to start making monthly installments again on Oct. 1, when the freeze imposed as part of COVID-19 relief measures is due to run out. It covered payments worth about $7 billion a month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated. Their resumption will eat a chunk out of household budgets, in a potential drag on the consumer recovery. Americans now owe about $1.7 trillion of student debt, more than twice the size of their credit-card liabilities. Politicians recognize it’s not sustainable. Yet for all the talk of loan forgiveness during last year’s election campaign — including from President Joe Biden, who promised to write off at least $10,000 per borrower — there’s been no progress toward shrinking the pile. Graduates fresh out of college or postgrad programs, when incomes are typically lower, tend to find payment especially hard. Since the U. S. economy is still 7.6 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels, many more of them are likely to be out of work now. But the student debt problem reaches deep into pretty much every demographic. Black borrowers are most likely to struggle, studies have shown. Retirees as well as recent graduates are on the hook. And the impact on the wider economy shows up in all kinds of ways. Student debt is one reason why record numbers of younger Americans still live with their parents. It acts as a brake for people who’d otherwise want to start families or businesses — and leaves millions of households short of cash to spend or invest. “I’m going to have to probably get a second job,” speculates Dan Ott, 55, a management consultant in San Francisco who has about $200,000 in student debt. “We will have to cut back, and it will certainly be painful.”Before the pandemic, it was clear that Americans were having trouble meeting their student-debt obligations. Loans in serious delinquency (more than 90 days late) exceeded $135 billion before the freeze — a higher rate than for most kinds of debt. The New York Fed cautioned that the real number of loans gone bad is likely twice as high, since many borrowers haven’t reached the stage where they have to start making payments. What’s made the squeeze worse is that college degrees — which are now much more widespread — turned out to be assets with a diminishing return in terms of enhanced earnings, according to a study by the St. Louis Federal Reserve.”For recent generations and for non-white students, the payoffs are somewhat lower than average,” wrote analysts William Emmons, Ana Hernández Kent and Lowell Ricketts. “The conventional wisdom about college is not as true as it used to be.”‘Fundamentally Broken’The sense that degrees have been mis-sold underlies some of the calls for debt forgiveness. Many Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have called for write-offs of $50,000 or more per borrower. Local leaders are pressuring the Biden administration to take action. Even some Republicans have joined in. Wayne Johnson, the Trump administration’s first student-aid chief, said the student-loan system is fundamentally broken. He proposed not just $50,000 in debt relief but also a similar sum in tax credits to those who paid for college already. Biden has resisted calls from within his party to write off the loans via executive order. In early April, he asked Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to prepare a memo on the president’s legal authority to cancel debt. The administration has said it will review existing programs aimed at easing the student debt burden, including those known as income-based repayment plans that tie a borrower’s monthly bills to their earnings. Chelsea Barnes-Walker, currently living in Knoxville, Tennessee, says she enrolled in one of those plans to avoid defaulting. College for Barnes-Walker was a winding path that saw the 31-year-old attend six different schools. Financial expenses associated with the loss of her mother shortly after graduating made it impossible to keep to her schedule of $400-a-month payments over ten years. She’s been able to reduce that to below $200 under an income-based plan — but will now be paying for 25 years. The coming generation of students should think hard about the balance sheet, she says: “Many kids are pressured to figure out what careers they want to achieve. And most figure out too late that it was not worth the debt.”‘Incredibly Depressing’Other steps the government has taken include allowing employers to contribute toward monthly student loan payments as a tax-free benefit. The pandemic relief bill in March last year allowed firms to reimburse employees up to $5,250 annually. Malia Rivera, a 46-year old marketing executive with Austin, Texas-based Innovetive Petcare, says her employer has partnered withGiftofCollege.com, a platform that bridges automatic payroll deductions to student loans and college savings accounts. Rivera says she’s made sure to keep up the payments on her own student loan even through the freeze. She says she’s learned after “racking up late fees over the years and navigating the trials and tribulations of career advancement” that automatic deductions as soon as she gets paid are the best route — and it’s helped lower her balance to about $8,000 from $38,000. That took time. “I have been in a ‘long-term relationship’ with my student loan,” says Rivera, recalling the initial payment that she made in the first month of her marriage. “My husband is celebrating his 15-year anniversary with me…and my student loan.”Still, for many borrowers the COVID-19 freeze on repayments made a big difference — and it’s now due to expire. Liz Tarzon, 49, who works for a non-profit in San Francisco, has been chipping away at her student loan for more than 20 years. This past year, she says, “I have felt that my head was above water financially for the first time since starting to repay.”But she’s aware the reprieve was temporary, and expects she’ll be making the payments until retirement — or beyond. “It’s an incredibly depressing thought.”",3,Reliable,0.0588902220967438,0.4300647390049565,1390,3,The Oregonian

232,Missouri voters narrowly approve Medicaid expansion,-3.33,49.33,https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-voters-narrowly-approve-medicaid-expansion/article_197d1897-5978-5daa-b9dc-3017e3a0ae06.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/st-louis-post-dispatch/,2020-08-05,19,"JEFFERSON CITY — Ignoring pleas from Republican leaders, Missouri voters approved a plan Tuesday to expand Medicaid coverage to more than 230,000 low-income people in the state. Missouri voted to expand its Medicaid program, as 53% of voters supported the measure. Missouri now joins 37 other states that have already expanded the federally subsidized health insurance program. The decision will mean adults between the ages of 19 and 65 whose income is at or below 138% of the federal poverty level will be covered. As of this year, that amounts to $17,608 for an individual and $36,156 for a household of four. The vote comes after repeated rejections by the GOP-controlled Legislature after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 allowed states to expand who can get coverage. The constitutional amendment marks the latest setback for Republicans when it comes to ballot initiatives. Voters also approved a minimum wage hike and rejected a right-to-work law pushed by former Gov. Eric Greitens in 2018.“Our campaign couldn’t have happened without the work of countless Missourians across the state who have been working towards expanding Medicaid for years. We would not be here today without the hard work of so many for so long. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank everyone who has worked toward this moment,” organizers of the Yes on 2 campaign said in a Facebook message Tuesday night. The federal government now covers about 65% of Medicaid costs, while the rest comes from the state. But populations covered under Medicaid expansion would have 90% covered by federal funding. An analysis by the Washington University-basedCenter for Health Economics and Policyfound that expansion would add 231,000 adults and 40,500 children to the rolls, costing the state $118 million a year. But that additional cost would be offset by savings elsewhere, as well as an increase in tax revenue because of a boost in spending on health care services. The bottom line: Missouri would save $39 million a year by expanding the program. Supporters also say the increase in federal money flowing to doctors, hospitals and other providers could spur the creation of thousands of jobs. A fiscal note filed by Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat running for governor, suggests the expansionwill either save $1 billion or cost $200 million. BJC HealthCare president and CEORichard Liekwegearlier told the Post-Dispatch that he believes Medicaid expansion would be an economic boost for the state.“It’ll keep small, rural hospitals open that are operating on a thread of an operating margin today,” Liekweg said. “For large systems — like BJC, SSM, St. Luke’s in Kansas City, CoxHealth in Springfield, Mercy Health — it will allow us to continue to keep all of our doors and access points open.”Hospitals bankrolled the “Yes on 2” campaign with more than $10 million in contributions. In the week leading up to the vote, opponents said the added cost would result in less funding for schools, universities and other social service programs. Gov. Mike Parson warned the strain of the pandemic on state coffers made it the wrong time to expand.“I don’t think it’s the time to be expanding anything in the state of Missouri right now. There’s absolutely not going to be any extra money whatsoever,” the Republican governor said. But other states that have expanded the program haven’t seen a massive drain on their budgets. Rather, studies have found that expansions resulted in reductions in uncompensated care costs for hospitals and clinics, which has helped stabilized struggling, rural hospitals. In neighboring Arkansas, which expanded Medicaid in January 2014, a2015 Gallup reportshowed the state’s uninsured rate had been cut roughly in half, dropping from 22.5% to 11.4% ― the biggest reduction in the nation.

Michael Ziemba, 49, may have lucked out due to a controversial provision of the state’s landmark 2019 bail reform -- a perceived loophole that has since been addressed. Soon after Ziemba fled the scene of the crash that killed pedestrian Jason Quackenbush, a new law prohibited the judge from keeping him jailed on bail. Quackenbush was walking to a friend’s house for the night when he was struck near the CSX railroad bridge on the Parkway. He died several days later in the hospital. Ziemba fled and ditched the car, which was found with 24 hours. Jason QuackenbushOn Tuesday, a free Ziemba came into court to plead guilty to felony leaving the scene of Quackenbush’s crash. He agreed to spend 2 to 6 years in prison. But he gets to remain free until sentencing Oct. 28, his lawyer, Matthew Dotzler, said. Ziemba’s freedom during the fatal crash prosecution caused a stir last year when a frustrated judge, Thomas J. Miller, saidhe had no choice to but release Ziemba from jailunder the state’s 2019 bail reform law. The law at the time did not allow bail to be set in fatal crash cases, beginning Jan. 1, 2020. That’s despite the fact that Ziemba had driven in dangerous ways before: hespent time in prison two decades agofor a drugged-driving crash that injured four -- including a mother and her 14-year-old daughter. The bail reform law that sprung Ziemba has since been amended: bail is now allowed to be set on any case that causes a death. But that amendment only applied to crimes committed beginning this summer. (As an aside, there’s a legal question over whether Ziemba’s crime caused a death -- he was accused of leaving the scene of a fatal crash, not being criminally responsible for the death itself -- he’s not charged with speeding or drinking, for example.)In any case, the bail law at the time required Ziemba to be released as of Jan. 1. Onondaga County prosecutor Susan Azzarellidelayed Ziemba’s release for monthsby reopening an old domestic violence case against Ziemba, forcing him to serve an eight-month jail sentence (shortened due to prior jail time and standard reductions for good behavior). That was supposed to be enough time to prosecute Ziemba in the Parkway fatality. But the court shutdown during the pandemic adjourned Ziemba’s case for so long that his sentence in the domestic case ran out a couple months ago, and he was released from jail, his lawyer said. There was nothing more prosecutors could do to keep him locked up on bail. State Supreme Court Justice Gordon Cuffy continued Ziemba’s release after his plea Tuesday: after all, Ziemba had come back to court when required, which is the legal purpose of bail in the first place. Ziemba will begin his 2-to-6 year prison sentence when he returns to court for sentencing Oct. 28. He had faced a maximum of 2 1/3 to 7 years in prison, if convicted after trial.",3,Reliable,0.0275401069518716,0.3256238859180035,733,3,Syracuse Post-Standard

The5-4 decisionwas led by the court’s conservative justices and dissented by its liberal wing. The ruling reverses a determination by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which stated that migrants can only be put in immigration detention within 24 hours of their release from criminal custody, as opposed to months, or even years later. The case’s lead plaintiff, Cambodian refugee Mony Preap, was a legal permanent resident with two drug convictions. He was detained, and faced possible removal proceedings in 2013, years after being released from criminal custody, according to the court document. The conservative justices argued that the earlier ruling “spare[s] terrorist aliens from the rigors of mandatory detention” and would be “gentler on terrorists than it is on garden-variety offenders.”Justice Samuel Alito said the fact that “the alien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail” is “especially hard to swallow.”This “unsparing deadline” will often “be missed for reasons beyond the Federal Government’s control,” he said, adding that the majority ruling was to ensure homeland security officials would not be constrained. Justice Stephen Breyer of the court’s dissenting liberal wing asserted the ruling could prevent bail hearings for immigrants with even minor criminal records. This could cause “serious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood.”“[The immigrants] may have established families and put down roots in a community,” Breyer said. “These aliens may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release.”Tuesday’s ruling hands a victory to the Trump Administration, which last week sought tougher immigration policies. Last September, the administrationproposed a rulethat would make immigrants who use public benefits ineligible for green cards or to get admitted to the U.

Ryan Fischer, 30, reportedly took three of the pop singer's French Bulldogs—Koji, Miss Asia and Gustav—out for a walk in WestHollywoodaround 10 p.m. on Wednesday. During the evening stroll, two men wearing baseball caps came out from the backseat of what appeared to be a white sedan that rolled up on Fischer. One of the men shot Fischer in the chest four times, with what police said was a semi-automatic handgun, before getting away in the vehicle with Koji and Gustav on Sierra Bonita Avenue. A surveillance camera from a neighbor's home captured the confrontation. The footage was made available at the request of Gaga's team who wanted to use it to track down the shooter. In the disturbingfootage, one of the assailants was heard cocking his gun and saying, ""give it up,"" before firing the shots. One of the singer's bodyguards was later photographed coming out of the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood headquarters with Miss Asia. Police arrived at the scene and discovered Fischer conscious but having difficulty breathing. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment and is expected to make a full recovery. Various news outlets were unable to confirm if the suspects targeted the singer's French Bulldogs or if it was a random attack. According to the American Kennel Club, French Bulldogs are the 4th most popular breed of dogs and are prone to be targeted by thieves since they are expensive and their small size makes it easier to steal. Tara Bruno, the founder of SNORT Rescue, toldFrench Bulldogs cost roughly between $3,000 and $5,000.

236,Biden administration moving to double tariffs on Canadian lumber despite already skyrocketing timber prices,13.67,39.33,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-double-tariff-canadian-lumber-skyrocketing-prices,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-27,25,"The Biden administration is recommending doubling tariffs on Canadian lumber despite the current skyrocketing prices for the materials for U. S. consumers.“At a time when soaring lumber prices have added nearly $36,000 to the price of a new home and priced millions of middle-class households out of the housing market, the Biden administration’s preliminary finding on Friday to double the tariffs on Canadian lumber shipments into the U. S. shows the White House does not care about the plight of American home buyers and renters who have been forced to pay much higher costs for housing,”National Association of Home Builders chairman Chuck Fowke said in a statement. The move, which would raise tariffs on Canadian lumber from 8.99% to 18.32%, comes as lumber pieces in the U. S. jumped 275% since last April.“The administration should be ashamed for casting its lot with special interest groups and abandoning the interests of the American people,” Fowke said. BUYING OR BUILDING A HOME CONTINUES TO GET COSTLIERThe finding was also heavily criticized by Canadian authorities, who called the increase a “tax on the American people.”“U. S. duties on Canadian softwood lumber products are a tax on the American people. They make housing less affordable for Americans and hinder economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mary Ng, a Canadian MP and the minister of small business, export promotion, and international trade.“We will keep challenging these unwarranted and damaging duties through all available avenues. We remain confident that a negotiated solution to this long-standing trade issue is not only possible, but in the best interest of both our countries,” she added. Canada has successfully challenged U. S. lumber tariffs before, most recently after former President Donald Trump’s administration imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian lumber. That number was brought back down to 9% after the World Trade Organization ruled in Canada’s favor. The Trump tariffs resulted in skyrocketing prices at the time, though from a much lower base than the current prices. But U. S. lumber manufacturers praised the findings, saying such tariffs are necessary to create a “level playing field” for U. S. businesses.“A level playing field is a critical element for continued investment and growth for U. S. lumber manufacturing to meet strong building demand to build more American homes,” U. S. Lumber Coalition co-chair Jason Brochu said in a statement.“More lumber being manufactured in America to meet domestic demand is a direct result of the trade enforcement, and we strongly urge the Administration to continue this enforcement,” he added. Deacon Lumber Company founder Stinson Dean urged a “ceasefire” between the countries on the hot button trade issue in hopes that the two sides could come to a solution that will help increase the supply of lumber to U. S. consumers. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER“In my mind, any tax on Canadian lumber incentivizes them to look to sell to other markets. The U. S. needs all the supply it can get-and buyers will clearly pay for it-but if it doesn’t exist, it brings construction to a halt.

237,"As Taliban Atrocities Mount, Afghans Urge International Sanctions",-1.0,42.67,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taliban-biden-sanctions_n_6116c832e4b01da700f5a9dd,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,25,"President Joe Biden is extremely unlikely to reverse his plan to wind down America’s 20-year mission in Afghanistan even as Taliban militants sweep through the country, massacring their opponents and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. But Afghans argue that the U. S. still has considerable power to influence the Taliban even after most American troops leave the country: through international sanctions. This week, a Washington-based advocacy group called the Afghanistan-U. S. Democratic Peace and Prosperity Council began lobbying Congress and the Biden administration to seek new United Nations sanctions on Taliban figures. Its effort has not been previously reported. Separately, Afghan foreign minister Haneef AtmartoldThe Wall Street Journal that world powers should reinstate U. N. travel restrictions on Taliban leaders.“While the Biden administration is resolved in leaving Afghanistan, it still can lead within international institutions. The Taliban will not respect its calls for peace without a show of force,” the group said in a Friday statement. “Without the U. S. to lead on sanctions, other nations will move to recognize the Taliban in efforts to stem an inevitable refugee crisis. This would be an absolute failing of the U. S. and the international community.”Supporters of stronger sanctions hope they will convince the Taliban to slow its onslaught. When the ultraconservative armed movement previously ruled Afghanistan, it was a pariah. Combined with the toll of a civil war and the Taliban’s repression, that isolation made life miserable for most Afghans. In negotiating with Washington as they seek to regain power, Taliban representatives have repeatedly said they do not want to lose foreign support like the aid and expertise that Afghanistan has come to rely on since the U. S. invasion in 2001. Tougher international restrictions on prominent Taliban members could show that countries will shun a Taliban-dominated government in Afghanistan if it violates rights standards and steamrolls other local players like pro-Western Afghans. Without a global rebuke of the offensive, however,Chinaor other powers like Iran might soon decide to acknowledge the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate leader, killing the prospect of a multinational effort to limit the group’s brutality. U. N. sanctions could affect prominent Taliban members who are based in Qatar, the small Persian Gulf state that hosted the talks leading to the U. S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and other Taliban forces in Pakistan. A senior Afghan lawmaker who recently fled a Taliban offensive explained their support for sanctions to HuffPost.“Those who have committed atrocities have to be recognized internationally. They will understand that they will not receive legitimacy if they continue to do atrocities,” said the lawmaker, who requested anonymity for fear of Taliban retribution against family members who are still under the group’s rule. “The U. N., the U. S. and other countries who are involved in Afghanistan should understand that … with keeping quiet about the atrocities that the Taliban are doing, they are inviting the Taliban to do that.”As the Taliban have taken over Afghan cities and districts in recent weeks, they havedetainedand killed relatives of officials in the U. S.-backed Afghan government,forcedwomen to marry their fighters andtargetedjournalists. The lawmaker said that civil servants and activists in their hometown were told by local Taliban representatives to surrender and provide information like their home addresses; the lawmaker advised them not to because those details would make it easier for them to be hunted down. The Taliban is also forcing local families to provide young men as fighters, the parliamentarian added. An international response matters because Afghans are deeply affected by apparent global apathy toward them, the lawmaker said. “We are demoralized, we cannot continue, because we think the world is backing the Taliban instead of the people of Afghanistan.”An official at the U. S. mission to the U. N. said that the Biden administration is open to tightening sanctions.“If the Taliban continues down their current path of violence it will affect the Security Council’s review of the travel ban exemption and the status of designations,” the official told HuffPost via email. The official did not comment on potential new sanctions. Biden aides say the U. S. continues to support the Afghan government and wants the Taliban to halt its assault in favor of talks to establish a power-sharing agreement. But the administration knows the next few weeks could bring a very different outcome. The president sent 3,000 troops to Afghanistan on Thursday to help withdraw many of the staff at the sprawling U. S. embassy in Kabul and he is speeding up efforts to evacuateAfghans who previously worked with American forcesand are now Taliban targets. The Taliban’s takeover of more than two-thirds of Afghanistan ― and the collapse of U. S.-backed government forces in many areas ― has occurred far more quickly than American and Afghan officials expected, suggesting they could soon take their ultimate prize, Kabul. The continued onslaught risks millions of Afghans’ lives and could shatter the society that has developed in the country over the last two decades, as women have come closer than ever to equal rights and foreign assistance has improved issues like humanitarian conditions and press freedoms. The lawmaker who escaped a recent Taliban assault said it was hard to believe how quickly their life seemed to crumble. One month ago, they were telling contacts abroad that instead of seeking safe passage out of the country for progressive Afghans, they should support their attempts to stay in their homes. “Now, after the things I saw, I think we have to find ways to leave instead … It’s better to have someone alive outside the country instead of someone who’s dead inside of the country.”To the parliamentarian, like many Afghans, recent developments echo painful memories of Afghanistan’s civil war of the 1980s.“It’s the same stories that my mom was telling me: We left everything behind, we had only one small bag,” they said. “Now this has happened to me.”At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

238,Cultivating a Politics of Restraint,0.0,39.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/cultivating-politics-restraint,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,18,"For the first time in a long time, American elites are having a thoroughgoing conversation over America’s role in the world. A broad spectrum of opinion — broader than usual, that is — informs the debate. To oversimplify, on one end of the spectrum are advocates of the status quo. They want America to maintain an expansive, expensive, and ambitious strategy for militarily dominating the international system. On the other end are advocates of restraint — a strategy that calls for trimming America’s global military commitments and relinquishing its global cop role while staying engaged through free trade, robust diplomacy, and active participation in international organizations, as well as a powerful military. In hopes of finding a politically viable middle ground, Georgetown University’s Charles Kupchan proposes a compromise that he suggests could guide the United States towards “judicious retrenchment” while also avoiding too radical a departure from, as he refers to it, “Pax Americana.”…The restrainers and liberal internationalists are both wrong. As the United States enters the post‐​Trump era, in which Americans will have neither the wherewithal to run the world nor the luxury of running away from it, the nation will need to find a middle way. The task for the United States in the years ahead will be to maintain its role as an anchor of geopolitical stability while at the same time avoiding overstretch. Leave aside the question of whether U. S. foreign policy can really be said to be “the anchor of stability.” Kupchan mischaracterizes the parameters of the debate. Aiming for the middle ground, he lands out of bounds. For Kupchan, the debate is not between advocates of restraint and advocates of the status quo; rather, it’s between the status quo and “isolationism,” a term he erroneously equates with restraint. There is little grounds for describing any serious trend in American politics, and certainly policymaking, as “isolationist.” President Trump was the closest we have come to a national figure advocating isolationism, and he was not an isolationist. The compromise Kupchan recommends is for the United States to “continue playing the role of great‐​power pacifier while abandoning its attempts to serve as the global policeman.” Even if policymakers could discern the difference between these two postures, it is unlikely to effectively curb U. S. activism. Its outsize power and position atop the international hierarchy since the end of WWII has led the United States to pursue expansive strategies that constantly tempt policymakers to intervene and become militarily entangled in the dangerous web of international politics to a much greater extent than necessary. There are no built‐​in mechanisms that reliably protect against the constant temptation to expand and intervene. If the premises of the strategy are broad enough, Washington will be sure to overshoot. Elected officials of both parties respond to this temptation. As my former colleague Emma Ashford explained, “both [Trump] and Barack Obama came into office promising to change America’s foreign policy, but when faced with crises, both yielded to pressure to intervene. This bias toward action is one of the biggest problems in American foreign policy. It produces poorly thought‐​out interventions and, sometimes, disastrous long‐​term consequences…”It is precisely because American elites have been socialized over generations into accepting special responsibilities in global security that a narrow strategy cautiously circumscribing this temptation to expand is what we most need. The idea is similar to what Thomas Jefferson said of the U. S. Constitution: “in questions of power then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution.”Ultimately, a nation’s grand strategy is going to reflect its politics, and the political establishment still reflects the past 80 years of expanding our concept of the national interest to allow for constant military intervention, global order management, and much tragedy. The politics, however, show some signs of change. Lately it seems the American people by and large are attracted to politicians calling for the United States to bring its focus back home. Many who employ rhetoric about “ending endless wars” seem to get special attention from voters. For anyone who appreciates the recent excesses in U. S. foreign policy and believes in the need to rein it in, now is an exciting time to propose more prudent strategies. But given the sheer inertia of U. S. primacy and the fickleness of its politics, proposing strategies that merely snip at the edges of “Pax Americana” will do little cultivate what is most needed in U. S. foreign policy: restraint in the face of temptation.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0011120339608711,0.3647748246585456,993,3,Cato Institute

After the officers opened fire, the suspect was shot and later pronounced dead at a local hospital.“Exactly what that suspect did with that handgun that led the officers to fire at him, will be determined through body worn cameras and through interviewing the officers and the multiple witnesses who were here before the shooting,” LAPD detective Meghan Aguilar said Thursday. “The suspect was struck by gunfire and transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased.”The incident occurred around between 11:20 a.m. and 11:55 a.m. on the intersection of Wilcox Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. A replica handgun was found on scene and interviews are being conducted with people who may have been assaulted by the suspect. As of this writing, the Hollywood Boulevard area is still blocked off as the incident is being investigated. Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

242,"8 Journalists on Reporting While Black, With the Weight of History on Their Shoulders",-6.67,41.0,https://www.glamour.com/story/8-black-women-journalists-on-reporting-police-brutality,https://adfontesmedia.com/glamour-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-03,18,"Before Errin Haines took her current job as the editor-at-large ofThe 19th, a soon-to-launch nonprofit newsroom reporting on gender and politics, she was the national race writer for the Associated Press.“A lot of the work I did was around the killings of unarmed Black people by the police and by vigilantes,” she says. “And when I moved on from that job, I thought I had moved on from that work. I certainly didn’t think I would be doing this work in the midst of a pandemic. But here we are.”“Here” is in the middle of dual public health crises: thecoronavirus—which has claimed more than 100,000 lives and pummeled people of color with disproportionate force—andracism. Across all 50 states and around the world, people have taken to the streets to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless other victims of state-sanctioned violence, risking their lives to call for change. On the ground with them, Black reporters are bearing a unique burden. The undercurrent of civil unrest, frustration, and grief isn’t just a familiar headline; it’s personal. And covering it for hours on end, with little sleep, exacts a toll. For Black women in the media, who have to contend with both racism and sexism, the cost is steep. Here, eight journalists reflect on what it means to do their jobs in this era. I have felt over the past few weeks a little bit of déjà vu, with the same narrative unfolding time and time again. And that is frustrating to me as a person. It’s also frustrating to me as a reporter, because I remember covering Ferguson in 2014 and Charlottesville in 2017, and I was telling the same stories back then as I’m telling now. But I have evolved a little bit on how I approach it. Because what we are talking about is a question of human rights. And I think it’s important not to present that as a both-sides issue. It is self-evident that policing in America, for example, has disproportionately targeted Black people. When I go on the air, it’s not about convincing people that that is a real thing. It’s not my responsibility to hold the hand of people who are willfully ignoring reality and pull them toward something that is obvious. That’s not what I as a reporter have to do. It is about telling people, “This is a real thing, and if you choose not to acknowledge it, you’re going to have a hard time understanding what’s happening in this country right now.”At CNN, we get it. This is a company that was started in Atlanta, the birthplace of the civil rights movement. I don’t think that inside CNN I have to explain this stuff to people. But I am a political reporter, so I am often asked to come on air and talk about these issues, and I accept that. Since we’re being honest, it is exhausting, and of course there are times when you want to be able to just sit and not have to be on television, attempting to articulate the pain and the anger that has built up over decades and decades. But I don’t have that option. I became a journalist in part because of the reporters who in the 1960s were out there documenting racial terrorism. Those are the people who inspired me. And I’m sure those journalists were sometimes tired too. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. This is personal. As Black reporters, we understand this on another level. I have two brothers who are Black men. This moment—since Ferguson—has shaped them. And they’ve had their own experiences with law enforcement. I grew up with a dad who was always afraid he’d be pulled over. We have lived these experiences, and I recognize that a lot of white reporters might not have lived these experiences. Over the weekend I was supposed to be onon CNN just after Omar Jimenez’s live hit. He’s a good friend of mine, so I was watching him. And as I was sitting there waiting to go on television, I could hear him getting arrested. I know Omar well. For a while, we lived in the same apartment building. I have to be honest that listening to that was one of the most horrifying and terrifying experiences of my life. When the officers were handcuffing him, he looked up at the camera, and I could see in his eyes just a feeling of fear. And it’s something I have seen before because I have seen it in the eyes of Black men I know who have been arrested by police for what seems like no reason. It was awful. That moment to me was not just about Omar or even about the press. I know a lot of reporters who were upset because it happened to a journalist. It wasn’t that for me. It was about what happens when people are arrested for no good reason and when Black men are arrested for no good reason, and what made it so terrifying was their willingness to do it on live television. So many people do not get to have their arrest recorded. But here it was happening to a young Black man and not even being on live television could stop it. Weekend Todayand NBC News White House correspondentAs storefronts shattered and fires burned blocks from their home in Philadelphia, my father, a white man, told me he never thought he would see protests like those he and my mother, a Black woman, witnessed in the 1960s. “History is repeating itself,” he warned. His words stopped me cold. My parents got married three years after the Supreme Court, in 1967, struck down laws banning interracial marriage. Their courage to wed 50 years ago shaped my view of the world, and my role in it. Growing up as a biracial child, the idea of helping people of different races and backgrounds better communicate inspired me to become a journalist. My father’s words reminded me that the sense of responsibility that got me into journalism more than 20 years ago is what needs to guide me right now. With protesters demanding change after George Floyd’s death, it is more important than ever that everyone has a voice and elected leaders from the White House to City Hall are held accountable for their words and actions, or lack thereof. The same year the Supreme Court paved the way for my parents’ marriage, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to students at a junior high school not far from my childhood home. “And when you discover what you will be in your life,” Dr. King said, “set out to do it as if God Almighty called you at this particular moment in history to do it.”I keep those words close in this moment, but also after the fires are out and our neighborhoods appear back to their usual rhythms. Because much work remains, and we each have a role to play. The Reporton QuibiThe last two weeks feel like they’ve lasted two years. Before the protests, I was traveling and profiling a Black teenager who lost her father to COVID-19 before her high school graduation. I came home to the stories of Christian Cooper and George Floyd. Then I woke up to see my friend, reporter Omar Jimenez, arrested by the Minneapolis police on television. There’s only so much harm to Black people that I can see in the field, through a lens, or on a screen before I begin to feel that I’m unraveling. I wake up anxious—not just about what might happen in the news, but also about the private worries that I might have to find a way to compartmentalize or suppress in order to do my job. I pride myself on being someone who can always push through and channel my anguish into good reporting. It’s become harder to do, but what ultimately buoys me is a community of stellar Black journalists, of every age and professional level, who have been supporting each other every day. We step up and answer the call. Texas TribuneI have a lot of unfortunate experience in working under difficult, breaking-news conditions and managing coverage of sensitive topics. I am, as a person, someone who gets more effective the worse things are. It has been a valuable thing for me as a news editor. It also means I have to be much more aware of the tendencies I have to compartmentalize. I’ve gotten better about it as I’ve gotten older, but my default response is still to figure out how to be useful which sometimes comes at the expense of asking myself, How am I doing?I feel fortunate right now that I have people who are protecting me. I have been in constant contact over the weekend with not just our CEO but our head of HR and our CFO. And their questions have been focused on things like,Given that we’re also in a situation in which the financial pressures on media are worse than ever, that’s a gift. But when you’re working on things that also affect your life or the lives of your friends and family, there is no real separation between you as a person and you as a journalist. It’s a continuum. I’m also an immigrant. I’m an immigrant with access to good lawyers, sure, but I’m still a person who is affected whenever, for example, a new executive order comes down. I have in the past been asked, “How can you report on this? How can you be objective?”I’ve gotten more sarcastic about that as I’ve gotten older, but one of the things I like to ask people who do that is: “Do you own a house? Do you pay taxes? Does that disqualify you from writing about taxes? Or government spending? Or policy around mortgage interest rates?”This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. There is a notion that certain kinds of experiences disqualify you from being able to objectively assess a situation. And I have found that the kinds of experiences that ostensibly disqualify you are rooted in things that make you different from the status quo in most newsrooms. Sometimes that is race and background; often it’s also class. Sometimes it’s other identities. I think we don’t talk a lot about how homophobic and transphobic newsrooms can be. The notion that there is one kind of person who can be objective because that person is the “default” is, first, untrue and, second, an idea that has been used and weaponized in bad faith against journalists from other backgrounds for a long time. Discounting these lived experiences has real ramifications. One of the things that’s so exhausting for Black journalists is this constant feeling of “Yes, and.” It is so frustrating when someone you had a conversation with four years ago—or six months ago or last week or just 24 hours ago—comes to you later and says, “I hadno idea. I had no idea things were this bad.” Because all that tells me is it didn’t matter when I said it. It only mattered when you finally found a reference point that you were willing to accept as valid. Black journalists have to deal with a dismissal of their expertise, even when it’s based in reporting and researchexperience because it’s painted as, “Well, of courseyouwould think that.” When what it should be is, “Oh, this might be something you know about, and it’s something you’re uniquely qualified to know, so let me take that seriously.”Then on top of that, after having your experiences held against you, you then see the people who dismissed you get bylines and cover stories and television hits and book deals talking about the things that they have largely culled from the journalists they weren’t listening to. And that is a hard thing. I was sick with pneumonia for three and a half weeks in early March. Since then the world around me has changed as coronavirus has swept the country, leaving a path of death, destruction, and uncertainty. Although I’ve been reporting on coronavirus, it’s also a story that hits home. I know at least 15 people, all Black, who have died in the past three months, ranging in age from 30 to 70 years old. I just started to go back into the field to report three weeks ago, and in that time the world has changed again. Reporting during a pandemic is one thing. Add a protest sweeping across the country and it’s a completely different situation. Before heading to protests in the past, I would have basics such as water and maybe goggles or a mask in case of tear gas. Now leaving the house has to be a carefully orchestrated movement that takes thoughtful planning. Every decision has to be about safety and protecting myself from uncertain elements while trying to limit my exposure in a city that is a hot spot for coronavirus. Each day I wake up I’m focused on telling a story from my hometown which has been ravaged by coronavirus. I feel a duty, especially now as many Americans still work from home, to tell the complex story of America. For many D. C. protesters I’ve spoken to, they want their voices heard as they come to peacefully protest for the first time in their lives. They want to be seen and heard. Some have tears in their eyes and pain in their hearts. Self-care and a support system are important. I have never been a regular sleeper and am notorious for getting caught up with work and forgetting to eat. I’ve noticed I’ve been sleeping a lot less and many of my colleagues tell me the same thing. I’m on the phone most days, checking in on friends who are also calling and checking in on me. Last week I struggled not to cry after hugging one of my best friends. I realized it was the first person I’d hugged since before I got sick two months ago. However, through all of the uncertainty, I remain hopeful. I stick to my golden rule: Don’t go to bed in fear or sadness; go to bed looking forward to the hope that comes from tomorrow. And although it may be hard, laugh at least once a day, every single day. Star TribuneI have not watched the video of George Floyd. It’s not that I don’t care. It’s not that I don’t believe in bearing witness. I just feel that I’m at a place as a Black person and as a Black journalist that I can’t keep watching these videos. For my own mental health, I just can’t do it. I feel like the screenshots that people put on Twitter and Facebook are more than enough for me. The description of the video—it is more than enough for me. The last video I watched was of Philando Castile. After that, I decided I’m not going to watch these from now on. It all feels the same when it comes down to it, and I can’t keep watching because there’s not much more to see. There’s not much more to tell. Someone was killed at the hands of police again. That’s a choice that I’ve made. Other people feel compelled to watch when it happens. But I feel like people should know that it’s a choice. You can still care about what happened to these men and women without watching the video. I have gotten much more deliberate in general about how I consume the news, and it’s taken time to manage it. It’s about managing the push notifications I get, trying to pace myself in what I’m reading to the point that I’m aware, but not, as my friend Karen Ho would put it,doomscrollingon Twitter. I need to preserve that balance to do the work I want to do. When I’m reporting, I have an extra level of context that some reporters don’t have. I’ve known that feeling of fear when I’ve been stopped while driving. I have a father and two older brothers. I come from a place of seeing these videos or reading stories and thinking, What if that was one of my siblings?I think lived experience makes stories better, but also, when I’m out talking to people, it’s not just about the articles. As a journalist and as a Black journalist, I also believe in helping people navigate the media. In the age of Trump, journalists have to educate people about how the media works. A lot of people don’t trust the media to tell their stories. People don’t want to give their names or talk about their experiences, and I understand that. They feel burned. They feel like the truth isn’t getting told. They feel like, Why should I bother? Having Black people covering these stories matters. Being on the ground, I can acknowledge that I feel their pain too. Black journalists are having these conversations in our newsrooms: What should our policies be about interviewing people at protests? How do we share pictures? How do we take pictures? A lot of people out there in the streets protesting—if they’re being interviewed by the media, that may be their first time talking to a reporter. In a breaking-news situation, journalists often just want to get the quote and go. But you can’t do that. You have to take the extra time. You can’t say, “We need your quote.” You have to tell someone, “This is why I’m asking you this question. This is where you’re going to see this story. Not all of your quotes will make it into the story, not because you didn’t say great things, but because we have limited space.”It feels like a basic thing, but if you are talking to someone who has never spoken to the media before, you have a real responsibility. It really matters. It’s important that people see that Black journalists exist, but I also think it’s important for Black journalists to tell their communities, “This is how my job works. This is where you come into play in me doing my job.” Because we can’t do our jobs if people are not talking to us. This week I’m thinking a lot about the fact that it’s the first week of the month. Rent is due for the third time during this pandemic, on top of what’s going on. People are still worried about where to get medication from, where a meal is coming from. There’s a decrease in resources, in access, and now in attention because our focus is elsewhere. The other day my editor asked me, “What is the best story you can do right now?” And I asked him if he meant in the context of what had happened to George Floyd. And he said, “No, in general. What do you feel is the story you want to tell right now and how can I help you do that?” I feel like that’s the question that every editor needs to ask their reporters in moments like this. Not every reporter—and not every Black reporter—can be out there with the rubber bullets and the tear gas. I think a lot of journalists feel like if you’re not out there, you’re not doing your bit. But at the same time, there are other stories we have to keep telling, and I can think about what those are. New York TimesI am a Black woman first and a journalist second. So my first reaction to what happened to George Floyd was: That could be my brother, my father, my uncle, my cousin, my son, my friend. That could be me. In these moments I think of my parents and grandparents and great-grandparents. They must have had endless reserves of patience to witness the violence, pain, and suffering that they lived through. But they did not waver, and that is why I am here doing what I do, making sure we’re in the room, making sure our voices are being heard. I take that responsibility very seriously. We have a long way to go, but we also have a responsibility to protect the gains for which our parents and heroes fought so hard. Black journalists are indispensable in this country and their legacy has long been overshadowed. But I think of Black women like Almena Lomax, of the, and Alice Allison Dunnigan, the first Black woman to cover the White House. Their work keeps me going. I get tired and frustrated and fed up, just like everyone else. It’s okay not to feel okay. It’s okay to know that you’re not always going to be able to approach the work dispassionately. But the work is not done. So we keep going. A lot of us have been covering these issues at least since 2014, and back then we didn’t have words like “self-care.” A lot of us were not processing these events on a personal level. I’m very transparent about the fact that I now talk to my therapist every week. We download how I’m feeling about just Black people seemingly being unable to do anything while Black in America. Thinking about that with a professional has been extremely helpful to me and is something that I certainly was not doing six years ago when I really started to do this work. As a Black woman and a Black woman in journalism, I’ve spent most of my career and most of my life mainly thinking about what it means to be a Black person in America. I think about my race from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed. When I got to The 19th, I realized that I think a lot more about being Black than I think about being a woman. A lot more. Being able to focus on my gender is a new experience for me. And this is one of the reasons that spaces like women’s publications and even feminism have been the kingdom of white women. Because if you are a white woman, until very recently, you have not thought about being white, which frees you up to think about the only thing that holds you back in life, which is gender. Just as I now have the luxury of thinking about my gender, I think that it is now on white women to think about their race. How does it affect their approach to this work? How can they use their privilege to center marginalized women and their stories? And not just in this moment but, I think, going forward. And I cannot have this conversation without thinking about the fact that we were supposed to be celebrating a huge milestone in this country’s history this year—the centennial of the 19th amendment and women’s suffrage. What does it mean to participate in this democracy as a woman in America? What does that mean when we know that Black women fought for a right that they were excluded from for generations? Purposeful forgetting and blissful ignorance is very real. People need to know. And there are too many people in America who cannot countenance the truth about our country’s history. I think that’s one of the reasons we are seeing Black journalists in particular treating racism as a matter of fact. This is not just about our feelings. This is about telling the most transparent truth that we can about America. One of the tenets of journalism is to afflict the comfortable. Well, white people are too comfortable in America. And if we are not pointing that out and showing people the disparities and being honest about and clear out about those disparities, then things are not going to be different. Black women have been telling the truth about America for a long time. As a Black woman in journalism, my obligation is no less than that. And I do that on the shoulders of all of the women who’ve done that work before me and with me now. I mean, do all Black women journalists know one another? No. But a lot of us do because there’s not a lot of us in this. So when we see each other doing the work, pushing back against racism in public, there will be a text message or a tweet or phone call, a kind of acknowledgement that just makes it clear: “I see what you’re doing. I appreciate you. Keep going.”Glamour.",3,Reliable,0.0484463833380242,0.4493256545655928,5096,2,Glamour

No Collusion – No Obstruction!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)April 16, 2019He even laughed at Democrats for not trusting Mueller after they had supported the investigation, although no one questioned Mueller’s findings, simply Barr’s assessment of them. Now that the redacted report is scheduled to be released to the public, Trump is once again doing the hypocritical attacks on the same people he insists exonerated him (they didn’t). The Mueller Report, which was written by 18 Angry Democrats who also happen to be Trump Haters (and Clinton Supporters), should have focused on the people who SPIED on my 2016 Campaign, and others who fabricated the whole Russia Hoax. That is, never forget, the crime…..— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)April 15, 2019…. Since there was no Collusion, why was there an Investigation in the first place!

POLITICOreports that Walton said:‘The attorney general has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the public … to be concerned about whether or not there is full transparency.’““The attorney general has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the public … to be concerned about whether or not there is full transparency,” U.

(@Amy_Siskind)April 16, 2019Barr has previously stated that redactions would be used to protect national security, which is obviously important and expected, and to protect the reputations of those who had not been charged, which is too broad a scope. Many worry that “protecting reputations” may mean covering up crimes committed by the president. After all, Trump wasn’t charged with a crime, but only because Barr refused to do so.‘A Justice Department spokeswoman said Monday that the nearly 400-page report, with redactions, will be released that morning to Congress and the public. However, the online media outlet pressed for an order requiring the release of the portions that must be disclosed under FOIA.’Soon, the right will be claiming Senior DC Judge Reggie Walton is part of the deep state conspiracy out to get tRump. The reality is it would be hard to script a better judge to decide Buzzfeed’s FOIA case seeking Mueller Report:— Jon Joseph (@jonjosephlive)April 16, 2019While Walton clearly agreed that Barr’s delays and redactions have been harmful to any perception of transparency in the highest office of our government and at the highest levels of the law, he denied Buzzfeed’s request.‘Despite Walton’s criticism, he denied a request from BuzzFeed to issue a preliminary injunction requiring the Justice Department to release Mueller’s report by Thursday.’If A.

Hill had a meteoric rise and an even faster fall: She was a former community college student who became the leader of a major nonprofit, then launched and won a seemingly impossible run for Congress in a deep-red district by the time she was 31. In Congress she shone for exactly one year. Then a right-wing site published the photos, which promptly spread as only nude photos of a 29-year-old congresswoman can. Hill says the photos, some of which were taken without her knowledge, could have only come from her then husband, who she says threatened to “ruin” her if she left him. Hereportedlysaid that he was hacked. The pictures showed that Hill and her then husband were involved in a relationship with a younger woman, an employee of Hill’s campaign. She resigned, with a resoundinglast stand of a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives. The fact that Hill’s private photos were published is a tremendous act of violation. But the injustice was complicated by the fact that Hill did have a relationship that she knows was outside the bounds of appropriate behavior. It didn’t break congressional rules, but the relationship tainted Hill’s image as a champion of the #MeToo movement. She apologized, but there was no taking it back. She was the boss. The relationship had been with a staffer. There should have been boundaries. There weren’t. That whole whirlwind—the allegedly abusive partner, the violating pictures, the uneven power dynamic, the perceived sordidness of a non-monogamous relationship—was compressed into one world for the public: scandal. Hill was shamed, blamed, and presumed to be out of politics forever. Not so fast, Hill says. The 31-year-old has a political PAC, called HER Time, that’s dedicated to electing women. She has a new book,, that reads like the best possible combination ofSeventeen Magazineand feminist manifesto. She has a new podcast, cheekily namedNaked Politics. And she has a plan to set women free—a legislative project to aid women and girls in demanding a kind of freedom she has never enjoyed. Glamourasked Hill about life after public shame. It was this crucial time in my life, coming out of the trauma that happened with my ex-husband, and with the photos, and with resigning. And then right after, within two months of when I resigned, my brother passed away. So being able to just sit down and tell my story—it was really therapeutic. I feel like it’s something that I needed to do for myself anyway, even if I hadn’t been able to publish a book. I’m glad that writing the book kind of forced me to do that, because I don’t know if I would have been able to do that otherwise.[endometriosis, Hill has spoken openly about hersexuality, hergun ownership, dealing with emergency medical expenses, the fact that she once considered abortion but thenhad a miscarriage, and hersexual assaultand abuse experiences.]Yes! It’s almost too strange, there are these experiences that happen to so many people, but they’re all rolled into one with me. I don’t know why during your life you go through things—and I think there’s got to be a reason behind it, and that’s the only way I’ve been able to cope with it all. But I think part of my job is to tell these stories and hope that some of them have an impact on people. There still aren’t very many people in high-profile positions who talk about these things, so I kind of feel obliged to. I mean, I’ve got the scars from my surgery—it’s one of those weird things where it’s like, “How do I have to prove it to you that this happened?”To me, it feels like you have to be able to own it even more. It’s about taking ownership of your own body and your own choices, and that’s hard! It’s a process for me to figure out—what are self-destructive behaviors that come in the wake of all this trauma, versus what are healthy coping ones? I don’t necessarily have a good sense of what a normal sex life for me should look like. I’m just trying to take my time with it, but I’m 100% in on sex positivity. I do get nervous about any BDSM stuff, because of my own experiences with it as it tied into an abusive relationship—but other people doing that in a healthy and safe way? That’s great for them. I tried to put into words our mission as feminists, as warriors, as women, which is to ensure that women are really guaranteed a few basic things—consideration, autonomy, safety, equality, and power. We do need to achieve equal power for any of these things to happen, which means electing women and installing women into positions of power at every level—whether it’s in government, in media, in nonprofits, in the corporate world. And there is a real legislative agenda that can move us in the right direction for all of this. What came out of the book was 10 real legislative goals that have either been composed or passed at the House, or passed at certain state and local levels, but have been blocked at the national level by Republicans. I don’t even think this should be a partisan issue! But it is. With HER Time, the PAC that I started, the overarching goal is to be able to elect women and then push forward this agenda. And I’m hoping we can get that to become a movement. The biggest thing I learned from it is that when I started to campaign, it truly felt like a movement and these people were my friends. That shouldn’t have been the case, because I was paying them. I truly do believe that the #MeToo movement and everything related to the abuse of power is really driven by patriarchy and power over women, so I don’t think the case is the same. But I do think we all have to be taking stock of that, and it’s not something that I did. I didn’t think of myself that way, and that was a mistake. You have to set your clear boundaries from the beginning. More than anything it probably just boils down to: Don’t shit where you eat. Starting three and a half years ago, when I entered the space of becoming a candidate, I really was skyrocketing. I just kept going and going and going up, and then I just fell, like, off a cliff. Now the rebuilding part is slower. It’s like you’re climbing out of a canyon and you’re trying to find the most efficient way out, and also knowing that there’s danger in coming out too fast, but also you’ve got this really strong desire to get out as fast as you can. With the outside parties that were in play, and my ex, I think that I very much came from the mindset of, “I’m not just going to sit here and kind of stew in this and be quiet for any lengthy period of time, I have to get back on my feet.” I’ve been a horseback rider for basically my whole life, and when you fall, the number one thing you’re taught, that’s just drilled into you, is that you have to get right back on. The reasoning behind that is that you get a fear, really quick, it gets instilled in you, and it kind of becomes unbreakable if you don’t immediately get back on. You have to know that youdo it. I think that’s kind of where I am right now—I got back on the horse. I might not ever be at the level where I was before, but I got back on. Samantha and Felicity. Oh, it’s Serena.

(And, briefly, into the manly-man fantasies of many pundits. There was even talk of amending the Constitution to allow for a President Schwarzenegger. I mean, really. Why not just imagine a President Donald Trump?) Right now, it looks like a pick ‘em between incumbent Gavin Newsom and perpetual right-wing radio nuisance Larry Elder. Of course, because this is a perilous and ridiculous exercise, there are 46 candidates running to replace Newsom.(Or, perhaps, 45. I’m no political consultant, but I have to imagine that the job would become exponentially harder if your candidategot paper dropped on himduring a candidates’ debate.)Anyway, Elder seems to be the frontrunner to be Newsom’s opponent if the recall succeeds, and he hasa very long track recordof radio idiocy to run on, and the rise of social media has given him a bigger presence, especially among the Trumpists. And, right now, the vote against recalling Newsom, who has a 57 percent approval rating, holdsa very slim leadin the average of the latest polls. This is a crazy way to run a state that also happens to have the fifth largest economy in the world. Trying to find a reason for it, I consultedthe Natural Resource Defense Council. Maybe it was something in the water. As we have seen, PFAS are what are known as “forever chemicals,” as the NRDC explains. Sounds as though they should leave Newsom alone and recall the water systems. Elsewhere, the slow-moving Rapture continues among the unvaccinated.

247,"Rey Rivera’s friend, former Baltimore employer pushes back on Netflix’s ‘Unsolved Mysteries'",0.0,45.0,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-rey-rivera-netflix-inaccuracies-20200805-zxmiq4ppp5euxhbcm23ksgezva-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"The former employer of Rey Rivera is pushing back on his portrayal in Netflix’s popular “Unsolved Mysteries” reboot, which raised questions about his involvement in Rivera’s 2006 death. Porter Stansberry, who has not spoken publicly about the case since the first days of Rivera’s disappearance, told The Baltimore Sun that he was “shocked and hurt” by the show’s insinuations.“The reason I’ve never commented about Rey’s death publicly first and foremost is because I never thought there was any mystery about why or how he died,” Stansberry, who runs an investment newsletter business, said in a phone interview. Rivera, 32, was missing for a week before his body was found in a room at the base of the Belvedere Hotel, having apparently crashed through the roof after a fall. The episode hitNetflixon July 1, and people interviewed for the show, including Rivera’s brother, Rivera’s wife, and the retired Baltimore homicide detective who worked the case in its first weeks, said Stansberry refused to cooperate with police and instructed his employees not to talk to detectives. The episode never accuses Stansberry of foul play, but viewers were clearly pointed to Stansberry as a shadowy figure who existed off screen and might know more than he was saying.“It’s completely untrue,” Stansberry said of the claims. “I did everything I could to help,” he said, including meeting with a detective in late June 2006.“He had every opportunity to say this,” Rivera’s widow, Allison, told The Sun regarding Stansberry previously not commenting. They haven’t spoken since June 2006, she said. “The fact is: [Rivera’s death is] truly a mystery. There’s just no answers.”But a second friend, Brad Hoppmann, who said he knew Rey Rivera since childhood and remained close with him up until his death, also believes the story has been twisted.“This is a real conversation the world can have about mental illness and help people get help when they need it,” Hoppmann said, “and it turned into a murder mystery where they’re accusing people of being involved.”Netflix did not respond to repeated messages sent to its public relations department, and the producers did not respond to messages sent through its website. Riverawent missing on May 16, 2006, and a guest at his North Baltimore home said he darted out and never returned. Three then-co-workers discovered a hole in a sub-roof of the Belvedere Hotel in Mid-Town, and Rivera’s battered and decomposing body was found inside. The mystery of his death was covered in the media at the time and was the subject of a 2018 book, “An Unexplained Death: The True Story of a Body at the Belvedere,” bylocal author Mikita Brottman. The show presents questions about how Rivera could have accessed the building’s roof, while his family members say he was not suicidal and did not have any known mental illness. His cellphone and glasses were found on the roof, relatively undamaged, which a retired homicide detective who worked the case said appeared “staged” to him. An engraved money clip he carried was never located. Rivera also left behind a note, which contains strange comments including references to Freemasons and Stanley Kubrick. “I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets,” it says. Though police said the circumstances pointed to a likely suicide, the medical examiner’s office ruled the death “undetermined,” saying there was not enough information to render a conclusion about whether it was a homicide, suicide or accident. Rivera’s case wasfeatured as the first episode of the new season of “Unsolved Mysteries,”and reached No. 1 trending on Netflix, leading to discussion and speculation on social media. Stansberry said he has received death threats, and his family has been harassed online. He said he’s even been questioned by friends and potential business partners.“It’s horrific,” Stansberry said. “You can’t even imagine what it’s like to tell people I had nothing to do with my friend’s death.”Stansberry and Rivera went to high school together in California and were water polo teammates. Rivera, an aspiring screenwriter, had moved from Los Angeles with his wife to take what Stansberry says was an entry-level position at his company writing a financial newsletter called the “Rebound Report.”When Rivera went missing, Stansberry said, he hired a private investigator, offered a reward and personally helped look for Rivera. Once the body was found, Stansberry said this week, “we were all sad and shocked by the fact that Rey killed himself, but once we saw all the facts and his financial pressures, it wasn’t much of a mystery.”In the show, retired Baltimore homicide detective Michael Baier and Rivera’s wife say that after Rivera’s body was found, Stansberry refused to return calls from investigators and put a “gag order” on employees to keep them from talking.“It’s completely a lie,” Stansberry said. “It’s not a matter of opinion. It’s a lie.”He said only that employees were told to refer media inquiries to a spokesperson. He said he personally spoke with a detective on June 23, 2006, which was after Baier was reassigned and when another detective, Marvin Sydnor, had the case. Sydnor did not return a call seeking comment Tuesday, but Stansberry’s attorney Charles Curlett said he had spoken with him recently. Allison Rivera said Tuesday that her information about Stansberry not cooperating came from Baier. Stansberry says the show is wrong that Rivera worked for him at the time of his death and that Rivera had left the job six months earlier on his own accord.“He resigned voluntarily — no ill will. He said he didn’t want to write in the newsletter world anymore” but didn’t have a solid next move lined up, Stansberry said. At the time, Stansberry’s company was beingsued by the Securities and Exchange Commissionfor selling fraudulent stock tips to investors in 2002, before Rivera joined the company. After a trial in 2005, U. S. District Judge Marvin Garbis ruled in 2007 that “Stansberry’s conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud, making statements that he knew to be false,” andissued a $1.5 million fine. Stansberry said there’s no connection to those proceedings and Rivera. Of particular interest in Rivera’s case is who placed a phone call to him that apparently precipitated him leaving his home. Allison Rivera has said the call came from the switchboard of Agora Publishing, and the specific caller could not be determined. Agora, a global publishing company headquartered in Baltimore, has several subsidiary companies, including Stanberry’s, and at the time all calls routed through a main switchboard. A police spokeswoman on Tuesday said the call came from an “owned subsidiary company of Agora Publishing,” but declined to provide additional details, saying it was an open investigation. Stansberry asserts that while the call might have come from someone at Agora — he says Rivera was doing freelance work for another Agora subsidiary after leaving Stanberry’s firm — it could not have come from his company.“Every person in our company who had worked with Rey was on the Eastern Shore at the time that call was made, having a corporate retreat in St. Michael’s,” Stansberry said. “No one in my company was in town when Rey disappeared. The idea we were calling him from our switchboard is ridiculous.”Stansberry said Rivera had also asked him previously if he was in leadership of the Freemasons, which Stansberry said he thought was a joke. He said when Rivera’s family and friends were searching for him, Rivera’s wife told him that the Saturday before he went missing, Rivera was “morose and would not get out of bed.”“She told me she was very worried about his mental state at the time he disappeared,” Stansberry said. “I’m not the only friend Rey approached and said things that were very odd.”Allison Rivera has said that her husband was in good spirits, though anxious about work. She said Tuesday that she couldn’t recall if she had such a conversation with Stansberry. Hoppmann, Rey Rivera’s childhood friend, said not long before his death Rey repeatedly asked him about being a member of the Freemasons and discussing the film “Eyes Wide Shut.”Hoppmann, who also worked for Stansberry at one time but says they are not close, said the week before his death Rivera asked to be able to visit his top-floor apartment in Jersey City alone. Rivera had a key to the place, but then returned it.“He was acting really, really weird,” Hoppmann said. Brottman, the author of the 2018 book about Rivera’s death and a resident of the Belvedere, said the Netflix show interviewed her for hours, and that she told them the roof was easily accessed, and not a difficult task to reach as the show asserted. In her book, she explores the various theories and concludes that Rivera likely had a mental break and jumped from the roof.“I think if they’d included my interviews it would have closed down a lot of speculation because it would have been obvious that a lot of avenues and angles had already been explored at length,” Brottman wrote on Reddit. Stansberry said the case is being sensationalized.“I think what’s really sad about this is that there are people in Hollywood who will do anything to craft a story to get attention, even when it comes to destroying someone’s reputation and trying to sensationalize the tragedy of a death of a 32-year old man,” Stansberry said.",3,Reliable,-0.0353829107400536,0.4210894660894662,2114,3,Baltimore Sun

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezsaid Thursday that the $1,400 direct payments included in the plan fall short of the promise that helped Democrats win control of the U. S. Senate.""$2,000 means $2,000,"" the New York Democrattoldthe. ""$2,000 does not mean $1,400.""Rep. Cori Bush(D-Mo.) echoed Ocasio-Cortez's criticism in a tweet late Thursday:On the eve of the Senate runoffs in Georgia, Biden told the state's voters that ""$2,000 checks"" would ""go out the door"" if they elected Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who both embraced the push for $2,000 checks on the campaign trail and ultimately defeated their Republican opponents.""There's no one in America with more power to make that happen than you, the citizens of Atlanta, the citizens of Georgia, and that's not an exaggeration,"" the president-elect said of the $2,000 payments. ""That's literally true.""But the Biden camp and others contend the plan was always to provide $1,400 checks on top of the $600 approved under a relief measure that President Donald Trump signed into law last month, not an additional $2,000 check--even though, in their messaging, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris continued to call for ""$2,000 stimulus checks"" after the $600 payments were already distributed to many Americans. In response to one journalist's claim that Ocasio-Cortez is engaging in ""goalpost-moving"" by demanding $2,000 checks instead of the proposed $1,400 payments, progressive organizer Claire Sandberg tweeted that ""Biden is the one who moved the goalpost.""""In a last-ditch effort to win the Senate, he said that '$2,000 checks' would 'go out the door' if Warnock and Ossoff won,"" said Sandberg, former national organizing director for Sen. Bernie Sanders(I-Vt.). ""Warnock posted this realistic image of a $2,000 Treasury check!""On the whole, progressives largely welcomed Biden's nearly $2 trillion relief proposal as a solid first step while stressing that it is not sufficient to fully bring the U. S. economy out of deep recession and confront the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 388,000 people in the United States. Some economists haveargued(pdf) that Congress must approve between $3-4.5 trillion in spending in the short-term to set the stage for a strong recovery. It is far from clear how much of Biden's initial offer will become law, given that Democrats will control the Senate by the narrowest possible margin and thus be unable to afford any Democratic defections. Potentially making matters more difficult is Biden's insistence on attaining enough bipartisan support to push the proposal through the Senate with 60 votes. Thereportedthat top House and Senate Democrats ""are preparing to pivot quickly to a parliamentary process known as budget reconciliation"" if Biden fails to win the support of enough Republican lawmakers. Only a simple majority in the Senate is needed to pass bills through the reconciliation process, which Republicans used to ram through their massive tax cuts for the rich in 2017. Sanders, the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,vowedearlier this week to use the reconciliation process to ""boldly address the needs of working families.""In astatementlate Thursday, the Vermont senator said Biden ""has put forth a very strong first installment of an emergency relief plan that will begin to provide desperately needed assistance to tens of millions of working families facing economic hardship during the pandemic."" On top of $1,400 direct payments to many Americans--including adult dependents--the president-elect also proposed increasing the current $300-per-week federal unemployment supplement to $400 and extending emergency jobless programs through September.""The president-elect's Covid relief plan includes many initiatives that the American people want and need, including increasing the $600 direct payments to $2,000, and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour,"" Sanders continued. ""As the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I look forward to working with the president-elect and my colleagues in Congress to provide bold emergency relief to the American people as soon as possible.""",3,Reliable,0.1656977901131126,0.4943920192710515,1012,2,Common Dreams

By the time Anderson Cooper pointed out that there was no real difference between Mike Lindell and a “snake oil salesmen,” Lindell just about lost it. We should have known that there was something more sinister to the MyPillow guy than just being a goofy pitchman who was naive enough to fall for Donald Trump’s lies.

Thequestion that remains unanswered is why the response to rioters by law enforcement wasborderline non-existent. As it turns out, communication is pretty shitty in DC. A few blocks away from whereworshipping rioters were fucking up government property,50 armed and uniformed agents of the Department of Homeland Securitywere waiting to be deployed to help Capitol police,who were outnumbered by rioters. But alas, there was no hotline bling for the DHS agents milling about theRonald Reagan Building. The agents were staged and awaiting orders from DHS’s Federal Protective Service, who would issue the command to join police at the Capitol at their discretion. But no request came. DHS also had agents on standby for protests following the death ofGeorgeFloyd, thoughagents were deployed in that scenario. Conveniently, DHS shifted the blame back ontoCapitol police, arguing that they were“serving at the request of the Capitol Police because that force has ultimate jurisdiction over the Capitol and therefore makes decisions about what agencies are allowed to police it.”If only there wasa way to streamline all this policingso there was a better understanding of who getsto be in charge.

European leaders are reportedly tired of Trump’s “unpredictability” and in the final days of his administration, a meeting with Pompeo,who is likely on his way out the door,just didn’t make it to the top of the priority list. Trump, a real bull in a China shop when it comes to foreign relations, has not been able to tweet about Pompeo’s canceled European trips,thanks to a Twitter ban.

253,The 'glitter bomber' is back with a brilliant new trap for porch thieves who never learn,0.0,40.67,https://www.upworthy.com/glitter-bomb-returns-new-trap-for-porch-thieves,https://adfontesmedia.com/upworthy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"Back in 2018, engineer Mark Rober instilled fear in the hearts of package thieves, or Porch Pirates as he calls them, by developing the ultimate glitter bomb. Rober had a package stolen from his porch and the police refused to do anything. 'So I used my engineering skills to go full 'Home Alone' on these punks,' Rober says. The thieves clearly messed with the wrong guy because Rober is a genius engineer who worked on NASA's Curiosity rover and later spent four years at Apple as a product designer in its Special Projects Group. The bomb was a complex device disguised as an Amazon package. But when the thieves opened it up it spewed glitter in 360 degrees and then kicked into fart spray mode that had them holding their noses in agony. Glitter is a fantastic tool for nonviolent revenge. Once it gets on your clothes, in your hair, or embedded in your carpet, there's no getting it out. The first video was a smash, earning over 85 million views on YouTube. The bomb was an effective way to enact revenge on thieves and it's also a beautiful piece of engineering. It's mystifying to watch the multi-colored glitter spiral out of the box like a supernova. via Mark Rober / YouTube AD So for the third year, to encourage porch pirates to choose a different profession, Rober is back and his bombs are better than ever. The Glitter Bomb 3.0 has been upgraded to have a super sticky, professional-grade glue on the handle. It has a timer that goes off after the second round of fart spay that counts down from 15. The countdown instills immediate fear in the pirates, so many try to get it out of their houses before the unpredictable device explodes. The bomb has four cameras inside that can catch the unboxing from every angle possible and GPS tracking so that Rober can retrieve the bombs after they've been ditched. Glitterbomb 3.0 vs. Porch Pirates www.youtube.com The footage of the thieves getting blasted with fart spray, hit with glitter, and freaked out by the countdown is wonderfully satisfying to watch. Who doesn't enjoy seeing thieves get their comeuppance? However, Rober didn't want the entire project to be about revenge. So he rewarded those he saw trying to return the stray packages to their rightful owners. The experiments show that the vast majority of people want to protect the property of others. 'It's only a teensy remaining three percent that get to star in my videos and almost never fit my preconceived notion of what a package thief is,' Rober says. via Mark Rober / YouTube Some of the most notable thieves Rober caught this year are two teenagers who had the stones to steal a package while the police were arresting someone just a few yards away. Before the teens open the bomb they rationalize what they just did by saying it would have been stolen by other kids anyway. All in all, this year's glitter bombing campaign seemed pretty successful and Rober got back four of his six bombs. One looks like it was kicked to death by a thief and another shot by a pair of San Francisco thieves. Hopefully, all his hard work and dedication has made more than a few thieves think twice before treading on our porches.",3,Reliable,0.1163159837578442,0.5345422665190107,718,2,Upworthy

The mayor leaned on some of his younger tech savvy leaders to compile expenses and apply for federal and state relief packages. Included in the team were City engineer Amanda Hicks, Public Works Administrative Assistant Rhonda Standridge, new city Finance Director Torri Perry, City Purchasing agent Kenneth Johnson, and Interim Fire Chief DeWayne Rose.“I want to commend the dream team,” said McClendon. “We call them the dream team, I’m happy to announce the city, through the federal government, has been awarded $1,030,000 as part of COVID money we will get back. Pretty much everything they bought, they managed it well and turned it in. We are getting that money reimbursed.”The mayor listed the purchases justified under the COVID Relief Act.“Trucks, overtime our officers worked under our COVID relief task force, part of Communication Director Nick Coulter’s salary all for our general fund.”But wait, theirs more. In addition to federal reimbursements, the city applied for relief through the state of Arkansas.“We are still in the running to get up to $300,000 from the state for COVID relief. That’s going to be great for our general fund.

Early in the crisis the city teamed up with health care providers and promoted drive through testing. Mayor McClendon took to social media and became a “viral” media sensation urging everyone to “stay your ass home” during the early days of the pandemic. The mayor compared the results of the dream team to those in other municipalities. He also lauded the entire city administration for maintaining austere spending during the health crisis.“Many other cities are struggling,” said McClendon, “tourism and the advertising and promotion tax collections, to sales taxes. But with this administration we have kept our heads above water and I want to thank you all as well.”McClendon looked at the reality of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and urged citizens to remain cautious.“The COVID-19 pandemic is rising,” said McClendon. “Tuesday we had 1,700 deaths in the country. I want everyone to continue following guidelines, washing your hand frequently, maintaining six-foot social distancing away, avoid large crowds, churches with more than 50 people and other large events.

257,Students and faculty urge deeper look at land-grant legacy,-14.17,42.17,https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.1/indigenous-affairs-land-grab-universities-students-and-faculty-urge-deeper-look-at-land-grant-legacy,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,16,"A banner hangs on a statue of Cornell University’s founder, Ezra Cornell, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day this year. Della Keahna UranWhenpublished “Land-Grab universities” last April, the two-year-long investigation shed new light on a dark open secret: One of the largest transfers of land and capital in the country’s history had masqueraded as a donation for university endowments. HCNidentified nearly 11 million acres of land, expropriated from approximately 250 tribes, bands and communities through more than 160 violence-backed treaties and land cessions. Now, in the wake of the investigation, land-grant universities across the country are re-evaluating the capital they built from these stolen Indigenous lands. More than 150 years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act — the legislation that transferred the lands — new discussions about the universities’ moral and ethical responsibilities have forced Americans to re-examine the law’s legacy. Land-grant institutions have long prided themselves on their accomplishments as beneficiaries: They used the proceeds generated by the land to broaden access to higher education, thereby contributing to economic development across the nation. But many of those institutions paid next to nothing for the public lands they received and sold. By far the largest beneficiary was Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, which acquired almost 1 million acres from Ojibwe, Miwok, Yokuts, Dakota and other Indigenous nations through 63 treaties or seizures. The land came from 15 states, and by 1935, when the last parcel was sold, Cornell University had generated nearly $6 million for its endowment, the largest of any land-grant institution. Adjusted for inflation, it raised over $92 million. Now, as the country reconsiders long-standing issues of racial equity and justice — focusing on everything from local political races to national legislation — students and faculty alike are pressuring administrators to address the investigation’s findings. On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, Oct. 12, 2020, members of Native American and Indigenous Students at Cornell (NAISAC) put forward a list of 10 demands in the form of apetition. The demands include turning the American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program into a university department; recruiting new Indigenous faculty and students, specifically Indigenous students affected and/or displaced by the Morrill Act; waiving tuition for those students; acknowledging the land of the Gayogo̱hó:nǫ’, or Cayuga Nation, before every Ithaca-based event; and reinstating an ad-hoc committee on Native American Affairs to oversee the approval of these demands.“If the president’s office was responsible, then they would meet each of these demands to the extent that we’ve laid them out in our petition,” said Colin Benedict (Mohawk), the external relations chair for NAISAC. “Each of these demands in my mind is completely 100% justified and should already have been implemented by the university decades ago.”As of Dec. 1, the petition had more than 900 signatures from students, staff, alumni and community members. The president’s office has yet to respond publicly, but in an email exchange, it stated, “The Office of the President is in receipt of the NAISAC petition, and the President is looking forward to working with the Native American and Indigenous community at Cornell on these issues.”A faculty committee, headed by American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program Director Kurt Jordan, launched theCornell University and Indigenous Dispossession Project. The project will research Cornell’s Morrill Act land history, identify the Indigenous communities affected, and foster discussion of possible remedies.“We’ve had a number of statements that have been made by the administration in light of the George Floyd murder, Black Lives Matter, and all of the other things that have been happening this year about the need for Cornell to really address its legacy, its historical roots, its complicity in … to some degree, with white supremacy,” Jordan said.“Benefiting from stolen Indigenous land has to be part of that.”History professor Jon Parmenter recently discovered that Cornell is in possession of over 420,000 acres of mineral rights in the Central and Southwestern U. S., a portion of which was retained through Morrill Act lands. In its petition, NAISAC urged the university to release a statement acknowledging the amount of land acquired, the interest accrued and mineral rights funds received, and pledging to refrain from mineral and resource extraction on those lands., faculty and students at the University of California, Berkeley have also made strides. Established in 1868, the university received almost 150,000 acres from the Morrill Act. The land raised $730,000 for the university’s early endowment, and, adjusted for inflation, has generated over $13 million. The university paid nothing in return. The presence and history of Indigenous people has been largely erased from the UC system, said Phenocia Bauerle (Apsáalooke), director of Native American Student Development at the University of California, Berkeley. Two years ago, Bauerle and the Native American Student Development center created a land acknowledgment to honor the Ohlone tribal lands that the university sits upon. However, the university has yet to adopt an official acknowledgment. According to aCalifornia audit, UC Berkeley is the worst offender among the schools when it comes to complying with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which grants Indigenous nations the right to regain ancestral remains and objects from museums. UC Berkeley has only repatriated 20% of its 500,000-artifact collection. In comparison, the University of California Los Angeles has repatriated 96% of its collection.“A lot of it comes down to, well, they see these issues as historical and not of the present because they see Natives as historical and not of the present,” Bauerle said. Since the dispossession occurred in the past, contemporary people don’t see themselves as responsible, and they feel no pressure to address the issue today. However, “ ‘Land-Grab’ gave us several concrete (points),” Bauerle said. “This dispossession of Native land that this whole country benefits from — here’s a specific way that we can show you that Berkeley actually played a part in it. These are the receipts. This is how much money you got.”Bauerle partnered with Rosalie Z. Fanshel, a doctoral student in environmental science, policy and management and the program manager for the Berkeley Food Institute, to organize a conference on the Morrill Act and Indigenous land dispossession.“The UC Land Grab: A Legacy of Profit from Indigenous Land” was held in two parts in September and October. The conference dug deep into the history of California’s genocide and the founding of the University of California. Participants called for action, including shared land stewardship, research opportunities and tuition options for Indigenous students. More than 500 people attended both days of the conference. David Ackerly, dean of the Rausser College of Natural Resources in Berkeley, was among them. “I felt like I was learning so much that I had not been aware of,” he said. “This is part of our story, I want to be part of this. I want to learn. I want to figure out where we’re heading.”Other attendees included staff from the office of UC President Michael V. Drake, the office of the chancellor at UC Berkeley and the governor’s office, as well as deans and administrators from various UC campuses and units.“Many Native and Indigenous people in the state and across the world have been made promises since colonization, and they’ve been broken. It’s hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”One of the panelists, Brittani Orona, a doctoral candidate in Native American studies and human rights at UC Davis and a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, was surprised by how many people within the university system had no knowledge of the history of land-grant institutions. “I think with Native people and Native students, you know that our land, our places have been taken away from us, from many different institutions and at many different points of time,” Orona said. At the conference, Orona spoke about the history of genocide in California. “Scholars of California Indian genocide will say it ended in 1873, but I argue it is a continuous process,” Orona said.“Many Native and Indigenous people in the state and across the world have been made promises since colonization, and they’ve been broken. It’s hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”Orona, who will complete her Ph. D. in the coming year, hopes that future Native and Indigenous students have a different experience than she did. “What does that mean, when you’re having California Native students pay out of pocket on land that has been dispossessed from them?I appreciate the discussions that are going on, but I’ll believe it when I see it — and when it moves beyond acknowledgment towards actual actionable items that make life easier for Native and Indigenous students and peoples.”As of Dec. 4, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ has yet to respond about the conference publicly. In an email, however, she wrote, “To achieve this inclusive campus culture, we must acknowledge how our history, including the Morrill Land Grant Act, impacts Indigenous people. Now more than ever, we, as a university, must take immediate action to acknowledge past wrongs, build trusting and respectful relationships, and accelerate change and justice for our Native Nations and Tribal communities.”High Country News.

258,They got ‘clobbered’ on Election Day. Now Massachusetts Republicans are weighing whether to change leaders,0.67,43.0,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/16/metro/they-got-clobbered-election-day-now-massachusetts-republicans-are-weighing-whether-change-leaders/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-16,25,"After seeing their small minority onBeacon Hill shrink further this year, Massachusetts Republicans are now pivoting to a fight for control of their deeply divided state party ahead ofthe 2022 election cycle, when the governor’s office and every legislative seat will be on the ballot. The election of a new party chair — slated for January — is expected to prove pivotal in determining the direction of the partyafter years of realizing few electoral gains among candidates not named Charlie Baker. Jim Lyons, a President Trump ally and former state lawmaker who has led the party since 2019, has said he will seek reelection, and state Representative Shawn Dooley, a House member since 2014, said Monday he will also run for the post, pitching the need for a party “rebranding.”AdvertisementThe $75,000-a-year position is picked by the Massachusetts GOP’s 80-seat state committee, which has increasingly taken on a more conservative bentdespite Baker’s efforts to shape it. More candidates are also eyeing a race that is likely to show the sharp fault lines running through the party, which has hewed closely to President Trump, both in tone and approach, under Lyons. That conservative rhetoric has often come at the expense of Baker, the state’s popular, moderate governor, and could complicate Baker’s own potential reelection bid in two years even with Trump out of the White House. (Baker has said he is considering vying for an unprecedented third consecutive term.)“President Trump has brought tremendous energy,” said Lyons, though he acknowledged it’s unclear if it will translate past Trump’s departure on Jan. 20. “My focus since the day I ran in 2019 has been to try to increase our ranks in the Legislature. I really feel a strong desire to see if we can fundamentally change the Republican Party.”AdvertisementAt the ballot box, it’s proven to bea struggle. There will be just three Republicans in the state Senate come January after the GOP lost five seats in the Legislature during 2020, strengthening Democrats' super-majority in both branches. And while some Republicans felt the resultscould have been worse, the losses still stung, including in a House district that had been held by Republicans — first by Kevin Poirier, then his wife, Betty Poirier — since the late 1970s. Further fueling Republican frustration is that the party, on a national level and elsewhere, far exceeded expectations even as it lost the White House.“There’s no silver lining to any of this,” said Tom Mountain, the state party’s vice chairman. Mountain did not directly address Monday whether he’s considering running for chairman. “We got clobbered. We’re the state [party] that probably got hit the hardest.”It’s renewed calls from many in the party to embrace a message of unity. Dooley, a former Norfolk town clerk running for the first time to be party chairman, said that in repeatedly attacking Democrats and Baker, the party apparatus has focused too heavily on national issues and ignored the GOP’s “essential” messaging of promoting smaller government, individual liberty, and providing a check on Democrats.“We need to rebuild our brand,” said Dooley, who also serves on the state committee. “We can’t be attacking Republicans, whether it’s Charlie Baker or the 18-year-old kid who just joined the party. We need to have a unified team working toward the common goal of bringing more balance to the state.”AdvertisementDooley said he intends to keep his state representative seat if elected chairman while ceding the “nitty gritty” operations to an executive director and finance director — two positions that Lyons has not filled. The MassGOP had $80,000 in its federal account as of mid-October and was on pace for its worst fund-raising cycle in 12 years after a lucrative fund-raising operation,built under Baker, collapsed last year. Mountain, the vice chairman, said the party has enough money to cover expenses, including rent, for a few months, but said it’s in “danger of becoming insolvent” without a fund-raising push.“It’s quite clear that the MassGOP needs a resurrection,” said Susan Smiley, a state committee member and Lancaster Republican who unsuccessfully ran for an open House seat this year. Smiley voted for Lyons in 2019 when he beat a Baker-favored candidate, 47-30, but said the party needs new leadership.“I think the strategy, if there was a strategy, failed,” she said. Michael Valanzola, a state committee member and one-time Baker administration officialwho resigned in 2016, said he is also considering running. Similar to Dooley, he said rebuilding the party’s shrinking GOP caucuses in the State House is critical.“Jim’s a great guy . . . and I had a lot to do with helping him win two years ago. But we have not necessarily been able to tap into the energy that you’re seeing in other parts of the country,” he said. “People are frustrated by that.”AdvertisementAn adviser to Baker said the governor is not engaged in the race for chair, nor is he supporting a candidate at this point. But Baker stressed at a press conference last week that Massachusetts Republicans need to recalibrate their pitch to voters.“It’s important for people who run for statewide office to understand that what voters care about here are statewide or local issues. That’s really where our focus as a party needs to be,” Baker said. He did not say, however, whether he’ll be on the ticket in 2022. “That’s a long time away.”Matt Stout can be reached atmatt.stout@globe.com.

For the past several days, Pompeo has used the official Secretary of State Twitter account to throw a multi-day parade in his own honor that would make a North Korean propagandist cringe.""The Trump Administration led the world in reforming multilateral institutions and ditching bad deals.#EffectiveMultilateralism,"" hecrowedon Saturday in one of 23 tweets extolling his own great accomplishments and showcasing a photo of his own face. He followed up with 24 more missives on Sunday boasting about kicking the United Nations' ass by, among other actions, cutting family planning because ""UNFPA is still working with CCP butchers who forcibly sterilize Uyghur women,"" and leaving the Human Rights Council, which is ""run by dictators, fixated on attacking Israel, zero accountability for gross abusers.""""America is a generous country, but prior Administrations let the UN treat us like a piggybank.@UNwas inefficient, wasteful, and manipulated by malign actors.

But Pompeo isn't just some dick on the internet. He's a major dick in person, too! Yesterday the secretary of State marched over to the Voice of America to give those reporters alectureon NEWS, HOW DOES IT GO, for simultaneous broadcast on every VOA station on the planet, naturally. First he praised himself and shit on China, as per custom. When the Chinese Communist Party attempted to exploit the tragic death of George Floyd to claim their authoritarian system was somehow superior to ours, I issued a statement, which read in part: ""During the best of times, the People's Republic of China ruthlessly imposes communism. But amid the most difficult challenge, the United States secures freedom.""There is no moral equivalence. This is a self-evident truth. Then he made it clear that VOA's chief mission is as an evangelist for God and Apple Pie, not to grub around with objective reporting of actual facts, which only gives aid and comfort to our enemies. But this isn't the Vice of America, focusing on everything that's wrong with our great nation. It's the Voice of America. It certainly isn't the place to give authoritarian regimes in Beijing or Tehran a platform. Your mission is to promote democracy, freedom, and American values all across the world. It's a U. S. taxpayer-funded institution aimed squarely at that. Indeed, this is what sets VOA apart from MSNBC and Fox News and the like. Addressing the staff, Pompeo lamented the bad old days in the Obama administration when ""VOA lost its commitment to its founding mission. Its broadcasts had become less about telling the truth about America, and too often about demeaning America."" Then he congratulated himself fordecimating the VOA's governance structure.""I read that some VOA employees didn't want me to speak here today. I'm sure it was only a handful,"" he laughed. ""They didn't want the voice of American diplomacy to be broadcast on the Voice of America."" Because if Mike Pompeo is anything, it's diplomatic!Censorship, wokeness, political correctness, it all points in one direction – authoritarianism, cloaked as moral righteousness. It's similar to what we're seeing at Twitter, and Facebook, and Apple, and on too many university campuses today. It's not who we are. It's not who we are as Americans, and it's not what Voice of America should be. It's time that we simply put woke-ism to sleep. And then, taking no questions from the assembled reporters, he strode out imperiously. Or tried to, anyway. Here's VOA reporter Patsy Widakuswara attempting to ask the secretary questions, which is her job.

Yeah, try not to faint. NPRreports:[Pompeo's deputy Elizabeth] Robbins, previously a State Department official under Pompeo, made the request later Monday for Widakuswara to be reassigned away from covering the White House. Through a spokeswoman, Voice of America said it did not comment on personnel matters. A group of anonymous whistleblowers filed a formal complaintlast week over Pompeo's visit, saying it was propaganda and that [newly installed VOA Director Robert A.] Reilly's intention to broadcast the address over VOA's airwaves was a violation of the newsroom's protections for editorial independence. Ain't he a peach!But sometimes being a raging asshole has a cost.""Looking forward to my upcoming travel on January 13-14 to Brussels, to reaffirm the deep and enduring partnership between the U. S. and Belgium,"" Pompeotweetedyesterday. But today the trip was off,ostensiblybecause everyone at the State Department is just""identifying the career officials who will remain in positions of responsibility on an acting basis until the Senate confirmation process is complete for incoming officials"" that they've had to cancel all travel. And if you are saying, ""Mike Pompeo is going to give up a free trip to pat himself on the back in Europe to stay home and help Joe Biden out? Come the fuck on!"" you are CORRECT. Reutersreports that Pompeo canceled his trip because no one in Europe will meet with him after his boss tried to stage a violent coup last week. The extraordinary snub to Washington came days after the storming of U. S. Capitol by thousands of supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump, an unprecedented attack on American democracy that stunned many world leaders and U. S. allies. Pompeo, a close ally of Trump, had sought to meet Jean Asselborn [the Minister for Foreign Affairs] in Luxembourg, a small but wealthy NATO ally, before meeting EU leaders and the bloc's top diplomat in Brussels, three people close to the planning told Reuters. Pompeo had originally planned to go to Luxembourg, but that leg of the trip was scrapped, one diplomatic source said, after officials there showed reluctance to grant him appointments. The Brussels leg was still on until the last minute. Dissed by Luxembourg! Welcome to private life, Mister Pompeo. May it be the first of many, many slights both big and small, and may they all be a stinging humiliation.

260,Fact: An Unborn Baby is a Human Being and Abortions Kill Children,19.33,29.0,https://www.lifenews.com/2020/08/19/fact-an-unborn-baby-is-a-human-being-and-abortions-kill-children/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,22,"Recently, political scientist Michael J. New described the results of what’s being called “the largest known in-depth interview study of American attitudes on abortion” as “nuanced.” A better term would be “complicated,” or maybe even “not-at-all coherent.”This new study out of Notre Dame, entitled “How Americans Understand Abortion,”not only sought to determine what Americans believe about abortion, but why they believe it and which factors influenced those beliefs. Anyone who opposes abortion and is committed to protecting the preborn can learn much from the results. For example, I found it fascinating that, according to the study, most Americans are simply not “particularly knowledgeable about the details of abortion.”Those of us neck deep in the issue may find it unbelievable that anyone could be “unfamiliar with basic facts about fetal development or public policy,” or what Roe v. Wade actually did to America, or where state abortion laws currently stand. But many are, which makes the task of education, especially about the science and politics of abortion, a priority for pro-lifers. In fact, data suggests that many Americans would be shocked to learn how permissive our nation’s abortion laws are. Another lesson to learn from this Notre Dame study is that we must do a better job publicizing the “life-affirming work done by the thousands of pregnancy help centers in the United States.” Much of the support for legal abortion is based on the fear “that children born after unintended pregnancies would be neglected,” and that “women would be adversely impacted by carrying an unintended pregnancy to term.”In other words, people are simply unaware that these old arguments, which date back to even before Roe itself (i.e., “who will care for these women and children”), have been substantially answered in incredible ways by pro-lifers everywhere. Easing concerns about whether help is available for women in unexpected or crisis pregnancies will be essential to any effective pro-life apologetic. The most important lesson from this study, however, is just how deeply moral relativism is shaping the abortion debate. Though a large percentage of Americans dislike abortion, they are uncomfortable with making abortion illegal. The data is incredible. Even those who think that abortion should be legal know that something wrong with it. And yet, they simply can’t imagine an alternative to the status quo.“Successful pro-life outreach to this group,” New suggests, “is the key to creating a durable pro-life majority that will restore legal protection to the unborn.”In other words, in addition to the beautiful and brilliant work of caring for children and women in crisis, work the pro-life movement has excelled in for decades, we have to learn to make the case for life. By “we,” I mean “you” and “me.” We need to know the science surrounding abortion, so that “they” will know the science is on the side of life. We need to know how embryology and ultrasounds have only strengthened the case for the humanity of the fetus. The case is incredibly strong, in fact, but, as this study reveals, we can’t assume that Americans know. And if they know, we can’t assume they’ve connected the dots to the immorality of taking innocent preborn lives. The case that abortion is wrong must be made alongside the case that abortion should be illegal, and not just by the “pro-life professionals.” If the Supreme Court manages to overturn Roe v Wade, and we should pray it does, the status and safety of preborn children will be decided on a state-by-state basis. Local law matters when it comes to abortion as much or even more than national law. After all, the law is a moral teacher. Many Americans think abortion should be legal simply because it is. That’s why pro-abortion forces oppose any restriction on abortion whatsoever as outrageous infringements on women. They must not allow a pro-life foot in the door. Those of us who care about the unborn must help people know what they should know about abortion so they can make the connections they currently aren’t making. The next Colson Center online short course, to be offered in September, will help you do just that. Pro-life apologist Scott Klusendorff will, over four successive Tuesdays, equip you to defend life and oppose abortion. Learn how to make the case for life with others in less than a minute.

During the years of armed missions to the Holy Land, when Jerusalem meant something to the sacredly inclined in Europe, children were encouraged to take to the rough and dangerous road as it wound its way towards Palestine. In 1212, a boy of 12 is said to have begun preaching at Saint-Denis in France. God had supposedly taken some time to communicate a pressing wish: Christian children were to head to the Holy Land and liberate it from the Infidel. How they would do so was not clear. They subsequently starved, suffered deprivation, were killed and enslaved on route to their destination. The modern student movement against climate change stresses another Jerusalem, that there will be nothing to salvage if nothing is done now. We are all, in short, for the chop if climate change is not arrested. As an Oakland high-schooler by the name of Bruketold, “My GPA isn’t going to matter if I’m dead.” And much else besides. To such movements can also be added other acts of striking in peaceful protest. Tens of thousands of US students did so in 2018 swathed in the grief and despair of gun shootings, the most immediate being the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The National School Walkout of March 14 and the March for Our Lives ten days later had a biting clarity of purpose: students and staff were entitled to feel secure in the teaching and learning environment. The movement was characterised by much eloquence wreathed in anger and tears, not least of all Emma Gonzalez, whochidedthose political representatives “who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been ever done to prevent this”. Criticism of such movements emphasises helplessness and delusion; they are children and so are vulnerable, idiotic and irrelevant. They are to be taught and have nothing to teach the adult world. Leave it to the big boys and girls to stuff up matters. The critics, often estranged from the very political processes they have been complicit in corrupting, see embryos in need of a constructive voice, expressed constructively without inconvenience, not coherent agents keen to affect change. There is, as Kari Marie Norgaard observed in 2012, a lag between the accumulating evidence of doom on the one hand, and the absence of public urgency, even interest, in response. “Although not inherently unproblematic,”surmisedNorgaard, “local efforts may provide a key for breaking through climate avoidance from the ground up.”The global climate change strike movement by children, blown and swept along by the efforts of Swedish student Greta Thunberg, have suggested the possible short-circuiting of this dilemma: to combat the global by being stridently engaged in the local. (Such statements can become feeble mantras but do operate to galvanise interest.)For Thunberg, the issue of change is unavoidable. In her COP24 Climate Change Conferencespeechin December, the plucky youth did not believe that begging world leaders “to care for our future” would make much of a difference. “They have ignored us in the past and they will ignore us again.” What mattered was letting “them know that change is coming whether they like it or not.”Protests wereregisteredon March 15 across 2,052 venues in 123 countries. There were 50 in Australia; and protests in every state in the United States. Often forgotten in these movements is the role played by children themselves in the organisational side of things, often clear, fathomable and inherently coherent. In the United Statesweresuch figures as 12-year-old Haven Coleman of Denver, Colorado, Alexandria Villasenor of New York City, and 16-year-old Israr Hirsi of Minnesota. Squirrel scholars suggest that these actions represented a “transformation” at play. Associate lecturer Blanche Verlieclaimedthat her research revealed how “young people’s sense of self, identity, and existence is being fundamentally altered by climate change.” It can be tempting to read too much into matters, to see flowers grow in fields initially thought barren. But there is little doubting climate change as a catalyst of active and noisy encouragement amongst youth, one akin to the anti-war movements of the Vietnam War period. There has been much finger wagging against the children from, for instance, politicians who just cannot understand how a striking student could ever get employment. How dare they take time off learning in a classroom while taking to the classroom of the streets? The spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May, for instance,arguedthat such protests increased “teachers’ workloads” and wasted lesson time. Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, in contrast,signalledhis preference for the marchers and strikers: “Climate change is the greatest threat that we all face but it is the school kids of today whose futures are most on the line.”In Australia, New South Wales Education Minister Rob Stokespreferredto brandish the rod of punitive action: both students and teachers would be punished for participating in the March 15 rally. By all means, find your “voice”, suggested the threatening minister, but avoid doing so during school hours. For such scolding types, climate change and injustice have strict timetables and schedules, to be dealt with in good, extra-curricular time. Australian Resources Minister Matt Canavan’s views on the youth climate action movement are childishly simple and representative, suggesting that Thunberg is correct in her harsh assessment. Recordedin November last year, the minister sees education as an instrumental affair. “The best thing you’ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue. Because that’s what your future life will look like […] not actually taking charge of your life and getting a real job.” Forget the environment’s durability; drill it, excavate it, mine it, drain it and burn it to a cinder. Australia, and the world, do not need environmentally conscious citizens, merely automata consuming and feeding the commodity markets. For the likes of Canavan, it is too late. For the children, the battle to change the beastly status quo is urgent, pressing and inevitable.

Former Vice President Joe Bidenis up in overall electoral votesfor the time being, but one thing’s for certain: The 2020 election is not going to be the resounding repudiation of Trumpism that many had hoped for. I hate to break it to those people, but that was never going to be the case. There was a certain kind of traumatic shock that came with the 2016 election, particularly among liberal white voters.they asked. Who knew it was so misogynist? Who knew so many people could be so easily duped?This time around, there was hope that Biden couldpull off a landslideand prove that 2016 had just been a fluke. But that faith was predicated on the ahistorical notion that Americans — especially white Americans — would rise to the occasion, and that Biden’s promises of a return to an immediate normalcy would in fact hold true. Even if Biden pulls out the W this time around, we’ve got trouble ahead. Voter suppression continues toonly get worseacross the country. North Carolina voters just elected 25-year-old Madison Cawthorn (whocomplainedabout attacks on “white males running for office” and sentthis heinous tweetright after winning) to Congress, and Georgia votersdid the samefor Marjorie Taylor Greene, a well-known QAnon conspiracy theorist. Though his reelection wasalways likely, Mitch McConnell is still the leaderof Republican senators heading into 2021. While Democrats will maintain their majority in the House, theylost several key races, includingsome of the big pickupsduring the 2018 midterms. To top it off, Trump is alreadylaying downhis baseless claims of voter fraud this election cycle because he can’t boast a commanding victory. Teen Voguepolitics team. Sign up for theTeen VogueTake!To be completely honest, while various pundits may say otherwise, I’m not sure any other Democratic candidate would’ve fared much better than Biden. That’s not due to the fact that he was some sort of ultra-unifying candidate of sheer perfection, but instead because it’s hard to go up against a gigantic machine of people who are actively and enthusiastically voting for white supremacy, misogyny, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, and so much more. Pew Research Center datesuggeststhat their votes weren’t necessarily against Joe Biden; they wereDonald Trump. Considering that the president still hasalmost a 45% approval ratingin a pandemic whereover 230,000 people have diedandmillions are out of work, it all tracks. Throwing blame on a lone scapegoat is easy; acknowledging and then dismantling a structurally oppressive system filled with people very loudly advocating for a white Christian ethno-state is much harder, less convenient, and more violent. For those who’ve spent the better part of four years banking on Trump’s ascendancy being an aberration, it’s time to put that notion to rest. He was always a symptom and never the core problem. But there is hope. We have to remember that, in many ways, we are a majoritybeing ruled by a minority— and we have to stop waiting for some quick solution to save us from being a country defined by centuries of oppression. The marginalization, after all, isbakedinto our nation’s DNA and was very intentionally put there. It’s taken decades to get to the point we’re at right now; it should be no surprise it’s going to take even longer to go further. While that’s all very scary, it also means that we don’t have to go at it alone. There are incredible organizers and activists who’ve been doing this work all over the country for decades, and others did that work before them in the preceding years and even centuries. Many folks were politically activated in the back half of the 2010s, which means we aren’t starting from scratch like it felt in 2016. Each of us doesn’t have to individually do it all — we can pick our causes and go hard at them. We aren’t running our own separate races; we’re a relay team working to move that baton and pass it onto the next generation. Right now, though, for those who are reeling from the evening and the general state of our country, rest for a few days and let the amount of work we have to do sink in. But once that period of devastation gives way to burning rage again, takethe words of abolitionist, activist, and organizer Mariame Kabato heart: “Let this radicalize you rather than lead you to despair.”?

The airline said Tuesday afternoon it had resolved a connectivity issue that prompted it to cancel more than 500 flights, about 15% of its schedule. On Wednesday, more than 260 flights, about 7% of its schedule, were canceled and more than 300 were delayed, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.""While our technology issues from Tuesday have been resolved, we are still experiencing a small number of cancelations and delays across our network as we continue working to resume normal operations,"" Southwest spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement Wednesday. Southwest said it is investigating the issue and doesn't have reason to believe it's connected to Monday's problem with a weather data supplier that delayed hundreds of flights. The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday had issued a brief, nationwide ground stop for Southwest, which prevents its flights from taking off to avoid overwhelming destinations. More than 1,690 Southwest flights were delayed Tuesday, close to half of the carrier's schedule, according to FlightAware. On Monday, 1,541 Southwest flights, about 41% of its schedule, were delayed, according to the site. The airline said that its operations on were disrupted Monday evening after its ""third-party weather provider experienced intermittent performance issues"" but told employees earlier Tuesday that it was in ""relatively good shape"" as operations resumed. The issues occurred just as airlines like Southwest are flying an increasing number of travelers as demand rebounds fromthe coronavirus pandemic. Carriers are grappling with a surge in customers along with employee reductions after they offeredbuyoutsand other packages to cut costs in the pandemic. Southwest,Delta Air LinesandAmerican Airlines, for example, have warned travelers about long hold times for customer service and encouraged them to use self-service options. While Southwest's issue Tuesday appeared to have only briefly impacted its systems, longer-lasting technology issues or outages can be costly.

The Biden administration is planning to take a harder line against vaccine-related misinformation propagated by GOP officials and on social media platforms alike, CNNreports, a stance some administration officials havealready startedto take. “Health misinformation is a serious threat to public health,” U. S. Surgeon Generalsaidin an advisory Thursday, calling it “a moral and civic imperative” for tech companies and others to fight such falsehoods. Administration officials “said a decision had been made” to “call out Republican elected officials and specific social media platforms” in the coming days and “are planning a call to attention more than a call to action,” according to CNN. Just this week, the administration took on vaccine skepticism through a variety of strategies, from Vice Presidentencouraging health workers in Detroit to “get the facts out” about the vaccine toteaming up with pop starOlivia Rodrigoto promote the vaccine among young people. The White House is trying to affirm the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines to young Americans—currently the eligible age group with the lowest vaccination rates thus far—by capitalizing on Rodrigo’s massive social media reach. Presidenthimself may reportedly get involved in the pushback against health misinformation perpetuated by Republican officials and right-wing media, though doing so risks fanning the flames of conservatives who have cast resistance to the vaccine as a way ofsticking itto their opponent—andpotentially endangered their audiencein the process. Fox’s anti-vaccine scare campaign has involved inaccurately conflating Biden’s door-to-door initiative to get people protected from COVID-19 as an “Orwellian” violation of personal privacy and freedom, among the misleading claims with stakes that administration officials have becomeincreasingly willingto call out.

267,Preston calls for hearing on UCSF Inner Sunset expansion – The San Francisco Examiner,-1.33,44.33,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/preston-calls-for-hearing-on-ucsf-inner-sunset-expansion/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,19,"Supervisor Dean Preston on Tuesday called for a hearing on the planned University of San Francisco expansion in the Inner Sunset. UCSF has plans to add another 1.5 million square feet to its Parnassus Heights campus, reaching more than 5 million square feet total. The expansion will bring nearly 1,000 units of housing, offices, and research facilities, and a new hospital expected to open in 2030 to increase patient capacity at the foot of Mount Sutro south of Golden Gate Park. The plan may be approved as soon as Jan. 20 by the University of California Board of Regents, which has the final say. Preston said his office sought a delay to March but was rebuffed. As a state entity, the university is not subject to San Francisco’s usual development process, but is crafting a memorandum of understanding with The City.“In 29 days, the California Regents will be asked to approve one of the most significant real estate deals my district has seen in years, and yet the board has not and will not have the opportunity to weigh in,” Preston said. “More to the point, the city has negotiated an agreement, purportedly to secure benefits for the community, the terms of which the community has yet to see.”The MOU is supposed to outline specific aspects for UCSF to invest in, like transportation or affordability, with public input. An informational hearing may come before the Planning Commission on Jan. 7. In January 2020, Mayor London Breed, Board of Supervisors President Norman Yee and Supervisor Dean Preston wrote to the university asking to make sure the Planning Department and campus neighbors are heard through a MOU process. UCSF Chancellor Sam Hagwood responded that month, noting a community engagement process dating back to 2018.“We look forward to developing our plans further with continued input from our neighbors, and we appreciate your engagement and support,” Hagwood wrote. “While our work is just beginning, we are confident we will build a new Parnassus Heights presence that will bring practical benefits to the neighborhood and enables us to fully leverage our academic-backed healthcare to serve the growing demand for complex care that exceeds our current capacity and that other health care institutions refer to us.”A community advisory committee, however,told SF Weeklythat some plans were not presented as up for debate. There have been two public meetings on the MOU in September and December but concerns remain over lack of detail. Preston is seeking a hearing for the board to publicly consider the plan and MOU.“This is in no way an indictment of [city] efforts, as well as the representatives of UCSF who have engaged to date,” Preston said of the hearing. “It is, however, deeply disappointing that UCSF leadership has decided to press on, in the midst of a pandemic, on an arbitrary timeline that does not accommodate public input on the proposed agreement.”Preston’s office expects the hearing to be held before the Jan. 20 Regents meeting.",3,Reliable,0.0889051808406647,0.4378380579993483,624,3,SF Examiner
268,Europe starts considering a Chinese COVID-19 vaccine for approval,-1.0,46.33,https://fortune.com/2021/05/04/coronavac-sinovac-covid-vaccine-eu-ema-rolling-review/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,25,"Europe’s top health regulator has begun evaluating China’s CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for potential use in the European Union. The European Medicines Agency (EMA)saidTuesday that its rolling review of data for the vaccine would “continue until enough evidence is available” for the vaccine’s developer, Sinovac BioTech, to file a formal application for authorization. This process is supposed to reduce the amount of time needed to evaluate the eventual application. Other vaccines in the EMA’s pipeline include Russia’s Sputnik V, Germany’s CureVac, and the U. S.’s Novavax. The agency has already green-lit the BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. CoronaVac, or “COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated” as it is more formally known, is unique among these vaccines in that it uses the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself—albeit in killed-off form—to trigger the immune response that leads to inoculation. India’s Covaxin takes the same approach, as doValneva’s under-development vaccineandQazVac, Kazakhstan’s homegrown jab. The level of CoronaVac’s efficacy is not certain. Turkish researchers have put itas high as 83.5%, which would make the jab more effective thanAstraZenecaor J&J’s vaccines. But itbarely cleared the 50% thresholdin Brazil—though that could be because trials there were largely dealing with the extremely dangerous P.1 coronavirus variant. CoronaVac’s finalized trial data is yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Gao Fu, the head of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, caused a stir last month whenhe admitted that China’s vaccines—including CoronaVac and Sinopharm—”don’t have very high rates of protection.” However, he subsequently claimed reports of the admission were a “complete misunderstanding.”The European Union is mostly acting as a collective in its approval and purchasing of COVID-19 vaccines. However, the slow start to Europe’s vaccination drive—which has recently picked up significant pace—led some Eastern European countries to consider non-Western alternatives. Hungary in particular bypassed the European Commission’s bulk purchasing mechanisms to secure its own supplies of Sputnik V andSinopharm. EMA approval does not necessarily mean the European Commission will place an order. For example, Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton—the head of the Commission’s vaccine task force—has repeatedlysaidthe EU has no need for Sputnik V, even though the EMA is evaluating it. CoronaVac has already been approved for use in a couple dozen countries, including Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and of course China itself. The World Health Organization is evaluating both CoronaVac and Sinopharm for potential approval. If it gives the go-ahead, the Chinese vaccines could then be included in the WHO-backedCOVAX program, which is distributing low-cost doses to low- and middle-income countries. Vaccine deals aside, though, an EMA recommendation for the approval of CoronaVac could have a big impact onChinese tourismin the EU. The European Commission officially proposed this week that the EU should open its borders to travelers who have beenfully vaccinatedwith EMA-approved jabs.",3,Reliable,0.103076488095238,0.3851125000000001,766,3,Fortune
269,Finger-pointing abounds as states get fewer vaccines than planned,-3.67,44.67,https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/vaccines-ready-but-no-distribution-operation-warp-speed-meets-speed-bumps/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,19,"All in all, it's about what you'd expect in the first weeks of a massive undertaking like this. One of the first states to report problems was Illinois, where its governor, J. B. Pritzker, said that it had indications it wouldonly be receiving half the expected dosesof the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine next week. Since then, over a dozen states have indicated that they'll be receiving fewer doses than planned in the second week (this articleseems to have a fairly comprehensive list). Aside from the obvious problem of fewer vaccinated people, this creates issues for states that are working through vaccinating a set of populations using risk-based priorities. For example, the availability of doses for health care workers will determine when vaccinations can be shifted to nursing home populations; planning on when to change the target population will be critical for a quick and effective shift. Without knowing when sufficient vaccines will be available, it's much harder to manage these transitions. When it comes to why the orders are being cut, we're hearing multiple excuses. At a press conference on the distribution effort, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azarpointed the finger at Pfizer, which is manufacturing the vaccine in the US. “We have recently been informed by them, finally, of various challenges that they might have in their manufacturing, and we will ensure that by whatever mechanism, that we provide them full support to ensure that they can produce for the American people,” Azar said. But Azar's isn't the only story being given out by the government. The Washington Postwas toldthat the issue was a matter of when the week's doses were determined. Originally, that had been planned for Friday, when the full week's manufacturing run had completed; it has since been shifted to Tuesday when fewer doses would be completed. That would necessarily cut down on the availability numbers given to states. Unfortunately, neither of these seems to be entirely true. In response to this news, Pfizer hasissued a statementin which it says it is having no production issues. ""This week, we successfully shipped all 2.9 million doses that we were asked to ship by the U. S. Government to the locations specified by them,"" the statement reads. ""We have millions more doses sitting in our warehouse but, as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses.""Given that BioNTech joined up with Pfizer in part because of the latter's manufacturing abilities and due to clear credibility issues with the Trump administration on the topic of COVID-19, it's likely that Pfizer's statement is closer to the truth. Warp Speed is a large and complex project in which multiple vaccine manufacturers will eventually be shipping doses to the federal government, which will then distribute them to states, each of which has to plan to get them to populations according to different priorities. It's not at all surprising that there would be some growing pains. Hopefully, they can be ironed out while there's a single vaccine supplier, which limits the complexity somewhat. But the single supplier status may change as early as today, based on the decision of an FDA advisory board that a vaccine from Moderna is effective. Based on preliminary figures, Moderna expects that it will supply substantially more vaccine as soon as it receives a formal Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, which will complicate distribution but ease supply bottlenecks. Longer term, there are indications of other opportunities to increase vaccine supplies. After havingdeclined an offer from Pfizerto purchase additional doses of the vaccine earlier this year, the federal government may beclose to a dealto purchase more. Pfizer had worked with the suppliers of its raw materials to determine how much vaccine it could produce; when the US turned it down, the company simply found other countries to sell doses to. Now, it's indicating that if the US government can ensure enhanced supply of its vaccine ingredients, it will sell the additional doses to the country. As of right now, the US only has commitments to buy enough vaccine to cover half of its population by the middle of 2021, making additional doses essential. Last week, the government did manage toget a commitment from Modernafor another 100 million doses of its vaccine. Major pharmacy chains areexpecting widespread availabilitythis spring, indicating a confidence that additional supplies will be sorted out. One small help for the present supply constraints that has become apparent this week is that the normal ""overfill"" found in vaccine bottles is sometimes enough toallow an extra doseto be extracted from a five-dose bottle of Pfizer vaccine. While it won't handle the big-picture supply issues, it will undoubtedly help individual facilities get more of their staff protected in the early days of the vaccination program.",3,Reliable,0.097467095812684,0.4303575917546506,1015,3,ARS Technica

Bill Lee and the state of Tennessee are finally publicly reporting confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to schools. The Tennessee Department of Education will launch a new dashboard on Tuesday that will include the total number of active cases among students and staff broken down by school across the state. The department will update the dashboard every Monday with the previous week's number of new cases and will include classroom or school closures and whether students are learning in-person, remotely or a hybrid of both for each district.“Parents and community members are working to make informed decisions, and we have determined the best path that balances informed decision making with our obligation to student privacy,” Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn said in a statement. “We believe this resource will not only help parents but will inform how COVID-19 is affecting student attendance, chronic absenteeism and overall student attainment.""Tennessee refuses to release information about COVID-19 cases in schoolsLee, Schwinn and state Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Pierceyhave all been criticized for not publicly reporting information on COVID-19 casesin schools. All have previously cited federal privacy law restrictions, like HIPAA and FERPA, for preventing the release of the information.""The real challenge is to provide as much information as possible to provide for transparency and to give information that is important to the public but continue to provide and adhere to privacy restrictions that FERPA and HIPAA require,"" Lee said previously. ""And that's a balance.""Lee acknowledged Thursday there is wide desire among parents for data that will help them make informed decisions about whether to send their children to school or not. Developing a dashboard to meet these needs appropriately was a process, Lee said during a news briefing.""We believe (the dashboard) will help parents make choices, but it won't compromise our commitment to parents and to students and to teachers,"" Lee said. ""It's uncharted territory. Most states are still grappling with this, but we think we have developed a tool that will be helpful in determining not only how many cases are in a school but also how it affects attendance, chronic absenteeism and even academic outcomes among our students.""Nearly200 COVID-19 cases linked to schools have been reportedacross the state since the first school districts in Tennessee reopened in late July, many prompting quarantines of students and staff and even temporary school closures. Dozens of school districts scrambled to launch their own online dashboards or other methods to report the number of positive cases among staff and students, how many individuals were in isolation or quarantine and school closures. Several states are already reporting or have committed to reporting the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, including Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Texas. These Tennessee school districts are already reporting COVID-19 cases after reopeningHow should districts notify parents about confirmed COVID-19 cases in their child's school?Schwinn said that the majority of state reporting efforts are being led by state health departments — the Tennessee Department of Education is the first to report cases in schools itself. The commissioner has been under fire in recent weeks from a group of lawmakers and some school district leaders over the education department's handling of the pandemic. From what information to report about confirmed cases to what safety guidance to follow in classrooms, some school leaders say the department has not given clear, consistent guidance. Lee releasedthe state's school reopening guidanceon July 28 — days after some Tennessee school districts had already reopened. Initially, he and Piercey said that neither the education or health departments would be tracking or reporting COVID-19 cases in schools. Helater announced that the state would work on a plan for reporting such data. Just a week later, Lee reversed course again and said the state would not release the data. After that, Lee said the state was contacting federal officials about what it could release. Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, has consistently argued the public has the right to know what's happening in schools. She acknowledged that districts might be worried that if they release school data, people will use it to try to identify infected people.""It all comes down to, 'Are we somehow identifying that Joe Smith in third grade has COVID-19?"" Fisher said. But privacy concerns are also dueling with the public's right to know, Fisher said.“That has to be weighed with the need for the public to know what’s happening in the schools,"" she said. ""People don’t want to make decisions about their kids in the dark.”House to hold special hearing on school return as legislators, conservative activists raise concerns about Commissioner SchwinnTennessee Department of Education launches dashboard to track school closings due to coronavirusThe state's new dashboard will be maintained by education department officials and school districts will be expected to update the department weekly. The state will not report specific case numbers for schools with less than 50 students enrolled — there are less than 40 of those statewide — and will not report the specific number of cases if the active case number is less than five. The education department routinely redacts student demographic or test data when it only applies to small numbers of students as a way to protect privacy. Department officials anticipate local school districts will likely still have the most up-to-date information on active cases in their schools and encourage families and community members to continue to reach out to local districts for more information.

271,As the Dark Night Rises,23.0,31.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-dark-night-rises/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"Back in 1968, the Rolling Stones imagined a world in which “every cop is a criminal, and all the sinners saints.” More than half a century after the release of “Sympathy of the Devil,” those lyrics are coming to life: The police are scourged, targeted, and de-funded, while convicts and low-lifes are hailed, released—and some have even received a kind ofhagiography. In fact, works of literature and popular culture have often anticipated future events. In his 1914 novelThe World Set Free,H. G. Wells envisioned the atomic bomb, three decades before the first one was detonated in 1945. In 1932’sBrave New World, Aldous Huxley imagined the mass media being cynically and deliberately used in order to anesthetize the population; at the time, the addictive powers of television and social media were decades in the future. Then, in 1994, in the novelDebt of Honor,Tom Clancy raised the possibility of a passenger jet being intentionally crashed into the U. S. Capitol; just seven years later, of course, came 9/11. So now, in the midst of a national nightmare of violence, disease, and ill will, we might look back at a presciently creepy film from 2012, Christopher Nolan’sThe Dark Knight Rises. In fact, Nolan’sTDKR—part of a Batman trilogy, released from 2005 to 2012—is regarded as both a commercial triumph and a classic of contemporary cinema. We might also add that Nolan is at least some kind of conservative;TDKRis unabashedly pro-police and anti-radical, even as it takes the dramatic license of making the bad guy, Bane, as vivid and interesting as the good guy, Batman. (In 2017, Nolan releasedDunkirk, an overtly patriotic and admiring recollection of Britain’s miracle in World War Two.)In fact, even thoughThe Dark Knight Risesis ultimately a morality tale of good defeating evil, as a piece of art, it must necessarily include plenty of nuance, and even murk. To be be sure, such shades-of-graying have been at the heart of Batman’s appeal for more than eight decades, since the Caped Crusader made his comic-book debut in 1939. Unlike most super-heroes, Bruce Wayne—alias: Batman—himself has no super powers. Yes, he has super-technology, but he is distinctly mortal and vulnerable. After all, his parents were murdered by a robber, right before his eyes—and it was that tragic incident that provoked the young heir to dedicate his life to fighting crime. Yet still, as every pop-culture fan knows, even after creating a high-tech Bat Cave underneath the brooding manse he calls home, Bruce Wayne/Batman is afflicted with Hamlet-level hesitations and uncertainties. And so even if, like Hamlet—or like Achilles, King Arthur, or Simba, the cub-turned-Lion King—Wayne is ultimately summoned to duty, the path by which he responds to the Bat Signal is always strewn with psychic obstacles. TDKR, released barely more than a decade after 9/11, vibrates with echoes of that tragedy. It’s set in Manhattan—thinly renamed, of course, “Gotham City”—and so we see terrorists blow up structures, while the blue-clad police stoically do their duty—and go to their fate. Yet at the same time, the film also recalls more recent events, such as Occupy Wall Street—and then spins forward to the rise of Antifa and hard-left radicalism and demagoguery. Indeed, early in the film, a female character says to the hidden Batman, “There’s a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you’re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.” Okay, so that’s the speech of a revolutionary, even if, in this instance, the speaker is an opportunist hypocrite; she is, after all, a cat-burglar, not a class-warrior. For his part, Wayne responds, “You sound like you’re looking forward to it.” And the woman answers, cool cynicism in her voice, “I’m adaptable.” Eight years later, those chill words stick with us, since, as we know, the revolution of 2020—as much cultural, right now, as physical—is being championed, and even financed, by adaptable wokesters. That is, by woke celebrities, tycoons, and corporations, all seeing tactical advantage in positioning themselves as cultural revolutionaries, while not actually risking their own income or property. So when Bane, the lead terrorist, having already attacked the New York Stock Exchange, takes over City Hall and declares, “I give it back to you, the people”—the insincerity in his voice is louder than his amplified volume. Indeed, eight years later, the same fraudulence oozes out of advertisers, marketers, and influencers across the landscape. Moreover, when Bane, leading an Antifa-ish horde, proclaims, “The police will survive when they learn to serve true justice,” we are reminded that “true justice” is whatever the violent proclaimer wishes it to be. And so the revolutionaries create their own kangaroo court, giving defendants the choice of “death or exile,” knowing that the sentence actually always means both. Indeed, to help set the tone, the film even quotes a passage from Charles Dickens’ 19th-century anti-revolutionary novel about the French Revolution,A Tale of Two Cities. Moreover, in Nolan’s 21st-century anti-revolutionary telling, even the woke plutocrats who financed the revolution aren’t safe; they, too, are sentenced to doom. Thus one is reminded of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, a cousin to Louis XVI, who supported the French Revolution and even voted to guillotine his relative the king. In fact, the duke even changed his name to the non-royal Philippe Égalité—although all that trendy common-causing was for naught, as Philippe, too, was guillotined in 1793. As Bane says mockingly of the fat cats he defeats, “Peace has cost you your strength!” Only, finally, does Batman rouse himself: “I’m not afraid. I’m angry.”Of course, today, we aren’t living in the world of the Dark Knight—there is no billionaire Batman coming to save us. Yes, we have an actual rich mogul in the White House, but he hasn’t worked out as many had hoped. Moreover, other real-life billionaires who have proffered themselves as political saviors—including Howard Schultz, Tom Steyer, and Mike Bloomberg—have all fizzled. So today—just as Mick Jagger also sang in “Sympathy for the Devil,” that half-century-old tune—“Heads is tails.” Yes, up is down, and down is up, as we grope our way to discover, or recover, a proper moral order. In the meantime, across this afflicted land, only the darknightis rising; there’s as yet no dawn on the horizon. So on this darkling plain, with no super-hero to save us from the ignorant clashes, maybe the only thing we can do is to light a beacon of hope for ordinary heroes—including ourselves—each to do what he or she can to set the world to right.",1,Questionable,0.0647611692514604,0.4729692906877373,1659,2,The American Conservative
272,"US Capitol building breach 'almost textbook' sedition, legal expert says",-1.67,47.67,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/01/06/us-capitol-breach-sedition-legal-expert-says/6571725002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,25,"The supporters of President Donald Trump who breached the U. S. Capitol building on Wednesday may face charges of sedition, several legal experts told the Detroit Free Press. The U. S. center of power became a scene of outright chaos Wednesday as supporters made their way past barricades, broke in through windows and sent representatives into hiding during a session of debate over election certification. The assault on the Capitol came shortly after a rally for the president, who continued to levy baseless claims that the election was rigged and told the crowd they would ""never concede,""USA Today reported. The actions of the crowd were “inexcusable” and crimes, U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Matthew Schneider told the Detroit Free Press.“There's a difference, a big difference, between peaceful protests and expressing your freedoms,” said Schneider, who was appointed to his post by Trump.“This is not it. The violent protesters are committing crimes, and they have to stop right now and this is not what our Constitution protects.”Depending on what investigators find and individual circumstances, charges could range from everything from low-level curfew charges, to trespassing, to the misdemeanor of destruction of government property less than $1,000, depending on the cost of the windows and anything else, he said. There could be a felony charge of destruction of government property over $1,000, depending on what was damaged, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, he said. Electoral counting resumes after police retake Capitol from pro-Trump rioters; woman shot and killed; Twitter locks out TrumpMichigan lawmakers hunkered down as rioters breached US CapitolOn the high end, charges of civil disorder, interfering with law enforcement, or inciting a riot could all be possible, up to seditious conspiracy — a federal charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison, he said. That latter charge seemed most appealing to two professors of Western Michigan University’s Cooley Law School. It reads:“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.""The phrase “delay the execution of the law” is key, and what was seen from some of the Trump supporters Wednesday, said Devin Schindler, a law professor who once clerked for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.“For at least some of these protesters, particularly the ones that broke into the Capitol, I think there's an extraordinarily strong case that they used force to delay, to hinder, the execution of our laws governing the election and how electoral votes are counted,” he said. “It seems fairly clear to me, based on what we're seeing, that folks are in fact, almost textbook violating this seditious conspiracy statute by using force to interfere with lawful government activity.""Though people on Twitter were levying the term “treason,” he and Schneider both agreed the charge didn’t quite fit with what is known, because treason requires the involvement of enemies to the U. S. Retired Brig. Gen. Michael McDaniel, associate dean for the Western Michigan University-Cooley Law School, too, pointed to sedition as a key possible charge in the case, after possible lesser charges. He also said the defense might be difficult; First Amendment protections aren’t in play once a break-in occurs. The idea of “sedition” has changed, he said, pointing to the version President John Adams used against his political opponents. It’s been narrowed by the courts in the present day. He also raised concern for a different federal charge of rebellion or insurrection, which could carry a sentence of 10 years in prison, and Trump’swords at the rally earlierin the day.“Remember it's got to be ‘against the authority of the United States,’” he said, using the language of the law. “So a really interesting question to pose to my law students later on this week is whether or not the president's speech … was inciting them to violence against the authority of the government of the United States.”Depending on that answer, given the president’s role, another impeachment would perhaps be more appropriate than a charge, he said. There likely won’t be any court action quickly on the events of the day, Michael Traugott, a professor emeritus of communication studies and political science and research professor emeritus at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan, said. There will be jurisdiction issues, even among which agencies will be doing investigations. Michigan leaders renounce US Capitol riot: 'This is happening because of lies'Trump repeated lies about Michigan's election before pro-Trump supporters stormed CapitolSchneider, too, said investigations could take weeks, but said some people could be charged Wednesday evening. But it’s not the first time the idea for ""seditious conspiracy"" has been raised in the last year. The U. S. government looked to the seditious conspiracy charge amid the violence of summer protests, Schneider said. Looking back historically, he also recalled another time shots rang out at the Capitol, in 1954. Five House lawmakers were shot and wounded then by members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, which argued for the island’s independence, who were shooting from the gallery above the chamber,USA Today reported. A different time, a gunman on the first floor of the building also killed two Capitol police officers in 1998, and a former Capitol officer fired shots at a senator in 1947 as he entered the subway tunnel linking the Capitol to Senate offices, USA Today reported. However, Traugott said the nearest precedent to what happened Wednesday can be found back in the Civil War. But even then, the Capitol itself wasn’t stormed.""The action of the mob in Washington, incited by President Trump, is an unprecedented affront to the peaceful transfer of power on which our democracy is based,” he said. “It is a seditious act unlike anything since the Civil War.“There have been individual acts, like Oklahoma City, but nothing like this. It’s pretty directly attributable to one person (Trump).”The actions of the mob created a “tear in our civil and political fabric (that) will be difficult to repair,” he said. People need to know the punishments, so they go home and things don’t get even worse, said Schneider.“We should all be able to disagree peacefully,” he said. “That's one of the most disturbing things to me is that we're, on both sides of the aisle, everyone is taking these disagreements to the extreme interest shouldn't be that way,” he said. Considering the historical context, Schindler thought back to the burning of the Capitol during the War of 1812, but still thought the 2020 storming stood out.“This kind of violence within the Capitol is extraordinarily rare,” he said. There’s some examples back in the pre-Civil War era or the Civil War era or congressman fights,” he said. “There was some … shootings in the Capitol, but to see this level of violence directed towards the lawful exercise of government is unheard of.”",3,Reliable,0.0645735322241346,0.4017489003633583,1630,3,Detroit Free Press
273,"China, the New Cold War Threat That Wasn’t",-15.0,32.33,https://progressive.org/dispatches/china-cold-war-threat-benjamin-davies-200804/,https://adfontesmedia.com/progressive-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-04,17,"Tensions between the United States and China are rising, with tit-for-tat consulate closures, new U. S. sanctions, and no less thanthreeU. S. aircraft carrier strike groups prowling around the South China Sea. It is the United States that has initiated each new escalation in U. S.-China tensions. China’s responses have been careful and proportionate, with Chinese officials such as Foreign Minister Wang Yipublicly askingthe United States to step back from its brinkmanship to find common ground for diplomacy. With a war-weary public demanding an end to the endless conflicts that have served to justify record military spending for nearly twenty years, the U. S. military-industrial complex has to find more substantial enemies to justify its continued existence and budget-busting costs. Most of the U. S. complaints about China are longstanding, from itstreatmentof the Uighur minority anddisputesover islands and maritime borders in the South China Sea, to accusations of unfairtrade practicesand criminalizing protesters in Hong Kong. But the answer to the question “Why now?” seems obvious: the approaching U. S. election. Danny Russel, who was Obama’s top East Asia expert in the National Security Council and then at the State Department,told the BBCthat the new tensions with China are partly an effort to divert attention from Trump’s bungled response to the COVID-19 pandemic and his tanking poll numbers, saying this “has a wag-the-dog feel to it.”Meanwhile, Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden has been going toe-to-toe with Trump andSecretary Mike Pompeoin a potentially dangerous“tough on China”contest, which could prove difficult for the winner to walk back after the election. China’s economic miracle has lifted hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty, and, until recently, Western corporations were glad to make the most of its huge pool of cheap labor,weakworkplace and environmental protections, and growing consumer market. Western leaders welcomed China intotheir clubof wealthy, powerful countries with little fuss about human and civil rights. So what changed?U. S.-based high-tech companies like Apple, which were once only too glad to outsource American jobs and trainChinese contractorsand engineers to manufacture their products, are finally confronting the reality that they have not just outsourced jobs, but also skills and technology. Chinese companiesand highly skilled workers are now leading some of the world’s latest technological advances. The global rollout of 5G cellular technology has become a flashpoint because Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE have developed and patented much of thecritical infrastructureinvolved, leaving Silicon Valley in the unfamiliar position of having to play catchup. Also, if the 5G infrastructure in the United States is built by Huawei and ZTE (rather than AT&T and Verizon), the U. S. government will no longer be able to require the “back doors” that the NSA uses to spy on us all—so they’re creating a scapegoat,stoking fearsthat China could insert its own back doors in Chinese equipment to spy on us instead. Left out of the discussion is the real solution: Repeal thePatriot Actand make sure that all the technology we use in our daily lives is secure from the prying eyes of both the U. S. and foreign governments. China is investing in infrastructure all over the world. As of March 2020, a staggering138 countrieshad joined China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a massive plan to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and maritime networks. China’s international influence will only be enhanced by its success, and the U. S.’s failure, in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, with a war-weary public demanding an end to the endless conflicts that have served to justify record military spending for nearly twenty years, the U. S. military-industrial complex has to find more substantial enemies to justify its continued existence and budget-busting costs. Lockheed Martin is not ready to switch from building billion-dollar warplanes oncost-pluscontracts to making wind turbines and solar panels. The only targets the United States can find to justify a $740 billion military budget and 800 overseas military bases are its familiar old Cold War enemies: Russia and China. Both countries expanded their modest military budgets after 2011, when the U. S. and its allies hijacked the Arab Spring to launch covert and proxy wars in Libya, where China had substantial oil interests, and Syria, a long-term Russian ally. But these increases in military spending were only relative. In 2019, China’s military budget was$261 billion, compared to the United States’ $732 billion, according to theStockholm International Peace Research Institute. The United States stillspends moreon its military than the ten next largest military powers combined, including Russia and China. Russian and Chinese military forces are almost entirely defensive, with an emphasis on advanced and effective anti-ship and anti-aircraftmissile systems. Neither Russia nor China has invested in carrier strike groups to sail the seven seas or U. S.-style expeditionary forces to attack or invade countries on the other side of the planet. But for lack of a more serious military threat to the United States, U. S. military doctrine is once again treating Russia and China as existential threats. The sad truth is that thirty years after the supposed end of the Cold War, the U. S. military-industrial complex has failed to reimagine itself in anything but Cold War terms, and its “New” Cold War is just a revival of the old one. The United States and China do not have to be enemies. Just a year ago, a hundred U. S. business, political and military leaders signed apublic letterto President Donald Trump in The Washington Post entitled “China Is Not an Enemy.”They wrote that China is not “an economic enemy or an existential national security threat,” and that U. S opposition “will not prevent the continued expansion of the Chinese economy, a greater global market share for Chinese companies, and an increase in China’s role in world affairs.”The letter concluded that “U. S. efforts to treat China as an enemy and decouple it from the global economy will damage the United States’ international role and reputation and undermine the economic interests of all nations,” and that the United States “could end up isolating itself rather than Beijing.”That is precisely what is happening. Governments all over the world are collaborating with China to stop the spread of coronavirus and share the solutions with all who need them, making the timing of the United States’ current effort to undermine China exceptionally counterproductive. Only by cooperating with other nations and international organizations can we stop the pandemic—and address the coronavirus-sparked economic meltdown gripping the world economy and the many other challenges we must all face together if we are to survive and thrive in the twenty-first century.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0473735369568703,0.4018418310084977,1506,2,The Progressive
274,What to know about getting vaccinated for COVID-19 in Michigan,0.0,53.0,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/01/13/what-know-getting-vaccinated-covid-19-michigan/6654800002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-13,25,"Doses of COVID-19 vaccines are trickling into Michigan’s hospitals, health departments and long-term care facilities as the more than 2.5 million people who are currently eligible to be vaccinated struggle to learn when and where they can be vaccinated. At the current rate, it could take months to vaccinate those now eligible, including front-line workers, teachers, first responders and people age 65 or older, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state's chief medical executive, said Wednesday. Some officials have said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer should not have opened vaccinations up to people ages 65 and older beginning Monday - which lengthened the queue by about 702,000 people - while the state was vaccinating the initial group of 800,000 front-line workers. But Michigan Department of Health and Human Services officials say the priority is getting as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible. Large-scale vaccination centers, which have been swiftly set up across the state, have the capacity to inoculate tens of thousands of people per day. But appointments have been dramatically limited because Michigan doesn't have enough vaccine. Appointments to be vaccinated at health departments and hospitals are filling up as soon as they become available, providers said. Michigan anticipates receiving 62,400 doses the week of Jan. 18, MDHHS spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin, and health providers said that will lead to additional shortages of vaccine beginning next week. Michigan Medicine received 20,000 fewer doses of vaccine than planned this week, and has placed a temporary hold on scheduling first-dose vaccine appointments because it only has enough to fulfill appointments already scheduled, spokeswoman Mary Masson said.“Please be patient, we do not have enough vaccines and it takes time to administer, but we are building quickly and it looks like we’re going to be coming into more vaccines soon,” Whitmer said Wednesday. “This is the greatest tool we have to end this pandemic.”Here's what you need to know:The vaccine will be rolled out in phases, based on availability. The state began vaccinating front-line health care workers in December and on Monday, the state extended eligibility to additional health care workers, those in long-term care facilities, residents 65 and older, and childcare, corrections and K-12 school staff. An estimated 2,576,000 Michigan residents are considered eligible for the vaccine, but the state had just 831,150 doses as of Wednesday, Sutfin said in an email to The News. Sutfin said Michigan expects to receive an allotment of 60,450 doses of Pfizer's vaccine this week. The state is also accelerating distribution with the Michigan National Guard, Sutfin said.""We recognize that there is not enough vaccine for every currently eligible individual with the limited supplies we have,"" Sutfin said. ""There will be some places that run out of vaccine and do not have enough appointments available. This is why we have asked the federal government to give the State of Michigan more vaccines.""Vaccination will take place in different phases that occur simultaneously, the state health department said. Michigan has more than 5,000 facilities participating in the federal program to vaccinate staff and residents in long-term care facilities, which is being administered by CVS and Walgreens pharmacies. Michigan's allotment of Moderna vaccine doses through the end of January are being shipped directly to the companies, which coordinate distribution, vaccination and federal and state reporting. The companies are not accepting appointments at their stores. Meijer's120 pharmacies throughout Michigan are partnering to distribute the vaccine through atext-based registration process through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership Program. Meijer will administer the first doses at a limited number of stores in Wayne County to patients 65 and older beginning the week of Jan. 18. Specific store locations have not yet been determined. Text ""COVID"" to 75049 to receive a link to register. A list of local health departments will be updated daily on thestate's website. County health departments that are scheduling for front-line health care workers in Phase 1A:Available for 1B (seniors, essential front-line workers) appointments or waitlists:is boosting its COVID-19 vaccination call center staffing, expanding the hours of operation and urging those not yet eligible to hold tight after being inundated Monday with more than 120,000 requests for vaccination appointments. The city has converted the TCF Center parking garage into a drive-through vaccine center, by appointment only. Mayor Mike Duggan said Detroit is hoping to provide 20,000 coronavirus vaccinations by early February if the state is able to maintain an adequate supply. If additional doses come through, they hope to increase the number of vaccinations to 30,000, the mayor told reporters Tuesday. Detroit is currently offering vaccinations to residents over age 75 and any ""good neighbor"" driver, 65 or older, who accompanies them to the TCF Center, as well as essential workers including K-12 teachers and childcare workers. All participants must make an appointment in advance. The city also ramped up vaccinations of critical workers including police officers and bus drivers. The city has booked its first 2,000 appointments, already set up through the first part of next week. Detroiters eligible should call (313) 230-0505 to arrange appointments.health department has exhausted its supply of vaccine and is unable to make new appointments before its next shipment of vaccines, officials posted to the county'swebsite. About 300,000 Macomb residents qualify for the vaccine, but the county's allocation for this week was 3,800 doses, County Executive Mark Hackel said Tuesday.""We need to make sure we have the supply before start continuing to open the demand,"" Hackel said. ""If we're going to try to figure out how do we get to the masses, it can't just be with health departments throughout the state.""Health Division asked residents to remain patient Wednesday as the department is seeing an overwhelming demand for the vaccine. The department has received 7,800 doses, administered about 5,600, and scheduled an estimated 17,000-plus first- and second-dose appointments through the end of February, officials said. There are more than 217,000 residents age 65 and older eligible to receive the vaccine in Oakland County. Officials are directing seniors to hospital systems to check for availability. The department's phone lines have received more than 20,000 calls each day and officials say the minimal supply limits their ability to schedule further appointments. To join the waiting list, use the county's Save Your Spot link on its website,oaklandcountyvaccine.com. Residents can also text OAKGOV COVID to 468311 for updates. For anyone unable to complete the form, call the health hotline at 800-848-5533.“We are asking the community to help us plan for administering future doses of vaccine we receive by completing this new form,” County Executive David Coulter said in a press release. “This will help us reach residents and workers who are eligible for vaccination when more doses become available. As we receive more vaccine, we will continue to administer them quickly and efficiently until everyone has the opportunity to receive the vaccine.”Health Department repurposed Eastern Michigan University's Convocation Center as a vaccination center, said Susan Ringler Cerniglia, the department's spokeswoman. The center has eight to 14 vaccination stations operating at a time and can inoculate up to a thousand people a day.""We’re working toward as soon as we have sufficient vaccine to do 5,000 a week,"" she said. As of Wednesday, the Washtenaw County Health Department had administered 2,088 initial doses, and 70 second doses, of the two-dose vaccine. Dr. Mouhanad Hammami,health strategist, said demand for the vaccine is outpacing the state's ability to supply it to regional health departments. The county has an estimated 500,000 people eligible for the vaccine but only received 2,900 doses this week, which will be exhausted by next week, he told county commissionersTuesday. Hospitals and health systems currently have the most reliable supply of vaccines for seniors, Hammami said.""I want to emphasize that anyone 65 and older because this is the contradiction that the state has said, 'Call your health department,' which will do them no good if they call us. In fact, it will put a lot of burden on us because we are going to repeat the same message: You need to go to your health system,"" Hammami told The Detroit News Monday. Residents are encouraged to check their health provider's online medical chart or portal as all local health systems are going to start making appointments for their patients once they vaccinate their medical personnel. Oakland County officials are directing 1B groups to Beaumont Health, St. Joseph Mercy Oakland, Ascension Providence and McLaren Oakland.has tripled its server capacity after its website crashed Friday due to heavy demand for vaccines. The health system will continue working on the system and plans to expand capacity even more, said Hans Keil, Beaumont’s chief information officer. A limited number of appointments became available Monday to patients by a randomized computer lottery. Senior patients receive an email inviting them to schedule their vaccination through their myBeaumontChart account. When Beaumont receives confirmation about how many doses will arrive next week, the health system will send additional email invitations to eligible patients to schedule appointments.""We are in regular communication with state and local officials and talking with them about increasing our allocations of the vaccine because we have the capacity to do so much more,"" Beaumont Health CEO John Fox said in a press release. ""Next week, we hope to launch two additional clinics and should have the capacity to do more than 50,000 vaccinations a week. Again, this all depends upon how much vaccine we receive.""Beaumont is also preparing to launch a call center to assist with answering questions and scheduling appointments. However, right now, the only way to schedule an appointment is online through myBeaumontChart.is prioritizing existing patients who are 65 and older, patients who have certain high-risk conditions or meet the broader eligibility requirements announced last week. Once adequate vaccine supply becomes available, Henry Ford will open as many as eight appointment-only vaccination sites throughout southeast Michigan with the combined capacity to vaccinate between 4,000 and 5,000 people per day, officials announced Wednesday. Nearly 32,000 patients, or 94%, of those who responded to a Henry Ford survey, said they wanted to receive the vaccine. The hospital system is contacting patients who meet eligibility requirements through MyChart, text messaging and phone calls. The hospital has more than 800 appointments scheduled this week for the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, officials said Wednesday. About 70% of Henry Ford's staff of more than 33,000 team members have received at least the first dose of the vaccine. Approximately 22% of employees declined vaccination, but are eligible to change their mind and sign up to be vaccinated. The health system anticipates all team members who want to be vaccinated will receive the first dose by the first week of February.was prepared to complete its Phase 1A and roll out to Phase 1B on Monday, but only has enough to complete first-dose appointments already scheduled as well as administer second doses, Masson said Wednesday.""We ordered 24,000 doses for this week. We received about 4,000 doses, which will be used for second doses scheduled for this week,"" she said in an email to The News. Michigan Medicine is administering more than 90% of its vaccine supply each week.""Michigan Medicine is ready and staffed to perform as many as 12,000 vaccinations per week, with rapid expansion capability to 24,000 vaccinations per week and additional locations prepared to open when vaccine supply is available,"" Masson said. ""We are eager to move into Phase 1B, which includes our patients who are age 65 and older and frontline essential workers, and we are actively working with state officials to partner on solutions.""The 14-hospitalsystem in West Michigan opened a vaccination center in Grand Rapids on Monday and scheduled 1,800 patients for its first day. As of Tuesday, it has vaccinated 23,782 people and has no further supplies of vaccines.""We will pause scheduling until we receive another shipment,"" Spectrum posted on its website.

275,History Shows Americans Have Always Been Wary of Vaccines,0.0,43.33,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/history-shows-americans-have-always-been-wary-vaccines-180976828/,https://adfontesmedia.com/smithsonian-magazine-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-26,15,"Even so, many diseases have been tamed. Will Covid-19 be next?As long as vaccines have existed, humans have been suspicious of both the shots and those who administer them. The first inoculation deployed in America, against smallpox in the 1720s, was decried as antithetical to God’s will. An outraged citizentosseda bomb through the window of a house where pro-vaccination Boston minister Cotton Mather lived to dissuade him from his mission. It did not stop Mather’s campaign. After British physicianEdward Jennerdeveloped a more effective smallpox vaccine in the late 1700s—using a related cowpox virus as the inoculant—fear of the unknown continued despite its success in preventing transmission. An 1802 cartoon, entitled,depictsa startled crowd of vaccinees who have seemingly morphed into a cow-human chimera, with the front ends of cattle leaping out of their mouths, eyes, ears and behinds. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, says the outlandish fiction of the cartoon continues to reverberate with false claims that vaccines cause autism, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, or that the messenger RNA-based Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna lead to infertility.“People are just frightened whenever you inject them with a biological, so their imaginations run wild,” Offit recently told attendees of“Racing for Vaccines,”a webinar organized by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.“The birth of the first anti-vaccine movement was with the first vaccine,” says Offit. People don’t want to be compelled to take a vaccine, so “they create these images, many of which obviously are based on false notions.”“There’s a history of the question of how you balance individual liberty—the right to refuse—versus the policing of the public health,” agreesKeith Wailoo, a medical historian at Princeton University and another panelist at the event. Because vaccines are given to otherwise healthy people that always brings an element of fear into the picture, saysDiane Wendt, a curator in the museum’s division of medicine and science. Wendt and her colleagues have been holding webinars under the moniker “Pandemic Perspectives.” The online panel discussions provide a vehicle to show off some of the museum’s images and artifacts while the building remains closed in Washington, D. C., during the Covid-19 pandemic. Experts provide context to the various topics, saysArthur Daemmrich, director of the museum’sLemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. “Racing for Vaccines” highlighted centuries of scientific progress and technological innovation, which has persisted even in the face of vaccine hesitancy. Of all the diseases for which humans have developed vaccines, only smallpox has been almost fully vanquished on Earth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says14 other diseasesthat used to be prevalent in the U. S. have been quashed by vaccination. After smallpox, vaccine efforts around the globe focused on diseases that were decimating livestock—the lifeblood of many economies. The French scientist and physicianLouis Pasteurhad by the late 1870s come up with a method to vaccinate chickens against cholera. He then moved on to help develop an anthrax vaccine for sheep, goats and cows in 1881. A few years later, Pasteur had come up with the first vaccine to protect humans against rabies, which by 1920 required one shot a day for 21 days. Early vaccines relied on developing science. When the influenza pandemic of 1918 crashed down on the world, no one had the ability to visualize viruses. Bacteria cultured from victims’ lungs was erroneously thought by leading scientists to be the cause of the illness, saysJohn Grabenstein, the founder of Vaccine Dynamics and a previous director of U. S. Department of Defense Military Vaccine Agency. Researchers created flu vaccines that failed because they targeted bacteria, not the true viral cause. The viruses weren’tisolateduntil the 1930s and the first inactivated flu virus for widespread use was not approved until 1945. By contrast, the Covid-19 vaccine went from genetic sequence to near-complete clinical trials, full scale production and delivery to Americans within eight or nine months. The technology has come a long way. Early smallpox inoculation required scraping out material from a pustule or a scab of someone who had been vaccinated and then scratching it into someone else’s arm, using a hollowed-out needle or something like the spring-loaded vaccinator device from the 1850s that can be found in the museum’s collections. A bifurcated needle that delivers a tiny amount of vaccine subcutaneously is still used today. In the 1890s, the development of an antitoxin to treat diphtheria gave rise to the pharmaceutical industry and to a regulatory infrastructure to help ensure the safety of drugs. Diphtheria led to sickness and death when toxins emitted by thebacteria coated the lungs and throat, giving rise to its common name, the “strangling angel.” Between 100,000 to 200,000 American children contracted the illness each year, and 15,000 died. The New York City Health Department was aleaderin diphtheria antitoxin production in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Scientists gave horses ever-increasing doses of toxins; the animals in turn produced antitoxins, which wereharvestedby bleeding the horses. The horse serum was purified and then administered to children. It helped prevent disease progression and conferred some short-term immunity, says Wendt.“The impact of this particular product, the antitoxin, in the 1890s was huge,” she says. Several drug companies—including H. K. Mulford Co., which also manufactured a smallpox vaccine, and Lederle, founded in 1906 by a former New York health commissioner who had been active in the agency’s diphtheria efforts—commercializedthe antitoxin. But tragedy struck. The St. Louis health departmentallowedcontaminated antitoxin serum from one of its horses—who had died of tetanus—to be distributed. Twenty-two children died. That led to the Biologics Control Act of 1902, which set the stage for federal regulation of vaccines with the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration. However, as seen through history, “getting vaccines to their destination is a continuing challenge,” says Wailoo. In 1925, Nome, Alaska, experienced a diphtheria outbreak. The town was snowbound. Twenty mushers and 150 sled dogs, including the famous lead dog Balto, relayed antitoxin across the state to Nome, helping to end the epidemic.“We don’t have dog sleds to deal with today,” says Grabenstein, but theultra-cold temperaturesof -70 degrees Celsius/-94 degrees Fahrenheit required for transport and storage of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is a high hurdle. Before Covid-19, the largest nationwide emergency effort to eradicate a disease came in the 1950s, when the polio virus reached apeakof almost 60,000 cases, fomenting anxiety across America. Children experienced paralysis, disability and death. Jonas Salk—who helped develop the influenza vaccine—created a new, equally important vaccine for polio. It was tested in one of the largest-ever trials, involving 1.8 million children, who were known as the Polio Pioneers, says Offit. When Salk announced on April 12, 1955, that it was “safe, potent and effective,” the vaccine was approved within hours and rolled out immediately, Offit says. “This was Warp Speed One,” he says, playing off the Operation Warp Speed program that aided development of the Covid-19 vaccines. Ultimately, for vaccines to work, they have to be administered. Public health officials in 1970 encouraged rubella vaccination for children with posters that stated that “Today’s little people protect tomorrow’s little people.” That’s because pregnant women who contract rubella are at risk for miscarriage or stillbirth. “This speaks to communal responsibility,” says Wendt, noting that many campaigns have aimed to motivate Americans to accept vaccines to protect not just themselves, but society at large. In the past, some pharmaceutical companies—such as Mulford—have produced stickers and buttons that allow the wearer to declare they’ve been vaccinated. The CDC has createdstickersthat lets Covid-19 recipients tell the world they got their shot. But many Americans—especially people of color—are still skeptical.“The African American community, for good reason, unfortunately, has seen a legacy of disparate care, of lack of care, including several high-profile incidents like Tuskegee and others where they feel the medical system abandoned them,” says Daemmrich. In theTuskegee experiment, government researchers studied black men with syphilis and told them they were being treated, but they were not receiving any therapies. The men were never offered proper treatment, either.“There’s a lot of distrust,” Daemmrich says, adding, “it’s not entirely clear how you overcome that distrust,” but that, “just showing up now in the midst of the pandemic and saying ok trust us now isn’t the way to do it.”The Kaiser Family Foundationhas been trackinghesitancy around the Covid-19 vaccine. In December, before the two vaccines had been distributed, 35 percent of black adults said they would definitely or probably not get vaccinated, compared to 27 percent of the public overall. About half of those black adults said they didn’t trust vaccines in general or that worried they would get Covid-19 from the vaccine. By January this year, Kaiserfoundthat while about 60 percent of black respondents said they thought vaccines were being distributed fairly, half said they were not confident that the efforts were taking the needs of black people into account. Early data on the vaccine rollout confirms some of those fears. Kaiserfoundthat in more than a dozen states, vaccinations in black Americans were far lower than for white Americans and not proportionate to black people’s share of case counts and deaths. And, few people alive now have seen anything comparable in terms of the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic, says Wailoo. “Maybe the scale of this is enough of an incentive,” he says. Offit isn’t as certain. “We saw polio as a shared national tragedy—it pulled us all together,” he says. “It’s harder to watch what goes on today, where it feels like we’re not getting together, rather just more finger-pointing.”Get the latest on what's happeningin your inbox.",3,Reliable,0.0618777678260436,0.4030451684330992,2409,3,Smithsonian Magazine
276,California wildfire advances as heat wave blankets US West,-1.0,47.0,https://apnews.com/article/fires-environment-and-nature-california-nevada-wildfires-7c8c4733b283251d28ab1bf89533e0ea,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-11,25,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Firefighters struggled to contain an exploding Northern California wildfire under blazing temperatures as another heat wave blanketed the West, prompting an excessive heat warning for inland and desert areas. Death Valley in southeastern California’s Mojave Desert reached 128 degrees Fahrenheit (53 Celsius) on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service’s reading at Furnace Creek. The shockingly high temperature was actually lower than the previous day, when the location reached 130 F (54 C). If confirmed as accurate, the 130-degree reading would be the hottest high recorded there since July 1913, when Furnace Creek desert hit 1,34 F (57 C), considered the highest measured temperature on Earth. About 300 miles (483 kilometers) northwest of the sizzling desert, the largest wildfire of the year in California was raging along the border with Nevada. The Beckwourth Complex Fire — a combination of two lightning-caused fires burning 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Lake Tahoe — showed no sign of slowing its rush northeast from the Sierra Nevada forest region after doubling in size between Friday and Saturday. Late Saturday, flames jumped Interstate 395 and was threatening properties in Nevada’s Washoe County. “Take immediate steps to protect large animals and livestock,” the The Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District tweeted. The blaze, which was only 8% contained, increased dramatically to 86 square miles (222 square kilometers) as firefighters sweltered in 100-degree temperatures. It was one of several threatening homes across Western states that were expected to see triple-digit heat through the weekend as a high-pressure zone blankets the region. Pushed by strong winds, a wildfire in southern Oregon doubled in size to 120 square miles (311 square kilometers) Saturday as it raced through heavy timber in the Fremont-Winema National Forest near the Klamath County town of Sprague River. The National Weather Service warned the dangerous conditions could cause heat-related illnesses, while California’s power grid operator issued a statewide Flex Alert from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday to avoid disruptions and rolling blackouts. The California Independent System Operator warned of potential power shortage, not only because of mounting heat, but because a wildfire in southern Oregon was threatening transmission lines that carry imported power to California. Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an emergency proclamation on Friday suspending rules to allow for more power capacity, and the ISO requested emergency assistance from other states. On Saturday, Newsom issued another proclamation allowing the emergency use of auxiliary ship engines to relieve pressure on the electric grid. Palm Springs in Southern California hit a record high temperature of 120 F (49 C) Saturday. It was the fourth time temperatures have reached 120 degrees so far this year,the Desert Sun reported. In California’s agricultural Central Valley, 100-degree temperatures blanketed the region, with Fresno reaching 111 degrees F (44 C), just one degree short of the all-time high for the date,Las Vegas late Saturday afternoon tied the all-time record high of 117 F (47 C), the National Weather Service said. The city has recorded that record-high temperature four other times, most recently in June 2017. NV Energy, Nevada’s largest power provider, also urged customers to conserve electricity Saturday and Sunday evenings because of the heat wave and wildfires affecting transmission lines throughout the region. In Southern California, a brush fire sparked by a burning big rig in eastern San Diego County forced evacuations of two Native American reservations Saturday. In north-central Arizona, Yavapai County on Saturday lifted an evacuation warning for Black Canyon City, an unincorporated town 43 miles (66 kilometers) north of Phoenix, after a fire in nearby mountains no longer posed a threat. In Mohave County, Arizona, two firefighters died Saturday after a aircraft they were in to respond to a small wildfire crashed, local media reported. A wildfire in southeast Washington grew to almost 60 square miles (155 square kilometers) as it blackened grass and timber while it moved into the Umatilla National Forest. In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little declared a wildfire emergency Friday and mobilized the state’s National Guard to help fight fires sparked after lightning storms swept across the drought-stricken region.

277,11. I never imagined how the world would change.,-10.67,39.33,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/911-anniversary-world-trade-center.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-07,25,"On Sept. 11, 2001, I was in my seventh year as the Boston Globe’s New York bureau chief, spending much of my time writing fun features and profiles, a welcome respite after three years as the paper’s Moscow correspondent and, before that, a decade as its military affairs reporter. Those seven years were my own variation on the“holiday from history”that much of the nation was enjoying. At 8:50 a.m., my editor phoned, telling me that an airplane had crashed into one of the twin towers. I got dressed and turned on the TV in time to watch the second plane hit the other tower. This was no sightseeing pilot’s accident—my initial assumption—but a plot, an attack. I dashed to the subway. On the ride from Brooklyn into Manhattan, I could see black smoke billowing from the buildings, streaking the clear blue sky like an oil spill. It looked like a Hollywood special effect. I arrived at the World Trade Center station, one of the last people to cross its turnstiles for many months to come, and ran up the steps. A large crowd had gathered to watch the towers burning. I found myself standing next to a reporter friend, and we wondered how long it would be before anyone would go back into those buildings. Then, at 10 a.m., came the rumbling, which sounded and felt like an earthquake. The first tower began to collapse, and everyone ran, including me. Odd calculations raced through my mind: The tower was a little more than a quarter-mile high. I was a little less than a quarter-mile away. Should I run straight and hope to outrace the building’s fall, or should I dart down some side street to dodge its trajectory? It didn’t matter. I glanced back to see the tower crumble where it stood, like a sandcastle in the tide. Everyone was in a state of horror. I talked with several people walking away from the disaster, some coated with ash. One man, a Xerox executive who worked a block from the towers, told me he’d seen “pieces of fuselage and body parts falling from the sky” and “strewn all over the street.” This was the first moment I realized that the weapons in the sky hadn’t been small prop engine planes, perhaps rented by saboteurs; they were passenger jetliners, hijacked by terrorists. The subways were closed down. Cellular networks were mangled. I walked uptown toward the apartment of my Globe colleague Elizabeth Neuffer (a tenacious reporter who would die two years later in Iraq). The streets were empty and quiet, except for the sound of news broadcasts blaring from car radios and bars. At each one, and there were several on every block, dozens of people gathered around to hear the latest. Rumors were rife that planes had also attacked the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Capitol. (One of those reports was true.)Over the next few days, the city was transformed. Popular depictions of New Yorkers as rude and rowdy had always been exaggerated, but the civility, courtesy, and mindfulness that washed over nearly everyone was astonishing. I have a vivid memory of walking across Third Avenue at East 33rdStreet three days after the attack. A man in front of me sneezed. A cop, who was guiding traffic at the intersection, looked him in the eye and said, “Bless you.” The pedestrian looked the cop in the eye and replied, “Thank you.”That afternoon, a friend in Tribeca approached a police officer on the sidewalk and asked, “How are you?” (Many were asking strangers this question with genuine concern.) The officer broke down in tears. To be a New Yorker in those days was to be stamped—proudly—with a special identity. One lunch hour, I wandered around Bryant Park, the small midtown cloister near the public library, to ask people if they were thinking about leaving the city. They all insisted that they were not. One young man with a Bronx accent replied, “What am I gonna do—move to Lincoln, Nebraska? That’s what the terroristsme to do.”All over the city, mimeographed sheets were taped or stapled on every available surface, especially subway station walls—photographs of the missing, with their names, their descriptions, and phone numbers to call if anyone saw them. People gathered to look at the photos, study them, read them carefully, as if they were memorizing their details. It was clear by this time that none of the missing would be found, not alive anyway. Yet people kept looking, out of respect—for the dead and for their loved ones who had posted the photos. The act was observed as a social obligation, a civic ritual: a moment of immersion into shared grief, a way to feel and affirm a sense of community and humanity that the attack had sundered but that its aftermath had strangely strengthened. For a while, anyway. It gradually became clear that the fresh breeze of unity—the notion that 9/11 brought us all together—did not extend to everyone. Two months after 9/11, an airplane crashed in Far Rockaway, a beachside community in Queens. Everyone feared—or just assumed—that it was another terrorist attack. (It turned out to be “just” an airplane crash, the product of wake turbulence and pilot error as a passenger plane pulled up and away out of the nearby JFK International Airport.) I took the long subway ride to the crash site to interview authorities and witnesses. A Globe colleague who happened to be in New York rode with me. The reporter was of South Asian descent. Not long after we divvied up the territory, he approached me to say he was very uncomfortable with the way people were looking at him—as if he were a terrorist, as if he’d had something to do with the plane crash. He feared for his safety. (We agreed he should leave.)Sometime before 9/11, I’d written a story about the soaring number of Pakistani immigrants in New York. They’d leased or bought wide swaths of business properties along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn; the area’s councilman, also Pakistani, was emerging as a real political force. After 9/11, many of the neighborhood’s residents left town; many of the businesses shuttered; the politician, a charismatic community leader, lowered his profile. President George W. Bush and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to their credit, urged people not to take out their anger on American Muslims. But as more was learned about the attackers, and as we wreaked revenge on the attack’s planners, the feelings—and a broad emerging hawkishness—were hard to control.“September 11 warped American culture,”Edward Luce, a Financial Times columnist, wrote in a recent reminiscence. “I had lived in the US until a few weeks before the attacks and returned five years later to a more paranoid, xenophobic and martial society.”Spencer Ackerman, in hisnew book,,argues that“the 9/11 era destabilized America and produced Trump” (as the book’s subtitle puts it). Donald Trump was hardly the first president to exploit the xenophobic streak in American culture, and 9/11 did not mark the first time a foreign attack sparked rampant fear of foreigners in the United States. (See, for instance, the Japanese internment camps during World War II.) But the spark this time was different; the threat was both more amorphous (a handful of hijackers with box knives) and more real (not even imperial Japan had attacked an American city)—and, as a result, more unnerving. The next attack could come anytime, anywhere, without notice; and the attacker wouldn’t be an army, navy, or air force; it might be that strange-looking man carrying a suspicious-looking object while walking down the street. In that sense, al-Qaida turned America into a more skittish country; if the goal of terror is to terrorize, the 9/11 attacks were a success. Within a few months, of course, U. S. forces fought back, toppling the Taliban, decimating al-Qaida’s ranks, and eventually killing bin Laden himself. But as recent events have shown, this triumph too was short-lived. In the 20-year interim, the nation—some of its leaders, nearly all of its legislators, and a majority of its citizens—took on an overly blunt view of “national security,” seeing myriad terrorist groups as a monolithic threat, when they weren’t monolithic (a shrewder strategy would have been to play some off the others) and most weren’t threats, not to our security anyway. The 9/11 attacks provided the legal basis and the political selling point for several military adventures—not least the invasion of Iraq, the most serious foreign blunder in U. S. history. They also distracted everyone’s attention from other looming threats—strategic, political, economic, and especially ecological—that may in the end do us more profound harm than that which was wrought by the terrorists on two airplanes. In one sense, 9/11 may have been less pivotal geopolitically than 11/9—i.e., Nov. 9, 1989, the date when the Berlin Wall fell, which led to the unraveling of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The Cold War was a horrific era, but it was also a system of international security, and its end spawned not only the spread of democracy (in places, for a while) but also the dispersion of power, the crumbling of political blocs, the weakening of central authority in already-weak states, and the loosening of historically dubious borders. If the two superpowers had held a grip on their respective spheres of the world for another decade, it is likely that one of them, or both, would have crushed or at least contained an outfit like al-Qaida before it swelled in strength and ambition. But 9/11 did mark a shift in ourabout the world—about the likelihood, and randomness, of peril that it poses. The nature of this shift—and the degree of anxiety about the randomness—have been shaped and modulated by other political currents coursing through these long two decades. Even in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, at a time when America’s politics could still funnel disputes in relative calm and good order, the common new threat in our midst served as a unifying force only up to a point. Now that the elasticity of our politics has snapped, as myriad chasms—of race, party, class, and geography—seem increasingly unbridgeable, threats from outside (real or exaggerated) have intensified our disagreements, made consensus on even basic understandings harder to form. Twenty years ago, citizens all over the country embraced New York in its hour of need and hung flags in a display of national unity. Would so many citizens do so today? Many among us have turned a pandemic—the classic case of a common threat from a faceless enemy—into apartisan battlefield. They’d likely respond in the same way to another terrorist attack. Trumpism may have deepened this erosion of civil society. Yet the rise of Trumpism is, in part, a product of the 9/11 era. As Edward Luce put it in his FT reminiscence, “It is hard to imagine Donald Trump without Iraq, nor Iraq without September 11.” The compounding effects of these events and phenomena—the increasingly grating dissonances that they’ve etched on our collective consciousness—may be the most deeply consequential legacy of that day 20 yearsago.",2,Generally Reliable,0.054498454512659,0.3726020964515282,2509,2,Slate
278,It’s Fight Night on Capitol Hill,-2.0,43.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/infrastructure-biden-agenda-fight-night-on-capitol-hill.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-10-01,25,"The conventional wisdom about House Democrats has long been that the left would fold in a fight with moderates over the size of social programs, making concessions to get half a loaf instead of nothing, as they have before. That’s not the case anymore. In the fight over Joe Biden’s agenda on Capitol Hill, the progressive caucus has stood their ground, with roughly four dozen members who are ready to vote down the moderates’ prizedinfrastructure billuntil abroader reconciliation billpasses. On Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders punted the infrastructure over the progressive holdouts. In particular, they do not trust Senate moderatesJoe ManchinandKyrsten Sinemato support a reconciliation bill and its $3.5 trillion price tag and see the bipartisan bill, which both support, as leverage. Leadership just made it official: no votes tonight. Have a good one, everybodypic.twitter.com/GE1LM5qtELThe House stayed in session late Thursday night as frantic negotiations were underway to find a formula that would allow Manchin and Sinema to support the reconciliation bill and thus free progressives to vote for the infrastructure legislation by Pelosi’s deadline of that same night. Negotiations continued Friday, with White House staff joining in, with the hopes of a deal being cut before the week is out. The left’s distrust of Manchin and Sinema had been fueled by the duo playing coy about what provisions, if any, they wanted to see in a reconciliation bill. On Manchin, at least, progressives have made some incremental progress. He made his preconditions for a reconciliation bill public on Thursday, saying he wanted $1.5 trillion in spending. Sinema has not made her demands public, although a spokesman for her said in a statement that she “continues to engage directly in good-faith discussions” with Biden and Schumer to “find common ground.”In recent days, members of the media have swarmedPramila Jayapal, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, with the same intensity once reserved for a key moderate like Manchin. “Love it or hate it, Jayapal is the first Progressive Caucus chair to make the position relevant in shaping the debate in years,” one veteran Democratic aide observed with admiration. Their increased clout is a shift from the Obama years, which conditioned Democrats to expect the left to crumble under Biden during debates over Obamacare and the 2009 stimulus. “Some of our progressive values have become quite mainstream,” said Jared Huffman, a five-term Democrat from California. “I also think that sometimes in the past, our progressive community/caucus might have been treated as, or assumed to be, adversaries and outsiders and not had a seat at the table. And I think we’ve been treated as allies by the administration and by everyone else.”Progressives are also buoyed by the sense of fatalism in so many Democrats about their party’s chances in midterm elections and see the reconciliation bill they want as a rare chance to pass transformative social legislation before Republicans return to power.“For 40 years before Joe Biden took office, I think Democrats controlled the presidency, the House, and the Senate for four total years, two with Clinton and two with Obama,” explained Andy Levin of Michigan on Wednesday. “And, despite those four little years — and even during them — the working people of the country have gotten the short end of the stick, so that they don’t even believe in government. They are like, ‘What is government doing for me?’ This, the Build Back Better Act, does so much more for the people.”The situation in the Democratic caucus bears a resemblance to the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which notoriously tried to drag every key bill to the right and fueled government shutdowns and debt-limit standoffs in the process, against the wishes of Republican leadership. “The knock on the Freedom Caucus is they know how to start a fight but not how to end one,”Matt Gaetzof Florida, a member of that group, told Intelligencer. “The current energy from progressives seems to suggest that they will end it, they will bring down the infrastructure bill if it doesn’t pave the way to their spending ambitions.”The lessons from the right go both ways, according to Gaetz. “The progressives trying to get their way now have observed the flaws that the Freedom Caucus used to try to get their way on health care,” he said. “The Freedom Caucus fundamentally ended up empowering McCain in the end to kill [Obamacare repeal] and I don’t think progressives want to do that with Manchin and Sinema.”",3,Reliable,0.0466658040027605,0.3908083160800551,1001,3,New York Magazine
279,What Economists Fear Most During This Recovery,0.33,42.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-economists-fear-most-during-this-recovery/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-23,25,"Graphics byAnna WiederkehrAs states push forward in their phased reopenings, we’re getting clues that the beleaguered U. S economy might be on its way to recovery. Retail sales spiked by 17.7 percent in May, and the unemployment rateunexpectedly dropped in that monthas well — suggesting that Americans were returning to work and opening their wallets earlier than many expected. But experts still think that even if things are starting to look up now, we shouldn’t assume we’ll be back to normal anytime soon. In fact, economists think there are still significant economic risks despite the tentative rebound, including a second wave of COVID-19, an unwillingness to spend from consumers and an absence of an additional fiscal stimulus from Congress. In partnership with theInitiative on Global Marketsat the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, FiveThirtyEight asked 34 quantitative macroeconomic economists what they thought about a variety of subjects around the coronavirus recession and recovery efforts. The most recent survey, which was conducted from June 19 through 22, echoed many of the predictionsfrom the last round— though there were also a few new wrinkles in their forecasts. When wefirst askedabout the shape of the recovery, 58 percent of respondents thought the trajectory of future U. S. gross domestic product lookedlike a Nike “swoosh”— a sharp downturn followed by a long, slow recovery. This time around, however, a consensus has formed around a slightly different shape: a reverse radical (i.e., a mirrored version of thesquare-root symbol). This shape — which 73 percent of our economists predicted for the country’s economic future — implies a steep drop followed by a quick partial recovery and a longer period of slower, mixed growth. But it isn’t necessarily an improvement over the swoosh. “There is nothing standard or smooth about this recovery,” said Lisa Cook, professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University. In her view, a reverse-radical-shaped recovery could be shaped by a spike in infections and hospitalizations, a wave of bankruptcies as unemployment benefits expire or consumers’ unwillingness to return to gyms, nail salons or other parts of their routine. That could make the bounce back from this recession bumpier than previous recessions. Twelve of the 17 economists who had predicted a swoosh in our survey in late May changed to the reverse radical this time, leaving just five respondents sticking with the swoosh in this round of the survey. (And no economist switchedtothe swoosh, another sign that other patterns fit the trajectory of this economic recovery better.)“By now, the partial reopening of the economy, along with the new unemployment and retail sales numbers, suggest a substantial bounce-back effect for the economy,” said Allan Timmermann, professor of finance and economics at the University of California, San Diego, who has been consulting with us on the design of the survey. “However, our panel is not convinced that this recovery will last, since they did not opt for the V-shaped recovery — in fact, it is interesting that not a single person opted for the V-shape.”Overall, the surveyed group didn’t meaningfully budge on its projections for either GDP or unemployment from the last time we asked. Nor did it change its long-term timeline for when GDP might return to its pre-coronavirus benchmark. Maybe it’s encouraging that the projections haven’t gottenworse— but the panelists still think it’s unlikely (33 percent probability) that GDP will creep back up to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 any time before the first half of 2022. Consensus forecasts for when U. S. gross domestic product will return to its pre-coronavirus level, in each round of the surveyProbabilities are based on the average of the 28 economists who answered this question in all three surveys. Source: FIVETHIRTYEIGHT/IGM COVID-19 ECONOMIC outlook SURVEYIn a new question this round, we asked respondents what factors might bring about their worst-case predictions for fourth-quarter GDP growth. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the average participant gave the most weight to the possibility of a second wave of coronavirus later in the year. But their next-most-significant fears were economic in nature: whether consumers would be unwilling to spend even after businesses open and whether Congress would choose not to pass further economic stimulus packages:How much weight economists gave various scenarios when setting the lower bound of their GDP predictions for the fourth quarter of 2020Weights are an average of responses in a survey of 34 economists conducted June 19-22. Source: FIVETHIRTYEIGHT/IGM COVID-19 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SURVEYWe also cannot understate theweirdness of these economic times. This led to a few other noteworthy results in our survey, starting with very high projections for thepersonal saving rate, which ballooned to a record 33 percent in April. (In that metric, saving is expressed as a share of disposable personal income.) Our group of economists doesn’t think it will stay quite that high going forward, but the respondents did predict a mean saving rate of 20.2 percent in Junereceived their stimulus checksby early June. Gloria Gonzalez-Rivera, a professor of economics at the University of California, Riverside, told us that she didn’t think the June saving rate would match April’s simply because Americans had fewer opportunities to spend their money at the height of the state-level lockdowns. But she added that she still expected consumers to be “conservative” in June.“A high savings rate is a sign that consumer confidence is low and spending is going to be low,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who, along with Timmermann, has been guiding the design of the survey. “My spending is someone else’s income. So when people start to save a lot, that really slows down the recovery.”The unusual nature of this recession also showed up in our respondents’ prediction for which investments might deliver the highest return over the rest of the year. As wewrote about last week, the stock market has been busy regaining most of its initial coronavirus-related losses since late March, even as the rest of the economy sits in a very tenuous place. Our panel generally thinks that disconnect between the stock market and the broader economy will continue. When given the choice among three investments, the panelists thought there was a 45 percent chance that NASDAQ — with its heavy emphasis on tech stocks — would perform best, followed by the S&P 500 at 34 percent. The economists thought there was just a 21 percent chance that 10-year U. S Treasury bonds, traditionally a safe haven in an environment of uncertainty and low corporate earnings, would provide the highest rate of return by the end of 2020. Overall, the economists in our survey think the economy has a long way to go before it returns to normal. Much of its path from here will hinge on the state of the virus itself, with additional emphasis on the government’s response. But the panel also sees many of the stranger features of this particular recession continuing to some degree — from the stock market’s disconnect with the rest of the economy to the extraordinary levels of personal savings by Americans. And of course, the error bars around the forecasts remain wide — as befits one of the most unpredictable economic moments in recent history.",3,Reliable,0.0679537006203672,0.3274369272702605,1610,3,FiveThirtyEight

Announced by Biden on Friday, the decision to reimpose a ban on the detention of pregnant women and girls was initially outlined in a memo signed last week by acting ICE Director Tae Johnson. Boasting of the new policy, Johnson said the border agency is“committed to safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system and preserving the health and safety of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals.”He added that“given the unique needs of this population,”ICE won’t lock up anyone currently or recently pregnant“unless release is prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist,”but did not elaborate on what might warrant such exceptions. The measure does not rule out arresting pregnant, postpartum or nursing women, the ICE memo stresses, but does require that if theyareto be housed in US detention facilities, they must receive mental health services and other appropriate care. The agency is also still permitted to send expecting women to immigration courts. ICE went out of its way to avoid specifying the gender of any hypothetical prisoner in its memo, a deliberate move intended to include transgender males among the group of pregnancy-capable individuals to whom the policy applies,accordingto a senior administration official who spoke to USA Today on Friday. The decision is not so much new as it is a reversal of a 2017 policy enacted by former president Donald Trump, who placed the fight against illegal immigration at the center of his successful 2016 election campaign. Under Trump’s predecessor and Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, ICE had a stated policy of only detaining pregnant immigrants“under extraordinary circumstances.”During Trump’s first two years in the White House, pregnant immigrants were detained 80% more frequently than during the last year of Obama’s presidency, according to a Government Accountability Report released last year. Biden’s version of the policy does expand the period in which illegal migrants can claim exemption from ICE detention, however. While Obama’s policy restricted itself to pregnant women only, Biden’s shield includes those who gave birth up to one year ago, as well as nursing women.",3,Reliable,0.1294430794430794,0.4356060606060606,485,1,RT

The results can be remarkably detailed, and a good reminder of just how diverse federal spending can be. In the current report, areas under review include everything from the management of “cell-cultured meat” production by the Food and Drug Administration and U. S. Department of Agriculture to potential savings in Medicaid claims processing and information retrieval systems. The GAO says its reports have been quite effective, with its recommendations producing $429 billion in benefits from 2011 to 2019. Speaking to a Senate committee earlier this month, Gene L. Dodaro, the government’s comptroller general, highlighted the savings that are available. “This year, we have over 112 new recommendations for consideration by the Congress and the executive branch,” Dodaro said. “The first has to do with leveraging the government’s enormous potential purchasing power by pulling together to purchase common items, medical supplies, office supplies, etcetera. There’s been some progress in this area, but there can be much, much more that result in significant savings.”Read the full GAO report hereand ananalysis by The Washington Post’s Joe Davidson here.",3,Reliable,0.209280303030303,0.5545454545454547,449,3,Fiscal Times

On Thursday, he refused to dismiss the two songwriters' claim that Taylor Swift used their lyrics from a 2001 song for her smash hit ""Shake It Off,"" court records show. That claim has been ongoing since 2017. In the suit, songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler alleged that Swift lifted lyrics from the 2001 3LW recording ""Playas Gon' Play,"" which includes the phrase: ""Playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate.""The lyrics in Swift's song, by comparison, read: ""Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.""U. S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald dismissed the claim in 2018, finding that the disputed lyrics lacked sufficient originality to merit copyright protection. However, an appeals court overturned the Los Angeles federal judge's decision the following year. In a Wednesday ruling, Fitzgerald refused to toss the case out of court. The judge wrote that Hall and Butler ""have sufficiently alleged a protectable selection and arrangement or a sequence of creative expression,"" and Swift's ""use as alleged is similar enough"" to survive the motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs seek a share of the profits from Swift's hit. According to the lawsuit, over 9 million copies of the song sold as of the filing date and 6 million copies of Swift's album ""1989,"" and the video for the song had nearly 2.4 billion views on YouTube. Swift's representatives reacted when the suit was filed, saying it ""a ridiculous claim and nothing more than a money grab. The law is simple and clear.

Unfortunately, unlike the silly show’stheme songsays, it was the opposite of a miracle—it’s a curse. The curse of white supremacy!It all started this weekend when Twitter user@HereIsMySpoutposted a thread with the leading sentence, “Ellie Kemper the actress who played Erin Hannon onand starred inUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidthas been outed as a KKK Princess.”Oop! Not Ellie KKKemper! Tell us more!Well, apparently the rabbit hole was opened when it became apparent that there are basically “Klan Balls” in Kemper’s native St. Louis, Mo. They’re called Veiled Prophet Balls, and they were historically exclusive to elite white folks. According to Newsweek, African Americans were eventually allowed to join in 1979 after protest...but...why would we want to???Here’s more information about the balls—which were part of a larger celebration in St. Louis—via The Atlantic’s Scott Beauchamp:Held annually every Fourth of July, usually in downtown St. Louis, Fair St. Louis is a festival that includes food, music, hot-air balloons, and fireworks. Touted as “America’s Biggest Birthday Party”, it’s basically just a fun excuse to enjoy the usually hot and humid St. Louis Fourth of Julys with friends and family. This summer, due to construction along the Mississippi riverfront, the fair was held in Forest Park, a jewel of a turn-of-the-century public park built for the 1904 World’s Fair. Attaching Fair St. Louis to these monuments of St. Louis’ former grandeur, the Gateway Arch and Forest Park, is fun and completely in the spirit of civic celebration, but also overshadows the dark and sordid history of the fair itself. Until the early ’90s I knew Fair Saint Louis by its older name, the VP Fair. VP stands for “Veiled Prophet”, and the name of the fair wasn’t officially changed to Fair Saint Louis until 1992. Another Twitter user@hannastasiaeven posteda newspaper clippingwith Kemper’s smiling face (the same unassuming white girl smile she flashes on the show!) next to the headline, “Freshman, 19, at Princeton U. is new Veiled Prophet Queen.”Naturally, the most apt response to all of this mess is encapsulated inthis gif. Also,this gif. Yes, Titus Andromedon (portrayed by Tituss Burgess) said it best:“What white nonsense is this?!”I’m not going to be disingenuous for Twitter engagement and say I never liked a show after controversy surrounds it—I loved the show and was entertained by the performances. What Isay is that I’ve always held the belief that Burgess quickly emerged as the true star of the show. Fans immediately campaigned for a spinoff—which we never got, much to our collective chagrin. As for what the traditional ball looks like today, Newsweek further reports:The ball continues to be held in December of each year, while the associated parade now takes place over the Fourth of July weekend. Far removed from its beginnings, said to have included floats featuring racist caricatures of different ethnic groups, the fair now looks like any other celebration of all things Americana, including fireworks, abundant food and music. Racism! It’s alive, dammit! Given the premise of—the main character emerges into a new decade in NYC after years in a doomsday cult—now I’m sitting here wondering if Kemper’s real life provided some inspiration.

It would also represent an historic shift away from the roads-first approach to federal transportation spending that has reigned since Dwight Eisenhower created the Interstate Highway System.

The reason? Struggles linked to our global supply chain. Last week, President Joe Biden revealedplans to help tackle bottlenecks within our supply chain, including plans to turn ports into 24/7 operations. Meanwhile, shipping companies FedEx and UPS as well as retailing giant Walmart will expand their efforts to ease the strains on the supply chain.“This is the first key step for moving on entire freight transportation and logistical supply chain nationwide to a 24/7 system,” said Biden. So, what is the supply chain, and why should you care about these issues? Let's explain:The supply chain is how we get nearly all of the stuff in our lives that we want and need. It's a system that helps makeand deliver our favorite products. It involves the manufacturersof these products, the companies that supply materials to create them, the cargo ships, trains and trucks that deliver them, and the stores selling them.“You can think of this as a pipe that connects supply and demand,"" said Tinglong Dai, a professor of operations management and business analytics at Johns Hopkins University. It's also complicated. Take the iPhone, for example. To build one, Apple has supply chains with companies providing materials for its smartphonesuch as Corning, which makes precision glass for use on the iPhone. Then you have the supply chains Apple uses to distribute iPhones to you.""It’s a complex network of various different entities that are working together in order to enable us as consumers to receive our products in the time that we expect,"" said Marko Bastl, the director of the Center for Supply Chain Management at Marquette University. These products may be hard to find due to supply chain issuesWhy are they higher?3 tips to save on your groceriesThe issues affecting supply chains are linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bastl said the pandemic is unique because it has impacted both supply and demand. Some manufacturers still aren't operating at the levels they reached before the pandemic. The pandemic also affected companies focused on logistics, such as warehousing to store items that travel overseas and transportation like trucks and trains to deliver them across the country, said Bastl. At the same time, due to millions of us staying at home to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, we ordered a lot of stuff, from personal computers to sports equipment.""It’s almost like a perfect storm of loss of manufacturing capacity as well as loss of logistics capacity, married then with the increase in demand,"" said Bastl. One of the enduring images of this crisis has been several container ships sitting idle at ports waiting to unload their goods. Biden has struck a deal with the Port of Los Angeles to turn it into a 24/7 operation to move ships through more quickly. Dai said the process of unloading these ships requires a lot of work and people, including warehouse workers and drivers to ultimately deliver these products to retailers.“We have increased the number of goods coming here to the U. S., but we do not have more truck drivers, we do not have more warehouse space,"" said Dai. ""So then that’s where those cargo ships are stuck.""Bastl said it depends on the industry because of the different supply chains they use, but he notes consumer electronics, such as personal computers and video game consoles, as well as toys, have been affected most by supply chain issues. Dai said ""low-end inexpensive products"" across industries will be impacted as well, forcing us to buy a more expensive item to compensate. All of these issues have a direct impact on what we can buy – on what's available to buy. That's the reason consumers have beenadvised to start their holiday shopping early. Dai projects we'll see higher prices and fewer available products. And we may see more empty shelves at stores due to shortages and delays, Bastl said.""The longer that these delays will last, the more likely it is companies involved in production, distribution and movement of our products will not be able or willing to absorb this cost, and they’ll start pushing them on to consumers,"" Bastl said.",3,Reliable,0.1335034013605442,0.5113945578231291,914,3,USA Today
287,When Climate Disaster and Mass Incarceration Collide,-10.0,37.75,https://inthesetimes.com/article/climate-disaster-mass-incarceration-prison-florida-environment,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-05-19,25,"PALMETTO, FLA.— More than1,200detainees at Manatee County Jail waited to hear if they would be evacuated from the danger zone on April4as a breach in a nearby wastewater reservoir threatened to plunge the area under a20-foot wall of contaminated water. What followed were72hours of uncertainty and yet another failed response to an environmental disaster that gambled with the lives and wellbeing of incarcerated people. The breach was discovered on April2at the old Piney Point phosphate plant reservoir in Manatee County, threatening to collapse one of the walls holding back more than300million gallons of radioactive water. If this wall ruptured, it would take less than an hour for the county to be submerged under​“a20-foot wall of water,” Acting Manatee County Administrator Scott L. Hopes told a local news channel. The potentially​“imminent” collapse of gypsum stacks full of toxic and radioactive contents would have been one of the largest environmental disasters of recent years. The next day, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Manatee County and issued a mandatory evacuation order to​“protect the lives and property of the people in the threatened communities.” More than300households were within the mandatory evacuation zone, and many fled the area, relocated by the local and state government to hotels where they received free meals. Detainees at the jail, meanwhile, were left neglected, just over a mile away from the Piney Point phosphate plant. Local organizerstweetedan urgent plea for the public to flood with phone calls the offices of the Sheriff for Manatee County, Rick Wells, the Board of County Commissioners, and the Emergency Management Division at Manatee County, in hopes that the pressure would force officials to evacuate the incarcerated people. At first, the sheriff moved the medical unit and jail staff to the second floor of the facility, leaving detainees vulnerable to the consequences of the flood on the first floor, surrounded by large bags of sand that were allegedly placed there to delay the effects of the flooding. By early morning on April4, the sheriff had crammed as many inmates as possible into the second floor’s cells. Only267of1,200inmates wereevacuatedduring the crisis, and they were sent to the nearby Polk County Jail. Jordan Mazurek, an organizer with Florida Prisoner Solidarity (FPS) — an abolitionist collective whose mission is to prioritize the needs of all incarcerated people, their community, and​“care networks” — fumed about Sheriff Wells’ response to the looming crisis.​“The immediate excuse from the sheriff’s office for why they weren’t evacuating people was,​‘Covid. We can’t evacuate people because it’s not Covid safe.’ Well, keeping people in cages is not at all Covid safe.” In overcrowded cells, prisoners faced a greater risk of spreading Covid-19. Detainees waited nervously to see if the breach would mean that a toxic flood would cut off all access to the critical infrastructure on the first floor, their water supply — or worse. Had the jail flooded, emergency access to the facility wouldn’t have been possible since the Florida Highway Patrol had already closed U. S. Route41, the only road to the jail. On April6, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Rick Wells and the state of Florida for presenting an​“unreasonable risk of serious harm” to those that remained detained at the jail. Thankfully, the crisis for Manatee County was averted by pumping millions of gallons of polluted water into Tampa Bay, providing reprieve to the detainees. But the gamble taken by the state of Florida and the sheriff carried large risks: When the evacuation order was lifted on April6— four days after the breach was discovered — more than1,000inmates remained at the jail. On April12, the lawsuit against Florida and Sheriff Wells and wasdismissedby the ACLU. For Florida Prisoner Solidarity, questions regarding the safety of incarcerated people during climate disasters are not new. The organization connectedwith an incarcerated person at a Florida prison that has frequently been threatened by hurricanes. The person asked to remain anonymous out of concern for their safety.“They come with plywood and cover up the windows — this is when everybody just walks around in their box,” F. D. O. C. Slave, whose chosen pseudonym is a reflection of the abuse he has experienced while imprisoned in Florida, toldwith respect to preparations for incoming hurricanes. While F. D. O. C. Slave has not personally experienced extreme flooding at his prison, there have been many reported cases ofsevere floodingacross the country due to the poor infrastructure installed, allegedly, to protect inmates, proving that plywood is not adequate protection for hurricanes. Though the plywood is typically installed two to three days before the hurricanes,​“it usually takes two weeks” to remove them. If another hurricane is expected soon, prisons keep the plywood for up to a month, often during90-degree temperatures in June and July.​“Because there’s no AC, and they close all the windows… there’s no ventilation,” said F. D. O. C. Slave. Over1,200legal cases werefiledfrom1980to2019that claimed violation of the Eighth Amendment right to protection from dangerous temperature conditions. According to Prison Legal News,79inmates and prison staff suffered from heat-related illnesses in the first10months of2018. Natural disasters, accelerated by climate change, are a growing threat to incarcerated people across the United States, who are vulnerable and often left behind during environmental crises. Deidre McDonald wrote in a first-person account for the Marshall Project about being incarcerated in a Texas prison during Hurricane Harvey in2017:​“To get to the main building, I must wade into it, knee-deep. That’s when I notice the ladies with wheelchairs, walkers and crutches are struggling. One woman is crying hysterically because she is afraid of water, and the dorm boss can’t get her to take one step forward.” Her account calls attention to how lack of planning and infrastructure poses additional risks for prisoners with disabilities or phobias.“Folks [were] up to their waist and chest in water for12hours,” Jordan Mazurek, an FPS organizer whose background is in toxic prisons and environmental justice, said of Hurricane Harvey’s devastating impact on Texas prisons.​“The feds didn’t have enough water to go around and so folks started drinking toilet water because it was the only thing left, and as a result, two prisoners died of bacterial infections.”The intersection of mass incarceration and environmental disasters is not coincidental. While the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that no group should be discriminated against when considering the public’s right to live in hazard-free areas, there’s a clear link between unsafe environmental conditions and sites of incarceration. Frequently located on cheap undesirable real estate, nearly one-third of federal and state prisons in the United States are less than three miles away from a Superfund cleanup site — highly contaminated areas, also known as toxic waste dumps, that the EPA determines as needing long-term clean-up since they pose a risk to the health and wellbeing of either humans or the environment. Marcos Santos, an inmate at the State Correctional Institute at Fayette in Pennsylvania — built on top of an old mining site and surrounded by​“about40million tons of waste” —toldAl Jazeera in2016,​“I’ve had to endure numerous medical problems: rashes throughout my body that hurt and keep me up all night. Extreme swelling of various parts including my throat making it difficult to breathe.”Inmates are at the front lines of​“the most brutal effects of every single disaster situation,” said Mazurek of FPS. Incarcerated persons’ lack of mobility makes it so that they cannot​“move out of the path of a hurricane on their own free will or move out of the path of what would have been a20-foot-high wall of toxic water coming at their jail,” Mazurek continued.​“Prisons are just an ongoing disaster, and that’s how it’s going to be until we close them all.”I hope you found this article important.

288,MMT economist Stephanie Kelton: “Donald Trump changed the terms of economic debate”,-9.0,41.0,https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2021/02/mmt-economist-stephanie-kelton-donald-trump-changed-terms-economic-debate,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-17,16,"In a recent Treasury video, Rishi Sunak declared: “The government is not some entity that has its own money, the government only has money because people pay taxes and we borrow money.”To the US economist and former Bernie Sanders adviser Stephanie Kelton, who is one of the advocates of modern monetary theory (MMT), the Chancellor was exactly wrong. As she writes in her 2020 book, rather than taxing or borrowing to fund spending, governments spend money first and only then choose to tax or borrow. Is this the “magic money tree” that, in 2017, Theresa May told a nurse did not exist? “If ‘there is no magic money tree’ is meant to be shorthand for ‘we can’t just come up with the money when we want to fund something’, well, then that’s wrong,” Kelton, 51, told me when we spoke by video call. “A sovereign currency-issuing government can always come up with the money to fund its priorities. There’s nothing magic about it; it’s just what it means to be a sovereign currency issuer.”The popularity of MMT, whose ideas can be traced back to the early 20th century, surged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as governments spent to save national economies. The theory now enjoys an evangelical online following as well as an array of detractors from the left and right (James Meadway, a former economic adviser to John McDonnell, has accused MMT of “peddling simplistic monetary solutions to complex problems of political power”). Kelton’s work is being studied at Westminster, including by intellectually curious Conservative MPs such as Steve Baker. In her view, the Covid-19 crisis is the ultimate proof of the theory’s validity. “What did we [the US] do? We spent trillions of dollars [to save the economy]. So do I feel vindicated? Hell yeah, I feel vindicated. It’s been apparent to anyone paying attention who has been getting this stuff right.”Kelton, who served as chief economist to the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee between 2015 and 2016 and is now a professor at Stony Brook University, New York, acknowledges constraints still exist. Countries that do not issue their own currencies, such as Greece and other eurozone members, lack the degree of freedom enjoyed by the US, the UK, Japan and others. For those with independent central banks, the true restriction, Kelton argues, is not the size of the budget deficit, but inflation. Conservative critics of MMT, such as the former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King, frequently point to the dystopian fate of economies such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela, where price surges over the past decade have rendered money worthless. But, once the illusion of significant budgetary constraints has been dispelled, how would governments resist the urge to splurge?“I’m giving you a framework that emphasises inflation risk, no other school of thought does that – Keynesian, neo-Keynesian, new classical, Austrian, Marxist,” Kelton replied. “MMT’s overriding concern is inflation risk, but your questions are always, ‘What happens when inflation accelerates out of control?’”MMT proponents suggest governments could levy taxes to dampen inflation. But, at a time of price rises, would politicians be prepared to demand the public pay more? “I don’t think it’s correct to say that Congress wouldn’t act if inflation is as bad as your questions suggest… and something is hurting the nation and the people are upset about it.”This could be dismissed as wishful thinking, but the inflationary spiral that some economists have warned of since 2008 has never arrived. I asked Kelton whether she believes Donald Trump has changed the terms of economic debate. “Absolutely. When he passed the $1.9trn tax cuts in 2018, which everybody knew were going to increase the deficit, I saw Senator Sanders, and he said to me, ‘Is this you? Did you do this?’ And I replied, ‘It’s a good thing. It’s a good thing in that it’s going to show you can make use of the budget when you have power to carry out your agenda.’”Kelton may have served as an adviser to Sanders during both his presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020, but she is encouraged by Joe Biden and believes he has learned from Barack Obama’s fiscal hesitancy. “He made the proposal for the $1.9trn stimulus programme unapologetically, saying that we have the ability to deficit spend. This administration understands that they have to show material improvements in people’s lives in the first two years because the margin in the Senate is already so slim.”Confronting what the Swedish academic Andreas Malm calls an “age of chronic emergency”, Kelton believes Biden understands that “these intersecting crises aren’t going to be dealt with through incremental policy – you have to go big in this moment”. Before Covid-19, she noted, 40 per cent of US adults did not have $400 saved to cover an emergency expense. At a time when Sunak still speaks of a “sacred duty” to “balance the books” – despite the moral and economic case for government spending – MMT’s political appeal is likely to endure.“So much of what I hope for is a better, more productive debate,” Kelton said. “We’re still going to have differences, but at least our debate won’t be bogged down by this threat of running out of money or bankrupting our children and grandchildren, all that stuff.”RelatedThis article appears in the 17 Feb 2021 issue of the New Statesman,War against truth",3,Reliable,0.0633923417851989,0.436770768913626,1222,3,New Statesman

Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said Thursday that this year’s fire season is shaping up to be one of the worst on record.“1987 was one of the worst fire seasons on record, and currently they’re on pace to exceed that,” said Hokanson, speaking to reporters. “If you go back to the beginning of fire season earlier this year, within the state of California they burned about 1.6 million acres, which is roughly the size of the state of Delaware.”The fires have destroyed more than 3,200 structures, including homes, and there have been eight deaths. More than 12,400 people remained evacuated Thursday. Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, assistant adjutant general of the California National Guard expressed confidence in the ability of guardsmen in his state to provide sustained response to wildfires. New classes of California Guardsmen are constantly being trained to respond to fires. Last month, a news release reported that more than 270 soldiers began training. Beevers said the Guard is presently training another 550 members who will rotate into the mix of current crews to prevent burnout. In addition to the human resources the Guard provides, Beevers expressed that the 16 bucket helicopters, 4 modular airborne firefighting systems-equipped C-130s, and surveying drones have also been an invaluable resource. More than ### National Guardsmen are currently activated for wildland firefighting missions. (Photo Credit: Master Sgt. Joseph Prouse)“These young airmen are being able to provide incident commanders in the field real time data on the unique behavior of a specific fire,” Beevers said. “They can put fire teams in the right place at the right time.”But the 1,300 soldiers and airmen from five different states activated to fight wildfires on the West Coast are only a sliver of the roughly 64,000 National Guardsmen currently serving domestically and overseas. That’s a significant decrease from June, when COVID-19 and civil unrest pushed numbers to a peak of nearly 120,000 members activated. Despite the workload 2020 has handed guardsmen, Hokanson said the force has remained capable and ready.“At the same time, we met every one of our overseas deployment requirements, and it had no impact there at all,” Hokanson said, referencing the high levels of domestic missions. Of the 64,000 currently activated, more than 18,000 are still tasked with COVID-19 relief missions across all 54 states and territories. Federal support for such missions wasextended until 2021at the beginning of last month.“National Guard forces around the country have provided critical support to governors as the governors work to address the needs of those populations within their respective states and territories,” President Donald Trump’s executive memorandum stated. Another nearly 4,000 soldiers and airmen continue to provide relief to communities in Texas and Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Laura. Airmen on the ground have been working to clear roadways of fallen trees and debris, the Louisiana Air National Guard reported. There are a lot of people in need,” said Senior Airman Alejandro Peralta, a structural engineering journeyman, in a news release. “Hopefully, they are comforted and feel supported when they see the Louisiana Air National Guard working in the area.”This year’s hurricane season has a 60 percent chance of above-normal activity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,and the season won’t end until Nov. 30. As hurricane and fire seasons continue on opposite coasts, civil unrest also rolls on across the country. Most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Eversrequested out-of-state assistancefor protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake and subsequent killing of two demonstrators. Military police companies from Michigan, Alabama, and Arizona responded. Approximately 150 Arizona National Guard soldiers from the 850th Military Police Battalion mobilized to Wisconsin in response to an Emergency Management Assistance Compact request Aug. 28, 2020. Arizona is one of three states sending personnel to Wisconsin which are expected to arrive later this evening (Tech. Sgt. Michael Matkin/Air National Guard)While a contingent of Arizona National Guard soldiers returned home from Kenosha, Hokanson said more than 1,200 soldiers and airmen continue to assist state and local law enforcement in various states.“2020 in general kind of proved just what a tremendous value the National Guard is for our nation,” said Hokanson.

It’s a choice that could stand toboost public trustin federal vaccination investment and deployment. Kessler’s got the experience: He’s already been advising Biden on the pandemic since its onset, Anita Dunn, co-chair of the transition team, told the New York Times. And he served as the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the 1990s, at a time where the AIDS epidemic was ravaging the country. Kessler was integral in efforts to bring antiviral HIV drugs to market in a little over a month. Perhaps most importantly, however, Kessler has no ties to big pharma—making him legitimately neutral in his role to support the development, manufacturing, and rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. Kessler is one of the few FDA commissioners who didn’t go on to work for a drug company after his tenure in the federal regulatory agency. There is nothing technically wrong with working for pharma after regulating it, Kesslertold Quartz in 2019. But the optics aren’t great: When leaders of the regulatory body that approves drugs go on to advise the companies that make them, it gives the illusion of a revolving door—like the FDA’s “authority” is more of a chummy relationship. “[The American people] believe that the FDA is making their decisions in their interest and no one else’s,” Kessler told Quartz. After his tenure at FDA, Kessler went on to work in academia, and then for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit nutritional science advocacy group. Hebriefly servedon the board of a company that creates transplantation diagnostic products, and in 2020joined the boardof Ellodi Pharmaceuticals, which develops drugs for the digestive system. However, according to the New York Times, he resigned from these boards this week, and does not own stock in any vaccine or pharmaceutical manufacturing company. That independence is a change of pace from Moncef Slaoui, who led OWS under the Trump administration. Slaouiheld sharesin Moderna while he funded the company to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. He eventually gave those up, butrefusedto give up some of his stock options in companies like GlaxoSmithKline, which is working with Sanofi to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and has received money from OWS. Federal employees are prohibited from such financial conflicts; in order for Slaoui to maintain his holdings, he was allowed to take on his role as a contractor. Critics maintain that Slaoui’s stock ownership in companies set to gain government investment eroded public trust in the government’s ability to make public health decisions based on the scientific merit of a company’s offerings. That trust is more important than ever as vaccines are deployed to millions of people. Already, the public is skeptical of the speed with which vaccines were developed—despite the fact that FDAupheld its usual standardsbefore issuing emergency use authorizations. Kessler’s appointment to the OWS position could manage to restore some faith in the government’s ability to put public health before private profits. To start, Biden’s transition team told the Times, Kessler will focus his efforts on creating larger vaccination sites in places like high school gyms to speed the slow rollout of existing doses. And he’ll direct new investments in pharma—this time, focusing on novel antiviral treatments for Covid-19.

291,The Andrew Cuomo coverup.,5.67,45.67,https://www.readtangle.com/p/andrew-cuomo-covid-cover-up,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-18,16,"Plus, a Los Angeles Times reporter answers a reader question. Hello from Brooklyn, New York, where it is somehow snowing… again… with an expected 6-9 inches coming today. Speaking of New York: we’re tackling New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s COVID-19 response. Plus, Laura Nelson from The Los Angeles Times joins us to answer a reader question. Yesterday, when writing about the Texas power outages, I wrote that “as far away as Denver, Colorado, people are being asked to preserve their power to help support the grid in Texas,” before repeatedly referencing how Texas was on its own grid detached from the rest of the U. S. People in Colorado were being asked to preserve power, but that’s because outages were occurring across the U. S. — not just in Texas. Andrew Cuomo. The New York governor is under fire. Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo was being heralded in the press as a sober, straightforward voice on the severity of the pandemic and what was going to be necessary to beat coronavirus. His approval ratings skyrocketed in New York and nationally, and he was frequently juxtaposed to the president as a more measured kind of leader around the virus. He was even floated as a 2024 presidential candidate, with some Democrats privately hoping he’d jump into the 2020 race. But in recent weeks, Cuomo’s record on the pandemic has been unraveling. In late January, New York’s Democratic Attorney General Letitia Jamesreportedthat nursing home deaths had been “undercounted” by as much as 50 percent, and shortly after, the state’s death toll went up by thousands. Then, last week, a former Cuomo aide named Melissa DeRosaconcededto state lawmakers that the administration “froze” the handling of an inquiry about the data. DeRosa said the Justice Department had requested the data and that the Cuomo administration feared it would be “used against us.” On Monday, for the first time, Cuomoacknowledgeda lack of transparency in his administration’s reporting of coronavirus deaths. He also conceded that his administration did not promptly answer questions from the media or public about the nursing home deaths, which now number over 13,000. Then, yesterday, New York State Assembly Member Ron Kim released a statement accusing Cuomo ofthreatening to “destroy” Kim’s careerafter Kim criticized Cuomo’s handling of the pandemic. Kim claimed that after he accused Cuomo of obstructing justice last week, Cuomo called him to lob threats and insisted he release a new statement clarifying his remarks. Cuomo’s role in the pandemic has become a flashpoint far outside New York as well. As global leaders and the president struggled to manage the coronavirus, other governors — like Florida’s Ron DeSantis, Texas’s Greg Abbott, California’s Gavin Newsom and Ohio’s Mike DeWine — have all been compared and contrasted with each other for their responses. Today, we’ll look at the reactions specifically to the latest news on Cuomo and explore the arguments over his administration’s response in New York. There is quite a bit of bipartisan backlash against Cuomo. While his supporters and allies have mostly stayed quiet in the last week, there’s a growing consensus on both sides that these revelations require immediate action — and lawmakers on the right and left have suggested he should face some sort of punishment. Many on the left are becoming increasingly critical of Cuomo, and wondering if it’s time for the state to rescind some of his power. Arwa Mahdawi wrote in The Guardianthat Cuomo is a “mini-Trump.”“Andrew Cuomo was practically deified by liberals in the early days of the pandemic because, let’s face it, anyone looked amazing compared to the train-wreck that was ‘try-injecting-bleach’ Donald Trump,” she wrote. “While Trump was in a state of dithering and denial, Cuomo took charge and was reassuringly direct: people across the US tuned into his daily press briefings. There was speculation Cuomo could be the next president. Of course, being good on camera doesn’t mean you’re doing a good job on the ground.“It has always been obvious to anyone paying attention that Cuomo is a mini-Trump,” she wrote. “He has the same appetite for authoritarianism as the former president: during the pandemic he has drawn scrutiny forcancelling special elections, issuingexecutive ordersandconsolidatingpower. Like Trump he has nothing but disdain for his detractors, particularly if they happen to be more qualified than he is. The New York Times recently reported that nine top New York health officials have resigned during the pandemic, with many of them telling the Times that Cuomo had asked them to match their health guidance to his decisions. But who needs experts, eh? Not the all-knowing Cuomo. ‘When I say ‘experts’ in air quotes, it sounds like I’m saying I don’t really trust the experts,’ Cuomo said of pandemic policies in arecent news conference. ‘Because I don’t.’”In Jacobin, David Sirota and Andrew Perez wrote that Cuomowas a “media created monster,”and compared his rise to the now-disgraced anti-Trump Lincoln Project.“In Cuomo’s case, the Democratic governor’s aides were caught on tape effectively admitting that they ‘froze’ and did not release the details of thousands of nursing home deaths from COVID-19 because they feared consequences from federal law enforcement officials,” they wrote. “No doubt, Donald Trump’s Justice Department was as highly politicized as Cuomo advisers feared — but that is hardly a legitimate justification for hiding details of thousands of deaths. And the framing of it as some innocent, unplanned, deer-in-the-headlights slipup is absurd, considering the context.“Cuomo’s administration hid the nursing home casualty data after his administrationslipped provisions into the state budgetthat helped the governor’s largest health care industry donors obtain legal immunity for nursing home executives,” they added. The right has been excoriating Cuomo, saying the left and the mainstream media are finally catching up to what they’ve been saying all along. This is why nobody believes anythingthe media says, Richard Lowry claimed in the National Review.“Andrew Cuomo, the Emmy Award–winning governor that a swooning press held up as the enlightened standard for an effective pandemic response, didn’t just make a disastrous mistake in his handling of nursing homes. He didn’t just miscount nursing-home fatalities. He may havenursing-home fatalities,” Lowry wrote.“It turns out that everything the press has accused Florida’s Ron DeSantis of — a botched response and dishonest numbers — is true of Cuomo,” he added. “All it took to realize that the heroic Cuomo narrative didn’t add up was to look, almost from the very beginning, at any of the COVID trackers that showed New York had one of the worst records in the country in terms of total deaths and deaths per capita. Amazingly enough, the myth of Cuomo continued unabated even when the governor rescinded his nursing-home policy last May and it was already obvious it had been a profound policy error.”In City Journal,Joel Zinberg re-told the saga, highlighting every time reporters and watchdog groups had been rebuffed while trying to get information, and pointing to the pervasive discrepancies between what was said publicly and what private reports showed.“The dam finally broke when the New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a report on January 28 that found the DOH had underreported in-facility deaths by as much as 19 percent, and that when nursing home residents who died at hospitals were added in, the DOH had undercounted the total number of nursing-facility deaths by 50 percent,” he wrote. “Finally, the most damaging disclosure was a leaked recording from February 10, in which a top Cuomo aideadmittedto Democratic lawmakers that the administration hid the true numbers of nursing-home deaths for political reasons. The administration had worried that federal investigators would use these numbers against the governor.“Yet Cuomo’s policy failures are not confined to nursing homes,” he added. “His capricious policies on business and restaurant closures, unmoored from public-health data, have destroyed small businesses statewide andwiped out New York City restaurants. The December restaurant reclosure was made at the same time that New York officials released data indicating that during the September–November period in which restaurants were open, restaurants and bars accounted for only 1.43 percent of Covid-19 cases. Transmission in homes and at social events account for nearly 74 percent of cases. And thenoted that the metrics Cuomo had said would guide his decisions on business reopening were worse when he announced New York City restaurants could reopen for indoor dining on February 14 than when he closed them in December. EvenNew York Democratsare now calling for curbing Cuomo’s emergency powers.”It’s disqualifying for any office. Plain and simple. Any Democrat trying to excuse what Gov. Andrew Cuomo has done — or who can’t criticize him without bringing up Donald Trump — is just showing themselves to be a partisan hack. This has nothing to do with Trump, and everything to do with Cuomo’s leadership and his failures as a governor. Yes, Cuomo gave sober, straightforward and frightening press conferences early on in the pandemic. He was honest about the threat COVID-19 posed, and about the fact that it would be a long road out. That is, perhaps the single thing he did right from the beginning of the pandemic — and it turns out even those sober words were buttressed on both sides by lies. This guybefore we were even out of the woods. He titled it “American Leadership: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.” Can you imagine the hubris it takes to do something like that? He won awards and basked in national glory while he was in the middle of a cover-up, hiding from the state and the country the fact that his poor decisions had killed thousands of elderly New Yorkers. “Freezing” numbers that are being requested by federal investigators and journalists is not a thing. That’s called “refusing to hand them over” and it’s what government bodies do when they are hiding something. But it isn’t just that the Cuomo administration sent walking coronavirus time bombs into nursing homes and then blamed Trump for it, it’s not just that he covered it up, it’s not just that his former staffers say they are “deathly afraid of him,” it’s not just that he insisted New Yorkers stay home for Thanksgiving while he invited his 89-year-old mother over, nor is it just that he openly panned health experts’ advice because he’s so arrogant he thinks he knows better. It’s not just that his reckless policies destroyed New York’s restaurants, or that the state pinballed back and forth on school reopenings or even that Cuomo can’t manage to get along with fellow Democrat and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, which leaves the rest of us stuck in the middle of their petty bickering. It isn’t even that New York has thesecond-most deaths per capitaof any state from COVID-19, or that today we are still in worse shape than every single state except South Carolina. It’s that when all of this was going down, as Sirota and Perez rightly point out in Jacobin, Cuomo was expending energy trying to insert liability shields into the state budget for his donors in the healthcare industry. He wasincentives for hospital and nursing home executives to protect New Yorkers in what was an obvious effort to keep his donors happy and his campaign’s pockets lined. He was, in other words, thinking about himself while tens of thousands of New Yorkers died. And the guy fighting to stop him?Ron Kim. Yes, the same legislator Cuomo allegedly threatened to “destroy” earlier this week for criticizing his pandemic response. Fortunately for us, Kim and other New York state legislators actually succeeded in rolling back some of the immunity, a policy the Associated Press had described as going“unusually far”to protect the healthcare industry. And yes, there is plenty of ire to go around for the New York press corps that ignored Kim, or for the national press corps like CNN that brought Cuomo on to be interviewed by his own brother while thousands of New Yorkers died on his watch and the two of them chummed it up about how great a governor he was. I distinctly remember the first time I sat through an Andrew Cuomo press conference, and I had a similar feeling many Americans did: it was honest and comforting. I evensaid so on Twitter, writing that I “hate to add to the lovefest,'' but watching Cuomo made me want to act more responsibly, which felt like a good thing. Looking back on that tweet now makes me cringe. Cuomo failed New York in one of the biggest tests of his career, and he was rewarded for that failure with book deals and wall-to-wall press coverage about how great he was. Now, with those failures seeing the light of day alongside the laundry list of his other shortcomings, my only hope is that New Yorkers don’t forget.

Hey Cassi, sorry to hear you’ve had a tough time getting an appointment for your grandmother. I know it’s frustrating. There were several big reasons whyCalifornia’s vaccination program really stumbled in the early weeks. The good news is that most of them have since been resolved. California has a very decentralized healthcare system, so 61 public health agencies in 58 counties had to get their own vaccine logistics operations up and running. And, as you said, the state was picky about who was being vaccinated at first – too picky, some experts and critics have said. (That complicated eligibility system has since been scrapped in favor of an age-based rollout.)During the period that vaccines were only available to frontline workers in California, some healthcare workers were reluctant to take the vaccine. And problems with the state’s data collection system meant that health officials couldn’t make decisions about where to send doses, or where to relocate doses, in real time. Meanwhile, Texas decided in December to break away from the federal vaccination guidelines and start giving shots to seniors. So your parents had several weeks’ head start to try to book an appointment compared to people in California. Israel’s population is about the same size as Los Angeles County. The country has a universal healthcare system, and the government struck a deal with Pfizer for a stable pipeline of doses in exchange for patient data, conditions that you wouldn’t see here in the U. S. As for the question of whether Texas or California is doing better: it depends on how you slice it. At the time I wrote this, Texas had used more of its vaccine doses (84%) than California (75%), and had a slightly higher share of residents who’ve received both doses – but a higher percentage of California residents have received at least one dose. Both states are pretty middle-of-the-road compared to the rest of the country. Also: Our perceptions of how well a state is doing compared to another state can often rely on who we know in those places and how easily they’ve been able to access the vaccine. A lot of factors come into play there, including English fluency, computer literacy, level of trust in the healthcare system, access to transportation and whether they have the time to secure an appointment, get there, wait for the shot and be vaccinated. The one-dose vaccine is on the way. Johnson & Johnsonrecently appliedfor an emergency use authorization from the FDA for their one-dose vaccine. If the vaccine is approved, which could happen in March, it could really help boost the country’s vaccination efforts. Supply is the biggest problem basically everywhere right now. In California, some vaccine sites — including the massive operation at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles — have had totemporarily shut downbecause of a shortage of doses. I hope this answers your question — and that, by the time you read this, your grandmother has gotten her vaccine!Politics can ruin just about everything, according to a new paper in the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing. ""Political polarization is having far-reaching impacts on American life, harming consumer welfare and creating challenges for people ranging from elected officials and policymakers to corporate executives and marketers,"" the paper says. Political affiliations are obstructing friendships, limiting job choices and leaving people poorer, lonelier, and less healthy.

It is also Biden’s first opportunity to open much broader conversations about the future of the Palestinian Authority, assert America’s position in Israeli-Palestinian relations and move toward a two-state reality — which can all be accomplished through four key diplomatic moves. Blinken is scheduled to shuttle between Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority on his first trip to the region as Secretary of State. As a seasoned diplomat, Blinken will surely notice the idiosyncrasies of the American Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem, which currently also serves as the diplomatic mission to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and to Gaza. But this odd diplomatic predicament is an opportunity for the Biden administration to redesign four interrelated diplomatic missions: the American Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem, a new American diplomatic mission to the Palestinians in Ramallah, the Palestinian diplomatic mission to the U. S. in Washington, and the American Consulate in Jerusalem, which has been in place since the Ottoman Empire and since 1967 represented US interests to the Palestinians. As the Biden administration is about to appoint its Ambassador to Israel, this is a surgical diplomatic move that can only happen now. The 1967 Six-Day War ushered in a strange diplomatic reality. Since the legal status of Jerusalem was seen as ‘disputed’, the American Embassy to Israel remained in Tel-Aviv. Meanwhile, the American Diplomatic Mission to the Palestinians operated out of the American Consulate in West Jerusalem, which has been in place since the Ottoman Empire. The Oslo Accords, which were signed in 1993-1995, further complicated diplomatic matters by establishing that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and not the Palestinian Authority, which is the self-governing body of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, would lead Palestinian diplomatic missions around the world. The difference is material: the Palestinian Authority is the government of the would-be Palestinian state that represents the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, while the PLO is a non-government organization that claims to represent all Palestinians both in the West Bank and Gaza, but also in the Palestinian Diaspora and Israeli Arabs. There was a logic to this madness. In the Oslo Accords, Israel and the Palestinians agreed that the status of Jerusalem is an ‘outstanding issue’ along with their future borders and the terms on which a Palestinian state will emerge. A Permanent Status Agreement, which was supposed to be signed in 1999, would have ‘upgraded’ the Palestinian Authority into statehood, determine its permanent borders with Israel including in the Jerusalem area, and thereby allow for the emergence of two capitals in that area: Yerushalayim as Israel’s capital and Al-Quds as the capital of the Palestinians. At that point, the U. S. and other countries would relocate their embassies to Israel and Palestine to Yerushalayim and Al-Quds, respectively. This was not only the outline of the 2001 Clinton Parameters, but also of the 2018 Trump plan. For the duration of the interim period of the Oslo Process, from 1994 to 1999, the Palestinian Authority was denied various attributes of sovereignty, including diplomatic representation. This is the reason why the PLO and not the Palestinian Authority, has led the Palestinian diplomatic mission to the U. S in Washington. It is also the reason why the American diplomatic mission to the Palestinians continued to operate out of the Consulate in Jerusalem and not from a diplomatic mission to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. While these matters were supposed to be resolved by May 1999, we have just marked the 27th year of the interim period of Oslo, with no resolution in sight. President Trump broke with these traditions. He not only moved the American Embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but also folded the Consulate into the Embassy as a Palestinian Affairs Unit. Hence, effectively, Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, was the ambassador to Israel and to the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza. Furthermore, in 2018, President Trump shut down the Palestinian diplomatic mission to Washington DC, which had been led by the PLO since 1994. These diplomatic facts create a blank slate for the Biden administration, which faces inevitable decisions not only regarding representation between the U. S. and Israel, but also with the Palestinians. The Biden administration is committed to the two-state solution and has already promised that the American Embassy to Israel will remain in Jerusalem. It also pledged to improve relations with the Palestinians, which will inevitably require direct diplomatic representation between the U. S. and the Palestinians. So what should Biden do? His administration faces two options: undo Trump’s actions by simply reopening the Consulate in East Jerusalem as the diplomatic mission to the Palestinians and the PLO mission in Washington or embrace a bold approach that creates a new diplomatic reality for all sides. A keystone of Biden’s new approach is making explicit that the Palestinian Authority will become a state alongside Israel. In doing so, Biden will be relying on four American Presidents and four Israeli Prime Ministers, including Trump and Netanyahu, who did so in the past. Biden should then declare the Palestinian Authority as a ‘nascent state,’ which is a status in international law that refers to political entities who are going to become states when they meet certain conditions. Israel was a ‘nascent state’ between the United Nations Partition Decision of Nov. 29 1947, and the departure of the British Mandatory Government on May 15 1948. Should the U. S. recognize the Palestinian Authority as a nascent state, it would make sense for the Biden administration to take two complementary steps: invite the Palestinian Authority and not the PLO, to lead the diplomatic mission in Washington, as well as to open a diplomatic mission in Ramallah to represent US interests in nascent Palestine and to designate an American Chief of Mission to the Palestinian Authority alongside its Ambassador to Israel. For Biden, this would be an important diplomatic step toward a reality of two states for two peoples, which benefits all sides. Israel should appreciate the consolidation of power in the hands of the Palestinian Authority over the PLO and Hamas, and the diminishing stature of the Consulate in Jerusalem. After all, a full-fledged American diplomatic mission to the Palestinians in the heart of Jerusalem compromises Israel’s stature in the city. Such a move can serve as an important signal to other countries who are operating consulates in Jerusalem, such as France, and signal to many other nations that it is OK to relocate their embassies to Israel to West Jerusalem while opening diplomatic missions in Ramallah. For the Palestinians, Biden could offer a final stamp of approval on the imminent statehood of Palestine based off the Palestinian Authority. This would be a setback to Hamas following its rise in the recent military confrontation. The PLO claims to be the representative of all Palestinians, when roughly 5 million Palestinians are also Jordanian residents and citizens and about 2 million are Israelis. A PLO-led Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington, D. C. that claims to also speak for an estimated 7 million Palestinians who are Israelis and Jordanians should be unacceptable to the U. S., to Israel and to Jordan. Biden can put an end to this diplomatic farce as well. When Secretary Blinken visits Jerusalem, he should see an opportunity for President Biden not only to assume American diplomatic leadership but also to help all sides get to a better equilibrium.

S., Kim Larson is still trying to convince others in her northern Montana county that COVID-19 is dangerous. As Hill County Health Department director and county health officer, Larson continues to hear people say the coronavirus is just like a bad case of the flu. Around the time Montana’s governormandatedface coverings in July, her staffers saw notices taped in several businesses’ windows spurning the state’s right to issue such emergency orders. For a while, the county with a population of 16,000 along the Canadian border didn’t see much evidence of the pandemic. It had only one known COVID case until July. But that changed as the nation moved into its third surge of the virus this fall. By mid-December, Hill County had recorded more than 1,500 cases — the vast majority since Oct. 1 — and 33 people there had died. When Larson hears people say pandemic safety rules should end, she talks about how contagious the COVID virus is, how some people experience lasting effects and how hospitals are so full that care for any ailment could face delays.“In public health, we’ve seen the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, research showing that this really does save lives,” Larson said. “In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”Public health laws typically come long after social norms shift, affirming a widespread acceptance that a change in habits is worth the public good and that it’s time for stragglers to fall in line. But even when decades of evidence show a rule can save lives — such as wearing seat belts or not smoking indoors — the debate continues in some places with the familiar argument that public restraints violate personal freedoms. This fast-moving pandemic, however, doesn’t afford society the luxury of time. State mandates have put local officials in charge of changing behavior while general understanding catches up. Earlier this month, U. S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams stood next to Montana’s governor in Helena and said he hopes people wear masks because it’s the right thing to do — especially as COVID hospitalizations rise.“You don’t want to be the reason that a woman in labor can’t get a hospital bed,” Adams said, adding a vaccine is on the way. “It’s just for a little bit longer.”He spoke days after state lawmakers clashed over masks as a majority of Republican lawmakers arrived for a committee meeting barefaced and at least onetoutedfalse information on the dangers of masks. As of Dec. 15, the Republican majority hadn’t required masks for the upcoming legislative session, set to begin Jan. 4. And now a group opposed to masks from Gallatin and Flathead counties has fileda lawsuitasking a Montana judge to block the state’s pandemic-related safety rules. Public health laws typically spark political battles. Changing people’s habits is hard, saidLindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University in Washington, D. C. Despite the misconception that there was universal buy-in for masks during the 1918 pandemic, Wiley said, some protesters intentionally built rap sheets of arrests for going maskless in the name of liberty.“In public health, we’ve seen the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, research showing that this really does save lives. In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”She said health officials realize any health restrictions amid a pandemic require the public’s trust and cooperation for success.“We don’t have enough police to walk around and force everyone to wear a mask,” she said. “And I’m not sure we want them to do it.”Local officials have the best chance to win over that support, Wiley said. And seeing elected leaders such as President Donald Trumprebuffhis own federal health guidelines makes that harder. Meanwhile, public shaming like calling unmasked people selfish or stupid can backfire, Wiley said, because if they were to give in to mask-wearing, they would essentially be accepting those labels. In the history of public health laws, even rules that have had time to build widely accepted evidence weren’t guaranteed support. It’s illegal in Montana to go without a seat belt in a moving car. But, as in13other states, authorities aren’t allowed to pull people over for being unbuckled. Every few years, a Montana lawmaker, backed by a collection of public health and law enforcement organizations, proposes a law to allow seat belt traffic stops, arguing it would save lives. In 2019, that request didn’t even make it out of committee, squelched by the arguments of personal choice and not giving too much power to the government. Main opposition points against public health laws — whether it’s masks, seat belts, motorcycle helmets or smoking — can sound alike. When Missoula County became the first place in Montana to ban indoor smoking in public spaces in 1999, opponents said the change would destroy businesses, be impossible to enforce and violate people’s freedom of choice.“They are the same arguments in a lot of ways,” said Ellen Leahy, director of the Missoula City-County Health Department. “Public health was right at that intersection between what’s good for the whole community and the rights and responsibilities of the individual.”Montana adopted an indoor smoking ban in 2005, but many bars and tavernswere givenuntil 2009 to fall in line. And, in some places, debate andcourt battles continuedfor a decade more on how the ban could be enforced. Amid the COVID pandemic, Missoula County was again ahead of much of the state when it passed its own mask ordinance. The county has two hospitals and a university that swells its population with students and commuters.“If you have to see it to believe it, you’re going to see the impact of a pandemic first in a city, most likely,” Leahy said. Compliance hasn’t been perfect and she said the need for strict enforcement has been limited. As of early December, out of the more than 1,500 complaints the Missoula health department followed up on since July, it sent closure notices to four businesses that flouted the rules. In Hill County, when the health department gets complaints that a business is violating pandemic mandates, two part-time health sanitarians, who perform health inspections of businesses, talk with the owners about why the rules exist and how to live by them. Often it works. Other times the complaints keep coming. County attorney Karen Alley said the local health officials have reached out to her office with complaints of noncompliance on COVID safety measures, but she has not seen enough evidence to bring a civil case against a business. Unlike other health laws, she said, mask rules have no case studies yet to offer a framework for enforcing them through the Montana courts. (A handful of cases against businesses skirting COVID rules were still playing out as of mid-December.)“Somebody has to be the test case, but you never want to be the test case,” said Alley, who is part of a team of three. “It’s a lot of resources, a lot of time.”Larson, with the Hill County Health Department, said her focus is still on winning over the community. And she’s excited about some progress. The town’s annual live Nativity scene, which typically draws crowds with hot cocoa, turned into a drive-by event this year. She doesn’t expect everyone to follow the rules — that’s never the case in public health. But Larson hopes enough people will to slow down the virus. That could be happening. By mid-December, the county’s tally of daily active cases was declining for the first time since its spike began in October.“You just try to figure out the best way for your community and to get their input,” Larson said. “Because we need the community’s help to stop it.”The Montana GOP uninvited a planned convention speaker amid U.

294,I’m high-risk for COVID-19 and eligible for a vaccine starting Monday. What do I need to know?,0.0,50.67,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/03/14/im-high-risk-for-covid-19-and-eligible-for-a-vaccine-starting-monday-what-do-i-need-to-know/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-14,17,"On Monday, Californians age 16 to 64 with underlying conditions can receive the coronavirus vaccine, adding 4.4 million people to the list of eligible folks. It’s a population that is particularly vulnerable at any age to suffer the worst of the disease, officials said. But it will also be “challenging,” officials said, citing a liberal screening process designed to balance the need to verify a person’s condition with the urgency of vaccinating as many people as possible. Officials caution that just because eligibility begins on Monday, it doesn’t mean you’ll be getting a shot immediately. While supplies are increasing at hundreds of clinics, pharmacies, mobile sites and pods, they remain in limited supply. Remember, vaccines are still being given to millions of healthcare workers, seniors, frontline workers and teachers, who have priority in the initial phases of the rollout. In Los Angeles County alone, for example, 2 million people with underlying conditions will become eligible next week, officials said Friday. The sheer demand sprung concerns about the extent to which people would be properly screened, and whether people would jump the line under the guise of having a medical condition. For those receiving a vaccine under this qualification, county officials said they were encouraging documentation of a condition but it was not required. Instead, the minimum threshold was that the resident attest to being at high risk, or having a disability that puts them at risk.“We certainly hope people won’t try to take advantage of the situation,’ said L. A. County Department of Public Health Chief Science Officer Dr. Paul Simon. “We don’t feel like it’s realistic for our staff at the community sites to screen people. We don’t have the medical expertise or the knowledge of the person’s medical history to make that determination. That’s why we’re really urging people to go their provider.”In essence, officials are leaning on people’s honesty to make it work.“The reasoning behind self-attestation is that, as you can imagine, it’s going to be really hard to prove or verify individuals having certain kinds of comorbidities,” Orange County Health Care Agency Deputy Director of Public Health Services Margaret Bredehoft said. You can’t tell someone has diabetes by looking at them, and physicians’ orders and prescriptions come in all kinds of formats, she said, noting there are also privacy concerns with asking people to share their medical records. Some county sites will continue to check IDs to verify a person’s age, residency or workplace and that they have an appointment. Relying on people’s honesty could allow some to jump the line, and “that’d be my concern,” Regional Center of Orange County Executive Director Larry Landauer said. The center coordinates services for OC residents with developmental disabilities.“There’s people that absolutely need priority, and they should have something from their doctor.”Landauer said his and other regional centers are working to get a letter approved by the state Department of Public Health that they can distribute to clients showing they’re eligible for vaccination in the phase that opens Monday. People between 16 and 64 are eligible if they have one of these conditions:State criteria also lays out that a person can be eligible as a result of a developmental or other “significant, high-risk disability,” one or more of the following criteria applies:State officials say this group would include all enrolled users of regional centers, independent living centers; in-home supportive services; community-based adult services and adult day health centers; Medi-Cal HIV/AIDS waivers; Medi-Cal home and community-based alternatives waiver programs; Medi-Cal Assisted Living waiver programs; all-inclusive care for the elderly programs; California Children’s Services program (if the child is 16-21 years old); and the California Genetically Handicapped Persons Program. No. Under state guidance, confidentiality is protected, so there is no documentation required of a diagnosis or type of disability. But under the state’s guidance, expect to be asked to sign a “self-attestation” that you meet the criteria. Riverside County spokeswoman Brooke Federico said adults who show up for a vaccine appointment next week will be shown a screening sheet with a list of various illnesses and asked if they fall into one of those categories.“If the resident answers in the affirmative, they will be vaccinated,” she said via email. “No note from their doctor or copy of medical records are required.”Residents should make sure they are eligible before scheduling an appointment, Federico added.“It’s possible appointments will be filled quickly,” she said, adding that more appointments are opened each week as the county receives more vaccine doses. County Public health officials recommend checking with your health provider first. While supplies are limited, some health systems and their affiliated clinics are vaccinating — and they may have appointments available. For instance, in San Bernardino County, officials were asking residents to first ask their health care providers about vaccinations, county spokesman David Wert said via email. If you don’t have a provider, or your provider doesn’t offer vaccinations, you can make an appointment through the county’s vaccination website or hotline, Wert said.“If they make an appointment at a public vaccination clinic or pharmacy, we are asking them to bring a form of verification of their high-risk medical condition or disability, which mirrors the guidance from the state,” Wert added. Don’t be surprised if your provider reaches out to you first. For example, Kaiser Permanente’s supply continues to increase.“We will use this increased supply to significantly increase the number of our members we are able to vaccinate,” according to a statement from the giant provider. “Kaiser Permanente has already begun reaching out to our newly eligible members with underlying conditions, starting with those with the highest risk.”Beyond a health provider, here’s how to get an appointment if you’re newly eligible:Counties across California are expanding ways to get vaccine to neighborhoods where they are needed most. Mobile unit teams are expanding. For options, state officials recommend checking with your health care provider, local public health department, or your local pharmacy. According to state officials, if you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan’s member services to request help for transportation to received covered benefits. If you get Medi-Cal through Fee-for-Service (FFS), you can access a list of Non-Medical Transportation providers in your county of residence, and you can contact them directly to arrange a trip to your appointment. Counties are honoring appointments made by people who live or work in those counties. At the moment, it’s not likely. On Friday, Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state’s Health and Human Services Agency secretary, said the list of conditions from the state was modified from the Centers for Disease Control, which had included smoking. But smokers did not make it to the state’s list.

We worked hard with a number of individuals with some representation from counties to get the list narrowed so we feel like we are focusing on the most vulnerable first.

296,The Animal Legal Defense Fund Is Busting Its Union With a Smile,-6.67,45.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/animal-legal-defense-fund-busting-union-labor,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-01-13,25,"TheAnimal Legal Defense Fund(ALDF) is a major nonprofit that boasts of its more than40years of​“tireless pursuit ofjusticefor animals.” When it comes to the pursuit of justice for working humans, however, its own employees say that it is badly failing the test. In mid-December, ALDF’s employees told the organization’s management that they intended to unionize with theNonprofit Professional Employees Union, a division of theIFPTE. They presented signed union cards representing a​“super majority” of the54-person staff, and asked for the ALDF to voluntarily recognize their union. Such voluntary recognition has become standard in the nonprofit world — the NPEU says that of the35nonprofits it’s organized, only two have refused to recognize their unions. One of those two is the ALDF. According to employees and the NPEU, the ALDF responded to the news of the union drive by hiring the anti-union law firmOgletree Deakinsand embarking on a union-busting campaign that is now in full swing. That campaign has centered on an ongoing series of​“captive audience meetings” in which managers gather employees in small groups to try to persuade them not to unionize, a tactic common among corporations intent on intimidating and misleading workers who seek to organize. An ALDF employee who supports the union, and who asked not to be identified due to fear of retaliation at work, said that the union drive came about because of the sort of disillusionment common in the nonprofit world, where people find that what they had seen as a​“dream job” actually is nothing of the sort. After the killing of George Floyd, the staff’s dissatisfaction with what they saw as the organization’s​“lukewarm, half-ass” response — as well as a perception of unfair pay rates, and inequitable treatment by managers — led directly to the desire to unionize in order to have a stronger voice in the workplace.​“The people who control most of these [animal rights] organizations are largely white, and largely wealthy,” and uninterested in scrutinizing the flaws of ALDF itself, the employee said.​“This is a huge problem for us. We’re a legal organization, so justice is paramount among our concerns… They think of us as being expendable because we have such coveted jobs.”The ALDF did not respond to a request for comment from its management. The organizing drive gathered steam through the summer, working in tandem with the NPEU, which has led anexplosion of organizing among nonprofitsover the past two years. The employee says that it became clear that management knew about the drive by late October, so the unit made sure to present a large majority of signed union cards in December to make it​“unambiguous that this is what people want.” Nevertheless, just before Christmas, management called a meeting and told everyone they would not be recognizing the union. Employees are upset that ALDF chose to hire Ogletree Deakins, thesameanti-union firm that the ACLU of Kansas hired last year to fight its own employee organizing drive — particularly because the firm works with clients in industrial agriculture, which employees see as being antithetical to ALDF’s mission. Though firms like Ogletree Deakins typically work to ensure that the employer’s anti-union campaign is as scary as possible while still following the letter of the law, they are not immune from comedy; ALDF employees found out about the firm’s involvement when a manager accidentally CC’d staffers on an email with an Ogletree attorney discussing details of an anti-union meeting.“Anything short of recognizing your staff union in this political environment is union busting,” says Kayla Blado, the president of NPEU.​“Management there doesn’t want to cede power to workers. They are using pretty infamous union busting tactics, the same things you see at big companies.” Blado says that the ALDF is not only forcing its employees to file for an NLRB election in order to certify their union — a process which will likely take months — it is also trying to challenge the size of the union, arguing to the NLRB that the number of eligible employees should be cut by a full two-thirds, which Blado calls​“insulting.”Employees at ALDF shared withnotes that they took during three separate captive audience meetings with different managers. They paint a picture of a nonprofit using a standard anti-union playbook that would not be out of place at Walmart or an Amazon warehouse: a mix of encouraging comments about how management values employees’ opinions and that a union is not necessary to communicate with them directly, along with fearmongering statements painting the union as a predatory outside entity that is only out for dues money. Managers alternate between insisting that they want employees to speak up and change the organization from within, disparaging the NPEU, and warning that forcing the ALDF into bargaining with the union does not mean that employees will actually make any gains. One meeting even features the highest form of the anti-union meeting genre — the assurances that the people delivering the anti-union message are, in fact, strong believers in unions. At one point, a manager describes the ALDF’s outside attorney as​“a really liberal blue guy,” adding,​“He’s a management-side attorney, no doubt about it, but he’s just not a union-buster.” At another point, ALDF executive directorStephen Wells, who is leading the group’s decision to fight against the union, is described as​“a really pro-union guy.”“It’s not like he’s an anti-union person,” the speaker says of Wells.​“He’s really liberal, he’s really progressive.”Depending on how long it takes to settle legal arguments at the NLRB and schedule a final vote, workers could be in for another two months or more of these sorts of meetings. Still, the ALDF employee says that the union-busting has not changed any minds, and is confident that the union will win.​“It’s making people madder and more dedicated,” the employee says.​“This is an act of love for this organization.”I hope you found this article important.

It’s a quick and cheap solution to help people chewed up by unfettered rapacious capitalism, a societal money laundering machine that spits out millions of humans after stealing their savings, their energy, and their youth. So, just like a good capitalist town, upon realizing what Seivwright was up to, the City of Torontoissued a warning letterto the carpenter to stop building shelters for unhoused people. (Well, if all those poor people get homes, then how will the rest of us know we’re better than them? I suppose we’ll still have our wrist watches, but you can’t tell the brand from very far away.)Point being, Khaleel Seivwright is a hero, as are so many unheralded activists across this land trying to help those torn up by our system.

TheSunreports: Survivors of cardiac arrest were aware of what was going on around them while they were ‘dead’ before being ‘brought back to life’, the study revealed. More surprising still, there is evidence to suggest the deceased may even hear themselves being pronounced dead by doctors. Dr. Sam Parnia is studying consciousness after death and examining cardiac arrest cases in Europe and the US. The assistant professor of Medicine at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine says people in the first phase of death may still experience some form of consciousness. The expert ventured that people who have survived cardiac arrest later accurately described what was happening around them after their hearts stopped beating. He said: “They’ll describe watching doctors and nurses working, they’ll describe having awareness of full conversations, of visual things that were going on, that would otherwise not be known to them.”Explaining when a patient is officially declared dead, he said: “It’s all based on the moment when the heart stops.“Technically speaking, that’s how you get the time of death.”His study is examining what happens to the brain after a person goes into cardiac arrest – and whether consciousness continues after death and for how long – to improve the quality of resuscitation and prevent brain injuries while restarting the heart.

So when leaders explain their decision on whether to send kids back to school by saying they’re “following the science,” citizens could be forgiven for asking what science they’re referring to exactly – and how sure they are that it’s right. But it’s become difficult to ask such questions amid the highly polarized debate around pandemic policies. While areas of consensus have emerged since the pandemic first hit the United States in March, significant gaps remain. Those uncertainties have opened the door for contrarians to gain traction in popular thought. Some Americans see them as playing a crucial role, challenging a fear-driven groupthink that is inhibiting scientific inquiry, driving unconstitutional restrictions on individual freedom and enterprise, and failing to grapple with the full societal cost of shutting down businesses, churches, and schools. Public health experts who see shutdowns as crucial to saving lives are critical of such actors, due in part to fears that they are abetting right-wing resistance to government restrictions. They have also voiced criticism that some contrarians appear driven by profit or political motives more than genuine concern about public health. The deluge of studies and competing interpretations have left citizens in a tough spot, especially when data or conclusions are shared on Twitter or TV without full context – like a handful of puzzle pieces thrown in your face, absent any box top picture to help you fit them together.“You can’t expect the public to go through all the science, so you rely on people of authority, someone whom you trust, to parse that for you,” says Aleszu Bajak, a science and data journalist who teaches at Northeastern University in Boston. “But now you have more than just the scientists in their ivory tower throwing out all of this information. You have competing pundits, with different incentives, drawing on different science of varying quality.”The uncertainties have also posed a challenge for policymakers, who haven’t had the luxury of waiting for the full arc of scientific inquiry to be completed.“The fact is, science, like everything else, is uncertain – particularly when it comes to predictions,” says John Holdren, who served as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for the duration of President Barack Obama’s eight-year tenure. “I think seasoned, experienced decision-makers understand that. They understand that there will be uncertainties, even in the scientific inputs to their decision-making process, and they have to take those into account and they have to seek approaches that are resilient to uncertain outcomes.”Some say that in an effort to reassure citizens that shutdowns were implemented based on scientific input, policymakers weren’t transparent enough about the underlying uncertainties.“We’ve heard constantly that politicians are following the science. That’s good, of course, but ... especially at the beginning, science is tentative, it changes, it’s evolving fast, it’s uncertain,” Prof. Sir Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute in London, recently told a British Parliament committee. One of the founding partners of his independent institute is Imperial College, whose researchers’ conclusions were a leading driver of U. S. and British government shutdowns.“You can’t just have a single top line saying we’re following science,” he adds. “It has to be more dealing with what we know about the science and what we don’t.”One scientist who talks a lot about unknowns is John Ioannidis, a highly cited professor of medicine, epidemiology, and population health at Stanford University in California. Dr. Ioannidis, who has made a career out of poking holes in his colleagues’ research, agrees that masks and social distancing are effective but says there are open questions about how best to implement them. He has also persistently questioned just how deadly COVID-19 is and to what extent shutdowns are affecting mental health, household transmission to older family members, and the well-being of those with non-COVID-19-relatedconditions. It’s very difficult, he says, to do randomized trials for things like how to reopen, and different countries and U. S. states have done things in different ways.“For each one of these decisions, action plans – people said we’re using the best science,” he says. “But how can it be that they’re all using the best science when they’re so different?”Many scientists say they and their colleagues have been open about the uncertainties,despite a highly polarized debate around the pandemic and the 2020 election season ramping up.“One of the remarkable things about this pandemic is the extent to which many people in the scientific community are explicit about what’s uncertain,” says Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health who is working on a study about how biases can affect COVID-19 research. “There has been a sort of hard core of scientists, even with different policy predispositions, who have been insistent on that.”“In some ways the politicized nature has made people more aware of the uncertainties,” adds Professor Lipsitch, who says Twitter skeptics push him and his colleagues to strengthen their arguments. “That’s a good voice to have in the back of your head.”For the Harvard doctor, Alex Berenson is not that voice. But a growing number of frustrated Americans have gravitated toward the former New York Times reporter's brash, unapologetic challenging of prevailing narratives. His following on Twitter has grown from around 10,000 to more than 182,000 and counting. Mr. Berenson, who investigated big business before leaving The New York Times in 2010 to write spy novels, dives into government data, quotes from scientific studies, and takes to Twitter daily to rail against what he sees as a dangerous overreaction driven by irrational fear and abetted by a liberal media agenda and corporate interests – particularly tech companies,whose earnings have soaredduring the shutdowns. He refers satirically to those advocating government restrictions as “Team Apocalypse.”Dr. Lipsitch says that while public health experts pushing for lockdown like himself could be considered hawks while contrarians like Mr. Berenson could be considered doves, his “name-calling” doesn’t take into account the fact that most scientists have at least a degree of nuance. “It’s really sort of unsophisticated to say there are two camps, but it serves some people’s interest to demonize the other side,” he says. Mr. Berenson, the author of a controversial 2019 book arguing that marijuana increases the risk of mental illness and violence, has been accused of cherry-picking data and conflating correlation and causation. Amazon initially blocked publication of his booklet “Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 1” until Elon Musk got wind of it and called out the tech giant on Twitter. Mr. Berenson prevailed and recently released Part 2 on the platform, which has already become Amazon’s No. 1 best-seller among history of science and medicine e-books. He strives to broaden the public's contextual understanding of fatality rates, emphasizing that the vast majority of deaths occur among the elderly; in Italy, for instance, themedian ageof people who died is 81. He calls into question the reliability of COVID-19 death tolls, which according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can be categorized as such even without a positive test if the disease is assumed to have caused or even contributed to a death. Earlier this spring, when a prominent model was forecasting overwhelmed hospitals in New York, he pointed out that their projection was quadruple that of the actual need.“Nobody had the guts or brains to ask – why is your model off by a factor of four today, and you made it last week?” says Mr. Berenson, referring to the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projection in early April and expressing disappointment that his former colleagues in the media are not taking a harder look at such questions. “I think unfortunately people have been blinded by ideology.”Amid a sense of urgency, fear, and frustration with Americans who refuse to fall in line with government restrictions as readily as their European or especially Asian counterparts, Mr. Berenson and Dr. Ioannidis have faced blowback for airing questions about those restrictions and the science behind them. Mr. Berenson’s book installments have prompted criticism that he’s looking for profits at the expense of public health, which he has denied. Dr. Ioannidis’ involvement in an April antibodies study in Santa Clara, California, which purported to show that COVID-19 is much less deadly than was widely believed was discredited by other scientists due to questions about the accuracy of the test used and a BuzzFeed report that it was partially funded by JetBlue Airways’ cofounder. Dr. Ioannidis says those questions were fully addressed within two weeks in a revised version that showed with far more extensive data that the test was accurate, and adds he had been unaware of the $5,000 donation, which came through the Stanford development office and was anonymized. The dismay grew when BuzzFeed News reported in July that a month before the Santa Clara study, he had offered to convene a small group of world-renowned scientists to meet with President Donald Trump and help him solve the pandemic “by intensifying efforts to understand the denominator of infected people (much larger than what is documented to-date)” and developing a more targeted, data-driven approach than long-term shutdowns, which he said would “jeopardiz[e] so many lives,” according toemails obtained by BuzzFeed. While the right has seized on Dr. Ioannidis’ views and some scientists say it’s hard not to conclude that his work is driven by a political agenda, the Greek doctor maintains that partisanship is antithetical to the scientific method, which requires healthy skepticism, among other things.“Even the word ‘science’ has been politicized. It’s very sad,” he says, observing that in the current environment, scientific conclusions are used to shame, smear, and “cancel” the opposite view. “I think it’s very unfortunate to use science as a silencer of dissent.”The average citizen, he adds, is filtering COVID-19 debates through their belief systems, media sources, and political ideology, which can leave science at a disadvantage in the public square. “Science hasn’t been trained to deal with these kinds of powerful companions that are far more vocal and better armed to penetrate into social discourse,” says Dr. Ioannidis. The polarization has been fueled in part by absolutist pundits. In a recent week, “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC daily hammered home the rising rate in cases, trumpeted the daily death toll, and quoted Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, while “The Tucker Carlson Show” on Fox News did not once mention government data, featuring instead anecdotes from business owners who have been affected by the shutdowns and calling into question the authority of unelected figures such as Dr. Fauci. Fed on different media diets, it’s not surprising that partisan views on the severity of the pandemic have diverged further in recent months, with 85% of Democrats seeing it as a major threat – nearly double the percent of Republicans, according toa Pew Research poll from mid-July. And in a related division that predates the pandemic, anotherPew pollfrom February showed that Republicans are less likely to support scientists taking an active role in social policy matters – just 43% compared with 73% for Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.“If you have more of a populist type of worldview, where you are concerned that elites and scientists and officials act in their own interests first, it becomes very easy to make assumptions that they are doing something to control the population,” says Prof. Asheley Landrum, a psychologist at Texas Tech University who specializes in science communication. Determining what exactly “the science” says is only one part of the equation; figuring out precisely how to “follow” it poses another set of challenges for policymakers on questions like whether to send students back to school.“Even if you had all the science pinned down, there are still some tough value judgments about the dangers of multiplying the pandemic or the dangers of keeping kids at home,” says Dr. Holdren, President Obama’s science adviser, an engineer and physicist who now co-directs the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard Kennedy School. Dr. Lipsitch echoes that point and offers an example of two schools that both have a 10% risk of an outbreak. In one, where there are older students from high-income families who are more capable of learning remotely, leaders may decide that the 10% risk isn’t worth reopening. But in another school with the same assessed risk, where the students are younger and many depend on free and reduced lunch, a district may decide the risk is a trade-off they’re willing to make in support of the students’ education and well-being. Lipsitch. “It’s incumbent on responsible leaders to use science to do the reasoning about how to do the best thing given your values, but it’s not an answer.”Editor’s note:As a public service, we have removed our paywall forall pandemic-related stories.",3,Reliable,0.091659776505748,0.4347745224759443,3131,3,Christian Science Monitor
300,University of Florida hit with racial discrimination complaint for promoting no-whites event,2.33,42.67,https://www.thecollegefix.com/university-of-florida-hit-with-racial-discrimination-complaint-for-promoting-no-whites-event/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,23,"Just hours after our report about ano-whites academic eventat the University of Florida, a professor filed a civil rights complaint against the taxpayer-funded institution. University of Michigan-Flint economist Mark Perry, who regularly files Title IX and Title VI complaints against sex- and race-restrictive programs at schools and colleges, asked the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to open an investigation. Though the Nov. 19 virtual event was hosted by graduate students in the Anthropology Department, the department itself promoted the event at least twice: in an email to the Anthropology 2301 class and by retweetingan organizer’s tweetabout the event. The email, obtained by theYoung America’s Foundation, conveys a message from the organizers that the event is “only for those who identify” as “BIPOC” (black, indigenous and people of color) students. This is so BIPOC students don’t have to “perform any emotional or mental labor to explain their experiences” to white students. Doctoral student Isis Dwyer’sNov. 18 tweetsuggested the “town hall” was endorsed by the department itself, as she included its Twitter handle and tagged the account as well. She marked her Twitter account private after our report was published, so it’s not clear whether the department previously undid its retweet or whether the retweet disappeared due to Dwyer’s action. The retweet was still on the department’s pagethe last week of December– more than a month after the no-whites event. Perry’s complaint, which he shared withand which cites our reporting, claims the department “has since removed that Tweet,” a screenshot of which he preserved (left). Asked for evidence that the department intentionally undid its retweet, Perry toldWednesday morning that the retweet was still live when he started writing the regulatory complaint Tuesday night.“When I checked right before sending the complaint [at 9:30 p.m. Eastern], the re-Tweet was gone, so I assumed it was removed by UF Anthropology,” he wrote in an email, but also credited the possibility that Dwyer’s action automatically undid the retweet. He was simply trying to emphasize the department’s role in “endorsing, promoting and publicizing the discriminatory event,” Perry said: “I think the [Office for Civil Rights] is sometimes more likely to excuse student clubs/groups for Title VI/IX violations (e.g., a Women’s Student Business Club or Black Student Accountant Club) than cases when the university through its departments, faculty, administrators, etc. are violating civil rights laws.”The university must enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act as a recipient of federal funding, Perry told the feds. Yet its Anthropology Department and grad students “are endorsing, supporting, promoting, and hosting […] no whites allowed town hall events and meetings that violate Title VI’s prohibition of discrimination based on race, color, and national origin,” the complaint reads. He also noted that Dwyer’s tweet specified that “BIPOC General Body meetings” would start in the spring, again showing the “discriminatory” nature of the planned gatherings. The University of Florida provideda statement Wednesday morning:The University and College of Liberal Arts and Sciences administration recently learned of an event in the Department of Anthropology that may not have been open to students of all races and colors. Such an event is inconsistent with the University’s policies and values that foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment. The University is reviewing the circumstances surrounding the event and will take appropriate action. Perry’s complaints often prompt targeted educational institutions to open their programs to whites or men or simply cancel the programs altogether.

301,Donald Trump is testing your gullibility,-20.83,27.83,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/gullibility-donald-trump-is-testing-your/31048/,https://adfontesmedia.com/palmer-report-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,25,"Palmer Report warned you that as Donald Trump fell more hopelessly behind in the election, he would start making empty threats about canceling the election, or refusing to leave office if he loses. These aren’t things that Trump can actually do; they’re laughably ludicrous. But Trump was always going to test your gullibility, to see if he could get you to fall for these kinds of empty threats. Sure enough, this morning Trump tweeted “Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” If you’re scared by this tweet, you just failed the gullibility test. The President of the United States can’t move the election; the Constitution gives that power solely to Congress, and we all know Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t going to postpone or cancel the election. Trump can no more postpone the election than I can flap my arms and turn into a bird. Nothing works that way. No matter how much Trump might wish he could postpone the election, no matter how loudly he might hint that he’s going to postpone the election, and no matter how many or few pundits decide to try to milk such a narrative for ratings, it’s still not a real thing. So why is he even talking about it?Donald Trump is the world’s worst dealmaker, but he’s still a dealmaker. If he can con enough of you into believing that he can magically postpone the election, then you’ll give him something in return (a legislative victory, for instance) for him agreeing not to postpone the election. Similarly, if Trump can fool enough of you into believing that he can just magically stay in office after he loses, then you’ll give him something in return (immunity from federal prosecution for his crimes, for instance) in exchange for leaving office peacefully. Trump is trying to play you for a sucker. He’s hoping that after nearly four years of this nightmare, you’re so worn down that you won’t think things through clearly. He’s done so many other horrible things, the thinking goes, that perhaps he’ll do this too. Except he literallycan’tpostpone the election. It’ll take place on November 3rd, with or without his participation or approval. And he literally can’t refuse to leave office after January 20th; Joe Biden would be sworn in anyway, and Trump would be dragged out for trespassing. Some media pundits are already lining up to try to scare you into staying tuned in to their TV shows and Twitter feeds by pushing the notion perhaps Donald Trump really can magically postpone the election. They’ll insist that if you brush off this imaginary threat, it means you’re not being vigilant enough. They’re full of crap. Vigilance is when you still continue to work hard on things like voter registration and turnout, even when your candidate is ten points ahead. What these pundits are pushing is gullibility – and Trump is more than happy to take advantage of it by making these kinds of false threats and trying to con his way into getting something in return. Should you be outraged that Trump is threatening to postpone the election? Of course. Should you treat it like it’s something he can actually do? Of course not. Don’t fall for his con. Like everything else involving Trump, it’s a sucker’s bet.

302,"If Mumia Abu-Jamal’s Case Is a ‘Non-Issue,’ Why Have Media Gone to Such Lengths to Silence Him?",-18.33,33.67,https://fair.org/home/if-mumia-abu-jamals-case-is-a-non-issue-why-have-media-gone-to-such-lengths-to-silence-him/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-01,25,"Philadelphia public broadcasterWHYY(4/24/21) was one of the few outlets to report on an April 24 rally seeking the release from prison ofMumia Abu-Jamal. The story included important information on Abu-Jamal, who is serving a life sentence for the 1981 killing of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. It noted that the case has “drawn scrutiny” over claims of police, prosecutorial and judicial bias and misconduct. It cited new evidence released as part of the appeal process, including a note from a key prosecution witness asking the prosecuting attorney for money—the sort of evidence that Johanna Fernandez, a history professor and part of Abu-Jamal’s legal team, notes has in other instances led to a defendant either being set free or getting an immediate new trial. Along with Fernandez, the piece includes the voices of Abu-Jamal’s brother Keith Cook, and MOVE member Pam Africa, as well as people who traveled from around the country to call attention to Abu-Jamal’s case, his current state of health—he has a number of debilitating conditions, and has just had heart surgery—and to put his story in a context of political prisoners here and around the world. I confess I was still irked byWHYYusing its lead paragraph to frame the story like this:The case has pitted Abu-Jamal’s supporters, including a long list of national and international celebrities who say he was framed, against police and their supporters, who resent the attention given to a man convicted of murdering a fellow officer. It bugs me, because those were the themes decades ago when Abu-Jamal was first convicted and sentenced to death (Voices With Vision,4/27/21). That he was a “cause celebre”—and therefore, wink wink, something something about liberal Hollywood, no need to pay attention—and that the upset of anyone concerned about his deeply flawed trial or his inappropriate sentencing was merely theatrical, because, after all, he was “convicted,” wasn’t he?Elite media at the time were open to straight-up lies: A 1995Washington Poststory (5/18/95) led with a macabre account from Faulkner’s widow, Maureen Faulkner, about how when her husband’s bloody shirt was held up in court, Abu-Jamal turned around and smiled at her. Except attorney Leonard Weinglass and the court record show that Abu-Jamal wasn’t in court when the shirt was displayed (Extra! Update,8/95). ABC‘s investigative news show20/20(12/9/98) employed a number of techniques for their big 1998 piece—stating prosecution claims as fact, even when they were disputed by some of the prosecution’s own witnesses or the forensic record; stressing how a defense witness admitted being intoxicated, while omitting that prosecution witnesses said the same (Extra! Update,2/99). At one point, actor and activist Ed Asner is quoted saying, “No ballistic tests were done, which is pretty stupid”—but then host Sam Donaldson’s voiceover cuts him off: “But ballistics testdone,” he says, referring to tests that suggested that the bullet that killed Faulkner might have been the same caliber as Abu-Jamal’s gun. But he didn’t note that tests hadnotbeen done to determine whether that gun had fired the bullet, or whether it had been fired at all, or if there were gunpowder residues on Abu-Jamal’s hands. Producers fromPeople’s Video Networktold FAIR at the time (Extra! Update,2/99) thatABCnot only used clips they’d recorded from Abu-Jamal without permission, but they added layers of echo, making him sound, they said, “like a cave-dwelling animal.”No one was too surprised when it was revealed that in a letter asking permission from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to interview Abu-Jamal (a request that was denied),20/20pointed out that “we are currently working in conjunction with Maureen Faulkner and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police” (Extra! Update,2/99). After that, the main story has been non-coverage. For instance, in 2006, when Abu-Jamal won the right to appeal on three grounds—including a jury purged of Black people, the prosecutor lowering jurors’ sense of responsibility by saying their decision “would not be final,” and the fact that judge Albert Sabo was all kinds of biased—thePhiladelphia Daily Newstold reporter Dave Lindorff that it was a “non-issue” (Extra!,3–4/06)—although when a judge overturned the death sentence in 2001, the paper (12/19/01) found time to editorialize: “Let Mumia Rot in Darkness.”The late great media critic Ed Herman (Extra!,9–10/00) reported how thePhiladelphia Inquirerwouldn’t cover rallies and tribunals in support of Abu-Jamal, calling them “stunts,” but when the Fraternal Order of Police bought a full-page ad in the New York Times, that merited a story. In 2000, when Amnesty International declared that the original trial was “deeply flawed,” theInky(2/18/00) made it the fifth “news brief” on page 2B. But if Mumia Abu Jamal’s case is a non-issue that only celebrities care about, why the active silencing?In 1994,NPRcancelled plans for a series of commentaries from Abu-Jamal—who is, after all, a journalist, a former head of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists—after Senator Bob Dole threatened their funding. They said it was because it was a “highly polarized and political controversy”—which they proceeded to say nothing about for the following year (Extra!,11–12/95). WhenDemocracy Now!prepared to air commentaries, stationKRTI, out of Philadelphia’s Temple University, cancelled the show and all ofPacificanews (Extra! Update,4/97), with a station VP explaining: “What’s good enough forNPRis good enough for me.”And when a Vermont college aired a taped commencement address from Abu-Jamal, it led Philadelphia lawmakers to throw together something called the Revictimization Relief Act, allowing crime victims or prosecutors to sue inmates whose behavior behind bars “creates mental anguish” for the victims. Clearly unconstitutional, violating both free speech and due process rights, it was dubbed the Silencing Act by many, who noted that it didn’t just curtail prisoners’ right to speak, but journalists’ and all of our rights to hear them (FAIR.org,10/22/14). Media’s response was a shrug: The New York Timesran anAPpiece (10/21/14) with the headline “Pennsylvania: Gov Signs Law to Help Protect Crime Victims.”Elite media would have us believe they are engaged in a serious reckoning with the racism of the US criminal justice system, that they care about over-incarceration and prison conditions. And keeping people behind bars just because powerful people want them there, and not due to the merits of their case? Well, that’s what Other Countries do. If only there were a case, 40 years’ worth of case, that would allow them to explore those ideals—if not to do justice by Mumia Abu-Jamal (they can’t return what’s been taken from him), then to do some semblance of justice by their own claims of concern.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0578707764097374,0.4715966717265419,1642,2,FAIR
303,Daily coronavirus updates: Connecticut formally expands next phase of COVID-19 vaccinations; state reports lowest single-day positivity rate in months,0.0,48.33,https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-daily-updates-0114-20210114-5ko2nbzkbrezvbipmpq2vqbwmi-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/hartford-courant-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,20,"Connecticut’s next phase of vaccinations has officially expanded to include all residents who are 65 years and older, as well as residents with at least one high-risk health condition, but a vaccine shortage means it could be months before this large group is inoculated. Gov. Ned Lamont on Thursday formally approved the Phase 1B expansion, whichhad been recommendedby a state subcommittee earlier in the week.“It will probably take a few weeks before all the people in Phase 1A get their second dose,” Lamont said, “but that doesn’t mean we’re not beginning to do people in 1B, really focused right now on folks 75 and above.”With the expansion, the state has added about 715,000 people to the phase, for a total of more than 1.3 million, according to state estimates. (Previous state estimates placed the number at more than 1.5 million.)The newly expanded phase, which began this week with residents 75 and older eligible to sign up for vaccination, now includes:All residents aged 65 and older. Residents aged 16 to 64 who have at least one high-risk co-morbid condition (including cancer and Down syndrome). Frontline essential workers (including teachers and grocery store workers). Residents of congregate settings (including group homes and prisons). Because of the size of the phase, the state is rolling out eligibility in waves — meaning not everyone in Phase 1B will be vaccinated at once.“This allocation strategy is limited by the number of doses we have available,” said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of public health. “We’re hoping for more vaccine as new [vaccines] get approved and as the existing manufacturers are able to ramp up production, but we can only give out as many vaccines as we have doses.”The state’s 277,000 residents who are aged 75 and older are first in line, and the state has already opened up vaccination appointments to that group. However, Connecticut officials have not said which group might become eligible next, or given any timeline for the full rollout of Phase 1B.“Our message to the public today is please be patient,” Gifford said. “It will take time for us to get to the other members of Phase 1B.”Lamont noted that “demand is far outstripping supply.” The state has received 46,000 vaccine doses a week from the federal government, though Lamont said Thursday they were expecting an extra 50,000 next week as a one-time reward for successful vaccine administration. Phase 1B marks the beginning of the widespread vaccination in Connecticut. Previously, only a narrow subset of the population — health care workers, medical first responders and nursing home residents — were eligible for inoculation. Gifford said the full vaccination process will take months but that state hopes to have most residents vaccinated by the fall. Also on Thursday, the state opened its centralized vaccination registration website to residents who are 75 and older. Eligible residents can now make a vaccination appointment through the website, which can be found atportal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19–Vaccination-75-and-older. They can also call (877) 918-2224 to set an appointment. Appointments are currently available only to residents who are 75 and older. Appointments are required at vaccination sites across the state.“Don’t just show up. That doesn’t work,” Lamont said. “You need to get registered, and you need to make an appointment.”Connecticut has so far administered more than 170,000 vaccine doses, with about 5% of the state’s population having received at least one shot and about 16,000 residents having received both of their required doses. The state ranks fifth nationally in the share of its population to receive at least one dose. State reports lower-than-usual positivity rateLamont on Thursday reported 968 new COVID-19 cases out of 22,171 tests, for a positivity rate of 4.4% — lowest in a single day since late November. That lower-than-usual figure came just days after Connecticut reported its highest single-day positivity rate since May. The state’s seven-day average currently stands at 7%, down slightly from recent days but still near its peak level.“The numbers are bouncing around a little bit,” Lamont said. “What we know is that outside is safer than inside and there’s nothing more important than wearing a mask.”Connecticut currently has 1,118 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, down 30 from Wednesday. Hospitalizations have remained mostly flat for about a month now, since peaking in mid-December. Additionally, Lamont reported 17 new coronavirus-linked deaths Thursday, following 87 on Wednesday. The state has now recorded 6,553 COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic, including 264 over the past week. The United States has now seen more than 23 million COVID-19 cases and 386,996 deaths, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University. High-capacity vaccine sites coming to Rentschler Field, other sitesIn addition to an existing vaccine site at the Connecticut Convention Center, state officials announced Thursday that the state will organize two additional high-capacity sites: one at Rentschler Field and one in Shelton. Josh Geballe, the state’s chief operating officer, said the sites are taking only a small number of patients currently but that they help ensure the state’s preparedness for future phases of vaccine rollout.“We’re limited for the foreseeable doses by the number of doses that we get in,” Geballe said. “What we’re doing is setting up these mass sites in anticipation [of more doses becoming available].”Emily Brindley can be reached atebrindley@courant.com.",3,Reliable,0.0762064639905549,0.3953973583234946,1287,3,Hartford Courant

305,Covering the Atlanta massacre from inside the Korean community,-7.0,42.0,https://www.cjr.org/local_news/atlanta-shooting-local-korean-news.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-23,18,"Read in Korean|한국어 번역 보기first heard about last Tuesday’s shootings in the same way as most others in Atlanta: after dusk fell, a breaking news alert appeared on his television screen. Little information was given about the shootings other than that they occurred at three massage spas, two of them off Piedmont Road. But Lee, president ofAtlanta K, a Korean-language local news outlet, read between the lines—Piedmont had a cluster of Asian spas. It was likely, he thought, that members of his community were among the dead. Atlanta’s Korean community knew that many of the spas in that area were run by their own. In his previous reporting on the businesses, Lee had pieced together a portrait of the people who worked there: they were largely older immigrant women preoccupied with surviving in an adopted country.“I knew how much these Korean women struggled, how hard they worked, how difficult a situation they were under,” Lee said in an interview, conducted in Korean, with CJR. “For them to meet such a senseless, tragic death.… More than anything, my heart hurt—my role as a reporter aside—as a person from the same immigrant society.”That evening, Lee started making calls. He got in touch with a source he knew from prior reporting who had a network of contacts within the spas, and his suspicions about the victims’ identities were confirmed. Overnight,Atlanta Kbroke the news that at least two of the slain women were ethnic Koreans—a number that eventually climbed to four. Korean-language local media outlets includingAtlanta K,theKorea Times Atlanta,andKorea Dailywere uniquely positioned to cover the shooting. Unencumbered by language barriers and culturally attuned to the tight-knit community, they quickly acquired details of the events and gave readers a nuanced picture of the victims. By Wednesday,Atlanta Khad reported that the four victims of Korean descent were in their fifties, sixties, and seventies. Of the four, only one woman provided massage services to customers. The other “old-time workers” performed secondary tasks: opening doors, keeping up the space, and providing food for colleagues. Some of the women lived, ate, and slept at the spa, and not all carried US citizenship. Subsequent coveragefromKorea Dailyrevealed they were mostly “subsistence workers,” some of whom didn’t have relatives in the US. Such details hinted at their shared isolation and insecurity. They were so close to one another that their children would call their mothers’ colleagues “aunties.”The Korean press also reported on important details about how the events unfolded. When shots were fired at Gold Spa, a Korean employee managed to hide behind adeskand alert other spa workers in the area, likely preempting further casualties. The victim at Aromatherapy Spa hadopened the doorfor the shooter, believing him to be a customer, when she was shot. TheKorea Times Atlantaciteda secondary source who relayed that a spa worker heard the shooter say he intended to “kill all Asians.”Meanwhile,coverage of the shooting by national media outlets remained vague; reporters seemed reluctant (or were unable) to find details about the victims or pick up reports from the Korean press. Instead, the mainstream press published profiles of the shooter. And when the Atlanta Sheriff’s Office held a press conference on Wednesday morning, the press raced to take down the official statement, whichuncritically echoed the suspect’s claims that he suffered from sexual addiction, and which minimized the role of racial animus in his motivation for the killing spree. Lee, who had worked the police beat in Korea earlier in his career, was in disbelief. “I’ve never before seen a case where the police suggest: ‘The suspect said it wasn’t the case, therefore it’s not the case,’ ” he says. Worse, the press replicated the official statement inheadlinesand presented it asbreaking news. In most news pieces, the spokesperson’s words were treated as self-explanatory, without additional context or questions. “It was almost as though the press believed what was said to be correct, like theywantedit to be the case,” Lee says. To Lee, the official statement was “clearly too absurd to repeat.” He felt no obligation to cover the press conference or to recite the spokesperson’s words. Instead,Atlanta Kran a story that recounted the community response to the official statement,titled: “ ‘Does a bad day mean you can kill someone?’: white police officers’ protection of a white murderer.”The press corrected course a day later, but already, public perception of the suspect’s racist and anti-Asian motives had been muddied. The shooter’s explanation for the murders—sex addiction—had been widely circulated, giving weight to long-standing associations between Asian-owned massage shops and illicit sex work. Investigationsinto the spas in the past weekcitedsuggestive customer reviews and a history of police raids (some of which had been undertaken wrongfully, Lee says), in effect imputing criminality to the women. The media should ask if it is meaningful to determine whether the victims had been offering sexual services, and whether such questions are worth stigmatizing the deceased women and risking harm to family members and other spa workers. This also means that survivors, who have long lived under the radar—fearful of losing their livelihoods and immigration statuses—feel discouraged from talking publicly. “Unless they have immense courage, it’s improbable for these women to want to put themselves out there,” Lee says. From the beginning, Lee had feared this sort of scrutiny. Reporters for national media outlets had asked him about criminal activity at the spas, to which he declined to respond. Why speculate on a question that lacks clear relevance to the story at hand? Already, the women have been unfairly immortalized in association with their place of work. The spas could never be a full reflection of who the women were; they were survival jobs—jobs the women might have worked tirelessly to retire from, had they been allowed to live out their lives.",3,Reliable,-0.0111075036075036,0.4595436507936508,1314,3,Columbia Journalism Review
306,Mom Faces Felony Charges For Taking a Drug Prescribed by Her Doctor While Pregnant,0.0,41.0,https://reason.com/2021/06/23/pregnant-mom-prescription-drug-charge-alabama/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,25,"Seven cops swarmed the home of an Alabama mom charged with the dastardly crime of taking a painkiller prescribed by her doctor while she was pregnant with her son—who, by the way, is perfectly fine and now 8 months old. In 2020, stay-at-home-mom Kim Blalock of Florence, Alabama, was pregnant with her sixth child. A year earlier, she'd had surgery for back problems resulting from a car accident. She also suffered from arthritis and a degenerative disc disease, and was prescribed hydrocodone to ease her chronic pain. Though she had stopped taking the drug when she learned she was expecting, the pain got worse as the pregnancy wore on—and she had five other kids to take care of. Six weeks before her son was due, she was in such agony that she went back to her orthopedist and he renewed her prescription. When her baby was born and tested for drugs, which seems to be routine, the results came back positive. The Department of Human Resources (DHR), the state's child services division, investigated and quickly closed the case,according to AL.com. But the cops and the district attorney? They smelled blood. Prosecutors couldn't charge Blalock with taking illegal drugs, because she had a prescription. They couldn't charge her with abusing the drugs, either. (Not for lack of trying, though: DHR had actually counted how many pills she had taken.) Nor could the authorities charge her with getting the legal drugs by illegal means, such as doctor shopping, or forgery. What they could and did charge her with was not informing her doctor that she was pregnant. They labeled this prescription fraud: a felony. This represents ""the literal policing of pregnancy,"" says Ellie Lee, Director of the Centre for Parenting Studies at the University of Kent in England, one of the rare schools with a department focused on parenting policy. Wisely, the Alabama state legislature had already passed a 2016 law to make sure moms taking drugs prescribed by doctors could not be prosecuted. But Blalock wasn't protected by that law, ostensibly because she might not have received the prescription had she informed the doctor of her pregnancy. Blalock visited the doctor in person, but was in her car, due to COVID-19 restrictions. Authorities asserted that her obstetrician would have weaned her off the opioid, but Blalock countered that she did indeed tell her ob-gyn. In either case, hydrocodone just isn't very dangerous. While babies exposed to the opioid in utero may have some withdrawal symptoms once born—including ""irritability, excess crying, poor feeding, and tremors,"" according to AL.com—those symptoms ""are not life-threatening.""Obviously, no one wants a baby to suffer. But no one should want a mother to suffer, either. And when a pregnant woman is in debilitating pain, there is no solution that promises perfection all around. Rather than recognizing that fact, police officers waited until two months after the baby was born and then ""swarmed Blalock's house while she and her husband were out of town."" Her two teenagers were at home and said at least seven armed officers entered, asking questions about her whereabouts. The teenagers were so rattled that they went to stay with their grandparents. A public information officer with the Florence Police Department declined to answer questions about the raid because the investigation remains open. Emma Roth, a lawyer with the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, is representing Blalock along with other attorneys. Roth has asked that the charges be dropped. Hanging in the balance is not just Blalock's fate but the fate of any woman who goes to the doctor and does not inform them that she's expecting. This reminds me of theCDC recommendingthat women who are pregnant or evencould bepregnant avoid all alcohol. That means basically no drinks from middle school to menopause. The federal government's impulse was the same as the Florence police department's: focusing so intensely on the fetus that the woman is barely an afterthought.""This is another leap forward in the long march toward erasing pregnant women as people,"" says Joan Wolfe, an associate professor of women's and gender studies at Texas A&M University, and author of""If I had known what I know now, I would rather lay in bed my entire pregnancy in pain than take a pill,"" Blalock said. ""I didn't think it was a big deal. My son is perfectly fine.""The fact that this prescription drug is not known to cause any lasting damage to a child means there is no reason to prohibit a mom in pain from taking it and feeling better.",3,Reliable,0.0594681508967223,0.4112451041022469,1019,2,Reason

In the same sector, agents saw a 900% increase in those being detained who tested positive for the coronavirus.“Even with the spread of the COVID-19 virus, human smugglers continue to try these brazen attempts with zero regard for the lives they endanger, nor to the health of the citizens of our great nation,” the RGV Border Patrol Sector said in a statement. On July 18, RGV Sector agents encountered 203 migrants who entered the U. S. illegally, walking north along a ranch road, it said in a statement. On July 17, agents encountered a group of 298 people walking north in a similar area; on July 16, they had encountered 235 people. Hastings shared photos of one encounter on Twitter, stating that a human smuggler fled the scene, leaving 11 people in a moving vehicle, which according to the picture Hastings posted, appears to be stuck in the bushes after having been driven off the road.“Human smugglers always have and always will place profit over human lives,” Hastings said. In June, Border Patrol apprehended 188,829 people who illegally crossed the southwest border, including more than 15,000 unaccompanied minors, over 55,000 family units, and over 117,000 single adults.

Sixty-one voted in opposition.""Taylor University is not budging, according to James Garringer, a spokesman for the university:“Since making the announcement of Vice President Mike Pence’s upcoming commencement speech, we have received feedback from people on either side of the issue. Taylor University is an intentional Christian community that strives to encourage positive, respectful and meaningful dialogue. We look forward to hosting the Vice President next month.”The university's refusal to rescind the invitation was praised by Kevin Holtsberry, a Taylor alumni. I was very nervous initially that the very vocal overwhelming minority might sort of sway Taylor to take a different stance so I'm very glad they're taking that solid stance,"" Holtsberrysaidduring an appearance on ""Fox and Friends.""""The vice president has very orthodox Christian beliefs - very traditional beliefs - that a vast majority of Christians believe,"" he continued. ""His political views are shared by a large section of America, so it's not a radical choice, and I think people should be able to engage and disagree with his views and do it in a mature fashion.""This isn't the first time Pence has been at the center of a controversy on a university campus. In May 2017, a group of more than 100 graduating seniors at the University of Notre Dame walked out of their own graduation ceremony in protest of Pence, who delivered their commencement address there that morning. A student activist group called We Stand For staged the walkout in response to policies Pence pursued as governor of Indiana that they say targeted the most vulnerable.“We invite all students, faculty, and families who will be attending the Commencement ceremony to walk out with us as we take back our graduation and show our dissatisfaction with the University’s selection of Mike Pence as honored speaker,” the groupwroteat the time. “We also will walk out in dignity and solidarity with all marginalized people affected by Pence’s politics, both on this campus and throughout our nation.”Pence has proven a most divisive figure on both sides of the political aisle. Although Donald Trump gained favor from the right when he picked the evangelical Indiana Governor as his vice presidential running mate, his choice received vigorous denunciations from the left. A former GOP leader who served in the chamber for nearly a decade, Pence fulfilled Trump’s need for someone who could work closely with the executive branch. Pence’s record for social conservatism has drawn harsh condemnation from LGBT and abortion rights advocates. As governor of Indiana, Pence approved the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a measure allowing businesses to discriminate against consumers based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. A fierce backlash from business and the tourist industry, along with atrending hashtag #BoycottIndiana, forced the governor and state legislatures there to add an amendment clarifying that nothing in the law was intended to permit discrimination. In 2006, as head of the Republican Study Committee, Pence voiced his opposition to same-sex marriage legislation when hedeclared“societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family.”Similarly, Pence has alsopledged his supportfor the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA), which would prohibit “the federal government from taking discriminatory action against a person on the basis that such person believes or acts in accordance with a religious belief or moral conviction that: (1) marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or (2) sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage.” FADA would also eliminate federal remedies for discrimination and allow those committing discriminatory acts to sue the federal government for interfering in their “right” to discriminate against LGBTs.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1012438157081014,0.3864664502164502,1040,1,Second Nexus

S. are behind on their monthly payments as of early January, according to an Urban Institute analysis. Researchers Jim Parrott, a fellow at the Urban Institute, and Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics,calculatedthat 18% of U. S. renters were behind on payments and warned that if lawmakers didn’t act fast, there could be a major eviction crisis. The average delinquent renter is four months behind on payments and owes $5,600, the researchers estimated using Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.“The pandemic has hit the nation’s most vulnerable communities hard,” Parrott and Zandi wrote in the report released Monday. “Not only have they been more likely to get sick, but they have been more likely to lose their income and savings, and now they are more likely to be evicted. Any one of these challenges should insult the conscience of the nation; all three should be unacceptable.”More than 19% of renters were behind on their payments in 13 states including California, New York, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee and Louisiana, according to the analysis.

The CDC, which hopes the guidance will prod more Americans to get vaccinated, also said fully immunised people will not need to physically distance in most places. The turnaround came just 16 days since CDC issued revised guidance that left many restrictions in place for vaccinated people. The agency came under fire in March for initially discouraging immunised grandparents to fly to visit loved ones. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the new guidance was based on a sharp reduction in cases, expansion of vaccines to younger people and vaccine efficacy against coronavirus variants. “We followed the science here,” she said.“If you‘re fully vaccinated and can take your mask off, you’ve earned the right to do something that Americans are known for all around the world: greeting others with a smile,” he said, flashing a brief smile himself. Biden earlier shed his mask during a meeting with lawmakers, Republican Senator Shelly Moore Capito told reporters. Some journalists at the White House also removed their masks. The CDC had faced criticism, even from public health officials, that it has been too cautious in its guidance. Critics have said people need to see more benefit of getting vaccinated in terms of returning to normal activities.“In the past couple of weeks, we have seen additional data to show these vaccines work in the real world, they stand up to the variants, and vaccinated people are less likely to transmit the virus,” the agency said in a news release. It added, “We needed to take the time to review the full body of evidence to get this right, and that’s how we came to this decision.”Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, said he supports the new guidance that many had been calling for.“People in state health departments and infectious disease doctors have been saying this for some time because they‘re so impressed with the effectiveness of the vaccine, and also, they have the feeling that people who are vaccinated need a reward,” he said.01:35Two Asian women attacked with hammer in New York after being told ‘take off your mask’Republican Senator Susan Collins called the guidance “overdue”.“If people find they cannot do anything differently after a vaccine, they will not see the benefit in getting vaccinated,” she said. The revised guidance is a major step toward returning to pre-pandemic life, but the agency still recommends vaccinated people wear masks on planes and trains, and at airports, transit hubs, mass transit and places like hospitals and doctor‘s offices. Officials in several states said they would immediately review existing mask requirements. The Retail Industry Leaders Association said the announcement creates ambiguity because it fails to fully align with state and local orders.“It is critical for customers to remember the CDC announcement is guidance and that many state and local jurisdictions still have mask mandates in place that retailers must follow.”The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents 1.3 million retail and grocery workers, called the new guidelines “confusing”, adding it “fails to consider how it will impact essential workers who face frequent exposure to individuals who are not vaccinated and refuse to wear masks”. The US government last month extended mask requirements across transport networks through September 13. The Transportation Security Administration said it would “work closely with the CDC to evaluate the need for these directives”. Walensky said CDC will soon issued updated transit guidance. The new guidance says vaccinated Americans can resume all travel, do not need to quarantine after international trips and do not need to be tested for Covid-19 if exposed to someone who is Covid-19 positive but asymptomatic. However, Americans still face some international travel restrictions, including non-essential trips to Canada.02:22US President Donald Trump takes mask off as he arrives at White HouseThe CDC said fully vaccinated people should still wear masks where required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws, and abide by rules and regulations set by local businesses and workplaces. In late April, the CDC said fully vaccinated people can safely engage in outdoor activities like walking and hiking without masks, but recommended their continued use in public spaces where they are required. Immune-compromised individuals should consult doctors before shedding masks, and those who are not vaccinated should continue wearing them, Walensky said.",3,Reliable,0.1241892135642135,0.3380411255411256,1013,3,South China Morning Post

The photo is taken from the end of the table, directly in front of the screen they would be watching. The people in the photo do not seem concerned with having their line of sight blocked, suggesting they weren't actually looking at anything. Second, no one is looking in the same direction. It is as though they are watching different screens or not even engaged. Third, and most notably, no one is interacting with anyone else in the photo.

Ron DeSantis didn’t wait until the final hours to extend the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures this time around. The governor on Wednesday night extended his executive order until Sept. 1 in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic that has wreaked havoc on the economy, two days before it would have expired. Last month, the governor waited until four hours before it was set to expire before extending it. Without the moratorium, thousands of Floridians could have become homeless in days because landlords have been filing paperwork in court to evict non-paying tenants once the ban ends. Advocates for low-wage tourism workers and others have been calling for the governor to extend the moratorium to prevent an avalanche of homelessness in Florida. State Rep. Ana Eskamani, D-Orlando, in at tweet called the extension a “necessary step to protect thousands of Floridians from homelessness but we need a plan to ensure housing security for all during & after COVID19 pandemic. Living life month by month is not sustainable & we’ve outlined proposals to the (governor) already that he’s thus far ignored.”As was the case last month, the governor issued the executive order without comment. On June 30, DeSantis ignored a question about the issue at a news conference in the daytime only to send out the order via email hours that night. The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. The rent and foreclosure crisis is especially acute in Florida.

(Photo by Courtney Pedroza/Getty Images)Friday marks two weeks since Arizona started the recount of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, which was ordered by the GOP-controlled state Senate to determine whether widespread fraud took place in the 2020 presidential election and U. S. Senate race. The ballots are being hand counted, and an audit official earlier this weeksaidat least some of the ballots are being scanned for bamboo fibers, in line with an absurd conspiracy theory that 40,000 forged ballots were shipped into the state from Asia. On Thursday, the Justice Departmentsenta letter to local officials warning the audit might be violating federal law since ballots have been handed over to a private company. That company, Florida-based Cyber Ninjas,has no election experience. Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan has pushed a conspiracy theory that a company tied to long-dead Venezuelan strongman dictator Hugo Chavez somehow rigged voting machines against former President Donald Trump. Cyber Ninjas wasorderedlate last week to release information on how it planned to maintain voter privacy, after a state judge said he was ""not yet persuaded"" privacy was being protected. The recount, being held at the Arizona Exposition and State Fair, isreportedlywell behind its expected pace, and auditors have been given a hard May 14 deadline to vacate the facility, since there's a high school graduation booked. Ken Bennett, a former Arizona secretary of state who's overseeing the audit on behalf of the Senate, suggested the audit could ""take a break"" and then resume after the graduation. The audit appears solely driven by former President Donald Trump's baseless claims that widespread voter fraud kept him from winning the 2020 presidential election, and Trump has said he's monitoring the audit and expects ""the results will be startling!"" The audit is solely reviewing ballots from the presidential election and the U. S. Senate race, both of which Democrats won. It's also only looking at ballots in Arizona’s largest county, Maricopa, which includes Phoenix and its sprawling suburbs. It'sunclearexactly how the audit is being funded and who is paying for it. The state Senate is paying $150,000, but Logan said there’s also outside funding.

314,'Not ready': Teachers across Arizona stage 'motor marches' to protest school reopenings,-3.0,46.67,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2020/07/22/arizona-teachers-protest-against-reopening-schools-in-person-classes-amid-covid-19-crisis/5487235002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/az-central-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,24,"Teachers started to roll into Encanto Park in Phoenix at 6 p.m. Wednesday. On their cars they'd scrawled “I’d rather see your kids on a laptop than a ventilator,” “teachers are not martyrs,” and “AZ #1 in COVID.”They were among dozens, if not hundreds, of educators getting behind the wheel to participate in ""motor marches"" across Arizona on Wednesday evening. The community marches signify a new teacher movement rising, as they protest reopening schools for in-person classes as the number of COVID-19 cases remain high in Arizona. In north Glendale, about 15 teachers drove in sign-bedecked vehicles with their blinking emergency lights. Some teachers honked and waved as people passed by the line of cars. Similar motor marches were planned on Wednesday in Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, Gilbert, Tucson and Yuma. Another march is planned later this week in Surprise. Many of the teachers participating in the protests were engaged in 2018, during the #RedForEd movement. On Wednesday, many of the 30 teachers lined up in Tempe wore #RedForEd T-shirts. But this time, they said, they are facing life-or-death stakes. Some are drafting their wills, a school board member said at a news conference earlier this month. A few of their colleagues already have died, including abeloved rural educatoranda Chandler High School swim coach. Mitchella Stevens, a middle school teacher in the Cartwright School District, said she and other teachers do not want to be “test subjects.”""I want consecutive days of no new cases,"" she said. ""I want it to be safe so that my students won’t take anything home and hurt their families and I want to be able to also visit my elderly parents.""The educators are up against the clock. Gov. Doug Ducey in June ordered a delay to the start of in-person classes until Aug. 17. But many educators are pushing for school buildings to stay closed through October, when they hope the state will have a tighter grip on containing the virus. State schools Superintendent Kathy Hoffman sent a public message to Ducey on Tuesday,urging the governor to set clear metricsto drive the decision to reopen schools.'""We cannot ask schools to make decisions that will impact the teachers' and students' health and safety without first providing them with the necessary public health data and funding to make safe decisions,"" she wrote. While there's pressure for Ducey to delay school reopening, he also faces pressure from the Trump administration and others to reopen schools on time. At a protest at the Capitol on Wednesday night, a handful of parents wearing green showed up to urge the governor to reopen schools. They held signs that said ""Facts over fear"" and ""We want a voice, we want a choice.""Ducey is expected to make an announcement this week on schools. It's unclear what he will decide. Parents, students and teachers debate reopening schoolsIn some districts, teachers already are reporting to their schools to prepare classrooms and attend beginning-of-the-year training and orientation. For Alexis Aguirre, an instructional coach in the Osborn School District in central Phoenix, the beginning-of-school-year rituals feel grim when juxtaposed with COVID-19 death rates.""A lot of teachers and parents are really confused as to why they're being asked to go back in person when we're dying at unprecedented rates here in Arizona, especially in Maricopa County,"" she said. While some districts have already pushed back in-person start dates to October, other districts may still be poised to begin in-person classes on Aug.17 if the governor doesn't take action, Aguirre said. Some teachers are afraid to speak up.""A lot of people don't know how to raise their voice and bring this issue to the table, but then other folks are afraid of retaliation and they're afraid of losing their jobs,"" she said. ""We want to stand in solidarity with them.""The J. O. Combs Elementary School District in San Tan Valley, for example, will open for in-person classes on Aug. 17, according to a letter from the superintendent. A now-deleted tweet from the district's assistant superintendent, Mark Duplissis, received backlash online over the weekend because he posted photos of teachers sitting in person at an orientation. Some teachers do not oppose returning to teach in person. Stephen Pena, a math teacher at Round Valley High School in Eagar, said the spread of COVID-19 in his eastern Arizona community is not as widespread as it is in metro Phoenix. He supports Ducey for not mandating every school in the state stay closed until October.""He's giving districts a choice of what best fits them and their community,"" Pena said. Teachers from the Osborn, Balsz and Wilson school districts all showed up to the central Phoenix motor march. Aguirre, the organizer of the Phoenix event, told attendees they were there to bolster Balsz and Wilson teachers. Those two districts plan to forge ahead with in-person learning on Aug. 17. Mario Martinez, a school board member in the Wilson district, said he believed the move to reopen was reckless. It takes just one symptomatic student to spread the virus around the small district, he said.""We need to think of our students, our families, our teachers,"" he said. Two Balsz teachers decorating their cars at Encanto Park said they feared returning to the classroom. Courtney Pearce teaches sixth-graders who switch classes throughout the day.""I see over 200 kids a day, just in my class alone,"" she said. ""There's just too many moving parts for it to be safe right now.""The Phoenix educators drove down Thomas Road all the way from 15th Avenue to 52nd Street, honking their horns and waving out their windows along the way. In Mesa, longtime educator Judy Robbins stood next to a decorated car with the phrase ""Keep It Scientific, Stupid."" She helped organize Wednesday's march. Some educators tried to call Ducey's office to complain about his reopening plans. Robbins has been teaching for 34 years, and now teaches students who are deaf or hard of hearing. She wants Ducey to base guidelines to reopen on science. She is in a high-risk category, she said.“I can’t be a teacher if I’m in the hospital,"" she said. In March 2018, before the #RedForEd movement led to a statewide teacher walkout, educators similarly held protests in their communities. They called the protests walk-ins, and would hold signs and march into school at the beginning of the day. Wednesday was usually a key day for these protests. As in 2018, educators are calling on the state to send more money to schools. This time, teachers say the funding is desperately needed to cover the increased costs for technology and protective gear, like masks and hand sanitizer. Becky Williams, a sixth-grade teacher in the Scottsdale Unified School District, said that when schools are ready to reopen for in-person classes, there's little money available to make class sizes smaller to ensure more distance between kids. Arizona's class sizes are highand keeping distance between kids in crowded classrooms is not feasible.""There needs to be some funding in place that's going to allow us to follow the CDC guidelines because right now most school districts cannot commit to reducing class sizes,"" she said. Heather Nieto, a Valley Vista High School teacher in the Dysart Unified School District, is organizing a motor march in Surprise on Friday. She was one of the founders of the #RedForEd movement, she said. The debate around school reopening underscores one of the major issues Nieto said educators rallied around in 2018: respect for teachers. Nieto said she's worried about the repercussions of returning to the classroom while there's still so much unknown about COVID-19, how it spreads and how it affects children. Her 10-year-old son has asthma and a heart murmur and she worries about spreading the virus to him.""Opening schools right now, it's not safe,"" she said.",3,Reliable,0.0262753760698966,0.4672162920793056,1784,3,AZ Central

They have not reduced crime. The prison populations have nothing to do with the levels of crime because crime rose, crime fell, the prison population massively expanded. And so what we know is that policing has not made our community safer. Jaisal Noor: On June 12th, activists painted ‘defund police’ in front of Baltimore City Hall, head of a committee hearing on the Baltimore Police Departments proposed a $509 million budget. Speaker 1: The City Council is voting on a $509 million investment into police at the expense of resources that are necessary to communities. And so we want the Baltimore City Police Department to cut the police budget by $270 million and take that money and invest it in community-based solutions. Speaker 3: The process to abolition is actually a process that’s not going to happen overnight. I know that removing the police in their footprint in our city and redefining public safety is going to be a long process. I’m willing to work with anyone who understands that, who actually wants to improve the city. Jaisal Noor: Baltimore spends more per capita on its police than any other large city, more than it allocates for housing, health, civil rights, and its contribution to its local school system combined. Activists with Organizing Black, say they want officials to spend half that money, over $270 million on social programs. Speaker 1: What has made our community safer are mental health counselors in schools, ensuring people have… youth have well-funded youth programs, that youth have summer jobs, that communities feel connected. And there is space for communities to build together and be accountable together. Jaisal Noor: The Baltimore City Council is scheduled to vote on its budget on June 15th. Activists who target Appropriations and Budget Committee Chair Councilman Eric Costello, with an early morning car caravan on Friday, say they will maintain pressure on elected officials. Speaker 3: I know the Councilors have gotten thousands upon thousands of emails. I know some Councilors that got visited at their house this morning, Councilor Costello was real upset. I would tell him that if he did his job, hearing from your constituents is not bullying. So if you do it, then get your constituents want, you probably would get left alone. People are showing up at Brandon Scott’s house.

Y. — The federal government is trying to gather data from states during the push to distribute an expectedcoronavirusvaccine that could potentially be used to deport undocumented immigrants, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today. The government is asking states to sign a data sharing agreement ahead of vaccine distribution that would provide federal agencies with demographic information on anyone who gets the vaccine. The agreement also seeks a driver’s license number, passport number or Social Security number, Cuomo said.“Why would you possibly need a person’s driver’s license number or Social Security number or passport number before they receive a vaccine? Why? There is no legitimate health reason,” Cuomo said during a conference call with reporters. “This is just another example of them trying to extort the state of New York to get information that they can use at the Department of Homeland Security and ICE to deport people.”The agreement says the information will be used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services and “other federal partners,” Cuomo said. Cuomo said he won’t share any information that could be used to deport anyone. He’s sending a letter to President Donald Trump, HHS and the CDC asking why they need ID numbers and seeking information about what other federal agencies will receive the information. He’s also asking whether the agencies will commit to saying the information won’t be used for immigration purposes.“I have been down this road before,” Cuomo said. “This is an administration that has from day one, with the wall, been relentless in their pursuit of undocumented people.”No vaccine for the virus has been approved yet, but states and the federal government are already planning for how to get one to the public. Cuomo also criticized the federal government’s distribution plansover the weekend. He said the Trump administration’s decision to rely on private pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and doctors' offices will leave out poor and minority communities without easy access to health care.

318,Mnuchin in the Middle: Between Trump and Democrats,8.0,39.25,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/13/mnuchin_in_the_middle_between_trump_and_democrats__142927.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-13,18,"It was hopeless, and he knew it, even before he started talking. The junior senator from Kentucky walked to the floor to deliver a melodramatic eulogy. “Can you hear it? Can you hear the somber notes, the feet shuffling, the solemn tones?” Rand Paul asked his colleagues last July 31 as they prepared to vote on a $2.7 trillion spending deal. “It’s a dirge, a funeral march; it’s the death of a movement.”“Today’s vote will be the last nail in the coffin,” he continued. “The Tea Party is no more.” And then, the Senate voted, 67-28, to suspend the debt ceiling and advance the spending package, which Paul had warned would further explode the nation’s $22 trillion debt. If anyone was hammering nails into the coffin of the grand old claim that the Grand Old Party was the one of fiscal responsibility, it was the secretary of the Treasury Department. More specifically, the Republican Treasury secretary. When the White House wants to win over Democrats, President Trump sends in Steve Mnuchin. He has suspended a debt ceiling and quarterbacked a trade negotiation and most recently guided the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security package through Congress. With more aid coming, some conservatives in the White House and on the Hill quietly complain that Mnuchin is the fox guarding the fiscal hen house. They don’t go on the record, and for good reason. While the life of other Cabinet secretaries can be brutish and short, Mnuchin enjoys rare job security. Many of his colleagues have been forced to resign. Others have been publicly humiliated, fired over the phone while on the toilet or left behind on the tarmac. Not him. There were some slight scandals — the expensive flights on military jets and that egregiously out-of-touch photo shoot with his wife and the sheets of freshly printed dollar bills. But neither stuck, and it’s easy to understand why.“Despite the concerns of conservatives,” a senior House aide told RealClearPolitics, “it is clear that he has the trust of the president, which makes him a unique figure in the Cabinet.”Complaining about Mnuchin might mean jeopardizing access to the White House or, worse, endangering a clear line to the Treasury Department as the secretary doles out aid. And so, Republicans complain about the product without publicly mentioning the man who guides the process. A spokesman for Sen. Paul declined to comment, but he isn’t alone.“I’m not interested in any more of Speaker’s Pelosi’s spending porn — or any other member of Congress for that matter,” Sen. John Kennedy said on “Fox & Friends” shortly after the relief packaged passed. “Unless you were throwing the Frisbee in the quad during Econ 101,” he continued, “deficits matter.”A spokesman for Kennedy did not return a request for comment on the record. But if anyone is playing Frisbee, as Kennedy suggested, it would be Mnuchin and Pelosi. Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff to the speaker, documented their correspondence in real-time. While Trump and Pelosi are not talking due to their feud, Mnuchin and the speaker talked on no fewer than 10 different occasions as House Democrats held up the stimulus bill. The result of those negotiations: $2.2 trillion in relief that included cash for the National Endowment for of the Arts ($75 million), a fat bailout for the Kennedy Center, which still furloughed hundreds of staff ($25 million), and hefty payment to NASA ($60 million). And there was more than money. As RCP first reported, a union provision was tucked into the bill that had nothing to do with combating coronavirus. Businesses with 500 to 10,000 employees that accept a government relief loan are now required to remain neutral if their workers try to organize. Trump left the ugly business of sausage-making to Mnuchin and overlooks spending his conservative base would find unseemly. Anything he finds objectionable in the bill, the president insists, is just the price of doing business. “This is the Democrats -- that’s the way they play,” he said on “Fox & Friends.” “We need their votes. They have the House. We had to take care of people.”No one doubted the need for immediate relief, and the pandemic package advanced out of the House by voice vote. But some conservatives note this isn’t the first trillion-dollar piece of legislation that Mnuchin has delivered, and they point to the July 2019 bill that suspended spending limits that Paul blamed for burying the Tea Party. These two examples, one prominent House Republican representative told RCP, have brought him to an unavoidable conclusion: “I think that he is out of his lane.”Mnuchin made his money in banking at Goldman Sachs before turning his interest to film producing. He handled the money partnering with 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros to produce dozens of films. Some were more successful than others. “Mad Max: Fury Road,” a story of post-apocalyptic survival starring Tom Hardy, was a hit. Others, like Sandra Bullock’s “Our Brand is Crisis,” about an American political consultant trying to fix the Bolivian presidential election, flopped. Aside from brief mentions in rolling credits, Mnuchin was little-known and his civic involvement was limited to cutting checks to prominent politicos such as Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney. It wasn't until after a last-minute invitation to a Trump primary victory party in 2015 that Mnuchin switched to politics full time. He became national finance chairman of the Trump campaign and, later, secretary of the Treasury. It is remarkable start for a political rookie. Some worry it’s not enough to go against an ace like Pelosi.“He's probably pretty terrific on the technicalities of high finance,” the Republican said. But stepping to the plate against a seasoned negotiator like the speaker, the representative continued, requires discipline. “She may have lost some of her fastball, but she certainly still has a curveball and a slider.”Mnuchin places a premium on winning Democratic approval for legislation. The 2019 debt deal that the secretary negotiated, for instance, passed the House on back of Pelosi’s caucus, while a majority of Republicans opposed it. He wants to make a deal just like his boss promised to do during the campaign, and Mnuchin, despite his ideological naysayers, has delivered. Unlike Trump, though, he can sit down with Pelosi. They even have their own way of talking.“We listen to each other. And we kind of speak shorthand to each other because we don’t waste each other’s time on niceties or anything like that,” Pelosi told reporters as the relief package was being negotiated. Why not just speak to Trump directly? “There was no need for that,” Pelosi said of negotiating with the man she has been more than cool toward for months. It has left conservatives on the Hill feeling overlooked and taken for granted. “When you are negotiating a big deal you never start by handing the other side their preferred negotiating partner,” a senior House aide told RCP. “Mnuchin starts with more in common with how the Democrats view the world then how Republicans view the world, and that is concerning to conservatives in Congress.”This is all too familiar to one former White House aide who said Mnuchin was in the habit of bragging about his relationships with Democrats on the Hill while overlooking Republicans. “Sending him to negotiate is like waving the white flag of surrender before the battle has even started,” the former aide told RCP. And according to a White House official with knowledge of the relief package negotiations, Mnuchin has a singular focus: the stock market.“We are more interested in bipartisanship,” the current aide explained, comparing how the current and previous administrations dealt with the Hill, “but Mnuchin also isn’t particularly ideological.” And so, the secretary has been willing to turn a blind eye to principled objections “when the financial health of markets seems to be on the line.” A quiet frustration with Mnuchin is simmering in more conservative corners of the administration, and the pandemic has only heightened tensions. A senior administration official wondered whom Mnuchin was “representing in this deal.” There are billions for corporations and corporate lenders, so much so that the official said that whomever Mnuchin was backing “certainly wasn’t small business.”If Democrats are going to lard up emergency legislation with add-ons, outside conservatives are urging Mnuchin and the Trump administration to make their own asks. They feel the union rule included in the last round of relief was an unfair ambush. They want it overturned, and more. The Club for Growth has sent a memo to Capitol Hill calling for a number of regulatory relief items, including a temporary suspension of any business regulation that “imposes a burden” on U. S. businesses, charities, educational institutions, and other employers trying to restart and rehire employees. The plan would also require Trump to issue an executive order suspending all civil and criminal penalties for any violation of regulations. Those are their proposed riders, and they wish Mnuchin would give those Republican concerns as much as priority as Democratic asks. It isn’t like the White House doesn’t have clout on Capitol Hill; conservatives say it is just a matter of will. They have hope in the newly minted chief of staff.“Mark Meadows is a very good negotiating politician. He is able to do remarkable things, and I’m hopeful that he can basically help Mnuchin begin to understand the ramifications for the conservative cause in these deals,” a House Republican said. “But I’m not sure he’s the one who should be negotiating in the first place.”Another congressman was more blunt, if also slightly more optimistic.“I've never been comfortable with a with a Democrat-Wall Street guy negotiating with Nancy Pelosi, who's always more inclined to put Wall Street in front of mainstream interest,” the Republican representative explained. “That being said, it's clear that he has the president’s respect.”Perhaps if Trump is reelected, the representative said, Mnuchin could leverage his relationships with Democrats to tackle the national debt. But if the Tea Party is dead, suffocated by the ballooning deficits of a Republican administration, fiscal renewal seems unlikely in the next four years. Another phase of relief now sits before Congress, and according to Hill sources, Mnuchin has been signaling different things to either side. Chuck Schumer spoke with Mnuchin Friday morning, and the Senate minority leader announced that he and the Treasury secretary had “agreed to pursue bipartisan talks with the leadership of House and Senate Democrats.” Pelosi also announced that she had talked to her new friend, recommending publicly that talks “proceed on a bipartisan basis.”Republicans have been pushing for additional funding for small business loans, and Democrats are amenable. They just want more sweeteners on top — aid for hospitals and local government and underserved communities. Mitch McConnell has said publicly that those funds can be included in a subsequent funding package. The delay, the majority leader concluded, was pure politics. “Nobody except Washington Democrats seems to be unclear on this fact or confused about the urgency,” McConnell said in a statement. “Republicans reject Democrats’ reckless threat.”Mnuchin remains in the middle, Trump’s point man for negotiations. Some worry again about what additional sacrifice he will make to get another deal.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1027705394963459,0.4176672019736535,2514,2,RealClear Politics

Freeman was46 years old, according to the Corpus Christi Caller Times. Freeman was put on a ventilator at the hospital and was getting bedside dialysis, his sister said. Kim Barrientos, the CEO of the Boys & Girls Club of the Coastal Bend, where Freeman served as a board member and president, said Freeman “was always apositive, happy individualand everything he did focused around kids and youth.”“You’re putting a face that everybody knows with something that’s going on,” she told KRIS-TV. “The pandemic’s out there. It’s real. it doesn’t discriminate against people.”Freeman leaves behind his wife, Cassie, and three children — Callie, Brock and Jenna, the school district said. Before becoming the Flour Bluff superintendent in 2019, Freeman served as the associate superintendent in Wichita Falls and superintendent in Montague and London, Texas, abio states. He had degrees from Midwestern State University, University of North Texas and Texas Wesleyan University. School Board President Shirley Thornton said she and her colleagues are “experiencing great sorrow,” according to the Caller Times.“Dr. Freeman saw each obstacle as an opportunity to shine, and he would expect that of all us right now” she said.

321,You Can Now Order Abortion Pills Before You're Pregnant in All 50 States,-13.67,35.0,https://jezebel.com/you-can-now-order-abortion-pills-before-youre-pregnant-1847910143,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-21,15,"Just beforeTexas’ 6-week abortion bantook effect on September 1, onlinemedication abortionproviderAid Accessbegan tolet Texans who aren’t pregnant order the pillsto prepare for a future unwanted pregnancy. This is a concept known as “advance provision,” and it’s akin to having emergency contraception waiting in your medicine cabinet before you actually need it. It’s especially helpful for people living in rural areas or in places hostile to birth control and abortion. Now,Aid Accesshas quietly rolled out advance provision ofabortion pillsto people capable of pregnancy in all 50 states—a move that could revolutionize how people obtain and think about early abortion care in the US. Dr. Daniel Grossman, professor of gynecology at University of California, San Francisco, and the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), told Jezebel that this model could help people access abortion earlier in pregnancy than they would otherwise if navigating layered state barriers. In 2018, Grossmanpublished datashowing that 45 percent of 7,000 people surveyed are interested in advance provision, even moreso than they are in getting the pills over the counter or online without interacting with a clinician.“I’ve been talking about it for a few years and it’s been hard to get any traction, either among researchers or among providers,” Dr. Grossman said. “My hope is that this will spark a conversation among mainstream healthcare providers to think about how should this model be integrated and how should it be tested and be part of mainstream medicine, where we could also then advocate for insurance coverage.” He also noted that it could help familiarize more people with medication abortion. “I’m still amazed how many people don’t even know about this option or areconfused between that and Plan B.”The medications mifepristone and misoprostol have been available in the US for more than 20 years, and the combination of meds, which essentially induce a miscarriage, is FDA-approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy. But they are highly regulated—you can only be handed the pills in a doctor’s office, not a pharmacy, and you typically have to be pregnant in order to get them. Plus, until the pandemic hit, theFDA didn’t allow the pills to be mailedoutside of a sanctioned clinical study. A Dutch physician, Rebecca Gomperts,launched Aid Access in 2018as a humanitarian effort to help people seeking abortions in highly restrictive areas of the US, like the South and Midwest. During the pandemic, they started working with US-based providers who were newly able to mail the pills. And now they’ve expanded their services to include nationwide advance provision. In 18 states that bothpermit medication abortion to be prescribed via telemedicineand where Aid Access has providers, a US-based provider will review the web consult and write the script, thepatient will pay $150, and the package will arrive in a few days. In other states, an overseas provider will write the script, patients willpay $110, and get the pills from a pharmacy in India in two to four weeks. (Financial help is available for either option.)Aid Access notes that people should contact them immediately if they become pregnant in the future so they can guide them through the process. They advise checking the expiration dates when you receive the medicines and note that most pills can be kept up to two years after receiving them. Dr. Grossman said that, ideally, a provider prescribing these medications in advance would counsel people on how to track their period as well as on the early signs of pregnancy, and offer support to people when they plan to use the pills. It would also be beneficial to study the practice as he noted that the FDA considered data on advance provision of emergency contraception (brand name Plan B) when evaluating whether to make it available over the counter,another model he’s studiedfor abortion pills. As for the inevitable criticism from anti-abortion lawmakers and activists (and some pro-choice ones) that services like this will lead to people giving pills to others seeking to terminate a pregnancy, aka “diversion”—this could be happening now. Since FDA labeling changes in 2016, patients are no longer required to take the first pill in the office; they can start the process at a time of their choosing. Since people take the pills at home, it’s possible that diversion occurs, though there’s no scientific evidence of that happening, Dr. Grossman said. And some health providers are already writing prescriptions for people who aren’t pregnant because they’re going to a country or region with limited abortion access for an extended period of time, like the Peace Corps, he said. While one site prescribing pills in advance of pregnancy will help some people, it’s important to emphasize thatabortion pills alone will not solve the access problem in the U. S. First, Aid Access isn’t covered by insurance and some might pay out of pocket for care that would be covered in a clinic. Other patients won’t learn they’re pregnant or know they need an abortion until they’re beyond the medication abortion window. For some, it’s not safe to have a miscarriage at home because of abusive partners or religious family members. And many pregnant people will still prefer in-clinic procedures because they’re over faster and allow them to get back to their jobs, schooling, or families the next day. Plus, managing your own abortion isexplicitly criminalized in three states(Oklahoma, South Carolina, and, after 22 weeks, Nevada) and could be legally risky inmany more. Robin Marty, journalist and author of theand head of operations for West Alabama Women’s Center, an abortion clinic in Tuscaloosa, offered some advice to mitigate those risks. Whether ordering on your phone or a computer, use private browsers and clear your cache afterward. Since the pills are good for about two years, people could run into trouble even for a future wanted pregnancy that ends in miscarriage or stillbirth if someone remembers you talking about ordering pills. If people want to tell trusted friends, doing so in person or over the phone are the safest options, followed by encrypted, disappearing messages on an app like Signal, Marty told Jezebel. Overall, this move by Aid Access is a good thing, Marty said, but it will have consequences. “I have always been a huge proponent of people being able to access medication abortion as quickly as possible and before they actually need it, and Aid Access appears to be the first one who is able to make this occur [on a broader scale],” she said.“I would definitely encourage people who are interested in this in doing this while they can,” she said. “The response to this is going to be a far more aggressive stance and [states] starting to criminalize directly any person who performs their own abortion.”Miscarriage + Abortion Hotlineat (833) 246-2632 for confidential medical support, or theRepro Legal Helplineat (844) 868-2812 for confidential legal information and advice.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1812710754158122,0.4402728411938938,1517,1,Jezebel

Brian Kemp is a comic book villain of voter suppression. No, on second thought, that’s actually offensive to comic book villains, as they usually have nuance and finesse. GeorgiaGov. Brian Kemp is a throwback to an old South that is blatantly racist and doesn’t give AF who knows it. Kemp straight stole the governorship from American shero Stacey Abrams. And, after Abrams helped turn Georgia blue and deliver two Democratic Senators, Kemp did what most white kids do when they are losing, he took his football back and changed the rules of the game. On Thursday, Kemp—surrounded by a bunch of white men—signed sweeping Republican-sponsored legislation that suppresses the fuck out of the Black vote and basically gives Kemp and his boys greater control over elections.“Among highlights, the law requires a photo ID in order to vote absentee by mail, after more than 1.3 million Georgia voters used that option during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also cuts the time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed,” theChicago Sun-Timesreports. Kemp ran to sign that bullshit just two hours after it was passed by a vote of 100-75 in the state House and 34-20 in the state Senate.“We are witnessing right now a massive and unabashed assault on voting rights unlike anything we’ve seen since the Jim Crow era,” stateDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler told the Sun-Times. State Rep. Park Cannon wanted Kemp to sign Jim Crow 2.0 in front of the people so she knocked on the governor’s door when he was livestreaming the signing. I guess you can figure out what happened next, but Georgia state troopers arrested Cannon, an Atlanta Democrat, dragging her through the Capitol and into a police car, while the person committing the real crime was safe in his office. Cannon was charged with obstruction of law enforcement and “disrupting General Assembly sessions, according to the Georgia State Patrol and released on bond late Thursday,” theAtlanta Journal-Constitutionreports.“She knew he was signing a bill that would affect all Georgians—why would he hide behind closed doors? This isn’t a monarchy,” Tamara Stevens, an activist who was there when Cannon was arrested, told AJC. “You have a woman of color fighting for the rights of Georgians and they arrested her for knocking on the door because she wanted to witness our governor sign the bill.”Georgia’s U. S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, who is also the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, reminded AJC that violent insurrectionists who stormed the U. S. Capitol avoided arrest on Jan. 6,yet a Georgia state legislator was arrested for knocking on a door in her workplace.“Today is a very sad day for the state of Georgia,” he said. “What we have witnessed today is a desperate attempt to lock out and squeeze the people out of their own democracy.”",3,Reliable,-0.0206349206349206,0.4157287157287157,649,1,The Root

S. Marshals Service, Flickr)good friend of mine did a short stint in jail recently. He got a week for contempt of court. It wasn’t a big deal. He’s a tough enough guy. But that’s not what I want to write about. I want to write about what he told me related to medical care in jail. He was in jail in Arlington County, Virginia, one of the wealthiest counties in America. He said the jail was actually quite nice. It was clean, the cells were spacious, and the deputies who served as guards couldn’t have been any more pleasant and respectful. And although the food was terrible, things could have been worse — except, that is, when it came to medical care. When my friend was first processed, he met with a nurse, who interviewed him about his current medical conditions. My friend suffers from diabetes, and he’s on three prescription drugs for it. He’s also supposed to eat a low-carb diet to prevent spikes in his blood sugar. He answered all of the nurse’s questions and was told that he would receive all of his medications after dinner that evening.toConsortium News’But the meds never arrived. He was awakened at 4:30 a.m. every day to have his blood sugar checked, and it was checked again every afternoon at 3:30 or so. But the medication never arrived. Meanwhile, his blood sugar and blood pressure moved higher and higher. He complained every time a nurse came to check his blood sugar levels that he hadn’t received any medication and he was going through withdrawal. All that did was to cause the nurses to simply stop coming. Nobody checked his blood sugar for his last three days in jail. There’s a business reason why the nurses threw my friend under the bus. They took a calculated risk that he wouldn’t die of a diabetes-related stroke or heart attack before being released. Imagine doing that for 1,000 patients. Or 1,000,000. If each patient’s medication costs $5 a day, that adds up to real money. And that’s the business model forCorizon Health, the country’s largest provider of for-profit “medical care” in American prisons. The company is contracted with 534 prisons and jails in 27 states, and it treats 15 percent of all the prisoners in the United States. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, Corizon has beensued 660 timesin the past five years for wrongful death, providing substandard medical care and inadequate staffing. It has been fined untold millions of dollars. But the company sees that as the price of doing business. Again, they can make more money by just not treating people and hoping that they don’t die than they can by actually providing medical care and then paying court-ordered legal settlements. Take as just one example the case ofMarques Davis. The 27-year-old was a prisoner in the Kansas Department of Corrections, where Corizon has an exclusive contract to provide medical care. Davis went to a Corizon nurse saying that he felt weakness in his arms and legs. The nurse determined that Davis was “malingering,” that is, making it all up so he didn’t have to work. Months later, with the numbness worsening, Davis began to complain that he felt like something was “eating his brain.” In fact, somethingeating his brain. It was an untreated fungus that caused his vision to blur, his speech to slur and his cognition to become so impaired that he began to drink his own urine. Davis finally had a heart attack and was taken to a local Kansas City hospital. A CT scan revealed “dramatic swelling of the brain.” A day later, he was dead. Davis’ lawyer hopes to prove in court that this was not an isolated incident, but “a clear and consistent pattern of Corizon delaying, postponing, or not providing necessary medical treatment.” AnACLU spokesmansaid, “Corizon is simply writing off the damages they’re having to pay as the cost of doing business without doing anything meaningful to improve.”The only way to force change and to try to stop these atrocities from happening is in the courts. So far, Corizon has shown that it simply doesn’t care what the courts say about its behavior or about the depravity of its business model. Arizona, however, has an idea. After scores of lawsuits against the company for failing to provide adequate care to prisoners and for failing to make any improvements in the delivery of healthcare, despite court orders to do so, Arizona simply threw Corizon out of the state. And then the state legislature passed a (nonbinding) resolution urging private equity firms based in Arizona to divest themselves of Corizon stock. Corizon leaders huffed and puffed and released statements saying that they had been wronged. They alsodid nothingto improve healthcare. But if 49 other states did the same thing, at least Corizon medical professionals couldn’t kill any more innocent people.toConsortium News’Post Views:527",2,Generally Reliable,0.0408374792703151,0.3498045486851456,1105,1,Consortium News

While US President Joe Bidenpointedthe finger at Facebook as the main culprit behind underwhelming vaccine uptake in the US, Faucitooka shot at the conservative cable news media. Responding to CNN’s Jim Acosta question of whether Tucker Carlson’s hugely popular show on Fox News would have prevented the eradication of dangerous diseases in the US had it been around decades ago, Fauci appeared to agree.“Do you think we could have eradicated polio or defeated the measles if you had Fox News night after night warning people about these vaccine issues that are, you know, bunk?”Acosta asked Fauci during an interview on Saturday. Dr. Anthony Fauci to@Acosta: ""We probably would still have smallpox and we probably would still have polio in this country if we had the kind of false information that's being spread now.""pic.twitter.com/MVUxEPX5yf“If we had had the pushback for the vaccines the way we’re seeing on certain media, I don’t think it would have been possible at all not only to eradicate polio, we probably would still have smallpox,”Fauci said, before adding that he was“certain”that polio would have been still active in the US. The US had its last outbreak of smallpox back in 1949, and since 1972, the vaccine is no longer commonly administered. The last wild case globally was in 1977. Shortly after 9/11, President George W. Bush ordered smallpox vaccinations for 500,000 US troops in high-risk parts of the world and frontline healthcare workers who were willing to get vaccinated. However, at the time there were concerns about possible life-threatening side effects of the jab, with the New York Timesreportingthat“the decision had been difficult for President Bush, given the probability that some people would die of the vaccine’s side effects.”According to a 2003 modelstudy, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, if 60 percent of the US population was vaccinated, this would be beneficial in an unlikely scenario of a national bioterrorist attack with the smallpox virus, but otherwise would have caused some 482 deaths nationally. The US has been polio-free since 1979, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) crediting“a successful vaccination program”with two vaccines introduced in the mid-1950s and early 1960s for uprooting the disease in the US. Worldwide, polio cases have plummeted dramatically since the late 1980s, with the World Health Organization reporting only 22 cases in 2017. And while polio has been almost eradicated, save for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it remains epidemic, the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign was called into question in light of a 2019 WHO report voicing concerns that more polio cases were attributed to a cheap oral vaccine than to a wild virus.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0451362363127069,0.5542239623121975,692,1,RT

Carter, the nation's 39th president andoldest-living formerpresident in U. S. history at 98 years old, lives a fairly normal and frugal life,The Washington Postreported in 2018. In fact, Carter still lives in the ranch house he built himself in 1961. The home, in rural Plains, Georgia — about a two-and-a-half hour drive south from Atlanta — is a two-bedroom ranch assessed at just $167,000, which is ""less than the value of the armored Secret Service vehicles parked outside,"" the Post reports. It's also a lot less than the median home price in Georgia, which is $319,431 in 2022, according to real estate siteZillow. Carter's other frugal tendencies include spending weekends dining with neighbors on paper plates with bargain-brand wine,the Postsays. In addition, it says he and wife Rosalynn make their own yogurt. Carter has also been known to buy his clothes at his local Dollar General store, according to a 2011Rolling Stonestory — heshowed up for the store's openingin Plains in 2004 — and he often flies commercial. In recent years, Carter has made much of his income from writing books, the Post reported; he has published at least 33, including a children's book and reflections on his presidency. (Thriftbooks.com lists52 books.)Carter also receives a $221,400 annual pension, as do all former presidents, plus the federal government gives all ex-presidents an allowance for things like travel and office space. In 2017, Carter got more than $230,000 in such allowances, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a conservative advocacy group. Carter's modest lifestyle is sharply different from those of other living former presidents. Donald Trump, the most recent president to vacate the White House, spends most of his time these days living on his 17-acre South Florida luxury resort, Mar-a-Lago, which Forbes values at roughly$160 million. Barack Obamapurchased an$8.1 million mansionin Washington, D. C. in 2017. The Obama familyreportedlyfollowed that with the 2019 purchase of a nearly $12 million estate in their favorite summer vacation spot: the picturesque (and pricey) Martha's Vineyard. And whileBill Clinton saidhe left the White House $16 million in debt, he swiftly erased that debt thanks to his lucrative paid speeches and book deals. NPRreported that in Clinton's first year out of office, he gave 57 speeches and raked in a whopping $13.7 million from his ""speaking and writing business,"" according to a 2001 tax return.

Ryan made his remarks during a Thursday evening address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. He was critical of both Republicans and Democrats, though he saved his sharpest barbs for Trump, who is by most measures the leader of the modern-day Republican Party.“It was horrifying to see a presidency come to such a dishonorable and disgraceful end,” Ryan said, referring to the deadly attack on the U. S. Capitol that Trump inspired on Jan. 6.“Once again, we conservatives find ourselves at a crossroads,” Ryan continued. “And here’s the reality that we have to face: If the conservative cause depends on the populist appeal of one personality, or on second-rate imitations, then we’re not going anywhere. Voters looking for Republican leaders want to see independence and mettle. They will not be impressed by the sight of yes-men and flatterers flocking to Mar-a-Lago.”It’s unclear how much impact Ryan’s words will have in the broader fight for the future of the GOP, if any. Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, was among the most respected Republicans in the nation’s capital before Trump’s rise, but two years out of office, his open contempt for Trump is not in line with the vast majority of Republican voters and elected officials. A tiny but growing group of anti-Trump Republicans has struggled to steer the party in a new direction, even as Trump continues to promote the same false claims — that he would have won the 2020 election if not for mass voter fraud — that inspired the Capitol insurrection. At the same time, Trump is openly contemplating another presidential run in 2024. One of Trump’s most vocal allies on Capitol Hill, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., lashed out at Ryan on Twitter ahead of the speech.“It really is amazing that Paul Ryan, who is the reason the GOP lost the House in 2018, is going to come out today and blame Trump for the problems in the GOP,” she said, adding a shot at another Trump critic, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. “Paul, the problem is you and your pal Liz.”Ryan spoke Thursday as the opening speaker for the Reagan library’s “Time for Choosing” series, which will later feature 2024 Republican presidential prospects such as former Vice President Mike Pence, former U. N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Those close to Ryan, 51, do not expect him to run for public office again, but they suggest he is paying close attention and remains concerned about the future of the party. The Wisconsin Republican also sits on the board of Fox Corp., which owns Fox News. In his remarks, Ryan described President Joe Biden’s agenda as “more leftist than any president in my lifetime” and warned of exploding federal spending under the Democrats who control Washington. He lamented the GOP’s interest in culture wars and “identity politics” at the expense of conservative principles.“Culture matters, absolutely yes, but our party must be defined by more than a tussle over the latest grievance or perceived slight,” he said. “We must not let them take priority over solutions — grounded in principle — to improve people’s lives.”The Republican Party has an opportunity to win elections and address critical policy challenges, as long as they don’t get in their own way, Ryan continued.“If we fail this test, it will be because the progressive left will have won by default,” he said. “It will be because the conservative cause ... lost its way and followed the left into the trap of identity politics, defining itself by resentments instead of by ideals. It will be because we mistake reactionary skirmishes in the culture wars with a coherent agenda. It will be because we gave too much allegiance to one passing political figure and weren’t loyal enough to our principles.”By STEVE PEOPLES, AP National Political Writer",3,Reliable,0.110479797979798,0.4129419191919192,901,3,Tampa Bay Times

Bush",-14.67,37.0,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a35281232/president-joe-biden-oval-office-white-house/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,16,"On January 20, Joe Biden became the 46th president of the United States—and given that he wasted no time carrying out his presidential duties onInauguration Day, it should come as no surprise that he already has a newly redecorated Oval Office as his workspace. While the inauguration was underway, this historic room (and the rest of the White House) was treated to a makeover, with many furnishings being removed and replaced to suit the president’s vision for his new backdrop. After all, if there’s one thing many of us have learned from spending more time at home during thepandemic, it’s the importance of truly making a room your own. The most noticeable—and telling—amendment made to the Oval Office at President Biden’s request is the plethora of artwork that pays tribute to those who came before him. This includes portraits of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton and busts of Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr., Daniel Webster, Cesar Chavez, and Robert F. Kennedy. This decorating choice reflects Biden’s admiration for and willingness to learn from history—after all, he double majored in historypolitical science as an undergraduate student at the University of Delaware. Of course, President Biden is not one to make choices solely based on aesthetics, so it’s hardly out of scope to presume that his artwork selections have a deeper meaning. Hanging above theResolutedesk(which has now been used by eight presidents in total, beginning with John F. Kennedy and more recently used by Barack Obama and Donald Trump) is a portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Similar to President Biden’s plans to help the U. S. overcome a difficult time in history due to the COVID-19 pandemic, FDR led this country amidst the Great Depression and World War II. In the same vein, the painting of Benjamin Franklin is said to illustrate Biden’s belief in the importance of science, something that is especially paramount in the age of a pandemic. A Trump-era portrait that has since been removed was one of President Andrew Jackson, who was a proponent of slavery (and an owner of enslaved people himself). Jackson also signed the Indian Removal Act, which forced more than 46,000 Native Americans out of their homeland. This choice of artwork came under scrutiny following a November 2017 event in which then-President Trump honored Navajo Code Talkers who served in World War II, with this portrait on the wall right behind them. It should also be noted that the close proximity of the portraits of political rivals Jefferson and Hamilton in President Biden’s Oval Office was no accident—this was meant to emphasize the urgency of overcoming political differences in times of strife. Suffice it to say, it seems like Biden is looking to the furnishings of his new Oval Office as a source of inspiration in challenging moments and as a way to honor both his predecessors and other notable American figures. Beyond (or rather, just below) the artwork of Biden’s Oval Office is a piece of decor that is noticeably more vibrant than its predecessor: a rich royal blue rug that was last seen in this room during the Clinton administration. This decor decision is a stark contrast from the Trump-era Oval Office, which had a predominantly neutral color palette, mainly made up of beige and other muted hues. It’s possible that this rug was chosen, at least in part, because blue is the color that is most often associated with the Democratic party. Biden also swapped out Trump’s golden drapes for Clinton’s even brighter set of gold drapes. There are now just two remnants from the Trump Oval Office: a gray damask wallpaper selected by Trump himself and a pair of cream, patterned couches, which were originally part of George W. Bush’s Oval Office. Given that President Biden only just moved into the White House yesterday—and the move-in process had to take place in—it is likely that more decor changes will soon be made to the Oval Office and other rooms in the People’s House.

A 400% interest rate on small-dollar loans is the average across the States. Now that83% of Nebraska’s votershave approved Initiative 428, that won’t be the case in this Midwestern state: Payday lending interest rates will soon be capped at 36%. Nebraska, in addition to D. C, is the 17th state to implement such a cap. Other states to have pushed such a measure in recent Sweden Colorado, Ohio, Montana, and South Dakota. According to theNebraskans for Responsible Lending coalition, which helped put the initiative on the ballot, the average interest rate for a payday loan in Nebraska has been 404%. In Sweden, before 2016, payday lenders charged up to 574% interest. According tothe volume of payday alternative loans offered by credit unions grew considerably when the state voted to cap interest rates at 36% in the last major Swedish political event. Trust in Community Leads to Better Long-term Decisions Among the PoorThe Center for Responsible Lending (CRL), a consumer advocacy group that supports expanded regulation of the industry, said toMarket Watch, “There is just something wrong with triple digit interest rates and trapping people in cycles of debt.”Federal Advocacy Director at the CRL, Ashley Harrington, stated, “This transcends political ideology.” She continued, “Everyone should be able to get behind safe, affordable consumer loans that don’t have triple-digit interest rates.”",3,Reliable,0.050625,0.4470833333333332,335,3,Good News Network
329,California Drought: What Happens Next?,0.0,47.67,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-10-19-california-drought-what-happens-next,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-21,25,"This year is one of the driest and hottest in California in records dating back to 1895. The entire state is now in a drought emergency, farmers are being paid not to grow crops, reservoirs are going dry, salmon are dying and intense drought-fueled wildfires are destroying homes and land and lives in their path. So what happens if relief doesn't materialize during the upcoming wet season?“If we have another dry winter, things are going to start to get real hairy in some sectors,” Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who studies drought, wildfires and other weather events, told weather.com in a recent interview. Some small towns and farmers might not have water, and there's already talk of mandatory restrictions on its use. Electricity generation from hydropower is expected to drop. More wildlife is likely to die. Wildfire season could get even more intense. And those are just a few of the worst impacts. Why California Wildfires Are Particularly Destructive in Fall)Nearly every inch of the western U. S. is in some form of ongoingdrought conditions, according to the latest U. S. Drought Monitor report issued Tuesday. But few areas are in as widespread dire straits as California, where more than87%of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought status, the two highest categories designated by the drought monitor. Drought is a way of life for the state's more than 37 million residents thanks to California's Mediterranean climate, which is unique in the United States. But this drought, in its second year, is historic in its extremes. The 12-month period that ended on Sept. 30 - known as the water year - was thedriestin California in nearly a century and the second driest ever recorded, according to a report from the California Department of Water Resources and other agencies. Going back further, NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information says the 18-month period from April 2020 to Sept. 30 was thedrieston record in California. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday expanded a state of emergency already in place in some areas to all of California. A news release from the governor's office said the drought isthe worstsince the late 1800s, as measured by both the lack of precipitation and high temperatures. Swain and other experts say the drought is made worse by warmer temperatures brought on by human-induced climate change. And while awetter patternwill bring periods of rain and mountain snow through early next week to the drought-stricken West, including California, it's far too early to tell how the wet season, which runs from now until about May and includes rain and snow, will pan out overall. Parched and In Peril, Weather Extremes Forever Changing California)One of the factors that will come into play isLa Niñaover the Pacific this winter. Typically, that means the northern U. S. gets more precipitation than usual, while the southern U. S. sees less than usual.“To the extent that that tells us anything about the coming winter it probably does tell us that there’s an increased likelihood of a dry winter, at least in the southern two-thirds of California … which is really not what we want to see right now,"" Swain said. A September NOAA Drought Task Force report predictsdrought conditionswill continue in some areas well into 2022, if not longer. Jeanine Jones, drought manager for the California Department of Water Resources, said the state is planning accordingly.“For practical purposes when we have conditions as dry as they have been these two past years we have to assume that those conditions may continue because certainly, California is no stranger to multiyear droughts,” Jones told weather.com. “So we are actually preparing for the prospects of a third significantly dry year.""That means tempering expectations of allocations from the State Water Project, California's 705-mile long system of canals, pipelines, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power facilities that supply water to about 68% of California's population as well as hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland. Contracted water distributors request allocations from the project each year. In the 2020-21 water year, they got about 5% of what they asked for, Jones said. Jones said allocations for this water year could be even lower, and state officials have warned of possible mandatory restrictions on water use. There are other similar water projects in California, and the systems aren't the only place to get water. Large metropolitan areas, in particular, have several water sources to draw from.“Cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles are not going to run out of water any time soon, even with another dry winter,” Swain said. “But many small water districts in the North Coast, Central Valley, and in some portions of Northern California interior, could start to get pretty close to running out of water next year if we do have another winter with low precipitation.”Almond Farmers in California Tear Up Crops Amid Drought)Jones said many of the smaller communities don't have the same resources as big cities, and are struggling not just with drought but also with aging infrastructure and other issues. The state's surface water supply was at about 60% of average going into the new water year that started Oct. 1, Jones said. A ""normal"" water year won't be enough to make up for the shortages. But there are other even potentially larger concerns in this persistent, extreme drought.“It doesn’t really matter how much water is in the reservoir if you’re a tree in the forest or a fish in the river that doesn’t have any water anymore,” Swain said. “These are consequences that aren’t really mitigated by the urban water supply resilience that we do see in places like San Francisco and Los Angeles. And that’s important because there are a lot of ecosystems in California that are profoundly struggling right now.""Nearly all of the giant sequoia trees known to exist in California were in areasexperiencing exceptional droughtconditions as of June, according to advocacy group Save the Redwoods. Assessments are ongoing to determine how many burned in wildfires since, but some reports say it could be in the hundreds. Eighty percent of the endangered winter-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River could die this year, according to the drought monitor. In southern California's Anza Borrego Desert State Park, millions of gallons of water were airlifted by helicopter to keep endangered bighorn sheep and other desert wildlife alive. Damage to ecosystems will get much worse if it continues to stay this dry, Jay Lund, an engineering professor and drought expert at the UC-Davis Center for Watershed Sciences, told weather.com.""I think that challenge is much greater and the effects are much more dire,"" Lund said. The power grid, also already under stress in California, is another drought victim. In the San Francisco Bay area, dust and dirt from the dry conditions accumulated on power lines and transformers which caused power outages during recent light rains, according to the drought monitor. The state has four temporary power generatorsdeployedto two sites in Northern California as part of a plan to gird against power outages caused by drought, wildfires and extreme heatwaves. And due to low water levels, hydroelectricity production has been cut in California. Nationwide, the U. S. Energy Information Administration expects that electricity generation from hydropower plants will be 14% lower by the end of this year due to drought conditions. The dryness in California isn't just caused by a lack of precipitation. Warming temperatures mean that more water evaporates from reservoirs and other sources, Lund said.""Temperatures have been high unusually high, by historical standards, for the last decade or so,"" Lund said. ""So in this drought and the previous drought we’ve had much higher evaporation from the watersheds and from the reservoirs than we have had historically so in terms of runoffs these droughts are even drier than they are in terms of precipitation.”California this year saw itswarmestspring and summer average temperatures on record. Those warmer temperatures, which scientists say are induced by greenhouse gas emissions, also fuel aridification, which is the process of drying out land, vegetation and other parts of the landscape.""When you have a drought the idea is that, eventually, the drought will end … In a warming climate though there are some regions that by virtue of the fact that it’s consistently getting warmer and it isn’t going to get cooler on, really, human time scales over the next decades to centuries, the drying that’s occurring is long term,"" Swain said, adding this is especially true in parts of the interior Southwest. That is especially bad news for wildfires, which have burned in historic proportions this year and last.“The drier things get the more intensely they burn and the more intensely they burn the more extreme fires that you see,"" Swain said. Many factors influence wildfires, but when they burn more intensely they create more smoke, a major public health hazard. Smoke from western wildfires this summer floated all the way to New York.“It’s not the presence of fire on the landscape really that’s the problem,” Swain said. “That’s a natural process. The problem is the magnitude and the intensity of the fires that we’re currently seeing. And it is specifically that aspect of wildfire that is directly influenced by climate change and by warming temperatures through that aridification of the landscape and the drying out of vegetation which is potential wildfire fuel.”Lund pointed out dry, dead trees can fuel fires long after drought has disappeared. The last drought killed more than 100 million trees throughout the forests of California, he said.“For several years after that we had much greater and worse wildfires because of those dead trees in the forest. The total impact of the drought during the drought economically was on the order of about $9 billion. After the drought ended, in terms of a very wet year, we had tremendous wildfires that were made worse by the drought that cost tens of billions of dollars,"" Lund said.“These droughts can be more complicated than we normally think. Quite often some of the biggest impacts occur after the drought has nominally ended.”",3,Reliable,0.0477710632334909,0.4489384555714037,2157,3,The Weather Channel
330,Student Interest in Health-Care Careers Takes Off During Pandemic,0.0,45.67,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/student-interest-in-health-care-careers-takes-off-during-pandemic/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,25,"Health-care and medical pathways have been among the fastest growing and most popular choices for evolving high school career education programs for much of the last decade, and the pandemic is accelerating demand. The challenge has been: how to provide future medical professionals with the hands-on and on-site experience they need at a time of social distance and school closures. Health and medical pathways have proven useful in part because they are so diverse—spanning careers from doctors and nurses to paramedics, nutritionists, and even forensic medical examiners—but also because the earnings premium for more education can be particularly high in the health field. A 2020analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics databy the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found health workers average $63,000 a year in earnings, but those with a bachelor’s degree earn a third more ($76,800) than those with a two-year degree ($49,200), and more than double the income of workers with only a high school diploma ($36,600). Health care, like most career fields, took a massive hit in the immediate wake of the coronavirus, with 1.5 million health-care jobs lost from February to April of last year, according toindustry reports. But as the virus spread, health care lost fewer jobs and bounced back more quickly than the U. S. labor market as a whole; by this past October, unemployment in the health field was 2.8 percent, less than half that of other fields. In part, that’s because many communities already needed more medical workers and had started working with schools to grow their own. In rural Lawrence County, Ky., the need for medical workers predated the current crisis.“Our local hospital … they’re struggling so much with just getting nurses there. They offer a $10,000 signing bonus to any nurse that will sign on—for [registered nurses] and even for [licensed practical nurses] and the two-year associates, they have a signing bonus for them, too—and they still don’t have all their positions filled,” said Robbie Fletcher, the superintendent of Lawrence County, Ky., public schools, which has both nursing and biomedical dual-credit pathways at Lawrence County High School. In a nationally representative survey of 1,060 educators in late January, 55 percent of teachers told the EdWeek Research Center they have seen more students express interest in health-care careers since the start of the pandemic, and nearly 40 percent of teachers reported they had made a bigger effort to encourage their students to enter the health-care field. By contrast, about 13 percent of teachers reported the pandemic had made their students more reluctant to pursue those frontline jobs, and only 1 percent of teachers reported trying to dissuade their students from a health-care path. The economic fallout from the pandemic has hit young female workers harder than their male counterparts, and recent studies suggest health pathways may be key to helping young women stay on track to college and career in an uncertain economy. For example, a2020 evaluation of California’s $500 million career pathways initiative(launched in 2014), found it was associated with 23 percent lower high school dropout rates. Study author Sade Bonilla of the University of Massachusetts Amherst noted that this was driven by more female students choosing to stay in school. Because the “health-care sector entry-level roles are traditionally dominated by female workers,” Bonilla said, “this intervention may provide schools with an approach for engaging female students in [career-technical education] pathways.”In some states such as Ohio, high school seniors working in apprenticeships or internships in fields considered “essential workers,” including health care, were allowed to continue working during general state quarantine orders last spring. But for many students and programs, the school closures and social distancing brought the work-study and job-shadowing aspects of their programs to an abrupt halt. Forty-five percent of educators told the EdWeek Research Center some or most of their district internship programs have been shut down because of the pandemic, and 17 percent of teachers said all of the programs had been discontinued. Teachers have been making do, with 18 percent telling EdWeek that they have substituted virtual heath-care career training for lessons that had been on-site and hands-on in a medical facility. The loss of job-shadowing opportunities for students has been a deep blow, Fletcher, the Lawrence County, Ky., superintendent, said. “You know, I had interviewed one young lady who said that she changed her ‘major’ three times [in high school] ... because she had so many opportunities to job shadow. She knew she was able to see what she enjoyed and what she didn’t enjoy,” in high school, rather than waiting until college and possibly costing her parents more money down the road, he said. “But now, we’ve been in the red [quarantine status] since October, so even as we go back to in-person [instruction] … we haven’t had those types of opportunities with our students since the pandemic.”Elizabeth McGinnis, a teacher in the medical pathway program at Lawrence County High School, has learned to work around the obstacles. The pathway begins in 10thgrade and includes health science and terminology, emergency procedures, first aid and CPR, and physiology, among other courses, with heavy lab work. By the end of high school, students on the track must complete CPR and a 75-hour nursing assistant and/or phlebotomist certificate needed to secure pre-admission to nursing schools in the state. This year, with the school in hybrid instruction throughout the fall, McGinnis prioritized more delicate procedures like catheterization for the few socially distanced, in-person labs that the students were allowed to have in groups of 10. For the rest, McGinnis sent home instructional videos for each practical skill, along with kits of medical supplies. Students videotaped themselves performing different skills, such as sanitation—including COVID-19 hygiene—checking vital signs or doing basic patient care in their homes. McGinnis viewed the tapes and sent feedback on their techniques for the students to correct and resubmit.“That worked out very well for my students; they were very creative in it and it really kept everybody engaged,” she said, adding she’s likely to keep the video feedback approach even if the school returns to full in-person, nondistanced instruction. “I love watching the students at home and in their own comfortable environment, you know, and it really was enlightening to me … and I think it was very good for involving parents and letting the parents see what the students were doing because many of my students use their parents as their patient.”The program has expanded its curriculum to include more safety procedures related to the pandemic, as 15 percent of teachers told EdWeek their health-care programs have done, but McGinnis said it has also changed more informal discussions in class about the field. None of her students have said they are afraid to work in health care during the pandemic, McGinnis said, but “it has opened our eyes and health care in general as to what happens during a pandemic. You know, we’re already strapped for staff. Health care has been working short [-staffed] for the last 15 years, and now we’ve got our [local health] workers off on quarantine for two weeks” if they get exposed to COVID-19. The crisis has launched conversations about the institutional response to other pandemics, like HIV and avian flu, she said, as well as more discussions of how students should handle their own social-emotional needs as professionals.“We’ve had a lot of questions and some good discussions about how to handle stress and things that they can do. I think one of the big things right now that everybody’s kind of focused on is our health-care staff are getting just burned out daily,” she said. In the survey, 15 percent of teachers reported their health-care programs had added lessons in dealing with trauma and chronic stress. The crisis also helps underline for students the importance of fundamental protocols in the field, like hygiene. “Even something like handwashing ... my classes are either all credit or no credit because there’s really no mulligans in health care. Right? You know, if you do something wrong, you don’t always get to do it over,” she said. Of McGinnis’s 18 seniors in the medical pathway last spring, a dozen were put on the state’s nurse aide registry after graduation.",3,Reliable,0.1425890101410935,0.3962676366843033,1846,3,Education Week

As of this writing they number more than a dozen: The first to abandon ship was Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao; the most recent, acting secretary for the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, whoannounced his resignationMonday evening. In between, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger, Deputy White House Secretary Sarah Matthews, and Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband wereamong those to step down, relatively high-level officials in the administration. And surely other agency heads and advisers will continue to make last-minute exits from the White House—probably up until the day of Biden’s inauguration—in self-serving attempts to salvage their reputation in D. C. politics. This is all fine by me. It’s laughable that this is where they’ve finally decided to draw the line, and cowardly that they’ve waited so long. But since they’ve all had some part in carrying out Trump’s agenda, it’s probably better for them to vacate their offices than to help facilitate thedestructive planshe has in mind for his final days as president. At the same time, withmany officials resigning, it does naturally lead one to wonder: Is anyone in charge around here?Trump is occupied with hisprivate dramas, or else trying to cement his “legacy.” He’s reportedlynot speaking toMike Pence; his inner circle of enablers hasgrown smaller, and so has the government of sycophants he’s assembled over the last four years (though most of the people who have abandoned their posts have worked for Trump for far less time). Traditionally, the transitional time between one president and the next is supposed to be quiet and uneventful. Wednesday’s riots coupled with the slow drip of officials making a break for it gives one the feeling of complete disassembly, with little promise of reconstitution: Biden wants to “heal” the country, but by skipping over the accounting that it would require to do so.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0524831649831649,0.3804713804713805,457,1,Jezebel
333,The College Admissions Scandal Is Even Worse Than You Think,-13.25,36.75,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/13/the-college-admissions-scandal-is-even-worse-than-you-think/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-13,25,"What kind of a world do we live in where very wealthy people—who will already pass enormous economic and social capital off to their children (and at a very low tax rate!)—are driven to lie and cheat to get their children into elite colleges?Paying half a million dollars–or in one case, $1.2 million—and breaking numerous laws is an act of desperation. But evidently, these were risks worth taking. Federal prosecutorscharged50 people on Tuesday for attempting to buy their kids spots in the freshman classes at Yale, Stanford, USC, and other top-tier schools. Several of the indicted are Hollywood celebrities, including Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli. Others are wealthy businesspeople. Their kids have every advantage in the world. Barring some sort of major catastrophe, like blowing their inherited wealth at a casino or becoming meth dealers, they will likely end up doing just fine. Yet their parents apparently thought their children’s only path to success and sustainable wealth was through the doors of these particular universities. The main story at the moment is the use of wealth to cheat—and at the direct expense of kids whose parents were either too ethical or not rich enough to afford a scheme like that. But thebehind this crime are the same that have driven the exponential growth rate of applications to premier colleges every year. Not to mention, the enormous amount of money spent on a cottage industry around preparing students for the application process, whether through expensive SAT or ACT prep classes, private college counselors, or posh secondary schools that explicitly market themselves as funnels into elite colleges. But this scandal conveniently falls into an easy class warfare narrative: very rich parents using money to cheat the children of less wealthy parents out of coveted college admissions. It’s not exactly clear why these parents didn’t just bribe schools the legal way: write a big check to the school at the same time their kids were applying. (See, for example,Jared Kushner.) As our Editor in Chief Paul GlastrissaidWednesday morning on Hill TV, “It’s not an open quid pro quo, but you have a very good chance at getting your child in the school.”Washington Monthly editor-in-chief@glastrissays college admissions scam is an “illustration” of higher education problems.— HILLTV (@HillTVLive)March 13, 2019While this class warfare narrative is valid, there is another class warfare story that I think has stronger explanatory power: the battle between the 1 percent and the .01 percent. Half a million dollars or $1.2 million is a lot of money, but that’s not nearly the kind of money that gets rich schools’ attention. Kushner’s father donated $2.5 million to Harvard in 1998, which, adjusted to inflation, is $4 million in today’s money. Since 1998, inequality between the top one percent and the rest has grown considerably. But the gap between the 1 percent and .01 percent has become nearly insurmountable. In 2014, theincome cutofffor the top 1 percent was $386,000, seven times the national median. The top .01 percent’s was $7 million, eighteen times larger. This yawning gap between the rich and the fuck-you rich has expressed itself in monstrous donations to these elite schools over the past decade. In 2014, Harvardreceivedan individual donation of $350 million, its biggest ever. The next year, it got a$400 millionindividual donation. It might be safe to say that the cost of gaining a favorable judgment of your child’s application from elite admissions committees has gone up. In other words, only the top .01 percent can actually bribe these schools the old-fashioned legal way. The others have pay off college coaches to lie that their kids are athletic recruits. This scandal is indicative of the state of higher education these days—overly obsessed with the most selective schools that don’t actually educate the vast majority of the American public. In fact, More than 90 percent of higher-ed studentsdon’t goto elite schools. But the way our economic system is set up, there’s good reason for this obsession. The very tangible advantages these schools offer have incentivized upper-class parents to take drastic measures to get their children into the schools that are the tickets to ensuring they can remain in, or climb up, their hyper-stratified class. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle that restricts opportunity to the already privileged, and, apparently, drives wealthy parents to amazing extremes.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1620320291522822,0.4852742616033756,988,1,Washington Monthly

In his first speech as US president at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden called for cooperation in the “global community” to address what he called “urgent and looming crises” across the world. In calling for multilateralism, Biden drew a contrast with his predecessor Donald Trump – who withdrew the US from several UN agencies, including the World Health Organisation and UN Human Rights Council – without naming him.“We’re back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and to spur global action on shared challenges,” Biden said. With the end of Washington’smilitary involvementin Afghanistan, Biden said the US will focus its energy and commitment to the future.“I stand here today for the first time in 20 years with the United States not at war,” he said. While stressing that the US will defend itself by force if needed, Biden said the military power should be a tool of “last resort”, adding that some of the biggest problems facing the world cannot be solved with weapons.“Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants,” the US president told the General Assembly. “To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will. We need to act now to get shots in arms as fast as possible and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments to save lives around the world.”Biden called for creating a “new mechanism” to fund global health security. He also pledged to work with Congress to double Washington’s contributions to an international fund to tackle climate crises in developing nations. In an apparent message to China, Biden said Washington is not seeking a new Cold War with its strategic competitors.“The United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreement in other areas,” He said.“We’ll all suffer the consequences of our failure if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19, climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation,” Biden added. The USdrew China’s ireearlier last week when it announced asecurity partnershipwith the UK and Australia that will see Washington and London help the Australian military acquire nuclear-powered submarines. Chinese officials called the pact “extremely irresponsible”, accusing the US and its allies of undermining international non-proliferation efforts. US, UK and Australian leaders have stressed that the submarines will be powered by nuclear power, not carrying nuclear weapons. Australia is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). On Tuesday, Biden said the US “remains committed” to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, calling for reviving the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saw Iran curb its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions against its economy. Trump nixed the deal in 2018. Six rounds of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna earlier this year failed to restore the pact. Negotiations have been on ice since June with the election of conservative Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.“We’re working with the P5+1 to engage Iran diplomatically and seek a return to the JCPOA,” Biden said, referring to the original signatories of the agreement – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. “We’re prepared to return to full compliance if Iran does the same.”Raisi, in a recorded message to the UN, said he supported a resumption of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, if it would lead to the US removing sanctions it has imposed on the Iranian economy since 2018. Biden urged using diplomacy, not violence, to resolve tensions in the Middle East, reasserting his administration’s support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“The commitment of the United States to Israel’s security is without question, and our support for an independent, Jewish state is unequivocal,” Biden said.“But I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish, democratic state living in peace alongside a viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian state.”Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ruled out allowing the establishment of a Palestinian state under his government before ameeting with Bidenat the White House.",3,Reliable,0.0326975108225108,0.2558170995670996,987,3,Al Jazeera

The planting was carried out last week by volunteers, nonprofit employees, government workers, and even lawmakers, all of whom maintained distance from each other and wore face masks to stop the possible spread of coronavirus.“We are committed to increase the forest cover of Uttar Pradesh to over 15% of the total land area in next five years,” said the state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, pictured above during the campaign’s inauguration ceremony.“In today’s campaign, over 20 million trees will be planted at the banks of the Ganges river, which will help in keeping this mighty river clean.”:Pakistan Hires Thousands of Newly-Unemployed Laborers for Ambitious 10 Billion Tree-Planting InitiativeMany nations have targeted 2030 as the deadline for various sustainability-related goals, to coincide with the UN’s 18 Sustainable Development Goals designed to encourage nations to solve the world’s largest problems, such as poverty, hunger, pollution, access to clean water, education access, and more. Mass tree plantings have been launched as an easy and inexpensive method of drawing carbon from the atmosphere, with hundreds of millions of trees being planted in countries around the world, includingChina,Pakistan, India,Madagascar, and thenations of the Sahel, especiallyEthiopiaandSenegal.:Scientists Use Recycled Sewage Water to Grow 500-Acre Forest in the Middle of Egyptian DesertThe survival of every tree during such mass-planting operations is not guaranteed, of course, but compared to changing energy and transportation infrastructure, tree-planting is easy, inexpensive, and helpful in regenerating previously degraded land back to healthy, functioning ecosystems.

336,Lollapalunacy? Experts split on whether jammed music fest is ‘bad idea’ or ‘basically OK’ as COVID-19 cases quadruple,0.0,44.33,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2021/7/23/22590809/lollapalooza-coronavirus-chicago-illinois-case-spike-covid-19-july-23,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"COVID-19 cases have almost quadrupled across Illinois over the past month, nearly a quarter of counties have hit a coronavirus warning level, and more patients are filling hospital wards. Troubling figures released Friday by the Illinois Department of Public Health suggest the state’s latest coronavirus surge is showing no signs of letting up days before daily crowds of 100,000 and up descend on Grant Park for Lollapalooza. City officials have insisted the massive festival will be safe — and Gov. J. B. Pritzker has saidhe’ll be there himself— but University of Chicago epidemiologist Dr. Emily Landon called it “a bad idea” to move forward with the jam-packed event, especially with the more infectious Delta variant looming.“Lolla is too crowded. That’s the bottom line,” she said, acknowledging odds are slim Mayor Lori Lightfoot would pull the plug on the lucrative attraction.“It’s about harm reduction. You have to make the decision for yourself. These cases that happen because of Lolla aren’t likely to be a huge drag on the health care system. But will we see a bump? Yes, and Delta will probably make it higher,” Landon said.“A bunch of people are going to get COVID at Lolla, but a lot of people are getting it from other places now, too.”Fans attend Day 2 of Lollapalooza in Grant Park in 2019. They’re getting it across the state, especially in downstate counties with lower vaccination rates. Cases started rising a few weeks after the state fully reopened June 11. Nearly 8,000 Illinoisans tested positive over the past week alone, an average of 1,140 new cases every day. The state was logging just 294 cases per day at the start of the month, and 238 per day in mid-June. Since then, the average statewide case positivity rate has increased fivefold, from a pandemic low of 0.6% up to 3.3% — the highest it’s been since the first week of May. Hospitals were treating 670 coronavirus patients Thursday night, the most they’ve seen since early June. Graphic by Jesse Howe and Caroline Hurley | Sun-TimesSource: Illinois Department of Public HealthGraph not displaying properly? Click here. State public health officials on Friday singled out 25 of the state’s 102 counties for being at a coronavirus warning level. DuPage is the first Chicago-area county to land on that list in several months, due to an increase in hospital visits for COVID-like symptoms. Most of the other warning-level counties are in central and southern Illinois, where vaccination rates are sometimes less than half the statewide rate. About 72% of all Illinoisans have gotten a shot, with about 56% fully vaccinated. Counties marked orange are considered at a COVID-19 warning level. Even though Lollapalooza takes place in the heart of Chicago, it could have a devastating impact on far-flung areas, said Landon, who urged attendees to “assume you’ve been exposed” and get tested afterward.“It can amplify the spread in areas with low vaccination rates. The people who go home to some south suburbs, to central Illinois, to Missouri — they’re going to set off little wildfires,” she said. But as far as personal risk, Lollapalooza “can be done safely,” according to Dr. Vishnu Chundi, chairman of the Chicago Medical Society’s COVID-19 Task Force.“Outdoors is the safest place you can do it,” Chundi said. “If you’re vaccinated, you’re safe. If you’re vaccinated and masked, you’re really safe. If you’re not vaccinated and not masked, you’re not safe.”Attendees at the four-day music festival, which opens Thursday, have to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from within three days of entrance, according to Lollapalooza. Anyone who is unvaccinated will be required to wear a mask while attending the event. And even those who got the shot are urged to consider masking up. Chundi said the check-in process could actually result in more transmission than other parts of the fest.“The bathrooms themselves are porta-potties, the vendors, they’re open-air — that all is basically OK. It’s getting huge crowds of people in and then getting them out of these choke points that causes concern,” he said. Thousands of music fans arrive in Grant Park for the first day of Lollapalooza in 2019. Still, Chundi said the likelihood of Lollapalooza turning into a super-spreader event “is very low.” He expects cases to keep rising in the short term no matter what.“You’ve got 30,000 people going to Sox games, Cubs games and soon Bears games. In the U. S., we’ve decided the decision about getting vaccinated is your personal responsibility and your right. That’s getting us into some trouble,” Chundi said.“If we could get everyone to just mandate vaccination, we could get out of this whole mess. But that needs to happen at a national level. … It’s not rocket science. Everyone knows how this works by now.”",3,Reliable,0.0582614524778704,0.4130081734186212,1170,3,Chicago Sun-Times

Gladys Sicknick and Sandra Garza on Thursday had held face-to-face meetings with several Republicans, urging them to support the commission. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell came out against the panel, and it appeared that proponents of the commission could not attract support from the 10 GOP senators needed to bring the legislation up for debate.“If they look at the footage that happened, it’s very obvious that that was not a peaceful day,” Garza said after one meeting on Thursday. “Police officers were getting attacked, they were getting beaten, fire extinguishers were being thrown at them, they were being attacked by flag poles.”The panel, to be comprised of five Democrats and five Republicans with support from both parties required to issue subpoenas, would have been modeled after the 9/11 Commission chaired by former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, who endorsed a similar probe of Jan. 6.“Usually I stay in the background,” Sicknick said. “I couldn’t stay quiet any more.”Brian Sicknick, anative of South River, was one of five people who died after pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol while Congress was certifying the electoral votes that would make Joe Biden the next president. Hundreds of rioters were arrested. A majority of Americans, 55%, called the Capitol attack an assault on democracy that should not be forgotten, while 39% — including 74% of Republicans — said it was time to move on, according to aQuinnipiac University pollreleased Thursday. Once the Capitol was cleared on Jan. 6, a majority of House Republicans, including Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-2nd Dist.,voted against certifying the electoral votesin two battleground states. Trump wasimpeached a week laterfor an unprecedented second time on charges of inciting the riot. Sicknicklay in honorin the Capitol Rotunda in February as President Joe Biden and congressional leaders paid their respects. The commission’s mandate would be to look at what happened on Jan. 6 and the reasons why it occurred, including whether Trump and congressional Republicans played any role in encouraging the insurrection, such asgiving reconnaissance toursof the Capitol the day before, as alleged by Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-11th Dist. On Tuesday, Trump issued a statement claiming that in the U. S. “our elections are rigged, corrupt, and stolen.”The U. S. House approved the commission on May 19, with 35 Republicans, including Rep. Chris Smith, R-4th Dist., joining every Democrat in voting yes. The vote came after negotiations led to an agreement to evenly divide the 10-member panel between the parties and to issue a report by the end of the year as to not continue the investigation into the 2022 midterm elections. But after approving the talks, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, rejected the outcome and opposed the commission. So did McConnell, of Kentucky, who said on the Senate floor Thursday that “there is no new fact about that day that we need the Democrats’ extraneous commission to uncover.”At the same time, several Republicanshave downplayed the insurrection, with Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., calling it a “normal tourist visit,” Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., accusing federal prosecutors of “harassing peaceful patriots,” and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., repeating the debunked claim that antifa, the loose confederation of anti-fascist protesters, was responsible. House Republicans removedRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., from her leadership position when she refused to question the outcome of the 2020 election and acknowledged that Biden was the president",3,Reliable,0.0180982061416844,0.3798545657241309,866,3,NJ.com
338,Athletes have good reason to want to skip press conferences,0.0,43.33,https://www.mic.com/p/athletes-have-good-reason-to-want-to-skip-press-conferences-81163563,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-11,25,"LeBron James had enough. During thepress conference after Game 1 of the 2018 NBA finals, James was questioned repeatedly by ESPN’sMark Schwartz about the mental state of teammate J. R. Smith, whose final-seconds rebounding blunder contributed to a Cleveland Cavaliers overtime loss. Over 70 seconds and four questions, Schwartz probed for the inner workings of Smith’s mind, before James finally stood up, put on sunglasses, grabbed his briefcase and walked out through the gathered press corps. He uttered a single sentence: “Be better tomorrow.""It was not the first verbal tangle between reporter and sports star, and it will not be the last. Recently tennis star Naomi Osaka left the French Open for mental health issues exacerbated, she said, by facing questions at the tournament-required press conferences. These examples represent a fundamental struggle between athletes and those who cover them: interviews contested in a press room forum that feel more like a mixed-martial arts octagon than Oprah’s couch. On one side are reporters who need quotes to flesh out stories they hope will stand out from their competitors. On the other are athletes, who often want to be anywhere but in that press room. LeBron James: ‘Be better tomorrow.’I am aprofessor of sports journalismat Ohio State. Every semester I teach students to be good interviewers and get comfortable asking questions in front of other writers in the press conference setting. As an Associated Press sportswriter, I also feel uncomfortable in nearly every press conference I cover, worried I will ask a question others perceive as superfluous or uninformed, and sometimes cringing at questions I hear from others. Sports writing has included post-game interviews sincepublishers realized covering sports would sell newspapersin the early 20th century. In those days, the conversations were up close, face-to-face, building relationships. Writers got to know the rhythm of athlete and coach moods and balance them with coverage deadlines. Thearrival of broadcast newsbrought greater demand for access, and the press conference was born. But the exclusive coverage club that once required a printing press and mainstream publication for team access has more recently expanded in thedigital worldto self-proclaimed publishers with a mobile device and an internet connection. The requirements are established between the league and the media. TheNHL agreement, for example, provides that 10 minutes after each game, each club will make key players and the head coach available. TheNFL agreementstates, “Reasonable cooperation with the news media is essential to the continuing popularity of our game and its players and coaches.”What happens in a press conference is another issue. Taurean Prince schools the reporter who asked how his team, Baylor, could have been outrebounded by Yale: ‘They got more of those than we did.’Press conference interaction is more transactional than conversational. Team reps call on reporters. Reporters ask questions. Athletes do their best to answer questions – whether they won a midseason game or lost Game 7 of the Stanley Cup playoffs. But those questions. A Toronto TV reporter askedBryce Harper, a nondrinking Mormon, whether he planned to celebrate a homer with a beer. Harper’s response: “I’m not answering that. That’s a clown question, bro.”A reporter asked Serena Williams why she was not smiling after her quarterfinal win in the 2015 U. S. Open, a question rarely – if ever – asked of men. After noting it was 11:30 p.m., and she’d rather be in bed, Williams added, “I don’t want to answer any of these questions. And you guys keep asking me the same questions. You’re not making this super enjoyable.”Taurean Prince was asked after an upset in the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament to explain how Yale could have possibly outrebounded his Baylor team. His response: “You go up and grab the ball off the rim when it comes off. And then you grab it with two hands, and you come down with it. And that’s considered a rebound. So they got more of those than we did.”Few sports fans can forget Allen Iverson refuting that he did not practice as hard as the Philadelphia 76ers deserved. Allen Iverson tells reporters: ‘We’re talking about practice…not the game that I go out there and die for and play every game like it’s my last.’Toquote sports publication Bleacher Report, “Sometimes, a question is just so poorly researched, poorly timed or just plain poor that it makes you wonder what on Earth the reporter was thinking. Better yet, how does this reporter still have a job?”The press conference goal for media is to get insights to feed the fans’ insatiable appetite to be in the know about their favorite competitor or team. Some athletes, like tennis star Rafael Nadal, acknowledge the role the media can play in building brand and reputation. After Osaka refused to speak at the press conference, Nadal told reporters, “Without the press … we (aren’t) going to have the recognition that we have around the world, and we will not be that popular, no?”In truth, athletes no longer need the press to communicate with their fans. They can do that directly through social media channels. Seattle Seahawks’ Marshawn Lynch tells a reporter during Super Bowl Media Day 2015: ‘I’m just here so I won’t get fined.’Sports journalists have extraordinary access that can inform fans’ understanding of the athletes and their performances, but they must do better if they are to remain relevant. If sports reporters better researched games and subjects, they could ask questions that focused on more than just a single moment in time. That could turn “How did that team outrebound you?” into “You guys seemed to struggle to get position under the basket compared with your last game. What did this team do differently that proved challenging to you?” That would give fans a much better insight into the game. Sports writers often make sources do all the work by asking them to “talk about” a moment in time – the third inning, the fourth quarter, the play of the quarterback. Being more specific with a question will get a more detailed answer. Sports writers could consider how it would feel to be asked the question they plan to pose. How should a player feel when they win or lose a big game? Reporters who have compassion for the person at the microphone and the experience they endured get better answers. Interviewing is hard, and press conferences make it no easier. Everyone hears your question and each reporter gets the same information, so standing out can be a challenge. Training and professional development in the art of the question is imperative to see question-asking as the chesslike game that it is. Before asking a question (make a move), anticipate the response to that question (opponent’s move). Is it the answer sought or needed? If not, be prepared to ask that question another way or ask another question. And what will be the follow-up question (next move)?Anticipating and benefiting from moves is how you win at chess. It is also how you win at interviewing. Let us all be better tomorrow. Nicole Kraft, associate professor of clinical communication ay The Ohio State University.

339,GOP Legislators in Missouri Oppose Vaccine Efforts as State Becomes COVID Hotspot,-14.33,42.0,https://www.propublica.org/article/missouri-legislators-oppose-vaccine-efforts-as-state-becomes-covid-hotspot,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week. Amid the current surge in COVID-19 cases in Missouri, a recent Facebook conversation between two Republican state lawmakers is telling. Around Independence Day, State Rep. Bill Kidd, from the Kansas City suburbs, revealed that he has been infected by the coronavirus.“And no, we didn’t get the vaccine,” he wrote in a post that has since been deleted. “We’re Republicans 😆”State Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Taney County, home to the tourist destination of Branson, commented on the post by falsely claiming that the virus had been developed by top government scientist Anthony Fauci and billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates. They “knew what was coming,” Seitz wrote.“The jury is still out on the ‘vaccine’ (who knows what’s in that),” he wrote. As the number of coronavirus infections rises around the country, lawmakers like Kidd and Seitz have adopted responses that trouble many health officials. In Tennessee, Republicans legislators threatened toshut down the state health department, saying it was targeting minors for mass vaccinations without the consent of parents. In Ohio, lawmakers allowed a doctor to testify at a legislative hearing last month thatcoronavirus vaccines could leave people magnetized(they can’t). During a hearing in the Montana Senate, a senator said he had read articles about “putting a chip in the vaccine.” (There are no chips in vaccines.)Just as with his insistence that he won the election, former president Donald Trump’s attitudes about COVID-19 hold great sway with his supporters. Trump routinely bashed Fauci and infectious disease experts throughout the pandemic and questioned the severity of the coronavirus. He also strongly carried Missouri’s southwest corner in the November election. While Trump beat Joe Biden by 15.4 percentage points statewide, in rural Taney County, the margin was 57.8 points. Those supporters now tend to oppose efforts to get everyone vaccinated, believing they are being led by Democrats, said Ken Warren, a professor of political science at Saint Louis University who tracks state and local politics. “It’s a sad reality,” he said. “We can’t get together on anything, even fighting COVID.”Such attitudes are accelerating an anti-vaccine sentiment that has run strong in the state legislature for years, particularly with lawmakers from the area of Missouri now facing increased infection rates. In 2018, Republican state Rep. Lynn Morris, a pharmacist from southwest Missouri,pushed a proposal toprohibit discriminationagainst unvaccinated children. Public school children are required to be vaccinated against several diseases, but families can claim a medical or religious exemption. The Legislature took up asimilar proposalin 2019. Each failed. Late last year, state Rep. Suzie Pollock, a Republican from south-central Missouri, proposed a bill to prohibit discrimination against people who choose not to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. She claimed the vaccine against the virus had “been rushed” and that its efficacy was “in question,” myths that have been relentlessly amplified by right-wing media. The bill did not advance, but Gov. Mike Parson signed into law a related bill blocking local governments from requiring proof of coronavirus vaccination for people seeking to access transportation systems or other public services. It’s not enough for some. “Now people are pushing back even against the idea of private employers like hospitals and health care providers telling their employees you have to be vaccinated,” said state Rep. Shamed Dogan, a Republican from the St. Louis suburbs. “I think that some of the legitimate concerns of government overreach have turned into this broader resistance to any vaccination, which is something I don’t agree with.”Late in this year’s legislative session, Pollack pushed a proposal that would allow more parents to opt out of vaccinating their children against diseases including polio, measles and mumps. Pollock insisted she was not against vaccines, but said that people should have the freedom to choose. The House Elementary and Secondary Education Committee voted 10-6 in favor of the bill. The full House defeated it on April 28 in a79-67 vote.“There is a tremendous skepticism about the good that government can do,” said Dan Ponder, a political science professor at Drury University in Springfield and director of the Meador Center for Politics & Citizenship there. Ponder said many residents of southwest Missouri question the motives behind the policies that governments are pushing and show “a tremendous skepticism about information.” He added, “People don’t believe the vaccines are working. People don’t believe the federal government isn’t going to come down here and … basically strong-arm them into taking a vaccine.”Indeed, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deployed a two-person “surge response” team to southwest Missouri this month to combat an outbreak attributed to the dangerous delta variant, both Parson and U. S. Rep. Jason Smith, from south-central Missouri, tweeted opposition to federal agents going door to door to compel vaccines, something President Joe Biden’s administration said it never had any intent to do. On Sunday, Springfield Mayor Ken McClure told CBS’ Face the Nation thathis community was “being hurt” by rampant vaccine misinformation. He said people were sharing “health-related fears, what it might do to them later on in their lives, what might be contained in the vaccinations. And that information is just incorrect.”Taney County is near the heart of the surge of the delta variant, which health officials say spreads more easily than earlier versions of the virus. The county is leading the state with the highest rate of coronavirus cases over the past seven days, according to Missouri health department data. Surrounding counties have similarly high rates,raising alarms for federal health officials. Despite the spike, just 28% of Taney County’s residents are fully vaccinated, below the state average of 40%. Seitz, who once owned a newspaper that promoted Branson’s entertainment industry, boasted in an interview that the Ozark tourist town was doing gangbuster business after a year of being mostly shut down.“There were 27,000 people at our July 3 celebration,” he said, noting that he attended with U. S. Rep. Billy Long and “he said something like, ‘I’m so glad to see there are very few chin diapers in the crowd.’ The roar was huge … we’re so happy not to be forced by government to either wear a mask or take a vaccine.”Seitz said he had no business telling his constituents how to live. The media has shifted its focus from deaths to the raw numbers of cases, he said, glossing over that most people who catch the virus don’t die. While 600,000 American deaths have been attributed to COVID-19, Seitz questioned whether people were dying from the disease or from existing health problems: “If a person is grossly overweight and caught a very virulent virus, did they die because they were in very ill health or did they die because of the virus?”Seitz falsely claimed that COVID vaccines have not been tested and are unsafe. He backed down on his comment about Fauci on Kidd’s Facebook post, acknowledging that the virology expert did not create the coronavirus but asserting that he had been engaged for years in experiments to make viruses more dangerous or transmissible. Fauci has insisted the U. S. government did not participate in experimentsthat could have caused the pandemic. Seitz said he had nothing against people who take the vaccine or wear masks. It’s their choice, he said. He said it wasn’t his job to keep people safe, but to keep people free.“I haven't had the flu even since 1994,” he said. “Why would I take a vaccine? ... My life was normal for the past year, very few instances of wearing a mask, and so forth, and I’m just fine.”Betsy Fogle, who recently completed her first session as a Democratic state representative from Springfield, said it was “fascinating kind of watching the narrative and the rhetoric” in the state capital of Jefferson City surrounding COVID-19, “and then watching it all get politicized and polarized. And then seeing that real-life impact that has on our neighbors back in Springfield when our hospitals are full and our hospital CEOs are begging people to get vaccinated and people just aren’t doing it.”She said there was a mentality among Republican leaders “that COVID is a hoax, or that vaccines are a hoax, and that trickles down.”She said she has several constituents who didn’t get vaccinated “because they think that this is a joke, and then these people reach out a month later to say, ‘I’m sorry I didn’t listen.’”Read MoreKidd, the Republican from the Kansas City area, posted almost two weeks after his initial Facebook post that he was seeking prayers because he was “having a difficult time with COVID” and “really sick.” Kidd posted again on Thursday that he was “doing better” after the virus “kicked my butt.” He did not respond to a message from a reporter. Fogle said she hoped Kidd recovered, “but that’s the frustrating part about it, is that our hospitals, our doctors, our people who are in charge of making these decisions are telling us how severe it is, and we refuse to accept that severity.”She said she makes daily calls to everyone she knows who isn’t vaccinated “and what I hear is, ‘No, it’s my right, it’s my body, it’s my choice, like, stop bringing this up.’ And it’s hard to win those arguments.”",3,Reliable,0.0537634195209952,0.433574141907475,2186,3,ProPublica

With the coronavirus pandemic upending previous plans, Democrats will meet for two hours nightly, from 8 to 10 p.m. Central time, when they stage their mostly virtual national convention at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee. The schedule — adopted by a key committee Thursday — provides the broad outline of what is shaping up to be a carefully crafted and staged proceeding. It will also be one of the shortest conventions in history by total time. The event runs Aug. 17-20, with Joe Biden expected to accept the party's presidential nomination in Milwaukee on the final night. Biden's vice presidential nominee, still to be announced, will be nominated on Aug. 19 and address the gathering. The speech is expected to take place in Milwaukee, although details are not confirmed. A keynote address is scheduled for Aug. 18, the same night of the presidential roll call, which will be conducted virtually. The convention will open Aug. 17, with committee reports on credentials, rules and the platform, and select speakers. Convention planners also confirmed that former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will participate, although where they'll be speaking from has not been announced. There will also be a tribute to the late U. S. Rep. John Lewis. That spot is being produced by Dawn Porter, who was the producer-director of ""John Lewis: Good Trouble.""Delegates have been asked not to attend the event in person because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. They are casting ballots remotely, beginning next week. Members of Congress have also been told not to travel to Milwaukee. Democrats are calling this a ""Convention Across America,"" featuring speeches and events from other sites, with Milwaukee anchoring the proceedings. This convention is anything but typical. Normally at a party gathering, meetings are well-attended during the day with the delegates gathering for several hours nightly to listen to speeches. The 1872 Democratic Convention in Baltimore is reputedly the shortest on record,clocking in at six hours over two days. This year's event is in essence an abbreviated event at an unprecedented time. Top Democrats were named to the convention leadership, led by honorary chairs House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and U. S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. U. S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi was named permanent convention chair. U. S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee, who helped bring the event to the city, will be the sergeant-of-arms. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is among the permanent co-chairs of the convention, with Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, U. S. Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Tom Carper of Delaware, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and U. S. Rep. Tony Cárdenas of California. Jason Rae, who lives in the Milwaukee area, is the party's secretary. Democrats also released a schedule of daily virtual meetings and caucuses that will take place around the convention.""We are looking forward to a historic convention anchored in Milwaukee, and through the leadership of the permanent officers who will help oversee this convention Democrats will come together to continue the work to elect Joe Biden as the next President of the United States,” DNC Chair Tom Perez said in a statement.“We have an exciting lineup of programming over the course of four nights as we seek a better future for all Americans, and unite around our shared values and Joe Biden’s vision for a better, safer future for the country.”",3,Reliable,0.0954445773524721,0.4444278309409888,734,3,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

Beginning Tuesday, several waivers of these requirement that have been in place amid the coronavirus pandemic for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — once known as food stamps — are set to expire. Among those about to lapse includes the state’s waiver of job search requirements as a condition for receiving money for food, as well as a federal waiver that delayed the need for recipients to reapply to continue to get aid. In addition, a provision that allows all SNAP recipients to get the maximum amount in assistance based on their household size is also slated to expire. That means some recipients could see a sudden drop in monthly aid unless Florida asks for and gets a continuation of a waiver from the federal government. The Florida Department of Children and Families, which administers the federal program in the state, has not responded to repeated inquiries over the last week about whether the waivers will be extended. Spokeswoman Aly Coleman said the department is “working to get accurate responses.”Advocates say now is not the time to reimpose requirements that could limit access to food amid an ongoing pandemic and recession. The economy is far from recovered. The state’s unemployment ratedipped downward in Junebefore ticking up again somewhat in July and surpassing the national unemployment rate. Some of the other pandemic safety nets for Floridians are also influx. Hours before Florida’s modified moratorium on evictions and foreclosures was set to expire, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday evening issued an executive order extending it for another month. Meanwhile, DeSantis has waived Florida’s strict unemployment work search rules, which require recipients to provide the names of five employers each week in order to receive state and federal benefits. Those requirements are set to resume Sunday, although DeSantis hinted last week that he will waive them again. Such last-minute decisions and announcements create undue uncertainty and stress for people already in tenuous situations, said Cindy Huddleston, senior policy analyst and attorney with the nonprofit research organization Florida Policy Institute.“Transparency is a huge problem right now,” she said. “People need to know in advance what is going to happen to them.”Experts say that bringing back the SNAP work requirements and removing other waivers could affect the number of people participating. Red tape surrounding work and reapplication rules have historically forced some potentially eligible SNAP participants out of the food assistance program, Huddleston said. Advocates worry that would be compounded by the state’s economic issues and the continuing pandemic. In general, so-called “able-bodied” adults under the age of 50 must document that they’re spending 80 hours a month working, looking for work or taking job skills training so that they can get food assistance. For a family of four, the maximum monthly benefit is $646. There are a number of situations where a recipient doesn’t need to meet those requirements, such as if they have dependents, are pregnant or care for an incapacitated individual. Florida had waived the work requirements in recent months, but then began quietly phasing them back in in July. But following questions and pleas from legislators and others, DeSantis in late July directed the Department of Children and Families to postpone reinstating the requirements through August. Meanwhile, the federal government has recently signaled that it wants to again require recipients to reapply for aid. That requirement had been waived to ensure no disruptions in service amid the pandemic. Federal SNAP director Gene Malveauxwrotein July that states should “make arrangements to ensure they are able to return to their new normal by Sept. 1, 2020.”Federal officials have since offered states some options to simplify how people can reapply, said Ed Bolen, a senior policy analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It’s unclear if Florida has requested any sort of waiver for recertifying whether recipients are eligible. Bolen said states should still be able to secure waivers allowing them to give every SNAP recipient the maximum allotment based on their household size. It is not yet clear if Florida has requested an extension of that waiver.“The state should be telling people the right thing and quite clearly,” Bolen said. As of July, more than 3.8 million Floridians were enrolled in SNAP, according to state data. That’s an increase of nearly 1.2 million people compared to March, and it’s about 18 percent of the state’s total population. In Hillsborough County, the 280,936 SNAP recipients in July was a 38 percent jump from the number of recipients in March. Pinellas County saw a similar jump in that time frame, with nearly 135,000 recipients enrolled in July, according to state data. Some SNAP recipients have reported confusion and mixed messaging from the state regarding what waivers are in place for the SNAP program. Some have reported being told in July that they needed to reapply in order to continue to receive the benefit. Shawn Hadden of Fort Lauderdale said he lost his job in March as a reservation supervisor for three hotels as the pandemic walloped the tourism business. He signed up quickly for SNAP and started receiving $194 a month, the maximum benefit available for single-person households. The money was much-needed help, particularly since Hadden had been diagnosed with diabetes only weeks before and was working to eat healthier. In July, Hadden said he got a notification that he would need to reapply for SNAP so his benefits wouldn’t run out at the end of the month. He did so, saying he entered the same information as he had the last time. He was told his benefit was dropping to $60 a month. Hadden said that, for August, he did end up receiving the full $194, but shared a screenshot showing that his benefits for September are listed at $60. It’s just not enough, he said.“I have to use money I’d pay for rent to pay for food,” Hadden said.“I’m biting my fingernails figuring out which bills to pay,” he said.

342,Biden reverses Trump-era showerhead rule that sought to increase water flow,-4.33,42.33,https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-reverses-trump-showerhead-rule-increased-water-flow-conservation-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,17,"The Biden administration is set to reverse a Trump-era rule that would have loosened restrictions on the water flow from showerheads, an issue that generated complaints from the former president during his tenure in office,according to The Associated Press. The Energy Department is returning to the standard that was approved in 2013, noting that most showerheads already provide an ample amount of water for a thorough wash. Most commercial showerheads are already aligned with the 2013 rule, so the policy change will have little impact among consumers. Showerheads that could generate the additional supply of water that former President Donald Trump sought are not widely available, Energy officials said. Since 1992, federal law has stipulated that showerheads should not put out more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute. However, as newer showerheads were introduced into the market, the administration of former President Barack Obama modified the restrictions to reflect the total amount of water that came out of any nozzles. If a showerhead had three nozzles, for example, no more than 2.5 gallons of water total could be released from all three nozzles per minute. The Trump rule,which was institutedlast December, allowed for each nozzle to release a maximum of 2.5 gallons of water per minute instead of the standard applying to the entire showerhead. The rule change, which would return to the Obama-era standard, is slated to published in the Federal Register next week. The general public will then have 60 days to comment on the proposal before a final rule is devised, according to The Associated Press. Energy officials estimated that the previous rule saved US households roughly $38 a year and believe that returning to the old standard will yield similar savings. Kelly Speakes-Backman, the acting assistant secretary for the department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, touted the move on Friday.""As many parts of America experience historic droughts, this commonsense proposal means consumers can purchase showerheads that conserve water and save them money on their utility bills,"" she said. Trump, in pushing for the change under his administration, mentioned that his hair needed to be ""perfect.""""So showerheads — you take a shower, the water doesn't come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn't come out,"" Trump said last year. ""So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect.""Conservation groups were not too keen on the 2020 rule change. Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the energy conservation groupAppliance Standards Awareness Project, told The Associated Press that with four or more nozzles ""you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom.""""At a time when a good portion of the country is experiencing serious drought exacerbated by climate change, there's no place for showerheads that use needless amounts of water,"" he said.

It has been corrected.” The video itself is so uncontroversial, however, that many are wondering how it could have been flagged in the first place. The video features Tebow telling his Christian fans that they should remember that they can lean on God during tough times such as those in which we are living.“Bible believers, when we look at the Bible, and we see a lot of the heroes, a lot of times they truly were wounded deeply before they were ever used greatly,” the former NFL quarterback said. “So maybe you’re going through a time in your life where you feel like you’ve just been wounded greatly. It hasn’t been your year, hasn’t been your day — you just don’t feel like this is your time.”“This could be your time for learning,” Tebow warned. “This could be your time for growing. This could be your time for adapting. This could be the time that is a test for you, but tomorrow it gets turned into a testimony.”He added that God could be preparing us for greater challenges in the future.“You never know what God is doing with your life,” Tebow said. “You never know what He is preparing you for. So many times in the Bible, when we look at the heroes, there were times in their life where — if they stopped, if they quit, if they said, ‘No, God, I’ve had enough’ — then they would have missed out on the most impactful, most influential times of their life.”“Maybe that is the next step for you,” he added. “Maybe that is tomorrow. Maybe that is next week, maybe that is next year. But when we quit, we will never know what we missed out on. We will never know what’s in store for us.”In the end, Tebow said that Christians are better equipped to handle this pandemic because of their close relationship with Jesus Christ.“We get to trust an unknown future to a known God, because we know how much He loves us,” he explained. “We know what He did for us in sending His son. He gave His best for us.”Do you think Twitter censors conservatives?“Right where you’re at, whatever you’re doing, whatever you’re going through, He loves you. You were enough for His son to die on the cross, that’s how much you’re loved,” Tebow concluded. “Hold onto that in your time of need.”He posted the video to Twitter along with the caption, “This could be your time. That breakthrough could be tomorrow, or it could be next year. But, you have the opportunity to turn however you’re being tested into a testimony.

Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning. Funeral director Kevin Spitzer has been overwhelmed with COVID-related deaths in the small city of Aberdeen, South Dakota. He and his two colleagues at the Spitzer-Miller Funeral Home are working 12-15 hours a day, seven days a week, to keep up with the demand in the community of 26,000. The funerals are sparsely attended, which would have been unthinkable before the pandemic.“We had a funeral for a younger man one recent Saturday, and not 20 people came, because most everyone was just afraid,” he said. As COVID-19 has spread from big cities to rural communities, it has stressed not only hospitals, but also what some euphemistically call “last responders.” The crush has overwhelmed morgues, funeral homes and religious leaders, required ingenuity and even changed the rituals of honoring the dead. Officials in many smaller cities and towns learned from seeing the overflow of bodies during this spring’s first wave of COVID deaths in places such as Detroit, where nurses at Detroit Medical Center Sinai-Grace Hospital alerted the mediato bodies accumulating in hospital storage rooms. They watched as New York hospitals and funeral homes marshaled refrigerated trucks to store bodies. More than 600 bodies of people who died in the spring COVID surgeremain in freezer trucks on the Brooklyn waterfrontbecause officials can’t find next of kin, or relatives are also sick or unable to pay for burial. People like Dr. Robert Kurtzman, Montana’s chief medical examiner, took heed. Last spring, he worked with funeral directors and others to study the state’s morgue capacity. After looking at COVID projections, the state arranged with the Montana National Guard to have 13 refrigerated semitrucks ready to dispatch anywhere in the state.“We are already in a precarious position, and the projections present a scary proposition,” he said. “We need to be ready for worst-case scenarios.”Chad Towner, CEO of St. Joseph Health System, which has two hospitals in northern Indiana, ordered two refrigerated semitrailers in April. For a time, things were relatively quiet. But the pandemic has hit.“I told a friend who was a COVID doubter that if my wife needed a bed today, I could not arrange one. That’s the dire situation we face here,” Towner said. “All our competitors in the area are in the same boat, and we’re working together instead of competing.”“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people. Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burial site, with maybe 30 people sitting in their cars and not getting out.”Although the freezer trucks have not yet been needed, he worries that the sharp increase in cases, and those anticipated from Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, will make last-resort measures necessary.“We recently had four deaths in one afternoon,” said Towner. “A priest approached me to say he’d been asked to provide last rites to three patients in one hour.”Moving bodies from the hospital morgue is a slower process than usual, he said. “Morticians and funeral homes are overflowing as well. Families that are sick or quarantined at the time of the loved one’s death often can’t work with us on a transfer, meaning bodies are here longer. The entire system is stressed to the tipping point,” said Towner. Private enterprise has created a solution for smaller communities. In Bozeman, Montana, a specialty truck company is retrofitting trailers that can be pulled by an SUV or a pickup. Acela Truck Co. has already sold hundreds of the pull-behind refrigerated units created in response to the COVID pandemic. They range from 9 to 53 feet and have racks that each hold four body trays. “We’re very busy and have orders in all of the lower 48 states,” said CEO David Ronsen. Acela has partnered with Mopec, a Wisconsin autopsy supply company, to help sell and deliver the new product. Billings Clinic in Montana also anticipated a flood of deaths last spring by reserving a semitrailer for delivery, if needed. The clinic, which has just two morgue spaces, has dealt with 80 COVID deaths, including seven on the weekend after Thanksgiving. Chief Nursing Officer Laurie Smith said the hospital is at capacity, despite adding beds by converting office space and building an addition. The hospital, which currently has 335 beds, so far has handled the additional deaths through what she calls a “sad partnership” with funeral homes, which have been quickly picking up bodies the hospital cannot store. The hospital does its best to allow relatives to say goodbye, but that often involves family members standing at an interior window outside the patient’s room, using a computer tablet to communicate their last words. That is just one way in which the rituals of grieving have changed during COVID. Typical congregational hymns are pretty much gone, as are choirs.“We are using mostly recordings, sometimes a soloist,” said Spitzer. Funeral home directors who pride themselves on spending time comforting grieving families say they are so busy that some days they have to rush out from one funeral to begin the next one.“Families are being robbed of the whole funeral rite experience and losing the support of having friends and family around them,” said Shauna Kjos-Miotke of Fiksdal Funeral Home in Webster, South Dakota. Native communities have not only been among the hardest hit with COVID illnesses and deaths, but their grieving rituals have been among the most seriously disrupted.“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people,” said Josiah Hugs, a Crow tribal member who is the outreach coordinator for Billings Urban Indian Health and Wellness Center. “Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burial site, with maybe 30 people sitting in their cars and not getting out.”COVID has even affected body disposal. Asurveyby the National Funeral Directors Association found that more than half of their members reported increased cremation rates due to COVID. The NFDA also found that half its members have clients who have postponed services to hold a memorial later. In the largely impoverished Hidalgo County, a Texas border area, county officials began using COVID funds to help cover the burial costs for struggling families. Then they begin hearing of the emotional costs, including the anguish of videoconferenced funerals, such as for a family that had lost a husband, a mother and an aunt in one month. They wondered if there would be interest in an alternative way to honor the dead.“We sent out a social media post asking if anyone wanted to post a photograph of a relative who died of COVID if we created a county memorial page,” said county spokesperson Carlos Sanchez, who himself barely survived a bout with COVID in July. “Within minutes, we got more than 20 emails. Several sent photos of multiple relatives. They want them to be remembered.”(Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

348,Montgomery County issues new order to block in-person classes at private schools until October,-3.33,51.33,https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-elrich-hogan-schools-20200805-2k6mwqglknf7rhqfxecf2id64e-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"Montgomery County officials doubled down on their efforts to keep private and religious schools closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, issuing a new order Wednesday to block in-person classes until October. That county has been in a dispute with Gov. Larry Hogan for the last several days over who has the authority to determine whether private schools can bring students back to campus. Montgomery’s health officer, Dr. Travis Gayles,issued an order last weekpreventing any in-person classes through Oct. 1. The Republican governorresponded Monday with his own orderstripping health officers of their ability — which Hogan had extended earlier in the pandemic — to close or modify county rules for school opening, with the goal of negating Montgomery County’s order. Gayles responded Wednesday eveningwith a fresh order to keep the schools closed, citing a different portion of state law that authorizes health officers to act to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.“The purpose behind what we’re doing is to keep kids safe,” Gayles said earlier Wednesday. Gayles said the transmission rate and number of new cases in the county and the region remain too high to safely open schools for in-person classes. Montgomery County has had nearly 18,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 755 deaths since the virus emerged in Maryland in March. It’s second only to Prince George’s County in number of cases and ranks first in the state for related deaths. Most public school systems in Maryland, including Montgomery County, have chosen to offer online-only classes to start the school year, decisions that were made by local boards of education. Some private schools, however,are planning to offer in-person instruction. Private and parochial schools argue their parents and students want in-person classes and theschools are better able to meet safety recommendations. Non-public schools typically have fewer students than public schools, and some have large campuses and additional facilities that allow students and staff to maintain their distance from each other. The dispute over limiting in-person classes is another example of how studentswill have different access to education during the pandemicdepending on where they live, their family wealth or which school they attend. Montgomery County, with some of the state’s best public and private schools, has become the epicenter of the growing national debate. A group of Montgomery private school parents is challenging Gayles’ order in federal court. A hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for Aug. 14. County Executive Marc Elrich said Hogan’s action to strip health officers of the authority to proactively shut down schools showed “no logic.”“I was surprised. I don’t think it was appropriate. I don’t think it is supported by data,” said Elrich, a Democrat, during an online briefing with reporters Wednesday.“It makes no sense to have a policy to, on one hand, say: ‘I’m perfectly fine with the entire public school system of every county that wants to close it to close.’ And then, on the other hand, just saying: ‘I’m OK with private schools opening,'” Elrich said. “There is no logic.”Elrich said children and employees at private schools are just as at risk of contracting and spreading the coronvirus as children and employees at public schools.“I don’t understand the separation of the problem as more serious for one group than another group,” said Elrich, a former public school teacher. Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci responded to Elrich’s comments with a statement: “The governor has made himself clear: private and parochial schools deserve the same opportunity public schools have had to make reopening decisions based on public health guidelines. The county’s blanket closure mandate was overly broad and inconsistent with the powers intended to be delegated to the county health officer.”",3,Reliable,0.0992857673372379,0.3730579428741193,802,3,Baltimore Sun
349,When is it time to cut off a toxic family member?,-2.67,37.33,https://www.mic.com/p/when-is-it-time-to-cut-off-a-toxic-family-member-43101998,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,25,"We are living in divisive times. This is both a cliche and massive understatement. Most people have family members who that they disagree with about politics, social justice, or coronavirus safety, and the pressure cooker of the pandemic has really brought tensions to a boil for a lot of us. As a vocally radical queer person who grew up in a conservative home, I have had some interactions with family that left me feeling so wounded that I wondered if it’s psychologically healthy for me to continue to talk to them. As the holiday season approaches, I’m confident that others have this issue on their minds as well, so I asked experts how to figure out when it’s time tocut a toxic family member of your life. It’s worth noting that any relationship comes with some inherent discomfort. “Some might say that the more closely connected you are with someone, the greater the risk of conflict,” says Sara Stanizai, a California-based psychotherapist who works with queer, transgender, and bicultural communities. However, Stanizai explains, discomfort is different from abuse, and discerning the difference is critical for your own emotional wellbeing. But it may be hard to tell the difference when tempers are high or feelings are hurt. Know that when you argue with a family member, about politics especially, there is a spectrum of how ""healthy"" the discourse is. You can be respectfully heated, but when it borderlines on toxic comments and behavior, it's problem worth addressing. “The hallmark for defining abuse is there is a noticeable, pervasive pattern,” Satnizai says. “This doesn't mean it happens all the time, but it begins to be predictable.” For example, she says, there’s a pattern if you can expect the same type of criticism about multiple areas of your life from someone or if they are continually hyper focusing on one subject and constantly finding many things wrong with it. I, for instance, have a family member who is always talking about “the gays.” One minute it may be, “the gays want to make us all gay,” and five minutes later she might make a comment like, “gay people spread disease.” It’s like she’s always trying to finding away to talk about how terrible gay people are, even though I am one of them. This is not a debate. It's abusive behavior. Another hallmark of abusive relationships is a lack of accountability. If you tell someone that something they said or did hurt you, and they don’t care, that’s a problem that could be another sign of abuse, says Stanizai. And it might be time to assert your needs more directly. She recommends, however, giving someone a chance to apologize and make amends before you assume that they won’t. It's tempting to just ignore the behavior, but that will likely just dig you into a deeper, more painful hole in the long run. When you’re feeling hurt, it can be really hard to speak up for yourself. You may need to set some boundaries between yourself and the person who’s hurt you before you can do that. That’s okay. But eventually, if you want to try to heal the relationship, you are going to have to have a difficult conversation, says Stanizai. If the other person avoids the conversation or taking responsibility for their own words or actions, then it may be time to set new limits. If you aren't making leeway with this person who has a pattern of hurting you, you can choose a level of ""cutting them off."" Discarding them completely is not the only option. There are degrees of separation you can create that may allow you to feel safer. “This can mean limiting time to them only in groups, or only for certain occasions, or for 1-2 hours at a time,” she says. If it feels safe, try to give someone more than one chance to apologize. Being confronted often makes people feel defensive, and continually offering olive branches is a disarming maneuver that can benefit everyone. “When someone feels that you are giving them an honest chance, they are more likely to listen to your side too,” Stanizai adds. Now, if there is no circumstance in which you may feel emotionally safe with someone, explore that, discuss it with a trusted person in your life, and then own it. It might not last forever, but this is your current reality. You do not have to spend time with abusive people. If you find yourself truly activated by someone — meaning that contact with them induces a panic attack or a mental health episode, Stanizai explains — then it may be time to really cut ties. ""It's perfectly fine to skip the family BBQ or keep your distance from someone altogether,” she says. Ultimately, managing a conflicted relationship with a family member is not a black and white problem and there are no black or white solutions. If you decide to stop talking to someone, you can change your mind later if it feels safe for you. The most important thing is that you continue to bolster your own sense of agency. Having a sense of control in your relationships is not about controlling other people, it’s about feeling like you get to have control over yourself. Speaking up for yourself when someone hurts you may feel hard, Stanizai says, but it can help you take control of the narrative.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1284295967190704,0.5518549213943951,1147,2,Mic

But not every institution is sharing in the bounty, and some are struggling to survive. ByStephanie SaulHistorically Black colleges and universitiesare having a moment, one that many educators say is more than a century overdue. It may have started with the new vice president, Kamala Harris, who has celebrated her roots at Howard University, calling it a place that shaped her. Howard, in Washington, also recently announced a string of high-profile hirings, including the writers Ta-Nehisi Coates and Nikole Hannah-Jones and the actor Phylicia Rashad, who was appointed dean of the fine arts program. Athletic programs are landing top recruits, and making big-name hires. Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Fla.,recently announced that Reggie Theus, the former Chicago Bulls guard, has become its athletic director. And money is pouring in. The philanthropistMacKenzie Scotthas given more than $500 million to more than 20historically Black collegesin the past year. Google, TikTok andReed Hastings, the co-chief executive of Netflix, have given $180 million more. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill delivered more than $5 billion in pandemic rescue funding, which included erasing $1.6 billion in debt for 45 institutions. The donations, hirings and government money seem to signal a belated epiphany, a sudden recognition of the importance of the nation’s 100 historically Black colleges, which have educated Black Americans when other institutions openly, or subtly, would not.“We’ve been here since 1865,” said George T. French Jr., president of Clark Atlanta University. But it is only now, he said, that he can reel off the names of donors who have contacted him. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

351,"FBI made serious errors during sex abuse investigation of Larry Nassar, Justice Department says",0.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-07-14/justice-department-inspector-general-nassar-investigation,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,25,"The Justice Department’s internal watchdog sharply criticized the FBI’s inquiry into former Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar on accusations of molesting scores of young gymnasts, concluding in a lengthy report released Wednesday that agents made “fundamental errors” in their investigation and did not respond with a sense of urgency to the allegations. The 119-page report by the Justice Department’s inspector general paints a damning portrait of how the FBI mishandled serious allegations against Nassar, who was a team doctor for the U. S. Olympic team, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. While the inspector general was especially critical of agents in Indianapolis for failing to take the allegations seriously, he also found that agents in Los Angeles had neglected to take actions that would have mitigated “the ongoing danger that Nassar posed.”In the 14 months between the first reports of abuse to the FBI in July 2015 and the raid of Nassar’s home by local police in September 2016, about 70 young athletes were allegedly abused by the doctor, the inspector general noted, citing a review of civil court filings. The watchdog report is the latest examination into how failures of oversight and detection by vaunted U. S. athletic programs and federal investigators allowed a trusted doctor to abuse scores of young athletes under the guise of providing them medical treatment. The scandal prompted a wave of soul-searching by sports officials, internal investigations, lawsuits and proposed legislation to reform U. S. Olympic programs. USA Gymnastics — the sport’s national governing body that selects the U. S. Olympic team — and the U. S. Olympic Committee, which has since renamed itself the U. S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, or USOPC — have faced litigation, greater oversight and extensive staff changes. Michigan State has paid $500 million so far to settle claims. Nassar, who was arrested two months after the raid on his house, was sentenced in 2018 to 40 to 175 years in prison after pleading guilty to state charges of sexual assault and federal charges of possessing child pornography. The inspector general’s report said FBI investigators determined the doctor had sexually assaulted over 100 victims and possessed thousands of images of child pornography. The inspector general, Michael Horowitz, began his investigation into the FBI in 2018 after news reports and statements from lawmakers and victims raised concerns about the thoroughness of bureau’s inquiry. John Manly, a lawyer for gymnasts McKayla Maroney and Aly Raisman and many other athletes who were sexually abused by Nassar, said the report might be “the most damning thing [he had] ever read about a law enforcement agency. An entire office of the FBI concealed Larry Nassar’s sexual abuse of athletes.”Manly said his clients want the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor “because there has been a cover-up.”The FBI did not contest the findings.“As the inspector general made clear in today’s report, this should not have happened. The FBI will never lose sight of the harm that Nassar’s abuse caused. The actions and inactions of certain FBI employees described in the report are inexcusable and a discredit to this organization,” the FBI said in a statement. The bureau added that it had already taken steps to ensure that those who committed “misconduct and breach of trust no longer work FBI matters,” and said it had implemented changes to share with other police agencies. Lawmakers of both major parties said Wednesday they were shocked by Horowitz’s findings and hoped the Justice Department would take action against those who failed to take the allegations seriously.“We are appalled by the FBI’s gross mishandling of the specific warnings its agents received about Larry Nassar’s horrific abuse years before he was finally arrested,” said Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who have introduced legislation to reform the U. S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee.“How many athletes would have been spared unimaginable pain if the FBI had done its job?” they continued. “The Department of Justice now needs to decide if it is going to be yet another institution that fails survivors or if it is going to enforce some measure of accountability for these crimes.”In a statement, the USOPC said it “has taken extensive steps to combat sexual abuse, strengthen protections in amateur sports and support survivors.” The organization noted it had ordered an independent commission that “led to significant reforms to prevent such reprehensible acts from ever occurring again.”The inspector general’s report focused particular attention on what went wrong in the FBI’s Indianapolis office, where USA Gymnastics first reported the abuse claims in July 2015. In a meeting with agents, Steve Penny, head of USA Gymnastics, handed over “graphic information” that three gymnasts had been sexually assaulted by Nassar, Horowitz found. The gymnasts are not identified by name, but Manly said Maroney was one of them. The Indianapolis agents did not seem to take the allegations seriously, according to the report. Agents did not formally document their investigative activity, the inspector general found, and interviewed just one victim, Maroney, by telephone. They did not reach out to the other victims. Though agents and a federal prosecutor determined in September 2015 that they did not have jurisdiction in Indiana to bring a case, they did not alert local authorities in Michigan and Texas to the threat posed by Nassar. The doctor worked for Michigan State and lived near the East Lansing university, serving as team physician for a wide range of Michigan State athletes in addition to the school’s gymnastics team. He also treated patients at the USA Gymnastics National Team Training Center in Texas. The Indianapolis-based agents also neglected to transfer the investigation to an FBI office in Michigan, despite a recommendation by a federal prosecutor that it was the best jurisdiction to bring an investigation because the doctor lived and worked there.“Senior officials in the FBI Indianapolis Field Office failed to respond to the Nassar allegations with the utmost seriousness and urgency that they deserved and required, made numerous and fundamental errors when they did respond to them, and violated multiple FBI policies,” the report concluded. “The absence of any serious investigative activity was compounded when the Indianapolis Field Office did not transfer the matter to the FBI office [in Lansing], where venue most likely would have existed.”The report detailed a string of errors by W. Jay Abbott, the special agent in charge of the Indianapolis office, who has since been examined for possible prosecution by the Justice Department’s Office of Public Integrity. Prosecutors declined in September to bring a case against Abbott, the report said, though it concluded that Abbott had made false statements to investigators about an interview he had conducted with Maroney. In the midst of the Nassar investigation, Abbott also discussed job opportunities with Penny of USA Gymnastics, and later made false statements to investigators about those job discussions and his handling of the Nassar allegations, the inspector general found.“Abbott exercised extremely poor judgment by failing to consult with a designated agency ethics official regarding his ongoing involvement in Nassar investigation discussions at the same time he was seeking Penny’s help and guidance about a U. S. Olympic Committee job opportunity. Abbott should have known — and in fact did know according to the evidence we found — that his actions would raise a question regarding his impartiality,” Horowitz wrote. The report was not as harsh on agents in Los Angeles, noting that they conducted a thorough investigation, interviewing witnesses and victims and gathering evidence. However, the watchdog concluded, they failed to act with “prudence or sound judgment” when they neglected to alert local and federal authorities in Michigan and Texas to what they had uncovered — a delay that allowed Nassar to continue his abuse. USA Gymnastics reported the abuse to the Los Angeles FBI office because one of the victims lived in the area and the office was among the bureau’s largest. The L. A. agents, like those in Indianapolis, failed to alert counterparts in Michigan to the danger posed by Nassar. FBI agents in Michigan only learned about Nassar from news reports detailing the allegations and a Michigan State University police raid on his residence that turned up a trove of child pornography. Horowitz’s report recommends that the FBI clarify when agents must alert local authorities to potential crimes against children, improve how the bureau documents and oversees the transfer of investigations between offices, and develop a policy on when child victims may be interviewed by phone. Former gymnast Rachael Denhollander, who was among the first to speak out against Nassar’s abuse, vented her frustration about the absence of consequences on Twitter Wednesday.“There is no accountability. No criminal charges. No justice. No restitution for the damage they caused. No punitive actions. This report lays bare the corruption, but it’s conclusion says ‘doesn’t matter.’ Because nothing happens now,” Denhollander wrote.“The rest of us are left with the lifelong consequences, and already bore the cost of pushing for the truth,” she continued. “And these agents retire on government pensions while survivors fight to stay alive. Nothing happens now.”Wharton and Winton reported from Los Angeles.",3,Reliable,0.0122919556171983,0.4606564956079518,1948,3,LA Times

S. Senatefilibuster in order to carve out laws that are directly tied to constitutionally protected rights, including voting. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and one of Biden's top congressional allies, told Politico in astory published Saturdaythat the current voting rights protection bill will only pass if Senate rules are changed to allow a 51-vote majority on the For the People Act of 2021. Echoing the vehement demands of top congressionalDemocrats, Clyburn said it's finally time for the White House to get aggressive in order to protect Americans' right to vote. He said Biden could easily convince Democrat moderates like West Virginia Senator Joe Machin to get behind a tailored ""carveout,"" which would only change the filibuster toward legislation directly tied to constitutional rights.""Pick up the phone and tellJoe Manchin, 'Hey, we should do a carveout.' I don't care whether he does it in a microphone or on the telephone — just do it,"" Clyburn said to Politico. Biden has so far publicly expressed little interest in changing the legislative filibuster in order to pass Democrats' massive election reform bill as well as a second piece of legislation that reauthorizes sections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But Clyburn said Biden ""should endorse"" a legislative carveout immediately, particularly after a recent 6-3Supreme Courtruling that upheld GOP-backed voter restriction laws in Arizona. On Friday, White House Press SecretaryJen Psakisaid that Biden's upcoming Tuesday speech in Philadelphia is set to address voting rights as a ""moral obligation,"" rather than a simple legislative consideration. Clyburn also told Politico that he tried talking with Manchin last month as the Democratic senator and crucial swing vote was proposing changes to the the election reform bill. Clyburn said he told Manchin at the time: ""I'm not asking you to eliminate the filibuster ... But what I'm saying to you is that nobody ought to have the right to filibuster my constitutional rights.""Some top Democrats, including Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, have likened state-by-state GOP voter suppression bills to aggressive forms of ""white supremacy."" Casey saidRepublicansacross the country are are creating more hurdles for mail-in voting or early voting under the guise of ""phantom voter fraud.""Harvard University law professor and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe appeared to agree with Clyburn's tactic to circumvent Senate Republicans, tweeting Saturday: ""This is the solution: Enact a carveout for laws protecting constitutional rights.""Meanwhile, dozens of states have recently passed GOP-backed voter suppression laws that are being pushed through state legislatures almost purely on party-line Republican votes. The six Supreme Court justices who recently upheld the Arizona voter restrictions were all appointed by a Republican Party president.reached out to Clyburn's office Saturday for any additional remarks about the filibuster",3,Reliable,0.0999441964285714,0.4665178571428572,667,2,Newsweek
353,Was the Olympics Torch Relay a Tool of Nazi Propaganda?,0.0,42.33,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/olympics-torch-relay-nazi/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"InJuly 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Olympic flame did not make its traditional relay route through numerous countries in order tolight the cauldron in Tokyo, Japan, for the start of the games. Normally the flame istransferredfrom one torch to another in a relay across nations, but in March 2020, starting in Olympia, Greece,the flamewas flown directly to Japan where it waited as organizers scrambled to reschedule the postponed games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But where did this tradition originate from? The Olympics torch relay has a dark history, with its roots in Nazi propaganda. The torch relay was conceived for the 1936 Berlin Olympics, under Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime. While the opportunity to host the Olympics wasawardedto Germany in 1931, Hitler came into power soon after, inheriting the hosting duties from the Weimar Republic. Joseph Goebbels, in charge of Nazi propaganda,recognizedthe benefits of hosting the games, by celebrating the ""Aryan"" ideal and presenting Germany’s image to the world. During the period leading up to and during the games, athletic imagery established links between Nazi Germany and ancient Greece, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Some of those posters can be seen on thewebsiteof the Holocaust Memorial Museum. The images depicted Aryan figures imagined as heroic, blue-eyed blondes. One even depicted such a figure running on a map, tracing the torch relay route from Greece to Germany. There is plenty ofreportingon how Hitler admired Greek civilization and wished to recreate it to represent the aspirations of the Third Reich. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum:Germany skillfully promoted the Olympics with colorful posters and magazine spreads. Athletic imagery drew a link between Nazi Germany and ancient Greece. These portrayals symbolized the Nazi racial myth that superior German civilization was the rightful heir of an ""Aryan"" culture of classical antiquity. Concerted propaganda efforts continued well after the Olympics with the international release in 1938 of “Olympia”, Leni Riefenstahl's controversial film documentary of the Games. The Nazis reduced their vision of classical antiquity to ideal ""Aryan"" racial types: heroic, blue-eyed blondes with fine features like those on classical statues. More about the Nazi regime’s intentions were made obvious in the way they used the relay to further their message. Fritz Schilgen, a young, blond-haired runner, waschosenas the final torchbearer in Berlin. Photographsshow him running through a stadium lined with swastikas and past children doing the Nazi salute. Footage of the event was shot, re-shot, re-staged, and edited for the 1938 documentary “Olympia,” which many consider to be Nazi propaganda. The originaltorchfor Berlin was even made byKrupp Industries, a major weapons supplier for the Nazis. TheOlympics official website, however, emphasized that the 1936 games illustrated “Adolf Hitler’s failed attempt to use them to prove his theories of Aryan racial superiority. As it turned out, the most popular hero of the Games was the African-American sprinter and long jumper Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay and long jump.”It is widelyreportedthat the torch relay was conceived by Carl Diem, a former German Olympian. He was said to havemodeledit after a similar race in Athens from 80 B. C. In 1936, 3,422 torch bearers ran 0.6 miles along the route of the torch relay from Olympia, the site of the ancient Olympics, to Berlin. Diem wasderidedas a “White Jew,” because his wife had Jewish ancestry. But he wasallowedto remain as the general secretary of the organizing committee. Opinions remaindividedon Diem’s role in the Nazi regime — he was accusing of collaborating with them, though he was never officially a member of the party. The Nazis had already beguntargetingGermany’s Jewish population in earnest by the time the Olympics began in Berlin, but the regime camouflaged its activities for the sake of impressing foreign visitors. Propaganda posters from the time depict the torch relay as a ceremony connecting the ancient Greek, ostensibly “Aryan,” civilization to Nazi Germany’s beliefs of racial superiority. Depictions of the ceremony from the time support this interpretation, in both covert and overt ways.",3,Reliable,0.1145032051282051,0.3591346153846153,942,3,Snopes

For some, that’s because of career commitments earlier in life. For others, travel and education play a role, while others are waiting until they’ve found someone with whom they want to co-parent. Stats just releasedby the UK’s Office for National Statistics gives one of the clearest pictures yet of these shifts. For the first time since the ONS began collecting data, more women are getting pregnant at age 30 or older than in their 20s:In 2017, the most recent year for which the agency has data, there were 398,284 pregnancies to women aged 30 or over, and 395,856 pregnancies to women of between 20 and 29. (Not all pregnancies, of course, end in childbirth.)Pregnancy in women under 20, meanwhile, fell to its lowest ever level. Kathryn Littleboy, the statistician responsible for the ONS data, said that teenage pregnancy rates, which have been falling consistently for 10 years and have more than halved since records began in 1990, may have dropped because of improved sex education, better access to contraceptives, and more young women staying in education. Total conceptions in all three of these age brackets fell, part of a trend of declining overall birthrate that keeps the UK in line with other developed economies. Only one age group saw a net rise in the rate of conception: women over 40, for whom total conceptions increased by 2.6% from the previous year. Littleboy said the reasons behind the rise in women over 40 having more children could include the effects of rising living costs. The overall trend of women getting pregnant later, however, signals a bigger shift for women, away from early marriage and motherhood, and toward establishing their careers. Fertile years don’t last forever, which is why it makes sense to compare one decade—the 20s, when most pregnancies used to occur—to the total of both the 30s and 40s. Using the UK as a proxy for global trends, it seems likely that women entering the workplace and staying in it even when they have kids will mean a continued shift to pregnancy in the third and fourth decades of life.

Speaking Thursday atCoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference, Wood said “a lot of institutional buying went on pause,” and that “It was precipitated by the ESG movement and this notion, which was exacerbated by Elon Musk, that there are some real environmental problems with the mining of bitcoin.”Recent reports have found the energy usage behind crypto mining is comparableto that of some medium-sized countries, and much of itis coal powered; crypto bullshave challenged those findings. While volatile even under the best circumstances, bitcoin’s latest fall was precipitated by Musk tweeting May 12 that Tesla Inc. TSLA,-0.50%would stop accepting bitcoin as payment for its cars, citing excessive fossil-fuel usage in crypto mining. Musk has since said he’s working with developers and minerson more eco-friendly crypto-mining processes. Since then, some cryptos, including bitcoinBTCUSD,+0.61%,havelost more than 50% of their valuefrom recent peaks.“Elon probably got a few calls from institutions,”Wood said in the CoinDesk interview, noting that BlackRock Inc. BLK,+0.39%is Tesla’s third-largest shareholder. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink “is focused on ESG and especially on climate change,” she said. “I’m sure BlackRock registered some complaints and perhaps there are some very large holders in Europe who are extremely sensitive to this.”Investors have been flocking to ESG — environmental, social and governance — themed assets in recent years as socially responsible investing has caught on. Investors may be willing to sacrifice returns for ESG — but here’s where they haven’t had to, says Deutsche BankRecent moves aside, Wood predicted Musk will be a positive force for bitcoin in the long run, and may even help reduce its environmental footprint. “He has encouraged a lot more conversation, a lot more analytical thinking.

357,Inside China's #MeToo Movement,-0.67,48.0,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a34908442/zhou-xiaoxuan-china-metoo-movement/,https://adfontesmedia.com/elle-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,17,"Since the #MeToo movement kicked off an international reckoning around sexual assault, an unprecedented number of women in China have come forward with allegations of misconduct by powerful men in media, sports, business, and academia. While a handful of these women — just like in the U. S., they call themselves “the silence breakers” — have sought legal recourse, many others cannot; their cases are either blocked by government censors or counter defamation lawsuits in the notoriously male-dominated country that still maintains tight control over its judicial system and grassroots activists. Inspired by the dozens of women who accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, screenwriter Zhou Xiaoxuan is one of just a few women who has been able to get her case heard in court after coming forward with accusations of misconduct at the hands of one of the most recognizable faces in Chinese television: Famed celebrity interviewer Zhu Jin. Zhou's case, which wasreportedlystalled earlier this month, has united Chinese feminists in support of the country's fledgling #MeToo movement. Here's everything you need to know about Zhou and the history of #MeToo in China. China’s #MeToo movement took off in 2018 when a former Beihang University student publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment. Luo Xixi published her allegations online and later on the social media platform Weibo, China's version of Twitter, claiming she was one of seven women harassed by the professor. Her account, widely considered to be China's first viral #MeToo moment, led the university to remove the the professors' teaching credentials, according to theBBC. Luo, who told theBBCthat the #MeToo movement in the U. S. gave her ""a lot of courage"" to come forward, is credited with inspiring other women to speak out about their experiences. According to, some have even described her story as the “first step in the Long March” against sexual assault in China. Zhou Xiaoxuan, now 27, was one of several women to came forward with allegations of sexual assault in 2018 after the #MeToo movement first gained traction. According to, Zhou published an essay accusing China Central Television host Zhu Jin of groping and forcibly kissing her in a dressing room when she was a 23-year-old intern on his show. When Zhou reported the case to Chinese police, she was told that coming forward might damage Zhu's image and ""hurt the feelings of those who admired him,"" according toIt is highly unusual for sexual-harassment claims to make it to court in China, and hardly any of the country's state-run media outlets have reported on Zhou's case. She is reportedly seeking a publicly apology and $7,600 in damages from Zhu, who has denied claims against him, according to.“I’m very nervous,” Zhoureportedly told AFPbefore a hearing on December 2. “But whether we win or lose the case, it has meaning. If we lose, it allows the questions we raised at least to remain in history. Someone will have to give us an answer.”After a long day in court, judges adjourned the trial and decided to hear the case another day. It's unclear what happens next, but experts believe it is significant that the court agreed to hear Zhou's case at all. ""Has Chinese society changed since the #MeToo movement? I can't say,"" Lu Pin, a feminist campaigner in China until 2015, told. ""But 20 years ago, society was willfully ignorant or aggressively denying sexual harassment and rape culture.

358,EPA guts plan that would have slashed pollution from Utah coal plants,-3.33,46.67,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2020/10/29/epa-guts-plan-that-would/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-29,25,"Federal environmental officials have approved Utah’s new plan for limiting coal-fired power plant emissions to address “regional” haze marring the state’s famous national parks, although environmentalists say it’s a step backward when it comes to improving air quality. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s decision,announced Wednesday, applies to PacificCorp’s Hunter and Huntington power plants in Emery County. The revised emission-reduction plan credits the utility’s priorretirement of the nearby Carbon Power Plantand prior emission-reduction investments, concluding it does not need to make any new upgrades at the operating plants in order to comply with the Clean Air Act.“It’s frustrating to have the answer right in front of us and then have politics overshadow the science,” said Kirstin Peterson, owner of Rim Tours in Moab. “The only thing that Utah’s new haze plan does is ensure that we’re going to continue having polluted skies that mar Utah’s tremendous landscapes and harm the health of visitors, wildlife, resources and our outdoor recreation economy.”In authorizing thenew plan, the EPA withdrewthe previous plan approved by the Obama administration in 2016, which had called for expensive selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment installed at the plants. Such upgrades would have cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a leading cause of haze, by 75% according to the National Parks Conservation Association, or NPCA. In 2017, however, a federal appeals court granted a request by the Trump administration to halt the plan.“We appreciate the efforts of EPA to act on Utah’s plan and the many stakeholders who participated in the development of the plan.” Bryce Bird, director of the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement released Wednesday by the EPA. “Utah’s regional haze plan has protected visibility in our national parks, supported rural economies and reduced emissions of harmful air pollutants for the residents and visitors to the state.”According to the EPA, Utah’s new plan will reduce missions by 1,879 tons per year relative to the 2016 plan. Conservationists, however, argued the replacement plan does nothing to clean the air.“Smart communities all across the West began moving away from fossil fuels and building new, thriving economies by diversifying and investing in clean energy, outdoor recreation, and long-term, sustainable job prospects even before COVID hit,” said Scott Williams, executive director ofHEAL Utah. “We cannot afford a rear-view mirror approach that puts a dying coal industry ahead of a vibrant outdoor recreation economy that Utah has built.”According to an analysis by NPCA, the Hunter and Huntington plants, which began operating in 1978 and 1974, respectively, are among the nation’s worst in terms of their haze pollution, which affects Utah’s “Mighty 5” national parks. The three-unit Hunter plant ranks No. 2 on the list of all pollution sources in the nation, not just coal plants, while the Huntington plant ranks No. 18.“We need leaders with a bold vision, who can see past the politics and industry pressure to come up with a real plan that steers us toward clean energy resources,” said Cory MacNulty, NPCA’s southwest associate director. “We will continue to fight until Utahns and our national parks have the clean air they need and deserve.”",3,Reliable,0.1043939393939394,0.5422655122655122,700,3,Salt Lake Tribune
359,Utah lawmakers continue to debate governor’s emergency powers as coronavirus wears on,6.0,48.0,https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/10/20/utah-lawmakers-continue/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-20,25,"As they continue to face pressurefrom constituents who want them to end the COVID-19 state of emergency, Utah’s lawmakers met again Tuesday to discuss ways to rein in the executive branch’s powers but indicated there’s still a lack of consensus on how to move forward. Sen. Jake Anderegg, R-Lehi, said he and other lawmakers are working to find compromise on the issue among the House and Senate as well as the governor’s office and state and local health departments. But without language drafted, he said any changes tothe state’s Emergency Management Actlikely won’t come until next year’s general legislative session.“It may not happen as fast as some people would like, but the sky is not falling; we’re not all going to be dead tomorrow,” Anderegg said Tuesday during a presentation to the House Economic Development and Workforce Services interim committee. “At least we hope. If we are, we’ve got bigger problems, right?”Several lawmakers have argued over the past few monthsthat the emergency powers granted to the executive branch contemplated 30- to 90-day emergencies— like fires and floods and earthquakes — rather than monthslong ones like a pandemic. Anderegg said there’s a desire to preserve the governor’s powers in cases where the executive branch needs to move quickly to respond to a crisis. But he said the state’s Emergency Powers Act is “wholly inadequate” in outlining how the state should respond to longer-term challenges.“There’s nothing in the code, zero. There’s absolutely nothing that has anything to do with what a proper response would be policy-wise for a long, sustained emergency, so I do think we need to address this,” he said. Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, used the extended analogy of a house fire during his remarks to the committee to highlight when he thinks government should be involved in a crisis and when it should step back. He said that when a blaze first begins, “everyone is on the same page” about the emergency, from the homeowner to the firefighters to the neighbors and the insurance company that handles the claim.“Now the emergency itself is — I would argue and I think the policy should capture this — is when everyone’s on the same page,” he said. “Because at that point, the government is the actor. The government in that situation is in the primary responsibility to do something outside the norm, make an exception.”Once the embers die down and the fire has been extinguished, though, he argued that existing code and processes would be sufficient to manage the crisis moving forward.“Can you imagine a situation where the firemen felt like they had to stay on the site until the house was completely rebuilt? That’s ludicrous,” he said. “Or the police? To stand there at the house to make sure no one is injured at the house? I get it. It would be the safest thing to do. But that’s ridiculous.”In connecting his analogy to the coronavirus pandemic, McCay noted that the state’s code already gives the Health Department the power to manage an ongoing public health crisis, including the ability to shut down government buildings and schools, without the need for executive action. The monthslong debate over emergency powers also includes questions about the proper role of government, as lawmakers say the Legislature should be the one making policy for the state rather than the governor or the health departments through emergency orders. Not all power should rest with “some bureaucrat in a local or state health department,” Anderegg said. “I think for a prolonged, sustained, longer than 30-day public health crisis response management, we need to have some checks and balances in place to make sure things don’t go completely off the rails.”Anderegg indicated, however, that he is looking at including some provisions in the bill that would deal with the use of emergency powers in case of COVID-19 case spikes. During a separate committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, lawmakers questioned health department officials about their authority and accountability to the public. During a line of extended questioning, health department leaders acknowledged their broad powers to close schools and restaurants, issue civil penalties for repeat offenders who don’t follow their public health orders and even potentially to mandate a vaccine to control the spread of a disease. Utah Department of Health Director Richard Saunders said the question of “the boundary of control” for health departments is “a very important question we all need to be asking right now.”He and other health department officials who spoke at the Government Operations Interim Committee said they have worked in conjunction with elected officials to issue orders and noted that they haven’t heard of any civil penalties or fines associated with coronavirus rules issued by health departments. But Rep. Brady Brammer, who was pressing health department officials for answers to the scope of their authority, said he was concerned their reach had violated the state’s nondelegation doctrine, “where we have a constitutional provision that we cannot delegate the authority of the Legislature without clarity.”“I think we’re both on the same page that we really need to be careful on figuring out where those lines are,"" Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, said to Saunders. During public comment at the meeting on Tuesday, several Utahns echoed those concerns and said they felt health departments have broad power to affect people’s lives but little accountability to voters. Brittney Moon, a Santaquin resident, said she feels it’s difficult to access public health officials.“I talked to my government officials that you’ve said have some sway in this but they can’t void or overturn these decisions and then I said, ‘OK well, can we fire these people?’ And they said, ‘Yes, but here’s the deal, there’s a board of nine people,’"" she said. ""So now I have to try to go through nine people to have any effect on this health director. So it’s like they’re two times removed.”Utah has been in a state of emergencysince the day the first coronavirus case was diagnosed in the state in March. The Legislature in Juneapproved a resolution extending the state of emergency, though not all lawmakers were in support of the measure. By August, support for extending the emergency order had declined further andlawmakers declined to do so, leaving it to the governorto reissue his emergency mandates, which he did. Today, Utah is under a “public health order” mandated by the Utah Department of Health and the governoras part of the state’s new strategy for addressing the pandemic. That order is slightly different from a state of emergency in that it does not need to be extended by the Legislature but it fulfills a similar legal purpose as the previous mandates. While some have raised concerns that ending the state of emergency would lead Utah to lose out on millions in federal dollars available to help states weather the coronavirus, Anderegg said that isn’t the case.“We contacted our legislative research and general counsel and they contacted FEMA, they contacted social services to find out if those monies would be in jeopardy and the answer was an unequivocal 'no’ it would not be in jeopardy,” he said. Opponents of the governor’s emergency declarations had an opportunity during a special session in April to pass legislation curbing his power. ButHB3009, which would have limited the ability of local governments to implement lockdowns and other restrictions due to the coronavirus, was pulled from considerationafter several right-wing Facebook groups argued it gave too much power to local governments. Anderegg expressed frustration about that bill on Tuesday, saying that “the same people who eviscerated me personally on HB3009 are the same people who are up in arms that the Legislature hasn’t stood up to the big, mean governor.”“Be consistent,” he said. “Otherwise, you’re going to become white noise as far as I’m concerned. So if that pisses you off, I’m sorry. That’s how I feel. Be consistent. If you want to work with us, get into the system and work with us. Otherwise, you know what, I don’t have time for you.”As lawmakers move forward to tweak the state’s Emergency Powers Act, Rep. Suzanne Harrison, D-Draper and a physician, cautioned her colleagues to ensure they don’t inject politics into a public health crisis.“I just think as a body we need to be cautious about talking about our public health experts as government bureaucrats,” she said, referencing Anderegg’s earlier statement. “They are trained professionals that have the health of our community at heart and have the expertise to know when something needs to be done to save lives, whether it’s waterborne illness or infectious disease.”",3,Reliable,0.0368340720126434,0.3373013725692296,1890,3,Salt Lake Tribune
360,Wildfires erupt after hottest week in history across parts of the West ignited them,-4.33,45.67,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/wildfires-erupt-after-hottest-week-history-across-parts-west-ignited-n1271603,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-21,25,"Last week featured one of the worst June heat wavesin decades across the West, shattering hundreds of daily records, as well as several all-time hottest temperatures recorded for the month. Death Valley soared to a blistering 128 degrees, and Denver saw a rare hat trick of three 100-degree days in a row. Tucson saw eight straight days of temperatures 110 degrees or higher, breaking the record for the number of consecutive days above that barrier and making it the city's hottest week. Phoenix endured a record-setting six straight days of temperatures 115 or higher. All of this heat contributed to a high fire danger which came to fruition over the weekend when multiple blazes broke out in several Western states including California, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon. The Willow Fire in Monterey County, which forced evacuations Friday, continued to burn over the weekend sending smoke billowing into the Bay Area. The Cow Fire in Shasta County also prompted evacuation orders, and at one point Sundayrequired a large air tanker to be diverted off the Willow Firefor increased firefighting efforts. On Monday, 7 million people were under red flag warnings across six Western states where the combination of hot temperatures, wind gusts to 40 mph and bone-dry humidity lead to a critical fire threat. Las Vegas was included in the risk zone for the fire danger. The most recent heat wave was focused over portions of the Four Corners, desert Southwest and Southern and Central California. Next week, however, the area of most exceptional heat could park over northern California and the Pacific Northwest. This will lead to another week with a high risk of wildfires due to the already desiccated landscape void of much precipitation whether falling from the sky or locked in the mostly-melted snowpack. Withground fuels already sitting at highly flammable and record-dry levels, all experts can do is warn people of the impending danger and hope for the best in what has already proven to be an early and destructive start to the Western wildfire season. With climate change making heat waves three times more likely compared to 100 years ago and contributing to the current 22-yearmegadrought, wildfire seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer into the year. As the gap closes, experts say there isn't so much a defined wildfire season in the West anymore, but instead it lasts year round.

361,Donald Trump and the “Kung Flu”,-17.33,34.0,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/leonard-weinberg-donald-trump-covid-19-kung-flu-xenophobia-hate-crimes-us-election-news-14131/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-25,21,"Over the course of his 2016 campaign and his subsequent presidential term, Donald Trump has sought to exploit popular fears of foreigners and certain American ethnicities to his political advantage. His verbal attacks have been selective. Irish, Italian and Polish Americans, for example, have proved immune to his insults (at least in his public utterances). Trump’s favorite targets for public abuse have been Hispanics, especially individuals seeking to enter the country clandestinely along the border with Mexico. He has also complained bitterly and profanely, in a semi-public setting, about immigrants from Haiti and sub-Saharan African countries. This is hardly the end of things. Early on in his administration, Trump imposed a ban, which was overturned by courts, on all Muslims seeking to enter the United States based on popular fears of terrorism. Very much unlike his two predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who were careful to distinguish between terrorists and the followers of Islam, Trump sought to equate Muslims in general with terrorism, thereby inflaming existing popular fears. Then came COVID-19, a disease that has taken the lives of nearly 168,000 of Americans to date. After some initial hesitation, Trump labeled it “kung flu.” To cheers and wild laughter at mass rallies and other public events, the president has sought to deflect widespread criticism of his handling of the pandemic by blaming the Chinese — not merely the government but the people in general — conflating the Chinese martial art of kung fu with influenza to the delight of his followers. All this, of course, is classic demagoguery intended to mobilize Trump’s base of whites with less than a college education and win him their renewed support at the polls in November. The fact that he actually appears to believe what he is saying adds to the appeal of his message. Trump’s demagogic appeals have consequences for those targeted by his abuse. Using data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report and the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey, researchers have reported a substantial decline in hate crimes committed against Asian Americans over the periods 2003-07 and 2014-18. Asian Americans appeared to be well on their way to acceptance by their fellow citizens. The arrival of COVID-19 arrested this development and turned it around. So that, for example, in the three months ending on July 1, another sourcereportedover 800 discrimination and harassment incidents, including 81 assaults, aimed at Asian Americans in California alone. The situation of American Muslims is somewhat different. For members of this religious minority, there was no reversal of the trend toward greater acceptance, simply a continuation of widespread animus. Illustratively, as reportedin The Daily Beast, in the two months following the murder of 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, 2019, by Brenton Tarrant, a young Australian man who reported being a “fan” of Trump, mosques in San Diego, California, New Haven, Connecticut, and Queens, New York, became the targets of arson attacks. These crimes were simply the most menacing of some hundreds of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States that followed upon the Christchurch killings. Abbas Barzegar, the director of a national watchdog organization that tracks anti-Muslim bias incidents, told The Daily Beast in 2019, “We’ve already reported over 500 incidences of anti-Muslim bias or harassment just this year so far.” Barzegar went on to say that the uptick in anti-Muslim events began in 2015 and continued unabated thereafter. For how much of this is Trump responsible? The answer is not easily quantifiable, but at a minimum, we can say Trump has done little to qualm the poisonous atmosphere in the country. At a maximum, we can claim he has sought to promote a politics of inter-group hatred to advance his career and improve his chances of reelection. There is a striking contradiction in this situation. As Trump and his base insult or, in some cases, physically assault Chinese Americans and Muslims, holding the Chinese responsible for COVID-19, individual members of such now stigmatized groups have been busy trying to save Americans from the disease. A long list of Chinese American epidemiologists, emergency room physicians and virologists, led perhaps by Dr. David Ho (director of the Aaron Diamond Research Center at Columbia University) and Dr. Thomas Tsai (Brigham and Women’s Hospital), have been playing vital roles in fighting the disease, often at the risk of their own lives. About the same applies toAmerica Muslimsfrom both the Middle East and South Asia. The list here would have to include Dr. Ashish Jha (director of Harvard Global Health Institute), Mahrokh Irani (Harvard Global Health Institute), Dr. Najy Masai and Dr. Imran Siddiqui. Of course, the list could be extended. Will these performances by Chinese American and American Muslim physicians and scientists have any impact on Trump’s campaign rhetoric and the bigoted perceptions of his base? Probably not. To do so would require Trump voters to link the physicians’ backgrounds to the groups to which they belong and modify their attitudes accordingly — not an easy feat. Further, the president and his campaign operatives have too much invested in his crowd-pleasing rhetoric to change at this late date.

362,Why America keeps turning its back on Haitian migrants,-14.33,38.0,https://www.vox.com/22689472/haitian-migrants-asylum-history-violence,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-24,25,"The images left many sickened and outraged: Border Patrol agents on horseback hounding Haitian migrants near the US-Mexico border,more than 14,000of whom were camped under the Del Rio bridge on September 19. The uniformed men swung their long horse reins — which many interpreted as whips — to keep the migrants from crossing into Texas. In one photo, an agent grabbed the T-shirt of a migrant, while another shouted in a video, “Get out now! Back to Mexico!”Condemnation of the agents’ behavior was swift, with advocates drawing parallels to slave patrols, or the white men on horses who whipped enslaved people in cotton fields. But inhumane treatment of Black migrants, particularly Haitian migrants, is not new; it’s closely linked to the history of immigrant detention in the United States. Haitians have sought asylum at US borders for decades, but every presidential administration since the 1970s has treated Haitians differently than other migrant groups, rejecting asylum claims, holding them longer in detention, and making it harder for them to settle down in safety. In the early 1990s, for example, when the United States detained more than 12,000 Haitian refugees at Guantanamo indefinitely, Immigration and Naturalization Servicesdenied the vast majority of them asylum. According to CarlLindskoog, the author of, the United States’ inhumane treatment of Haitian refugees, whom the country has often cast as criminals, unskilled, diseased, and poor, has been a central part of the immigration detention story.“Policies were specifically designed to deter Haitians from coming in. These policies became the prototype for what became a global system of migrant incarceration,”says Lindskoog, a professor of history at Raritan Valley Community College in New Jersey. The current wave of Haitian migrants is fleeing a country that has experienced compounding crises. This summer, Haiti suffered a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and tropical storm that killed an estimated 2,200, with thousands more missing or injured. The July assassination of President Jovenel Moïse worsened violence and instability. Haitians are still reeling from the January 2010 earthquake that affected 3 million people, causing irreparable damage to homes and infrastructure. Gangs havesince risen in power, leading many Haitians to live in fear for their lives and families. As Lindskoog says, what Haitians are experiencing is the kind of calamity that asylum was designed for in the period following World War II: “It is their legal right to seek asylum.”However, some migrants hoping for asylum are instead being chased down and shut out at the border —images showthem being removed from airplanes in Port-au-Prince with their belongings scattered on the airport’s tarmac — whilean undisclosed number are being allowed intothe United States. Biden’s decision to fly Haitians back to deadly circumstances, under a Trump-era policy,underscores the United States’ longstanding animus toward Black migrants. I talked to Lindskoog about the history of Haitian migrant detention in the US and why America has consistently rolled out harsh policies for Haitians, without displaying compassion for immigrants from the embattled Caribbean nation. Our conversation has been edited and condensed. This week, images and video of Border Patrol agents mounted on horseback rounding up Haitian migrants at the southern border sparked national outrage. The images depicted officials using horse reins, which many likened to whips, to control the movement of the Haitians. Can you tell me what came to mind when you saw those images?The images are horrible. I agree with everyone who said it was so terribly resonant of the long history of anti-Black racism and racial violence. Those images bring a lot of strands of history together, from why the Border Patrol was created, to how violent that institution has been, to how our modern policing system comes from the enforcement of slavery. And then there is how our immigration system has been criminalized and merged into our criminal justice system, both of which have anti-Black elements. What’s happening at the border is horrifying and fits into the long intersecting history of anti-Black, anti-immigrant sentiment and anti-Haitian exclusion. Let’s talk more about the Border Patrol’s racist history, whichhas been well documentedand began with its formation in the early 1920s as a kind of brotherhood with KKK members and racist Texas Rangers. Can you tell me more about how these origins were likely at play in Del Rio with Haitian migrants?There is a really good book about this by Kelly Lytle Hernández calledin which she describes how the creation of the US Border Patrol in 1924 happened amidst a much broader anti-immigrant moment. There was the nationalImmigration Restriction Act of 1924that placed new racist immigration quotas and exclusions as part of American immigration policy. It was the gatekeeping mechanism at the time for keeping out who we don’t want to come across on American shores. [Author’s note: For example,the lawfavored migration from Northern and Western European countries and decreased the annual immigration cap from 350,000 to 165,000.]Simultaneously, the Border Patrol — which evolved out of a longer history of anti-migrant, anti-Mexican white supremacist violence along the US borderlands — was introduced to police to control the movement of Mexican migrants in particular, but also other people who might cross the southern border. Yes, many people tend to only think of Mexican migrants trying to cross the southern border. But there are people from Caribbean countries taking long, arduous treks across water and through numerous nations and terrains to seek American asylum. For example,reports have suggestedthat many of the more than 14,000 Haitian migrants who were camped under the Del Rio International Bridge had actually left Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and had stopped in places like Brazil and Chile but have been on the move to Mexico due to various circumstances. What kinds of conditions have these migrants faced in the past 10 or so years?From what I’ve learned from organizations like the Haitian Bridge Alliance and from reporters who have gone down to places like Brazil to report on conditions, especially after the economic downturn and other crises in Brazil, is that they couldn’t stay there. So they went to Chile and didn’t have the greatest reception there and sometimes faced a harrowing journey through jungles and across borders. There’s agigantic immigration detention facility in southern Mexico, where Mexico does a lot of the dirty work of the United States by detaining people who’ve crossed the border with Guatemala. If they got out of there, and were able to make it through the dangerous terrain up to the US-Mexico border, that is a major act of survival because of everything that they had to face in coming so many miles and facing so many police forces, prisons, and natural challenges. And then to see the images and read the reports that they’re living in that large encampment now, and just trying to get food and water and then to face that violent reprisal by the US Border Patrol — it’s just unimaginable. And how does this modern-day situation compare to the kind of treatment Haitian migrants have traditionally received over the past couple of decades, whether they’re entering through the southern border or trying to get to Florida’s shores by boat?They have, for most of history, been met with exclusion. During the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, most Haitians were coming on student visas or tourist visas, and then if they didn’t have authorization to stay, they were overstaying their visa. There were also a number of political exiles. So they weren’t really on the radar and seen as a big problem. They were establishing themselves in neighborhoods in New York primarily, and in Boston and elsewhere in Canada. It’s really in the early to mid-1970s when the so-called “boat people,” which is a different demographic — more working-class, urban, displaced Haitians — started to come by boats and ships, trying to make it to American shores. When they tried to put in asylum claims was when they started to be more on the radar of American authorities. That triggered this racist backlash, especially in South Florida, because it was at a moment when there was already a racist backlash to the civil rights movement. So to have all these poor unauthorized migrants who don’t speak English, that are Black, showing up, there’s this really racist reaction. South Floridians started to put pressure on their local officials, who then turned to Washington, and there was a very concerted effort to keep Haitians out. The Carter administrationintroduced something called the Haitian Program— a punishing set of policies designed to deter Haitians from coming in. And if they were already here, it tried to keep them out of the mainstream population. That meant putting them in detention facilities and local jails, basically denying them carte blanche their asylum claims and just sending them back. There was a big legal challenge in 1980,,where Haitian migrants and their advocates got a federal judge named James Lawrence King to recognize in a ruling that this practice was not only discriminatory but also racist. Haitians were being excluded because they were Black and because they were Haitian. King overturned the Haitian Program, but the Carter administration worked to circumvent it like subsequent administrations would. When the Reagan administration came into power, they introduced a new Haitian detention program and the policy of interdiction, in which Coast Guard cutters would intercept boats of Haitian asylum seekers before they could even reach land and send them back, often to violence and death in Haiti. That process continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Biden administration’s mass denial of asylum claims, which they’re doing by invokingTitle 42— a 2020 Trump administration coronavirus policy that has been used to expel more than a million migrants without hearings before an immigration judge — is not something new. This is something that both Republican and Democratic administrations have done, and it very much fits with the long history of the US government denying the legitimacy of Haitians’ asylum claims and sending them to a dangerous and often deadly situation. It seems presidents of all backgrounds and in both parties have engaged in harm toward Haiti and Haitian migrants. US involvement in Haiti has often led to periods of instability there, but then the US has at times in the past turned around andinterned Haitians at Guantanamo. The coup d’état against Haiti’s first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, happened when George H. W. Bush was in power, and hesort of paid lip service to the illegitimate military governmentthat was ruling after Aristide was put out of office. But Bush refused to accept Haitian asylum seekers and did everything the US government could to keep Haitians from being able to seek safe haven, even though the human rights atrocities after the coup were well-documented. There was another set of legal challenges and legal battles in the courts to give Haitians asylum, some of which were somewhat successful, but that’s the period when Guantanamo was first established as an offshore prison to try to serve as a buffer for people whom you don’t even want to allow to get to American shores to seek asylum. And Haitians were the first Guantanamo detainees. When Bill Clinton was running for president and trying to defeat George H. W. Bush, he promised to reverse that. A lot of Americans and people around the world were indignant about the Bush administration’s treatment of Haitians. Of course we’re gonna let Haitians in,” Clinton said. But after he was elected, he reversed course and turned his back on the Haitians and said, “Well, we don’t want to trigger another humanitarian crisis by taking people because then more people will go out on this perilous journey across the ocean.”He was trying to invoke humanitarian reasons for still denying people the right to seek asylum. Meanwhile, more Haitians filled up Guantanamo, some of whom were HIV positive and had AIDS. That began another chapter in what one scholar calls the carceral quarantine of Haitians for medical reasons. This was similar to what’s happening today because Title 42 is built on the basis of public health mandates to exclude people. While many people were forcibly returned from Guantanamo to Haiti, a number of those Haitians who remained at Guantanamo were able to make it to the United States after intense political and legal struggle. There’s historically also been a difference between how Cuban migrants and Haitian migrants have been treated,which many scholars point out is based on skin color. Is it useful to compare the plight of various migrant groups trying to make it into the United States?I think it is useful. I think there are a lot of interesting polarities in the experience of Haitians and Cubans in how they come to the United States. The best example of course was the summer of 1980 when more than 100,000 Cubans came by boat seeking asylum, and so did approximately 15,000 Haitians. The Refugee Act of 1980 had just passed, but it didn’t have clear instructions for how to treat vast numbers of asylum seekers, so initially, both Cubans and Haitians were placed in refugee camps on military bases across the United States. But pretty quickly, Cubans, for the most part, were released and allowed to be with family members and the Cuban community. Haitians languished in detention much longer. For the Haitians that came after, a special piece of legislation was passed to adjust their status known as theCuban-Haitian Entrant Act of 1980. But the Haitians that came after the act were again treated just like the ones that came before — excluded and barred. Cubans never suffered the same kind of exclusion or mass detention that Haitians did, despite the fact that they’re both coming from Caribbean nations and seeking asylum. How do these exclusionary policies translate to how Haitians are treated once in America?For the Haitian community and Haitian migrants in particular, they’ve repeatedly been targeted as disease carriers, which historically has also been a racialized notion not only of the foreign-born but especially of the nonwhite foreign-born. In the 1970s, their incarceration exclusion was sometimes justified on the basis that they were carrying tuberculosis. In the 1980s and especially in the 1990s, it became the notion that they were carrying AIDS. But Haitians said all along that singling them out is discriminatory because they aren’t any more likely to be diseased than other people. It is racialized stigmatization. The same thing goes for criminalization. TheBlack Alliance for Just Immigrationhas documented how Black immigrants are much more likely to be incarcerated, how they spend much more time in detention, and how their asylum cases, deportation cases, and immigration appeals are much more likely to be denied. That’s part of how immigration enforcement blends into the criminal justice system and policing — now that there’s a criminalized racial immigration system, often a migrant’s first point ofcontact in this country is with law enforcement. A lot of municipalities and localities have an agreement between their local law enforcement in the immigration system that they will refer any unauthorized or undocumented person or someone with some kind of immigration issue over to the immigration system. They then get put into the immigration system based on some racialized reading about who they are and are disproportionately likely to be detained or deported. So it’s clear that Haitian migrants are particularly demonized and criminalized, but I also think another element to their story is erasure. It feels like not many people know about this history. Even in the past decade or so, conversations about immigrants tend to leave out Black immigrants in general. Research from the nonprofit organization RAICESfound that 44 percent of familiesthat ICE locked up during the pandemic last year were Haitian and that this information was underreported. A February 2021reportfrom the American Immigration Council stated that at one detention center in 2020, nearly half of the families threatened with family separation were Black and originated from Haiti, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and Afro-Latino communities in Latin America. What does the erasure signify?Black migrants, Black immigrants, and Black asylum seekers are often left out of discussions of immigration, immigrant rights, and immigrant justice. In the media, when we are having these big national debates, we tend to think more about Central Americans and other Latin Americans, not the Caribbean so much. And, of course, in recent years, there were large numbers of displaced people coming from Central America — and that’s part of why that drew the attention. But it’s also true that Haitians only appear from time to time in conversation, and it’s not understood that their experiences track really closely to a lot of other asylum seekers. Even with the current attention being paid to the treatment of Haitian migrants, it’s still unclear how the United States is going to decide which Haitians they allow in and which they don’t. The Biden administration’s initial response was to schedule seven flights a day to send Haitians at the border back. But then the Associated Pressreportedthat Haitians were being released to El Paso, Texas; Arizona; and other places for 60 days before they’d have to appear at an immigration office. There’s not much transparency about how these decisions are being made.​​The Biden administration is under intense political pressure from different sides and from different interests, just as previous administrations have been. The administration is trying to maintain its image as being very different from the Trump administration, especially when it comes to racism and anti-immigrant nativist xenophobia, but I don’t believe that his policies have yet proven to be very different.[Vice President] Kamala Harris can stand there and say she is horrified, and [press secretary]Jen Psaki can say the same. But the whole reason the inhumane treatment of Haitians is happening is because the Biden administration is continuing the Trump administration’s illegitimate and unjustified use of Title 42, which is a way of denying the asylum process to which Haitians and all other people are entitled, by both our own federal law and international law. US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorcas made a strong statement to migrants saying that if they come here illegally, they’re going to be removed, that they are going to fail. But it’s not illegal to claim asylum. It is a legal right to claim asylum. Migrants have to have a legitimate fear of past or future persecution in their home country on the basis of a number of categories — if they can prove that, then they’ve proven their asylum case and are supposed to be allowed to stay. Many activists have used the phrase “Haitians are owed.” There’s this idea that the world owes Haitiand has played a role in its plight. What do you think about this in the context of what took place at the border this week?We do all owe Haitians for the Haitian Revolution, which successfully ended in 1804 and was the most sweeping human rights revolution in all of human history. Haitian liberation, first from slavery and then from colonialism and achieving independence, was a victory for all enslaved, oppressed people, including Black Americans. In many ways, Haitians, sadly, because they’ve so often been targeted by racism and injustice, have kept fighting in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s in this country and in others. Their determination to liberate themselves and other people they’ve struggled alongside continues to be a model for how all incarcerated, enslaved, and otherwise abused people can find their liberation. That’s one major reason we owe a debt of gratitude to Haitians. That’s even more reason to fight alongside them for justice today at the US-Mexico border and wherever they encounter racism and discrimination.

That’s according to newresearchpublished Friday by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit that studies the spread of misinformation and deception on social media likeFacebookandTwitter. The report’s findings are important because they highlight “a trend that disinformation is now being used as a means of economic warfare,” said NCRI lead intelligence analyst Alex Goldenberg. Traditionally, disinformation campaigns have been used “in the context of political warfare,” said Goldenberg. For instance, organizations with ties to the Russian government distributed fake news on social media before the 2016U. S. presidential election. Some of it centered onrace and politicsas a way to divide the nation. The NCRI report said that some of the same groups that spread political misinformation during the 2016 presidential election, including Russia’sInternet Research Agencyand the Global Research website, have been spreading and amplifying articles intended to “create distrust of U. S. 5G technology.” Some articles repeat conspiracy theories that5G wireless technology causes health problemsand that it is responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.“This proliferation of 5G conspiracy theories, many of which are now intertwined with COVID-19 conspiracy theories, now threaten U. S. 5G infrastructure, associated companies, and their personnel,” the report said. “Last year, the Department of Homeland Security put the U. S. telecom industry on alert about related potential cell tower attacks and risks to telecommunications workers.”Some of the biggest producers of anti-5G conspiracy theories include Russian disinformation sourceslike the Russian state controlled television network RT. Alternative health and wellness sites like Natural News and Children’s Health Defense are also peddling anti-5G propaganda, the NCRI researchers said. Additionally, the report discovered that Russian troll outlets arespreading conspiracy theorieson social media that are intended to sow doubt about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines fromPfizerand Moderna. The goal is to promote the Russian Sputnik V vaccine at the expense of other COVID-19 vaccines, especially in African countries. Even if the propaganda campaign fails to convince U. S. citizens to consider taking the Sputnik V vaccine, the spread of the basic idea that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are ineffective and perhaps dangerous is valuable to the Russian troll outfits, Goldenberg said. For the report, the researchers analyzed 4 million articles since January 2020 that mentioned U. S. pharmaceutical companies like Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer and discovered that known-disinformation sources produced over half-a-million of those articles. The researchers also analyzed over 8 million Twitter posts and noticed a huge uptick of tweets containing the name Pfizer and words associated with conspiracy theories like “plandemic,” “big pharma,” and “scandemic” over the past year and a half. Sometimes, up to 100 of these malicious tweets were posted in a single minute, with surges occurring during the recent U. S. presidential election and when the phase 3 clinical trials of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine were revealed. Retailer H&M was also subject to a recent disinformation campaign that the researchers said may be linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The disinformation campaign involved the spread of articles and videos of various Chinese citizens criticizing H&M after the retailer expressed concern aboutreports of forced labor inChina’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Starbuckswas the victim of a disinformation campaign in 2018 that involved Internet pranksters creating a fake coupon that people of color could use to receive free coffee after an incident involving the arrest of two Black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks. The NCRI research said that the fake Starbucks coupon scandal ballooned to the point where political commenters were referencing the incident as it if it were real, “reaching millions of viewers and promoting outrage on Twitter.”As for future potential corporate propaganda campaigns, Goldenberg suspects that if scientists determine that people need a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine as protection from the emerging virus variants, it’s likely that disinformation sources will flood the Internet with anti-booster shot propaganda. NCRI CEO Adam Sohn believes that more corporate disinformation campaigns will continue as state and non-state actors have a solid playbook to spread misinformation across social media. He recommends that corporate marketers must have “an all-seeing eye for their brand on social media to get a sense of where the misinformation trends are in their industry.”“It might be Company A tomorrow, but it could be you the next day,” Sohn said.

367,'Barbaric Torture': Alleged WikiLeaks Source Details US Prison Conditions,-3.33,40.0,https://shadowproof.com/2021/01/29/us-doj-moves-stifle-alleged-wikileaks-source-challenge-mccnewyork/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,22,"*The United States Justice Department is attempting to foil former CIA engineer Joshua Schulte’s challenge to his harsh confinement conditions at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. Assistant U. S. Attorney Charles Jacob argued in a letter [PDF] to a federal judge, “The court lacks jurisdiction to resolve this petition in the context of this criminal case.”Prosecutors maintain MCC Warden Marti Licon-Vitale should be the target of any habeas petition, or complaint, but Licon-Vitale cannot be named as a defendant. Effectively, if accepted by the court, this means Schulte would have to pursue a civil lawsuit against prison administrators while at the same time preparing for the Justice Department to try him on Espionage Act charges that a jury deadlocked on last March. He already has public defenders and definitely could not afford to hire an attorney to argue his constitutional rights are being violated. Schulte was accused of leaking the “Vault 7” files to WikiLeaks and charged with 13 offenses, including four counts of violating the Espionage Act in June 2018. The files Schulte allegedly released brought scrutiny to the CIA’s hacking arsenal, which targeted smartphones and computers. A program called “Weeping Angel” that allowed the CIA to attack Samsung F8000 TVs and convert them into spying devices was exposed. They also showed how the CIA targeted Microsoft Windows, as well as Signal and WhatsApp users, with malware. Lawyer Sabrina Shroff, according to Matthew Russell Lee of Inner City Press, opened Schulte’s trial by maintaining the CIA did not want these documents published and the CIA had no idea how they were leaked. They also do not know when, why, or who leaked the documents. Shroff further suggested the CIA felt pressure to blame someone, and Schulte was an easy target. “All they know is WikiLeaks published the information on March 7, 2017.”In October 2018, Attorney General William Barr imposed special administrative measures (SAMs) on Schulte. The complaint [PDF] alleges the prison has imposed additional “arbitrary punishment” that was not authorized.“MCC’s treatment of pretrial detainees is truly abhorrent, unconscionable, cruel and unusual punishment,” the complaint declares. “SAMs inmates are locked in concrete boxes the size of parking spaces with purposefully obstructed views of outside. The cages are filthy and infested with rodents, rodent droppings, cockroaches, and mold.”“There is no heating or air conditioning in the cages. There is no functioning plumbing. The lights burn brightly 24 hours per day, and the inmates are denied outside recreation, normal commissary, normal visitation, access to books and legal material, medical care, and dental care.”The complaint adds, “All attorney-client privilege is also void to SAMs inmates as the prison confiscates, opens, and reads all legal mail. Inmates are forbidden from transferring legal material to and from their attorneys.”Schulte is allegedly denied proper heating and air conditioning, and the cells in 10 South, the SAMs unit, lack insulation. This means he wears “four sets of clothing, five sets of socks, a sweatshirt and sweatpants, two blankets, three sets of socks on his hands, and still freezes when the temperature in his cell plummets below freezing and waterfreezes in his cell.”The warden and MCC staff, the complaint argues, are “aware and indifferent to this barbaric torture.”Schulte has not been outside in over two years because there is no outside recreation available to SAMs detainees. He cannot even see the world outside his cell because windows are blacked out.“Despite Mr. Schulte’s congenital heart issues and ongoing cardiologist appointments, he has not seen a doctor since his trial in February 2020. Additionally, Mr. Schulte has not once seen a dentist at MCC.”“When [10 South] inmates are moved, they must be shackled from head-to-toe like Hannibal,” the complaint states. Schulte is “handcuffed, belly-chained, and foot-cuffed,” even though he has never been accused of violence or committing disciplinary infractions. The FBI intercepts Schulte’s mail in order to prevent the “alleged dissemination of classified information.” Yet, it is impossible for Schulte to “transmit classified information by receiving mail, especially court mail.”Schulte’s lawyers contend, “The mail interception is arbitrarily imposed in violation of the Fifth Amendment. This court should modify SAMs and issue an order preventing the FBI from intercepting or reading any incoming mail to Mr. Schulte.”All of the alleged violations of his constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment are practically impossible for Schulte to challenge through the “administrative remedy” process supposedly available to prisoners. First, MCC did not reply “in a timely manner” so Schulte appealed to a regional office. That regional office claimed he failed to “file at the institutional level,” even though he was cleared to appeal because the MCC had not responded to his grievance within 20 days. This regional office also disqualified his complaint because it was not written in ballpoint pen. (Schulte is banned from using pens.)Schulte appealed to the Central Office, which is next in the bureaucratic hierarchy. He received “similar denials.”On top of that, the prison apparently has an “informal resolution process” that prisoners like Schulte are required to go through before they can formally complain. Schulte has 17 outstanding forms submitted through this process. He is not to be given a form that allows him to pursue an administrative remedy unless the prison replies to these forms. The warden limits prisoners’ ability to formally file requests, and as a result, Schulte’s lawyers insist this is in violation of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Prisoners in 10 South are “often forced to urinate and defecate in plastic bags. During visitation, inmates are moved to a 6×6 ft. cage. Instead of taking the inmate back to his cage after visitation, as would be logical, [Solitary Housing Unit] lieutenants take the visitors back first.”It can be anywhere from five to seven hours before the lieutenants return, which means prisoners must go to the bathroom in a plastic bag they were given. Systematic abuse and mistreatment of SAMs prisoners played a decisive role in District Judge Vanessa Baraitser’s decision to deny the U. S. government’s extradition request against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He would likely be placed under the kind of restrictions Schulte has faced if the U. S. prevailed and brought him to the country for a trial on Espionage Act charges. Even more troubling, Schulte already went to trial once. A jury did not convict, yet because the Justice Department is responsible for his SAMs designation—and they have not given up on their leak prosecution—the cruelty has not abated.“It is barbaric and inhumane to lock human beings into boxes for years and years,” the complaint concludes. “It is a punishment worse than death, and there is no wonder that MCC inmates would rather kill themselves than continue to live in absolute oppression.”“No matter what crime an individual is alleged to have committed, the United States Constitution grants all a presumption of innocence. Indeed, no American wants to be treated like a caged animal if accused of a crime—dependent, deserted, dehumanized, demoralized, and detained.”",2,Generally Reliable,-0.0192421502548085,0.3883034686832155,1652,2,Shadowproof
368,Popularity of Bail Funds Continue Protests’ Momentum,-11.33,48.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/popularity-of-bail-funds-continue-protests-momentum,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,23,"ATLANTA—On June 1, police officers had 20-year-old William Lefforge, and about 50 other protesters, boxed in on the sidewalk near Atlanta City Hall. The officers warned the protesters they had three minutes to leave, but according to Lefforge, the group could not get by the police. The police arrested them and transported Lefforge and his group to the Atlanta Detention Center. Lefforge estimated his arrest happened around 4 p.m., well before the 9 p.m. curfew that Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has since lifted.:Lefforge called his mother, Jen, who in turn reached out to the Atlanta Solidarity Fund. Thanks to the fund, Lefforge walked out of the detention center a little before midnight. He had only his release papers, which cited “pedestrian in the roadway” as his charge. Organizers were waiting in the parking lot across from the detention center to make sure protesters reached their homes. On June 4, Lefforge was at another protest. As historic protests against police brutality toward Black Americans sweep the United States, social media is littered with calls for donations to local bail funds. Those unable to join the frontlines of protests are giving material support by donating, according to protesters and organizers. The Atlanta Police Department reported it made298 arrestsin the first weekend of protests alone. An organizer with the Atlanta Solidarity Fund who asked to be identified only by his first name, Marlon, said protesters have been arrested for curfew violations, disorderly conduct, and even felony incitement to riot. With a felony charge, judges are more likely to set ahigher bail—or deny it entirely. Keeping protesters in jail is the point, according to Marlon. He said, “Not just in Atlanta, but around the country, police forces are waging a kind of war of attrition. Eventually people’s wallets will run out. Their safety nets will run out and they’ll have no choice but to stop protesting. When we support bail funds, we make sure [protesters] have that backing that they need to stay on the streets as long as they need.”Even before the protests, bail was a costly system. A2017 report from UCLA’s Million Dollar Hoods research team found that “the money bail system is a multi-billion dollar toll that demands tens of millions of dollars annually in cash and assets from some of L. A.’s most economically vulnerable persons, families, and communities,” all before anyone has been found guilty. One factor driving up that total cost is the fact that judges frequently sethigher bail for Black and Hispanicdefendants than for white defendants with the same charge. Albert Corado, 31, is an organizer and police abolitionist with People’s City Council in Los Angeles. Corado said People’s City Council emerged after the city government’s lack of action in the face of the novel coronavirus’ spread. “There was no rent relief, no tangible plan to help people. We were frustrated with city council and the mayor’s response,” he said. So the People’s City Council called for rent suspension and commandeering hotels for Los Angeles’ unhoused population. It also supportedPeople’s Budget LA, which is focused on getting more funding to social services like improved mental health services and public education, instead of funding the police. People’s City Council’s demand to defund the police is now being echoed across the US. City councils arevotingtoslashpolice budgets and even heedingprotesters’ calls to defund. After the police killing of George Floyd, People’s City Council’s agenda expanded. Corado and nine other organizers started a GoFundMe to cover legal and medical costs for protesters, direct support to Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, and supplies for protest organizers. The group raised over$2 million. Corado said it is a huge sum of money for a few organizers to make decisions about, but they are committed to channeling the money to supporting protests against police brutality. Corado also has a personal connection to recent appeals for defunding police. The LAPD killed Corado’s sister, Melyda, in 2018. He added, “Having lost my sister to police violence, it feels amazing. It’s a big fuck you.”Similarly, the Minnesota Freedom Fund was one of the first bail funds to gain national attention. The nonprofit raised$20 millionin only four days but struggled to spend the donations on bail, using only$200,000. Board member Jared Mollenkoftold local mediathe nonprofit would be undergoing a massive scaling-up and remains committed to ending cash bail. Sarah Abdel-Motaleb, a law student in Dallas, Texas, donated to her local bail fund as a form of solidarity with the protesters. Abdel-Motaleb added, “Even if [a donation] is just a little bit, it’s going into a larger fund that will make an impact on people’s lives.”She also brought up the safety concerns of jailing protesters while the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing. Health expertswarn the virusis able to spread quickly in jails. The Bail Project is a national nonprofit that provides bail assistance to low-income individuals charged with a crime. The nonprofit has helped release over 11,000 people from pre-trial detention, according to CEO Robin Steinberg. Steinberg called cash bail “a driver of injustice,” citing the disproportionate cost to Black families. When someone who has not been convicted of a crime is able to await their trail outside of jail, Steinberg said, “The impact is felt not just by the individual but also allows that person to reconnect to family and employment and their community.”In light of the protests, The Bail Project started operating a 24-hour assistance line to help arrested protesters and concerned friends and family. The line has received 300 calls, according to The Bail Project. She said it makes sense why people have flocked to bail funds as a way to show support for protesters, adding, “Paying [someone’s] bail is a way to have an immediate disruptive impact on the way [the legal] system operates.”Ultimately, Steinberg said bail funds are “not the answer,” but are a “powerful tool.” The Bail Project is dedicated to ending the norm of mass incarceration",3,Reliable,0.0445601851851851,0.409182098765432,1366,2,Real News Network

Frankfurt prosecutors said in a statement together with the Federal Criminal Police Office that in mid-April three German suspects, said to be the administrators of the “Boystown” platform, were arrested along with a German user. One of the three main suspects was arrested in Paraguay. They also searched seven buildings in connection with the porn ring in mid-April in Germany. The authorities said the platform was “one of the world's biggest child pornography darknet platforms” and had been active at least since 2019. Pedophiles used it to exchange and watch pornography of children and toddlers, most of them boys, from all over the world. Prosecutors wrote that they found “images of most severe sexual abuse of toddlers” among the photos and video material. A German police task force investigated the platform, its administrators, and users for months in cooperation with Europol and law enforcement authorities from the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, the United States, and Canada, the statement said. The three main suspects were a 40-year-old man from Paderborn, a 49-year-old man from Munich, and a 58-year-old man from northern Germany who had been living in Paraguay for many years, the prosecutors' statement said. They worked as administrators of the site and gave advice to members on how to evade law enforcement when using the platform for illegal child pornography. A fourth suspect, a 64-year-old man from Hamburg, is accused of being one of the most active users of the platform having allegedly uploaded more than 3,500 posts. Germany has requested the extradition of the suspect who was arrested in Paraguay. No names were given in line with Germany privacy regulations. After the raids in mid-April, the online platform was shut down. Germany's top security official thanked the authorities for their success.“This investigative success has a clear message: Those who assault the weakest aren't safe anywhere,"" German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said. ”That's what investigators work for day and night, online and offline, globally.""“We'll do everything within our power to protect the kids from these disgusting crimes,” he added.",3,Reliable,0.0937037037037036,0.3307407407407406,492,2,CBN

S. decision on the date when it will allow international visitors to visit will be announced soon. President Biden was attending a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House on Friday and was asked about when the U. S. travel ban might be rescinded. As reported by, Biden told reporters that a team that is advising him on the pandemic “brought that subject up. It’s in the process of (considering) how soon we can lift the ban ... and I will be able to answer that question to you within the next several days.”It was Chancellor Merkel who raised the issue and said through a translator that President Biden had also told her the same thing during their meeting, that he was looking into the matter. ""Before such a decision, one has to reflect,"" Merkel said,as reported by. ""It's not sensible to have to take it back after only a few days.""Before Merkel’s visit,reportedthat EU diplomats were becoming increasingly frustrated with the Biden Administration over leaving the travel ban in place for most of their citizens, “citing inconsistent rules, economic costs and an outdated strategy for halting the coronavirus.” The U. S. government has come under pressure for saying it will follow the science but then not doing so in regards to removing international travel restrictions. Airlines for America, a trade group which represents many U. S. carriers, said “the time for action is now” in regard to allowing international visitors to enter the U. S. It made the point that the U. S. allows travel to and from Mexico, which only has about one third of its residents vaccinated. However, travel is currently restricted from Canada and the U. K., where vaccination rates are high. Whilst completely vaccinated travelers are allowed into the EU from the U. S. and even to the U. K. if they quarantine and test (on day two and day eight), airlines are hampered because of the lack of two-way travel–they cannot offer as many flights as they would like because movement is only happening in one direction. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian toldthat whilst bookings by Americans surged when those countries reopened, “the problem is, there are only Americans that we are carrying in (to Europe) and carrying out.” Delta’s transatlantic capacity is currently half what it was pre-pandemic. The U. S. Travel Association, a non-profit organization, welcomed the President’s comments. Executive Vice President of Public Affairs and Policy Tori Emerson Barnesissued a statementhighlighting the emotional and financial cost of the U. S. travel ban.“Each day that outdated restrictions on travel exist wreaks economic damage on our nation,” Barnes said, “not to mention the personal toll on individuals separated from their families and loved ones. Travel bans related to Canada, Europe and the U. K. alone cost the U. S. economy $1.5 billion every week—enough to support 10,000 American jobs.”",3,Reliable,0.0457723577235772,0.3591056910569105,712,3,Forbes

Armstrong’s address comes in response to a recent employee walkout at the cryptocurrency company.“Everyone is asking the question about how companies should engage in broader societal issues during these difficult times while keeping their teams united and focused on the mission,” Armstrong said.“It has become common for Silicon Valley companies to engage in a wide variety of social activism, even those unrelated to what the company does, and there are certainly employees who really want this in the company they work for. So why have we decided to take a different approach?” he wrote in ablog postclarifying the company’s policies. Armstrong explained Coinbase prioritizes its mission, “playing as a championship team, focus on building, and being transparent” and that taking a stance one way or another would violate their inclusive work environment.“While I think these efforts are well-intentioned, they have the potential to destroy a lot of value at most companies, both by being a distraction and by creating internal division,” Armstrong stated. Armstrong wrote that for the company to focus on activism unrelated to their business would go against the principle of inclusion. “We have people with many different backgrounds and viewpoints at Coinbase, and even if we all agree that something is a problem, we may not agree on how to actually go solve it.”Armstrong also clarified that while the company does not want to focus on debate surrounding political or social justice matters, they do encourage it as “core to a healthy team where it is safe to disagree.”“Of course, there are exceptions here around internal employment matters, whistleblowing, etc. And we want all employees to feel safe disagreeing on the work itself,” he explained. “Candor and debate are core to a healthy team, where it is safe to disagree. We consider these to be related to our mission.”According to Armstrong, Coinbase employee duties should be used to the “service of the company or our own interests as employees and shareholders” and that leaving “policy decisions, non-profit work, broader societal issues, and political causes” out of their business strategies as much as possible is the best way to do so.“We focus minimally on causes not directly related to the mission,” he said.

P. Morgan. A supercycle is typically an extended period of gains that could run ten years or longer. Commodity prices have risen sharply from their pandemic lows with the S&P GSCI up 77% from its April 21 low through Thursday. West Texas Intermediate crude oil is trading just below $60 per barrel and gold is hovering above $1,800 an ounce as loose monetary and fiscal policy have resulted in pressure on the U. S. dollar and sparked fears of a return of inflation.“Unintended consequences” of President Biden’s environmental policies will also be a catalyst for higher commodity prices, wrote J. P. Morgan quant strategist Marko Kolanovic. Biden has promised to “transition” the U. S economy away from its reliance on fossil fuels and towards clean energy. Doing so will result in higher prices of metals needed to build out infrastructure and upward pressure on energy prices as supply is constrained. In particular, Kolanovic says an “oil up cycle” has begun. There have been four commodities supercycles over the previous 100 years, according to J. P. Morgan. The previous, which was driven by China’s economic boom, had a 12-year up cycle that peaked with the 2008 global financial crisis and was followed by a 12-year down cycle that ended with President Trump’s trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices crashing below zero in March of last year was the “watershed event” needed to get investors interested in commodities again, said John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo, on a call discussing his 2021 outlook. He declared “super bear cycle” over. In fact, the rest of Wall Street seems to be on board, as well. Bank of America strategists think the economy’s reopening means the return of human mobility will cause a macro data to surge as pent-up demand is unleashed and inflation shifts from Wall Street to Main Street. They believe 2020 marked a ""secular low” for rates and inflation, and that the current decade will likely see inflation assets outperform deflation assets and real assets outperform financial assets. Commodities: +28%Energy: +43%Precious Metals +18%Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, said in October that a structural bull market was just getting started. They forecast commodities prices would rise 28% in 2021, led by energy (+43%) and precious metals (+18%).

374,COVID-19: Un-Normalizing the Third U.S. Wave of the Pandemic,-9.17,39.67,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/covid-19-un-normalizing-the-third-u-s-wave-of-the-pandemic.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2020-11-15,25,"“The cases are going vertical,”wroteEric Topol, the head of Scripps Research Translational Institute and not temperamentally an alarmist, on Thursday. In the spring, Americans nervously following the course of the pandemic heard a lot about the risks of “exponential growth,” but outside of New York, the first-wave epicenter, the country’s experience with spread of this speed was rather limited. Now almost the entire country is there, with COVID-19’s spread in 47 of 50 states currently “uncontrolled,” according to Covid Exit Strategy. In the world of AI speculation, this vertical portion of a curve is sometimes described as “the singularity,” a threshold past which growth in computing power is so rapid its effects cannot really be predicted beforehand. With the virus, we do know what is ahead: much larger charts, with much longer y-axes, tracking much, much more sickness. Looking at the national map on Wednesday, Ebola doctor Craig Spencerjoked, the pandemic “currently has 531 electoral votes and is a strong favorite for all four in Maine.” Each of the next two days, the new case total grew again. Over the last few months, election-preoccupied Americans have normalized what was once an unthinkable, and certainly an unconscionable, level of death and suffering. There have been a thousand deaths from the coronavirus a day, roughly speaking, producing a cumulative total that is today approaching 250,000 — more than the number of people who died in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “I just keep thinking about this epidemic — on our soil, in our country,” the Harvard epidemiologist Michael Minatold melast month. “What would the government do if we had 200,000 people die from bombs being dropped on us? You know we would not be sitting idly by.”Our daily update is published. States reported 1.7M tests, 163k cases, and 1,321 deaths. There are 69,455 people currently hospitalized with COVID-19.pic.twitter.com/SAD7LOJTDLSince then, while we were sitting idly by, the pandemic did not merely continue unabated, it tidal waved. Just over a week ago, the country set a record with 100,000 new cases; Friday, it recorded more than 170,000. Just over a week ago, it might have seemed alarmist to warn of bunkering in through the winter; on Thursday, Chicago, America’s Second City, instituted shelter-in-place guidance, and right now, in New York City, the nation’s largest school system is on the brink of shutting down again. Zeynep Tufecki, the pandemic’s premier journalistic prognosticator, hasjust called on the country to “hunker down.”The presidential election is now mostly behind us, but the country is still several months from new national leadership and probably several months more from the real interventions that change of leadership will bring. Dr. Anthony Fauci predicted last week that vaccines could be in wide distribution throughout the country by April, but that is almost half a year from now. In the meantime, two pressing questions loom. The first is, if we have normalized once-unthinkable suffering, can we un-normalize this third wave and actually engineer a meaningful response, rather than continuing to relax into tragic complacency? And the second question is, assuming we can respond, how much of a difference can be made?It’s unwise to bet against normalization, which is so strong and pervasive a force in our culture that it muddies our ability to respond to any growing threat (like climate change or the degradation of democracy). But I think the answer to the first question is that, yes, we can un-normalize and choose to at least try to respond. There is already plenty of evidence to support that, not just in the policy turns of Chicago and New York, but in the headline space of our major newspapers and the anxiety space of our social media. (As it was in the spring, the speed with which anxiety about what might happen arrives, spreads, and is displaced by the nightmare actually happening, has been dizzying). The evidence is even clearer in Europe, where the pandemic has been tracking about a month ahead of ours, and where over the last week, many of countries worst-hit by the coronavirus have finally turned the curves of new infections down again — though it is only marginal improvement from some very high peaks. In France, for instance, new cases grew from a rolling seven-day average of about 4,500 new cases in the spring to about 55,000 new cases earlier this month, and has now drawn down close to 40,000 new cases daily. Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic, among others, all have followed similar patterns — fall waves that dwarfed the spring ones now beginning to crest. But this can only count as “progress” if you are grading on a very steep curve, or making a very short-term assessment. And it has been devastating to those who had hoped — as recently as a few weeks ago — that herd immunity or community protection might kick in at relatively low levels of exposure, since many of the same places that were hit hardest in the spring are being hit hardest again now. But the European data does show that at high levels of infections, even those countries and cities exhausted by earlier pandemic waves have proven themselves capable of turning the corner and bringing caseloads down again — and given Americans some hope that our capacity for normalization, while distressingly high, may not be infinite. But the experience of Europe also provides a distressing answer to the second question, about what difference such interventions can make. While the story of those countries’ fall wave is still ongoing, at the moment nobody has managed to really suppress the pandemic to anything like even the “manageable” levels experienced in the summer. Australia, after a second wave in July and August, has brought its pandemic down to almost zero again — but September is the beginning of spring Down Under and brings with it the relief of seasonality. Here, the fall surge has come to pass almost precisely as we were warned in the spring, and we find ourselves, despite the six-month head start, largely impotent to respond. This is not because the country has done nothing to prepare, though in certain areas of course the preparation has been tragically inadequate. It is because we have allowed the pandemic to get this big in the first place. Disease spread of this size, in this season, would overwhelm almost any preparation. Consider the tools at hand. Especially compared with the spring, our testing capacity is now quite large — though perhaps not at an ideal, surveillance-scale level, which would allow us to catch asymptomatic cases. (Rapid testing, which could make that kind of real-time surveillance-style feedback possible, has been woefully underproduced and almost certainly can’t be scaled in time to respond to this surge, especially given the total void of federal leadership extending into late January.) Contact tracing, which technocrats have hoped would fill that gap and allow the tracking of asymptomatic cases, has basically failed everywhere in the U. S., even those places where whole disease-detective armies have been stood up at some scale. There are today, still, some issues with PPE availability in certain places, but not the widespread shortages we saw in the spring. While many hospital systems are — terrifyingly — approaching capacity now, it is much harder to reallocate resources to help when the shortages are so widespread, in so many parts of the country. Of course, public policy matters, especially now at the local level — and American parents are right to be outraged that, in many parts of the country, bars and restaurants remain open for indoor business while in-person schooling is being shut down. Mask mandates are still patchwork across the country, but new ones are likely around the corner. We are also likely to see now a wave of new restrictions — probably less like the blanket shutdowns of the spring but nevertheless more meaningful intrusions into everyday life than most Americans have experienced in months. But it is also striking how much of the present guidance —from COVID president-to-be Joe Biden, for instance, orfrom Obama’s CDC chief Tom Frieden— reflects social behavior rather than public policy: mask-wearing, hand-washing, social distancing. Those measures work to suppress the spread rather than defeat it, but at this point, for the time being, they might be the best tools we have. At the height of its summertime second wave, which produced a local peak of pandemic hysteria, the U. S. hit a rolling seven-day average of 67,000 new cases a day. It will likely be quite a while before we can even glimpse that level again.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0852986086736087,0.4175488085488086,1914,3,New York Magazine
375,"Navajo and Hopi voters turn out in force on Election Day, hoping for a clear voice",0.0,51.33,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2020/11/05/native-american-voters-turn-out-large-numbers-election-day/6169022002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/az-central-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,24,"As voting got underway Tuesday on the Hopi Nation, Karen Shupla, the tribal registrar, set out to visit three Navajo County polling stations serving Hopi voters. The Hopi Nation reaches into both Navajo and Apache counties in northern Arizona. What she found was part of a larger story on Election Day: Even with concerns about coronavirus, Native voters on the Hopi and Navajo nations showed up in large numbers at in-person polling locations.“Turnout has been great,” Shupla said.“We’ve even had people come in trying to register to vote,” she said, but Arizona does not allow same-day voter registration. Her first stop was a polling site inside the Kykotsmovi Village Community Center, near the Hopi tribal office. Shupla said the location offered curbside voting, along with a ballot drop-off box for the first time. In Sipaulovi Village, Shupla stood outside the Sipaulovi Youth & Elderly Building and worked with local Native Vote volunteers as they handed out teal-colored shirts to Hopi voters leaving the polls. Native Vote is a nonpartisan initiative developed by the National Congress of American Indians that focuses on voter registration, election protection, education and data collection. Because of the pandemic, all the Hopi Villages are closed to nontribal citizens and many of them have security posts set up in front monitoring traffic. One is set up in front of the Sipaulovi Village, and the staff was directing voters toward the polling site only. No one was allowed into the village unless they were a resident.“They’re busy,” Shupla said. There had been a steady stream of voters since the site opened and she was impressed with how smoothly the location was running. The final Navajo County polling station was at the Hopi LDS Church in Polacca. Shupla said she didn’t encounter any voting issues at any of the three sites, but she saw a lot of first-time voters.“I’ve never seen lines and we’re seeing lines,” she said. “I think people are seeing the importance of this election.”In Arizona, nearly 6% of the voting-age population is Native American, making it one of the highest percentages among Indigenous communities in the U. S., according to the National Congress of American Indians. The Navajo and Hopi nations stretch across parts of Coconino, Navajo and Apache counties. Of Navajo County's 108,000 residents, 43% are Native American. Of Apache County’s population of about 71,000, Native Americans make up 73%. ASU law student MacArthur Stant, a volunteer with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project, was also out visiting polling places on the Hopi Nation. He stopped in Polacca and SipauloviThe project is part of the ASU Indian Law Clinic and provides resources to tribes and tribal citizens in Arizona, “to ensure access to the polls and to prevent voter disenfranchisement,” the project's website says. At the polling stations, Stant said he saw a steady flow of voters throughout the day.“It’s been very exciting. A lot of first-time voters and it feels as if those first-time voters are going to stay voters,” Stant said. He noticed a lot of the first-time voters are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.“These are people who haven’t voted in their life and they’re starting to see the value and importance of it,” he added. “I think as a whole this starting to be very important.”For state elections, there were 14 Native candidates on ballots across Arizona and 11 of them won their election. Apache County voter Andrew Simpson said he felt both the Democratic and Republican parties haven’t spent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed they’re paying more attention to Indigenous communities.“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,” he said.“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Simpson said. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”Simpson voted early by mail, but still showed up to the polls on Tuesday at the Steamboat Chapter House. As a former council delegate on the Navajo Nation, Simpson said he wanted to see the turnout. In Chinle, voters were able to use one of the few early in-person voting sites in Apache County. The polling station was inside a blue warehouse and had two entrances, one for voters in the Chinle precinct and the other for the Canyon De Chelly precinct. Election official Karsteen Draper, 43, from nearby Del Muerto, greeted voters who walked toward the building, directing them to the correct precinct or to a poll worker who could help ensure they were in the right line. He said he's volunteered for elections before and has always enjoyed working with people. He likes answering their questions and helping them vote.""The line has been flowing smoothly. No long waits,"" Draper said. He planned on being the final voter of the night. As an election official, he had to make sure no one tried to get in line when the polls closed at 7 p.m. Volunteers with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project were set up in front of the polling station, providing voters with hand sanitizer and answers to voting or ballot questions. ASU law students Aspen Miller and Seth Jensen had been set up in front of the polling site since about 6 a.m. Miler said the site wasn't even open when they arrived. They talked to hundreds of voters throughout the day and the biggest confusion they encountered was that the Navajo Nation was having a tribal election, too. The Apache County polling site was set up only for the state and national elections. The tribal election took place at the Chinle Chapter House about two miles away. Jensen said turnout was steady and Miller agreed, saying there was always somebody inside voting.""Nobody's been turned away,"" she added. Married couple Ashley and Marlyn Willie from Chinle both knew they wanted to vote in person rather than by mail.“My vote will count then and there,” Ashley Willie, 27, said. ""Our voices can be heard through voting.""Marlyn Willie echoed his wife's thoughts. He said he's been voting since he turned 18, and now at 29, voting is still important to him because his future, his kids' future and eventually his grandkids' future all depend on who leads.""Not just this election but all the elections,"" he said. ""People have to get up and vote so they can be the change. We choose who gets to be in there.""In the 2016 election, Maryln Willie said he did vote for Donald Trump and he has tried to vote Republican much of the time, but that changed this election. He voted for Joe Biden. He doesn't believe the current division in the United States will change this election. ""Not with the two candidates we have,"" he said, and he doesn't believe either candidate can deliver on their campaign promises.""Not much is being said about our future,"" he added, and he said he changed his candidate this election year because of his kids. He believes that Trump has not handled the COVID-19 pandemic properly, and he said has to think about his children's health and safety. The coronavirus had hit Indigenous communities the hardest and no one knows how long it's going to last.""My children deserve to be safe,"" He said. ""I'm just hoping for a little bit of change.""As the polls closed on Tuesday night, Chinle Chapter House voter Joanie Hunter stood in line along with about 100 other tribal voters waiting to cast their vote in the Navajo Nation Chapter general election. Hunter already voted in the state and national election, casting a ballot early because she thought the polling line would be too long on Election Day.“I thought the chapter (election) should be fine,” she said but was proven wrong by the time she made it to the polls just before 7 p.m. Hunter said she was mentally kicking herself for not voting early.“I didn’t think there would be this many people,” she said. By the time Hunter got in line, it looped around the Chinle Chapter House complex with about 100 voters still waiting. At one point during the day, the line stretched past the parking lot toward the main highway.“I don’t mind waiting,” Hunter said, even as a few of her fellow voters walked away from the line. She said she cares about her chapter election because she feels it’s an election where her voice is really heard.“You get a say in whose running things,"" she added. ""I believe it does make a difference.""Thousands of Navajo voters cast a ballot for chapter leaders on Tuesday. Native voters often turn out in higher rates for tribal elections than nontribal elections, according to the National Congress of American Indians. In chapter elections, Navajo voters elect leaders for their local community governments at 110 chapters across the Navajo Nation. The Navajo Nation is about the size of West Virginia and spans three states, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It is split into five agencies: Western, Chinle, Fort Defiance, Shiprock and Eastern. Within those agencies are chapter houses and they serve as local governments for surrounding communities. It’s operated along the same lines as a city council. On Tuesday, Navajo voters elected chapter presidents, vice presidents, secretary-treasurers, commissioners, election supervisors, farming board members and grazing committee members. Local chapter elections are usually full of candidates campaigning until the polls close and free food is always nearby. Many of the candidates tend to share their platforms with Navajo voters while serving coffee, stew and frybread. But because of the coronavirus, the scene was different this year. There were no food stands set up in the chapter house parking lots or candidates hosting rallies for voters. The Navajo Election Administration and the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors implemented public health safety guidelines for voting at polling places and discouraged candidates from setting up food stands. Tribal voters were also encouraged to vote early or by absentee ballot to avoid large crowds and wait times on Election Day. At the Steamboat Chapter House as voters left their vehicles and walked toward the door, they were often greeted by an election official asking if they were voting in the chapter election or for Apache County. The Steamboat Chapter House served as a polling station for the state and national election on Tuesday. Chapter voters were directed toward the entrance of the chapter house on the right side of the building, while Apache County voters were directed toward an entrance on the left side of the building. Navajo voters waiting in line maintained social distancing, wore masks and often used the handwashing stations set up near chapter house entrance. Election officials also checked temperatures before voters entered the building. Andrew Simpson and his wife, Bessie Yellowhair Simpson, from Steamboat, showed up at the polls to observe while they waited for relatives to arrive from Phoenix to vote. They both voted early, but as community leaders, they enjoyed sticking around on Election Day. But rather than their usual hugs and handshakes, they both wore masks, waving to people from inside their truck or bumping elbows with the few who walked up to the truck window. Yellowhair Simpson occasionally walked the grounds to greet people or talk. She is currently the commission secretary-treasurer for the Steamboat Chapter and was up for reelection this election. She did not retain her seat,according to unofficial results. The husband and wife also believed that Election Day is a great way to build relationships among the Navajo people, but because of the pandemic, they’ve lost that. It has prevented them from leaving their house, Simpson said, and at 74 he’s been told he is at high risk for contracting the coronavirus. The only time they leave home is to restock on essential items, so being at the polls on Tuesday gave them a chance to see and interact with people at a safe distance.“We just wanted to see people and our relatives,” Simpson said, and he’s recognized most of them through their masks. “There is still life out here.”The unofficial results for the Navajo Nation Chapter General Election can be found on the Navajo Election Administrations website atnavajoelections.navajo-nsn.gov.",3,Reliable,0.1193906166932482,0.3770789980000505,2621,3,AZ Central

Both he and his wife, who works at one of the world’s top biotech companies, are on the H-1B, a non-immigrant visa allowing foreigners to live and work in the US. One of Amey’s previous employers applied for his green card in 2011. Almost a decade later, a green card still eludes him.“We’ve been waiting patiently for our green card since nine years now and it will likely take another 10-plus years till we get it,” says Amey, who like the other Indians in America whom we spoke to for this story asked that we publish only their first names to avoid drawing attention from US immigration services. Over the last decade, Amey has worked at several technology startups. “I helped them launch award-winning products, hire teams, and raise millions of dollars in venture funding,” he says. A few years ago, he and his wife opened a mom-and-pop store in suburban Philadelphia where they hired around 15 local workers. Today, they live in Los Angeles with their two-year-old son and a five-year-old Goldendoodle. For millions of Indians who went to the US on the H-1B visa in the early 2000s, a green card was a tangible next step to security and freedom. The chances of getting one now, however, look grim. Indians ranging from those working on the frontlines in America’s fight against Covid-19at hospitalsto those employed at tech behemoths likeNetflixandGoogleare among those on the interminable line for green cards. Immigration Voice, a US nonprofit, has been sharing their stories on social media to help drum up support for a group it refers to as “legal high-skilled future Americans.”Of the total 1 million green cards given out every year, just 140,000 are for employment-based applicants. The majority of the rest goes to family-based applicants. And because of the annual 7% country cap on green card allocations in the employment route, Indians face unprecedented backlogs.“The bottom line is that the H-1B system is old and has many flaws, but has become the main vehicle for great foreign-born talent to enter the US either directly or after being employed as students” on OPT visas, says Ran Harnevo, the CEO of Homeis, an online network for expats and foreign-born nationals around the world. “There are super-talented employees that totally rely on this visa for several years with (a) very slim opportunity to evolve to a better visa or a permanent residency.”By the start of 2030, the green card backlog will exceed 2.4 million petitions, virtually ending all legal employment immigration from India and China, the countries with the most employment-based green card petitions, the Cato Institute’s immigration policy analyst David Bierwrote in a March 2020 brief. Getting the H-1B visa—a pre-requisite before an employer can sponsor an employee—is a herculean task in itself. Dhaval, 34, immigrated to the US from India in 2008 to pursue a PhD in computer science. He thought life would be much easier once he completed his doctorate but his name was not drawn in the H-1B lottery for four years. His optional practical training (OPT) period ran out and he had to enroll in a masters program that offered CPT (curricular practical training) to continue working.“In these five years of constant struggle with getting the immigration work visa, even after having the highest possible level of education, I lost valuable time in starting the green card process,” he said. In an upsetting twist of fate, he finally got the visa—but then his company decided to stop sponsoring green cards due to constant immigration rule changes carried out by the Trump administration. H-1B visa-holders typically hesitate to change or quit jobs, since losing H-1B status could get them kicked out of the country. Even if Dhaval switches jobs and gets a new sponsor within the year, the wait for a green card could be longer than 80 years. US president Donald Trump’s hardline anti-immigrant stance has made a historically onerous process all the more challenging. Under his administration, application denials and requests for evidence both have gone up. During a recent vacation, Amey’s visa drew extra scrutiny for reasons not known to him. He spent close to 40 days working remotely from another country until his visa was approved. Dallas resident Anuja, a post-doctoral research fellow in biochemistry, has faced similar issues. “Being on a visa has many problems, especially in my field, which comes under the technology alert list,” she says. “When I travelled to renew my student visa towards the end of [my] PhD in 2013, I had to spend five weeks in India to receive clearance to travel back to the USA.”Dhaval, Amey, and Anuja all give the same reason for wanting a green card: freedom. The freedom to change jobs and fields, to travel, to start companies, to buy properties and put down roots, and more. In spite of waiting it out for years, several green card aspirants have gotten fed up.“President Trump’s visa restrictions are a ‘kiss of death’ for American innovation, and signal to the most vulnerable communities that their immense social contributions simply don’t matter anymore,” said Homeis’ Harnevo. “He has shattered their American dream, and now they have nowhere to turn.”Canada, for one, makesimmigration much easierthan the US, and Indian-born workers in the US are taking note. Dhaval opted for Canada’smerit-based immigration systemin 2019 and got permanent residency status within a year. He plans to make the move in the coming months. According to the Cato Institute, the number of Indians applying for permanent residency in Canada has doubled since 2016. Amey, too, started looking into migrating to Canadian around a year ago, citing “uncertainty, the political rhetoric, and the constant anxiety related to the American legal immigration process.” The family is in the final stages of getting permanent residency in Canada. But not everyone has an easy way out. Anuja, who hails from Mumbai, is still holding out hope for permanent residency in the US because “the kind of research I am involved in doesn’t happen in India,” she says. She is trying to get her green card via the EB1 route, nicknamed theEinstein visasince it’s reserved for people who are highly acclaimed in their fields. But the fear of things not working out is palpable.“If we were to lose our jobs today,” she says, “it would mean a flight back to India despite having spent our young years being as productive as possible in researching and mentoring, paying taxes, and being law-abiding citizens…not to mention visa issues in India due to havingUS-citizen kidsif you decide to go back.”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",3,Reliable,0.0442657154064921,0.3721981605234032,1515,3,Quartz
377,Ohio Supreme Court rules in favor of city in case brought by South Euclid Municipal Court,0.0,48.0,https://www.cleveland.com/community/2020/12/ohio-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-city-in-case-brought-by-south-euclid-municipal-court.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,18,"SOUTH EUCLID, Ohio -- The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled in the city’s favor in the case in which the South Euclid Municipal Court Judge Gayle Williams-Byers sued South Euclid for not providing the full funding the judge requested. The judges request for a sizeable increase in funding came as the city has experienced budget difficulties. Those struggles, City Council had maintained, made it difficult for the city to meet the judge’s requestWilliams-Byers had asked council to allocate $920,385 for the court’s 2019 budget, or nearly $212,000 more than was made available for the court’s budget the year before. Council, citing 2019 expenditures that exceeded revenues by $250,000, countered by giving the court $637,134. Later in 2019, after the municipal court filed suit against the city and council, council allocated an additional $90,866 in funding for the court. This added funding brought the total amount turned over to the court about $20,000 more than the court had received the year before. The Ohio Supreme Court, in its ruling, stated, “When a statute grants the legislative authority discretion to determine funding for a particular budget item, a city may refuse to fund even reasonable requests by a court -- The burden is on the court to establish that the city’s allocation constitutes an abuse of discretion.”It was further stated in another portion the supreme court decision that, “The judge’s request for this funding increase came at a difficult time for the city. The city had run budget deficits the previous two years and had made substantial cuts to a number of departments. In 2018, the city’s expenditures exceeded its revenue by over $250,000, forcing it to lay off employees, reduce road maintenance and other basic services, close public parks, and put off needed infrastructure improvements. The city anticipated that its revenue would remain stagnant in 2019, while the costs of critical services -- such as police and fire protection -- would continue to increase.”Judge Gayle Williams-ByersWilliams-Byers had asked the Ohio Supreme Court to give the municipal court the difference between what she had requested and what the court had thus far received. That difference stood at $192,385. Williams-Byers told the court that the added money was needed for various expenses. They included $19,120 in additional wages for three employees who took on extra work; $63,600 for two new staff members, a deputy clerk and probation officer; $51,404 in healthcare benefits; $34,980 for fringe benefits for all employees; and $6,033 for a 2-percent cost-of-living raise for all employees. The city contested each of those increases, save for the pay raises. The court sided with the city in each of the contested areas. The judge also stated that $22,187 was needed because she wished to rely less on discretionary funds in 2019 so that she could save money to finance an upgraded case management system. These costs, which had previously been paid by the court, were to be shifted to the city. Williams-Byers had been in the news when it wasreported in October, 2019, that she had spent tens of thousands of dollars since 2014 on trips to out-of-town judicial conferences. The supreme court stated that it questioned “the judge’s sincerity” with regards to her statements regarding attempts to conserve discretionary funds for a future system upgrade.“As the city points out,” the decision states, “its evidence demonstrates that the court spent nearly $60,000 on conferences and trainings during the previous six years. In 2018 and 2019 alone, Judge Williams-Byers traveled out of state ten times to attend conferences in such prime locations as Hawaii and Panama City, Panama. Judge Williams-Byers and the small-claims-court magistrate were slated to attend a weeklong seminar in Sovana, Italy, less than a month after issuing her funding order. And, according to the city’s finance director (Brenda Wendt), Judge Williams-Byers had -- all while embroiled in this budget dispute -- set up purchase orders totaling $3,990 for her and the magistrate to travel to France.”In reasoning its decision, the supreme court stated that it understood that a municipal court, in some situations, may exercise its power to compel essential funding, when necessary, to preserve judicial independence. It added that a legislative body, city council in this instance, needs to provide necessary funding.“But,” the supreme court noted, “we proceed cautiously when a judge seeks to use the court’s inherent powers to bypass ordinary budget channels. This is because problems arise when one branch of government seizes for itself a power rightly belonging to another branch of government.“Municipalities have limited public dollars to allocate among competing public needs, and the legislative process is designed to address those types of trade-offs. The legislative branch is more broadly representative of the citizenry than the judiciary.”The court further stated that “judges should seek to resolve funding disputes through the regular budgetary process, and funding orders and lawsuits invoking inherent authority should come only when all else has failed -- when a local funding authority’s (city council) refusal to adequately budget imperils the court’s ability to carry out its essential constitutional and statutory functions.”The state’s highest court also denied Williams-Byers’ request for an order to have the city pay the municipal court’s attorneys fees.“I’m extremely pleased with the decision that the supreme court came up with,” said City Council President Joseph Frank. “This is a decision they made regarding all of city councils throughout Ohio. regarding their budget allocations. The centerpiece was if it was reasonable, and we presented facts to the (supreme) court, and they certainly listened and denied the (municipal) courts’ request.“Budgeting is complicated and it involves a give and take on both sides,” he said. “We continue to face financial uncertainties, between COVID and state funding. We have to watch our budget just like every other city.”Williams-Byers, now serving her second six-year term, also has asuit pending against the city inCuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. In this case, the judge has claimed city officials have used discretionary court funds to pay court employees benefits and salaries over the course of, possibly, several years.

BuzzFeed News ReporterA COVID-19 PCR self-test kit is pictured at the Main Press Center of the 2020 Summer Olympics. Two soccer players and a video analyst from South Africa have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Olympic Village in Tokyo — just five days before the opening ceremony of the Summer Games. Players Thabiso Monyane and Kamohelo Mahlatsi and video analyst Mario Masha are now in the Tokyo 2020 isolation facility, a Team South Africa statement said Sunday. A fourth member of the country's Olympic delegation, rugby coach Neil Powell, also tested positive while at a training camp in the city of Kagoshima in southern Japan and is in isolation there. Monyane and Mahlatsi are the first athletes to test positive while staying at the Olympic Village, which has been set up as a bubble in hopes of preventing the spread of disease among the 11,000 people traveling from around the world to compete in the games. According to South African officials, the positive results came up in daily testing, and the men had previously tested negative on their daily tests, as well as when they departed South Africa. Less than 3% of the South African population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.""The timing of the positive results suggests that the PCR test in these individuals was done during the incubation period of the infection, which is how they could be negative in South Africa and then positive in Japan,"" Team South Africa's chief medical officer, Dr. Phatho Zondi, said in a statement. All other members of the South African delegation have continued to test negative. As Japan continues to see COVID-19 cases and deaths, officials last week banned any spectators from attending the games. But with thousands of athletes and support staff traveling into the country, fear that the Olympics could become a superspreader event remains, with even Japan's emperor reportedlyvoicing concern. People demonstrate against the Tokyo Olympic Games on July 18 in Tokyo. Since July 1, 55 people associated with the games havetestedpositive, most of them contractors. Meanwhile, Olympic leaders have continued to say the competition is safe.

Former president Barack Obama speaks during a cabinet meeting as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi looks on at the White House in Washington, DC, 2009. (Olivier Douliery / Getty Images)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. When Americans started facing the threat of foreclosure at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Barack Obama campaigned on apromiseof a simple, straightforward, and elegant solution: Force big banks to accept some losses and write down the amounts homeowners owed on their mortgages, thereby avoiding mass foreclosures. Soon after winning office, Obama abandoned the pledge to the delight of his Wall Street donors. Now, new data suggests that had Democrats instead used their huge congressional majorities to deliver relief, they could have rescued hundreds of thousands of families who were thrown out of their homes while Obama’s administration was bailing out the banks. Separate data, meanwhile, suggests that lessening the blow of the housing crisis on middle-class families may have averted Donald Trump’s narrow victory in 2016. The data provides a powerful cautionary tale to President Biden and congressional Democrats as financial analysts havewarnedof the possibility of a significant increase in foreclosures this year. The newstudyevaluates so-called mortgage “cramdown,” whereby bankruptcy judges reduce outstanding home-loan debts in order to keep people in their houses. The Supreme Court restricted the procedure in 1993, leaving judges unable to use cramdown to reduce middle-class Americans’ debts on their primary residences — even though judges were free to keep using cramdown to shield wealthy people’s investment properties and vacation homes from creditors. Comparing data from courts that had previously used cramdown with courts that did not use cramdown, the analysis from researchers at the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, and PUC Chile finds that cramdown “reduces the five-year foreclosure rate by 29 percentage points … stabilizes living arrangements and circumstances of households” and is associated with a reduction in crime rates. In early 2009, Obama’s incoming administrationpledgedto “reduce mortgage payments for economically stressed but responsible homeowners, while also reforming our bankruptcy laws” — and the new administration had recent history as a validator of its pro-cramdown rhetoric. When the federal government extended cramdown to rescue family farmers in the 1980s, it had the effect of compelling lenders to preemptively write-down the mortgage principal to avert bankruptcy proceedings, according toFederal Reserve Bank research. But after Wall Street banks thatbankrolledObama’s campaign mounted a furious lobbying blitz, the White Housequickly backed down— and Democratic lawmakerssaidObama officials abandoned the effort, dooming it to defeat.“The banks — hard to believe in a time when we’re facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created — are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place,”saidIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin after afailed Senate effortto pass cramdown in 2009. Ultimately, between 2007 and the end of Obama’s first term, banks foreclosed on more thanfour million householdswho were unable to use cramdown in the same way corporations and wealthy investors can use the provision to shield their own property. Researchers conservatively estimate that cramdown may have prevented roughly six hundred thousand foreclosures — and maybe significantly more. Datacompiledby the Center for American Progress suggests that Trump ended up turning the foreclosure disaster into a huge political opportunity for himself, increasing Republican electoral support in areas that were particularly hard hit by the housing crisis.“Larger proportions of underwater homeowners were prominent features of counties where support for the Republican Party increased from 2012 to 2016, compared with where the Democratic Party gained or maintained a foothold in 2016,” CAP’s analysis found. “In addition to declines among suburban and rural voters, Democrats experienced shrinking margins of victory in several distressed metropolitan areas. This may have played a role in turning Michigan and Wisconsin from blue to red in (the 2016) presidential election.”During the COVID-19 pandemic,millions of homeownershave taken advantage of mortgage forbearance programs to put off home payments. Though that has stemmed the tide of foreclosures for now, recentdatashows an uptick in new foreclosure proceedings. A recentFederal Reserve analysisestimated “current forbearance programs may prevent about 500,000 foreclosures that otherwise would have occurred” last year — almost exactly the number of foreclosures that the new cramdown research said would have been prevented during the last housing meltdown. In response, Democratic lawmakers included what some consider alimitedversion of cramdown in aCOVID-related spending packagesigned by Trump at the very end of 2020. Theprovisionsallow for more bankruptcy protections and discharged debts even if debtors missed some mortgage payments on a residential home — as long as the missed payments were related to hardship incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, those protections are temporary and end later this year. At the end of 2020, Sen. Elizabeth Warren introducedlegislationto reinstate cramdown. As a bankruptcy law professor, she was one of the most outspoken voices for the policy. The legislation has not yet been reintroduced in the new Congress.

381,What happened before Kodak's moment,-6.33,43.0,https://popular.info/p/what-happened-before-kodaks-moment,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,18,"Kodak, once an iconic American brandvalued at $30 billion, has been in dire straits for more than a decade. It filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and emerged in 2013. But Kodak, which built its business selling film, never successfully transitioned to digital. After bankruptcy, Kodak's old stock was worthless, but the newly issued shares peaked at over $36 in early 2014. But since then, it has rapidly declined, with the price mired well below $3 since March. In recent years Kodak has beenselling its patents, buildings, and other assetsfor cash. In 2018, the company attempted a pivot to cryptocurrency. Then, late Tuesday afternoon, everything changed. President Trumpannouncedthat he was ""using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals."" Kodak would now ""produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" reducing the country's reliance on China. Trump described it as ""one of the most important deals in the history of U. S. pharmaceutical industries.""The deal was also announced in Kodak's home city of Rochester, with White House adviser Peter Navarro in attendance. The stock immediately spiked, reaching $53 by 10 AM on Wednesday. To put that in perspective, if you owned 100,000 Kodak shares on Monday morning, they were worth $210,000. By 10 AM on Wednesday, those same shares were worth $5.3 million. But Kodak's stock actually began to riseTrump's announcement. On Monday, it increased from $2.15 to $2.62 on an unusually large volume of trading. Kodak CEO Jim Continenza appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box and was asked about the high trading volume on Monday. Continenza said he couldn't explain it. But Popular Information has learned that at least part of the reason for the spike on Monday was carelessness by Kodak. On Monday at 12:02 PM, Kris Betts, a reporter for WHAM, a local Rochester station, tweeted about an impending announcement. Betts, quoting a Kodak press release, said that the announcement would involve U. S. government officials and ""could change the course of history for Rochester and the American people.""A couple of hours later, a story with the same information was published to the WHAM website:Both the tweet and the story were taken down within a few hours without explanation. But WHAM told Popular Information that, on Monday, a Kodak press release was sent by email to Rochester news outlets without any indication that it was ""embargoed"" until Tuesday. Later, Kodak informed the station that it ""forgot"" to include the embargo, and WHAM agreed to take the story down. The news was also reported (and later removed) by other local outlets,including WROC. By Monday evening, a slightly vaguer version of the story was tweeted by The New York Times' Maggie Haberman. On Tuesday morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that Kodak would receive a loan from the federal government. The stock ended Tuesday at $8.06. After the official announcement, Kodak’s stock price soared. Kodak did not respond to a request for comment. The administration's loan to Kodak was possible because of aMay 14announcement by Trump. That was when Trump delegated authority to the CEO of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) under the Defense Production Act. The DFC was authorized to invest in companies to ""restore the domestic industrial base capabilities, including supply chains within the United States… needed to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak.""During his CNBC appearance, Continenza said that he had been working with the government on securing the loan for ""a few months."" It is obvious that securing the deal would dramatically increase the value of the company. The amount of the loan was seven times the value of Kodak at the beginning of this week. That means that Continenza knew about the possibility of the deal when he purchased 46,737 shares of Kodakon June 23. At the time of his purchase, those shares were worth 103,756.14. As of Wednesday afternoon, those same stocks were worth $1.87 million. Other employees who purchased shares since the May 14 announcement include Director Philippe Katz and CFO David Bullwinkle. Continenza has made a few other purchases of Kodak stock dating back to August of last year. In an appearance on Fox Business on Wednesday, Continenzasaidhe doesn't ""speculate on the stock price.""The deal with Kodak was brokered by White House trade advisor Peter Navarro. In recent days, Navarro has openly feuded with Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert. Navarrowrote an op-edfor USA Today with the title, ""Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on.""One of Navarro's chief complaints is that Fauci was insufficiently supportive of using hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, to treat or prevent COVID-19. The deal with Kodak appears to be a way for Navarro to continue to push hydroxychloroquine. As part of the deal, Kodak willreportedlymanufacture chemicals that will allow more hydroxychloroquine to be produced domestically. Studies have shown, however, that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in treating or preventing COVID-19. Astudyby the University of Minnesota, released June 3, found hydroxychloroquine ""does not prevent Covid-19."" A rigorousstudyby the UK government, released June 5, found hydroxychloroquine had ""no benefit for hospitalized Covid-19 patients."" On June 15, the FDArevokedits emergency authorization for the drug, stating that its ""unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19."" The WHOdropped hydroxychloroquinefrom a large clinical trial on June 17, ""after available data indicated the drug was not effective for Covid-19."" (Navarro has keyed in on one outlier study that experts say wasdeeply flawed.)But, despite the evidence, Trump and his advisers remain keenly interested in the drug. On Tuesday, TrumppraisedDr. Stella Immanuel, who claimed in a viral video that hydroxychloroquine is a “cure"" for COVID-19. Trump said Immanuel was ""spectacular"" in the video, adding that he believed hydroxychloroquine ""works in the early stages"" of the virus. Immanuel, however, is known for holding a number of views that are not supported by scientific literature, including that ""the uterine disorder endometriosis is caused by sex with demons that takes place in dreams.""Support Accountability Journalism",3,Reliable,0.0356645233851116,0.3682697776080128,1506,3,Popular Information

384,The new stimulus bill makes illegal streaming a felony – TechCrunch,-1.0,41.0,https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stimulus-bill-streaming/,https://adfontesmedia.com/techcrunch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,19,"We’ve already written several stories aboutthe new pandemic stimulus packagethat Congress approved yesterday, including funding toincrease broadband accessandfor new energy initiatives. There are, however, other provisions that could also have serious implications for the technology and media worlds. For one thing, the bill includes a proposal from Senator Thom Tillis (a Republican from North Carolina) that wouldmake illegal streaming for profit a felony(rather than just a misdemeanor), with penalties of up to 10 years of imprisonment. When Tillis released a draft of his proposal earlier this month, the open internet/intellectual property nonprofit Public Knowledge releaseda statementarguing that there’s no need “for further criminal penalties for copyright infringement,” but also saying that the bill is “narrowly tailored and avoids criminalizing users” and “does not criminalize streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams” — instead, it focuses on those who pirate for commercial gain. The bill also includes the CASE Act, which creates a new Copyright Claims Board within the U. S. Copyright Office. This system has been compared to small claims court, with the ability to adjudicate copyright claims and order payments of up to $30,000. Whenthe House of Representatives was debating the CASE Act last year, proponents defended it as giving independent artists an easier way to pursue copyright infringement claims, while groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said it could have a negative impact on individual internet users. Techdirt’s Mike Masnickargued yesterdaythat it will “supercharge copyright trolling exactly at a time when we need to fix the law to havetrolling.”Now that the House and Senate have approved the bill, it’s going to President Donald Trump for his signature. Since the full text was only released yesterday, we can probably expect plenty more debate over its implications in the weeks and months to come. Senator Tillis also issued a press releasenoting that the legislation was co-led by Senator Patrick Leahy (a Democrat from Vermont) and emphasizing that it will only apply to “commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services.”“The shift toward streaming content online has resulted in criminal streaming services illegally distributing copyrighted material that costs the U. S. economy nearly $30 billion every year, and discourages the production of creative content that Americans enjoy,” Tillis said in a statement. “I am proud this commonsense legislation that was drafted with the input of creators, user groups, and technology companies will become law so we can target criminal organizations and ensure that no individual streamer has to worry about the fear of prosecution.”GitHub defies RIAA takedown notice, restoring YouTube-dl and starting $1M defense fund",3,Reliable,-0.0028354978354978,0.4318181818181819,591,3,TechCrunch
385,Omaha protesters paint harsh picture of jail; officials say they did their best in a bad situation,3.0,44.67,https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/omaha-protesters-paint-harsh-picture-of-jail-officials-say-they-did-their-best-in-a/article_d355a9af-143a-5ad4-98c8-85cf5ee39925.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,22,"Amanda Humes and Ben Schacht have carefully considered which local protests to attend among several over the past two months. In early June,they attended a vigil for Zachary Bear Heels, who died in 2017 after he was punched and shocked with a Taser by Omaha police officers. Two days later, they marched down Dodge Street to Memorial Park — a week after James Scurlock was killed. Saturday’s gathering, which started at Midtown Crossing and was held to stand in solidarity with Portland and demand justice for Scurlock, was near the married couple’s residence. They trusted the organizers and took part in the peaceful protest. But they didn’t return home until early Monday morning, after little sleep and an overnight stay at the Douglas County Jail. What they learned while there is that the arresting and booking process is not a smooth one.“There was this feeling of hopelessness. It didn’t feel like there was a person in there who was interested in listening or helping,” said Humes, 33. “This feeling that you’re up against this system of processing … you don’t know where you are in that process or how long it will take.”The 120 protesters who were arrested by Omaha police officers Saturday night near 28th and Farnam Streets bogged down the jail’s booking process, despite the fact that Douglas County correctional officers stayed past their shifts and additional officers were called in to handle the influx. Scheduled routine maintenance to the jail’s computer systemonly added to the delays in getting protesters processed and released. Many protesters took to social media or told their family and friends about conditions inside the jail. Some of the allegations included that air conditioning in the cells was turned off, that they weren’t given food and that the cells were overcrowded. Some protesters contended that the system glitches were deliberate. Douglas County Corrections Director Michael Myers said the allegations aren’t accurate.“It was just a perfect storm of events,” he said Monday while showing a World-Herald reporter the areas where the protesters were kept. “I don’t want to discount people’s experiences. It’s frustrating to know that we were doing the best that we could with the resources that we had and the space that we had, and to be demonized like that feels unfair.”Myers said the jail isn’t equipped to handle so many people at one time. Officials had set up a third booking window after the large protests of late May and early June. The change allowed jail workers to book as many as 40 people in one hour, but the Saturday night system reboot jammed up the process. After people are booked, they are patted down and screened for metal or cellphones. They also must turn in any property, other than clothing, visit the medical office and get a booking photo taken, among other steps. Myers said with 100-plus people, all of that takes time. The protesters filled the jail’s 66-chair holding area, two large cells, eight small cells and a courtroom waiting room and small gym that officers turned into sleeping quarters with plastic cots. The holding area has 10 phones, which are free to use, two private toilets and drinking fountains. Sometimes on Sunday, Myers said, the large holding cell doors were opened to allow people to freely walk around. Other times, officers switched out groups to let them use the phones and get water. Protesters dispute that phone access and water were readily available. Riley Wilson, who served as a legal observer for a Scottsbluff attorney, said that at one point, 43 men were in one of the large cells, standing-room only. Wilson and others criticized the crowding based on federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend keeping people 6 feet apart to minimize the spread of COVID-19.“Once we were transferred over to the correctional facility, the biggest, scariest thing for me,” Schacht said, “was being in a pandemic and being crammed together. Masks can only protect you so much.”Myers said if there’s a problem with an inmate, jail workers move the people from the waiting room to the cells for safety, and that’s what happened. Most of the time, he said, the large cells held about 20 to 25 people.“You can’t social distance here,” he said. “We did the best that we could.”All arrestees are given orange, laundered masks, and most of the protesters wore their own masks, Humes said. Correctional officers are also required to wear masks. Many protesters said the capacity of the large cells was 14. A small sign above those cells — numbers 1 and 6 — say “ICE CAPACITY — 14.” Myers said that if the jail is holding arrestees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then only 14 people can be in that cell at once. But these protesters were not arrested on ICE-related charges, so those standards didn’t apply.“ICE has a lot of standards which exceed normal operating standards,” Myers said. At least one transgender person was arrested and placed into a small holding cell alone. Myers said officials usually allow transgender inmates to be with the gender they identify as, and a committee discusses placement so that the inmate and others are safe, but the committee doesn’t meet on weekends. The protesters were arrested on suspicion of a combination of charges, but mostly failure to disperse and obstructing passage. One person was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving, six with obstructing officers, four with resisting arrest and 11 with unlawful assembly, said Omaha Police Lt. Sherie Thomas, a police spokeswoman.“The protesters started walking in the street against the direction of traffic, then there were announcements made advising the crowd that they were unlawfully assembling before arrests were made,” Thomas said in an email. Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza had said Saturday that the protest “leaned toward the potential of getting violent.” When a World-Herald reporter requested more information about that statement, Thomas said “some intelligence was gathered” and declined to give further details. Wilson, the legal observer, said he did not observe any violence by protesters. He said he did see officers push someone off their bicycle and shoot pepper balls. As they arrested protesters from about 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m., they ordered people to get on the ground and then put zip ties on their hands. Protesters sat on a bridge along Farnam Street for a few hours before they were taken to the Douglas County Jail, where they waited again.“It was incredibly slow, and it was really painful,” Humes said. “Both my wrists were swollen and bruised from having to lay there like that.”Once inside the jail, Humes said, she was put into a holding cell with other women.“They all yelled, ‘You’re 46!’ meaning I was the 46th person to go into this room,” she said. Humes said some people were waiting to get their medication, and others coached a woman through an anxiety attack. At some point, the toilet in the women’s cell clogged or overflowed. Myers said that he had not heard about that but that maintenance staff is on hand at all times to fix problems as they arise. Around noon Sunday, Myers said, he authorized his staff to use a paper process to book people and allow them to post their bail because the computers still weren’t working. About 37 people were released during the day Sunday, and 69 people were released between 3 p.m. and midnight, he said. A few protesters had warrants from other counties and weren’t allowed to be released, he said. Myers said he was at the jail Sunday, overseeing the holding area. He said he spoke to a gathering of friends and family outside the jail to address their concerns. Myers said he is proud of the way his correctional officers handled the influx of people. Humes said she was able to pay her $500 bail but couldn’t leave the jail until about 10 p.m. Sunday. She waited for her husband for a couple of hours but then went home. Her husband was released about 1 a.m. Monday. Schacht, Humes and Wilson said they heard officers say that the jail process, charges and financial burden might stymie the arrestees’ future efforts to raise their voices in protest. But they said the situation only bolstered many protesters’ attitudes.“When you hear that, it sure makes you think, this was a very deliberate attempt to send a message,” Wilson said. “If the desired result was to have (protesters) being dissuaded from acting, all they did was intensify their beliefs.”alia.conley@owh.com, 402-444-1068twitter.com/aliaconleyOWHGet the latest in local public safety news with this weekly email.",3,Reliable,0.0512675382653061,0.3764314058956914,1883,3,Omaha World-Herald
386,Long COVID poses a subtle workplace crisis as sufferers say they're working longer hours and feel more stressed,0.0,45.0,https://www.businessinsider.com/long-covid-work-crisis-longer-hours-stress-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,17,"Long COVID may pose a workplace crisis, as new data offers a snapshot into how sufferers feel the impact on their working lives. Those self reporting symptoms of long COVID say they are working longer hours than before and in general have higher levels of anxiety. Some feel like they don't have anyone to talk to about their symptoms,according to the latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). There are two stages to the condition that is clinically diagnosed as long COVID, according to the British Lung foundation. Symptoms that last for between four and 12 weeks is known as Ongoing Symptomatic COVID-19. Symptoms that last for more than 12 weeks — and are unexplained by another diagnosis — are referred to as Post COVID Syndrome. Symptoms reported by sufferers can vary in their type and severity and include breathlessness, fatigue and aches and painsamong a variety of others. For the ONS survey, 39,268 UK adults aged 16 and above were polled to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on British society between April 7 and June 13. In total 6.2% of adults said that they had experienced symptoms of long COVID — that included 2.6% who said they were unsure. A tenth said that they had tested positive, but had not suffered any chronic symptoms. The survey covered self-reported symptons of long Covid, rather than those whose conditions had been clinically diagnosed. Of those who reported long-term symptoms, 44% said that it had affected their day-to-day work either through their ability to do their job or through other factors like having to work from home. Some 30% said that this impact had been negative. There has been an increase all around, with 36% saying they had not experienced long COVID but had felt the impact of the coronavirus on their working lives. But it's long COVID sufferers who were more likely to say that they worked longer hours as a result of the pandemic than those with no symptoms (25% versus 21%). Their mental health is also generally worse (40% compared to 30%). The majority, 65%, said that they felt more stressed and anxious as a result of their long term condition — compared to 59% for those without chronic symptoms. A quarter feel like they have no one to talk to about the condition. A further 25% say they feel like a burden on others. Other UK government studies have estimated that as many as2 million people had had COVID-19 symptoms that lasted at least 12 weeks by February 2021. Global numbers are hazier, but the World Health Organisation estimated in February that one in 10 people who catch COVID-19 could suffer long term symptoms.

387,Mitch McConnell's disdain for Biden's stimulus win says volumes,-12.0,34.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/mitch-mcconnell-s-disdain-biden-s-stimulus-win-says-volumes-n1273188,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-30,25,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is an uncomplicated man. Helikes to win, and there's something fascinating in that single-mindedness. There's no glad-handing, no attempt to connect with voters or even to try to appear to care about what they care about. McConnell doesn't pretend to be someone he's not — his hypocrisies are the blatant kind and, I assume, justifiable in his mind. A moment from McConnell's news conference Tuesday in Kentucky was a testament to this simplicity. The bespectacled 79-year-oldtold attendeesthat he was ""astonished"" to see that the Biden administration wanted to pass the $2 trillion American Rescue Plan:Well, it passed, on a straight party-line vote. Not a single member of my party voted for it. So you're going to get a lot more money. I didn't vote for it. But you're going to get a lot more money. Cities and counties in Kentucky are getting close to 7 or 800 million dollars. If you add up the total amount that'll come into our state, $4 billion, that's twice what we sent in last year. So my advice to members of the legislatures and other public officials is ""spend it wisely,"" because hopefully this windfall doesn’t come around again.“So you’re going to get a lot more money.” McConnell, in Kentucky, talks about Biden’s American Rescue Plan and its impact on Kentucky, while making the case that it went too far.(via@WSILNewslive stream)pic.twitter.com/AS4fXodpb4Most politicians would be touting that kind of investment in their home states, even if they didn't agree with the circumstances of its arrival. It's what we've been seeingfor months from Republicans around the countryin the wake of the stimulus package. But not McConnell, who all but holds the package at arm's length. Nothing about what that money could be spent on comes out of his mouth in those moments, nothing about how those billions could improve the lives of Kentuckians, nothing that admits that actual human beings would benefit from federal spending. See, McConnell may talk about helping the American people when he delivers speeches from the Senate floor in his drawling monotone as he prepares todeploy yet another GOP-led filibuster. But a win for the people isn't the same as a win in the game McConnell is playing — and he clearly draws a line between the two. At least, that's the message I've come away with from years of profiles and interviews and other attempts to add nuance to a figure who has loomed over Washington politics for the last dozen-odd years. The latest attempt came Tuesday in The Atlantic, where staff writer Peter Nicholas tried tounpack McConnell's view of his own legacy. As Nichols notes, after the next midterms, McConnell is likely to become the longest-serving caucus leader in the Senate, which is the kind of thing that usually tends to spur self-reflection. Instead, what emerges is a portrait of a creature of Washington who goes through the motions of politics' ""friendly combat,"" as McConnell puts it, for no other purpose than the thrill of it:For McConnell, politics is sport. He’s won and lost and is now aiming to recapture his old title of Senate majority leader in the 2022 midterm elections. “If you’re a football fan, it’s like the difference between being the offensive coordinator and a defensive coordinator,” McConnell told me. “The offensive coordinator has a better chance to score.” But for many Americans, rarely has politics been less of a game. ... Any long view of McConnell’s tenure would dwell more on what he’s blocked than on what he’s built; what he’s against, not what he’s for. When I asked Republicans close to McConnell what he cares about most, it was striking how little they mentioned policy. They talked instead about his fixation on winning the game. If there's a deeper philosophy to be found, it's in his disdain for rules that make it harder to win. His signature issue before rising to the Senate GOP leadership was dismantling any efforts at real campaign finance reform. Asa 2019 profile noted, McConnell adopted ""a position that blended a constitutional free-speech argument with a frank acknowledgment of practical expediency"" in that fight. He also gambled that becoming the villain in that case was ""likely to cost him little more than bad press and earn him the gratitude of his caucus and political capital within it.""If there's a deeper philosophy to be found, it's in McConnell's disdain for rules that make it harder to win. That willingness to be the bad guy in the media on issues that help Republicans win structurally, both in Senate debate and in their re-election campaigns, is the legacy McConnell will one day leave behind. And that's what I think I find so fascinating about him, this hollowness. There's nothing to decode or discern in McConnell's aims or motives. As far as villains go, he's more one-dimensional than most moviegoers would accept in this day and age. It's confounding that someone could devote his entire life to the acquisition and wielding of power and yet have such little care for how it's deployed except in the interest of retaining that power. And nevertheless, McConnell persists, gumming up the works for the Biden agenda in hope of getting his old title back. If and when he does, though, I hope the people of Kentucky remember what he told them: There are no more windfalls coming. Not if they don't help him win.

388,How to Find a Covid-19 Vaccine Appointment in Your Area,-3.0,47.67,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-find-a-covid-19-vaccine/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-06,25,"Omicron's rise hasbeen abrupt and startling. Like Delta, the WHO's director-generalsaid earlier this month, Omicron causes infections severe enough to lead to hospitalization and death, particularly among unvaccinated people. You should take every opportunity to protect yourself and your loved ones from it, and the latest shield available to you is a booster shot. Booster shots, like initial doses of the vaccination, may not completely prevent you from contracting Covid-19., and if you do catch a breakthrough case of Covid-19, you're far less likely to end up in the hospital with a severe infection. More thandosesof Covid-19 vaccines have been given worldwide since the pandemic began. The three vaccines used in the US—Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson—have been taken by hundreds of millions of people around the world by now, and they've been found to be safe and effective. In short, theycannot get you sickwith Covid-19. Vaccinations have led humanity out of many of history's most devastating diseases, such as polio, smallbox, and measles, and the Covid-19 vaccines—along with social distancing, masks, and smart policy decisions regarding reopening businesses—will beour path forwardto living with Covid long-term. States, territories, and our one state-like district (DC) all have wide latitude to set their own Covid-19 policies and procedures. Advice and paths to a Covid-19 vaccine are going to differ based on which part of the US you live in, but we've put together a guide that should give you an accurate overview of how to get the jab. All American adults, regardless of occupation or preexisting health conditions, areable to sign upfor a booster appointment. At least five months must have elapsed since your primary Pfizer-BioNTech or your Moderna series, and at least two months after your Johnson & Johnson. Children age 12 and up are eligibleare also eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech booster. If, and only if, a child aged 5 and up is moderately or severely immunocompromised, they can also receive a Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot. There's no federal or nationally centralized list onto which you sign up for a booster shot. Each state, territory, and freely associated state has sign-up information available on its own health department website. Odds are that a vaccine appointment is already available near you. About 90 percent of the population in the US has a vaccine sitewithin 5 miles of where they live.. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonSome health department sites are more helpful than others, offering telephone hotlines, statewide sign-up lists, and eligibility checkers that will say whether you can get a vaccine yet if you answer a few questions about your age, gender, profession, and health conditions. Other states merely direct you to a list of vaccination providers to call yourself. Check outVaccines.gov(formerly VaccineFinder), built by Boston Children's Hospital and the CDC, to locate available vaccines near you, andfollow its Twitter accountfor updates. Other places to check include:Vaccination sites let you make an appointment so that you can be sure you're not in for a long wait when you arrive. Now that vaccines are widely available, it's fine to walk in without an appointment. It's not guaranteed they'll have space, though, so if you want to make sure you won't have a long wait, make an appointment beforehand. A government-provided vaccination site, such as a community health center or public health department, might be the safest option if you're worried about surprise medical bills or don't want to reveal your citizenship or immigration status. They tend to be free, too. In our research and experience, we found that many say they don't ask for health insurance information or immigration status on their websites. Check with your local facilities to make sure. Most states also run mobile vaccination units, a broad catchall term for pop-up tents, buses, and trailers that are regularly driven to different locations. They typically show up in areas where residents have limited ability to go to a vaccination site, such as low-income neighborhoods, nursing homes, and rural areas. While a state or city's website for government facilities might only drop new appointment openings on certain days or at certain times, private companies operating in those states aren't held to the same schedule. Each company seems to have a different time at which they drop new appointments, so openings are scattered across the day. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonLike the initial vaccines, booster shots are typically covered by your health insurance, but it pays to check with your provider and the office before you commit to an appointment. Surprise bills are a problem in this country. Private practices and retail locations, such as pharmacies, usually require you to bring anandhealth insurance cardand may ask for the name of your primary care physician. Vaccination sites run by government services, such as at community health centers and public health departments, don't typically ask for health insurance info, but you may needproof of state residency. Depending on your state, it may be possible to use school records, samples of mail addressed to you, or a statement from another person as a substitute for a government-issued ID. But be sure to check with the specific vaccination site you've decided upon. In the United States, the three booster vaccines available to the public right nowvia emergency authorization by the FDAare from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen. TheCDC recommendsthe Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech booster shots over the Johnson & Johnson. ABritish studypublished in the Lancet compared the immune responses of six vaccines, including the three vaccines available in the US, and found that the mRNA vaccines—Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—provided the strongest protection, although all six booster vaccines did increase immune system protection. It is also safe to mix and match your primary and booster vaccine. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasgranted full approvalto the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots continue under Emergency Use Authorization. Moderna has requested full approval, and Johnson & Johnson says they plan to request full approval within the year. Vaccination sites typically tell you which brand of booster shot is available and let you choose when scheduling. It takes two weeks after your booster shot for your body to build up its maximum defenses, so remember that until then your body is still building up its immune system protection. The CDC also offers advice onwhat to expect at your vaccination appointment. You may get asked if you've been exposed to Covid-19 or shown any symptoms lately, and the facility should ask you to sit and wait for a period of15 minutesafter getting your vaccine to ensure you don't have a severe reaction, or 30 minutes if you've had a reaction to a vaccine or injection before. You should also be given a card that tells you the vaccine you got and the date (keep it). After your vaccination, you cansign up for V-safe, the CDC's Health Checkerwebsite. It will send you phone notifications to fill out an easy survey in the days and weeks after getting your vaccine, asking about any symptoms you've experienced and notifying you when you should get your second dose. A few warnings:Don't get any other vaccinationsin the 14 days before or after your Covid-19 vaccination. Don't preemptively take new medications before vaccination, even over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, or stop taking your normal medications before your appointment; talk to a doctor before the appointment and tell them what you're on, though. They may have some advice for you. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonEven if you've already had Covid-19, your antibodies won't last forever. Youshould still get vaccinatedwhen you can. Plus, theprotection you receive from a vaccination isthan the protection you get from having had Covid-19. If you had Covid-19a vaccination, then that's even stronger. I was a healthy guy who hit the gym regularly and had no existing health conditions, but Covid knocked me flat on my ass for five weeks in 2020 before there were any vaccines available. I was only 31. Protection isn't immediate after a shot. It takesabout two weeksafter Moderna's or Pfizer-BioNTech's second shot, and two weeks after the single Johnson & Johnson shot for your body's immune system to reach its maximum strength against the virus. Johnson & Johnson is currently testing a two-dose version of its vaccine, but the findings aren't ready yet, and so it's only being given as a one-dose shot at this time. In its clinical trial, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had a lower overall efficacy than the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, but all three are great atpreventing severe cases of Covid-19that would lead to hospitalization or death. On April 25, 2021 the USresumed administeringthe Johnson & Johnson vaccine afterpausing it on April 13, 2021to investigate a possible link between it and a rare type of blood clot that can appear within two weeks of being given the shot. There have been half a dozen or so reportedcases of complicationsout of the 17.8 million doses administered in the US. The CDC recommends that you bring your original vaccination card when you show up for your booster, as many vaccination sites will ask for either the card or a photograph of the card. Your vaccine provider will double-check to make sure thatfive months has elapsedsince your primary series, and add all your information—vaccination site, date, time, brand of booster vaccine, and details on the production batch of booster you received—to your previous doses' information in one place.. Many venues, restaurants, bars, and methods of travel require proof of vaccination now. You need to keep your card safe so that you can use it as a pass. Carrying your physical card with you everywhere might be risky. Many cities and states have their own Covid pass apps for iPhones and Androids so that you can have your Covid pass information always handy without risking your physical card. There's also the nationwideCommonPassapp. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonDon't laminate your vaccination card. Stick it in a Ziploc if you're worried about keeping it safe, and put it somewhere you know you'll be able to find it in three or four weeks when you're due for your second dose. If you lose your card, you can go back to the site and get another one printed off. Take a picture of it so that you have the information as a backup, just in case.some side effectsto the vaccines, butallergic reactionsare rare. If you've had allergic reactions to vaccines before, tell the person giving the vaccination as soon as you arrive. They'll probably ask you to hang around for a little while after the shot, just to make sure. Here's alist of vaccine myths and factsthat slaps down the persistent lies floating around social media and conspiracy websites. For example, the vaccines will not alter your DNA or make it unsafe for you to have a baby. They also won't make you magnetic. Even after you are fully vaccinated, keep wearing a mask in public (or get one). The CDC hasupdated its recommendation for vaccinated people to wear masksindoors and in certain other situations, as the risk level has changed since mask rules were relaxed earlier this year. Masking up keeps everybody—even you—safer. Finally, if there are folks in your life who might need help getting vaccinated, share the knowledge and give them a hand. Every vaccination makes us all a little bit safer.",3,Reliable,0.1466041130256817,0.4747031744580762,2737,3,WIRED

On Aug. 12, the visitor and resource protection supervisor at Arches National Park, heard a call come over her radio of a possible domestic assault, stemming from an argument in Moab between Petito and her fiance, Brian Laundrie. Hulls arrived to find the couple pulled over by a Moab police officer inside the park. Knowing that in a domestic violence situation the female usually feels more comfortable talking with another female, she focused on Petito, who at that point was sitting in the back of a police cruiser.“I can still hear her voice,” Hulls said in an exclusive interview with the Deseret News. “She wasn’t just a face on the milk carton, she was real to me.”Hulls pictures the sobbing 22-year-old sitting in the back of the cruiser. She knows her mannerisms, just from the roughly hour-and-a half interaction.“I was probably more candid with her than I should've been,” Hulls recalls, warning Petito that her and Laundrie’s relationship had the markings of a “toxic” one.“I was imploring with her to reevaluate the relationship, asking her if she was happy in the relationship with him, and basically saying this was an opportunity for her to find another path, to make a change in her life,” she said.“She had a lot of anxiety about being away from him, I honestly thought if anything was going to change it would be after they got home to Florida.”In the end, Petito stayed with Laundrie.“This wasn't a good day for anybody. We thought we were making the right decision when we left them.”And on Sunday, when she heard the news that the FBI recovered a body in Wyoming “consistent with the description of Gabby Petito,” the law enforcement ranger of 17 years tilted her head back and let out a sigh of someone all too familiar with a body recovery effort.“I honestly haven’t looked at my body camera footage for that night. It’s hard to think about now because I feel like I could've said more to help her,” she said. “It’s hard not to second-guess myself, and wish I said more, or wish I had found the right words to make her believe that she deserved more.”Teton County Coroner Brent Blue confirmed on Tuesday the body found in Wyoming was in fact Petito’s. The coroner’s initial determination for the manner of death is homicide, though official cause of death remains undetermined, pending final autopsy results, Denver FBI officialstweeted. It’s a video that millions of Americans watched. Gabby Petito, sitting in the passenger seat of her van crying uncontrollably as she and Laundrie are approached by a Moab police officer. Petito apologizes multiple times. Laundrie, soft-spoken, nervous and also apologetic, sits in the driver’s seat as he takes the keys out of the ignition and proceeds to explain why the van hit the curb.“He really stresses me out. This is a rough morning,” Petito tells officers.“I don’t know, it’s just some days I have really bad OCD and I was just cleaning and straightening up and I was apologizing to him,” she says as the officer walks her away from the van, sitting her down on the curb before helping her into the air-conditioned cruiser.“I’m sorry that I’m so mean.”Petito then details a fight between her and Laundrie earlier that afternoon, where she says her fiance tried to lock her out of the car, telling her she “needed to calm down.”Their stories line up, with Laundrie telling officers, “I said, ‘Let’s just take a breather and let’s not go anywhere. Let’s just calm down for a minute.’” He then tells police that the several scratches on his face were from Petito hitting him as she tried to get back into the van. A striking image soon emerges — a sobbing Petito, surrounded by male officers. Then Hulls arrives. After consoling Petito, Hulls discusses what to do with her colleagues. They had several options. With the facts suggesting Petito was the aggressor, they could’ve taken her to jail. But Hulls said the situation appeared to be more of a mental health crisis than a case of domestic violence. What Petito did to Laundrie “was emotional,” Hulls said. “She shouldn't have done it, but it wasn’t done maliciously.”“I wouldn't have called (the relationship) unsafe. If we had any reason to think any one of them was in danger, we would’ve separated them,” she said. On Monday, audio of the 911 call was released, giving new insight into what led up to Hulls’ interaction with Petito.“A gentleman was slapping the girl,” the caller tells dispatchers. “They ran up and down the sidewalk. He proceeded to hit her, hopped in the car, and they drove off.”Why that information was not relayed is unclear. Moab police did not respond to a request to comment. Hulls detailed the complexing, difficult — and often scrutinized — relationship between law enforcement and domestic violence situations. Sometimes the choice is clear, and knowing the victim is in imminent danger can make the responding officer’s job easier. But it’s not always black and white.“Sometimes you get evidence and they don’t own up to it, and they’re just lying to your face and it’s unsafe, and you know that something more is going to happen if you let them go home together. That’s a much easier decision to arrest,” she said. “With this one, I just don’t think she understood how big a deal this was.”So they separated the couple. Petito took the van, Laundrie was taken to a hotel, and a few days later, they were back on the road, headed north to Salt Lake City. Their social media presence resumed, showing every indication of a happy couple in love and living out the coveted van life. They stopped in Ogden, where Petito ispictured in front of a butterfly mural, the last thing posted to her Instagram account. A few days later, Petito texted her mom before the couple reportedly went camping in Wyoming. It was the last time they heard from their daughter. A week later, she was reported missing. On Sunday the story took a heartbreaking turn when investigators made the grim announcement from Grand Teton National Park. The case is still under investigation — what exactly happened to Petito and the role Laundrie played has yet to be announced. But according to the thousands, maybe millions, following the story, Laundrie is guilty.“Where is Gabby?” became a rallying cry, repeated ad nauseam in the thousands of comments under Laundrie’sstill active Instagram account. Moab is pictured at dusk on Friday, Sept. 17, 2021. When the news broke of the incident outside Arches, Moab quickly became a focal point. Screengrabs from the body camera footage, with Utah’s iconic red rocks in the background, became the main image used by national media. Even now, weeks after the incident, the case is still casually mentioned all over Moab — spend a few hours at a coffee shop, bar, even the Arches National Park visitors center, and you’re bound to overhear Petito’s name. Sometimes they’re expressing grief. Sometimes they’re speculating on what happened. And sometimes they’re criticizing the response from Moab police. Why was Petito treated as the aggressor? Why was Laundrie, who towered over his fiance, treated as a victim? And why didn’t they notice,as some on Twitter suggested, the signs of a controlling and manipulative relationship?Hindsight is 20/20, Hulls said of the criticism, noting that “it’s easy to say that when you can break down a video, minute by minute, and judge it, versus being in the momentwhere we saw minor injuries and two people that were apologetic.”“It’s not that we didn’t think he was manipulative, but we have to worry about the safety, and not the psychology of it,” she said. “We have to go by the facts that we were faced with at the time, and not let our emotions drive the decision.”And while Hulls doesn’t fault the actions taken by her colleagues that day, she admits it can be hard not to fixate on what else she could have said to Petito.“It’s hard not to think that I could've done something more, or found the exact words to make her change her life right then,” she said. “There are so many circumstances where you wish it had gone a certain way, and if you get stuck with the ‘would have, could have, should have,’ you can’t do this job. You got to learn from it and keep going, otherwise you’re not going to be help for the next Gabby.”National Park Service ranger Melissa Hulls, the visitor and resource protection supervisor for Arches National Park, listens to a call on her radio outside of the park’s visitors center on Sunday, Sept. 19, 2021.",3,Reliable,0.0685343550298907,0.3839142380437024,2032,3,Deseret News

Living in a digital world has its perks. But it's also rife with vulnerabilities. Last year, ransomware attacks were up300%...and they don't seem to be slowing down. Over the last month, the US has been the target of three major cyberattacks. From the fuel industry, to government computers, to...meat. Yes, meat. Here's what the beef's all about...... Last month, a ransomware attack shut down one of the US's largest fuel pipelines for six days – thought to be one of themost disruptiveransomware attacks on record. The line provides 45% of fuel to the East Coast. And its closure triggered fears about gas shortages and promptedpanic buyingat the pump. Gas prices jumped, pumps ran dry, and the US gov had to step in and tell people to not fillplastic bagswith fuel.... Last week, the tech giant revealed that hackers compromised the US Agency for International Development's account with Constant Contact, an email marketing service. And from there, targeted around 3,000 email accounts – affecting over 150 gov agencies (including some in the US), think tanks, and NGOs. At least 23 other countries also fell victim to the hack. Microsoft said their security systems blocked most of the attacks, but it was notifying affected users.... Yesterday, a ransomware attack caused the world's largest meatpacker toclose downall of its US beef plants – affecting at least 20% of US beef production. JBS is home to brands like Primo, Pilgrims, and Swift products. The company says there's no evidence its info has been compromised and backup servers were not affected. But with beef and pork prices alreadyon the risebecause of disruptions caused by the pandemic, this attack could increase prices even more. But JBS says the ""vast majority"" of its plants will be up and running today. Hacking groups – many of which are based in Russia. DarkSide, a criminal hacking group, managed to walk away with $4.4 million in ransom money after it hacked Colonial Pipeline. Microsoft's pointing the finger atNobelium: a Russian group that was behind last year'sUS gov data breach. And JBS is suspecting criminal Russian hackers too. The White House already imposedsanctionson Russia for previous attacks. Now, it's getting in touch with the Kremlin over this latest hack, warning Russia against harboring cybercriminals. TBD if it has any effect, or if it'll be brought up inconversationwhen President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet later this month. While the federal gov has tried toaddresscybersecurity holes, hackers have exposed the faults in US infrastructure security. It's leaving companies no choice but to pay off ransom or face major disruptions. Pope Francis. Yesterday, he updated the Catholic Church's laws to more clearly address sexual abuse – the first major changes since 1983. For decades, the church has facedsexual abuseandfinancial scandals. And victims have long said that the church's code protected accused clergy members – and some say the church's process of handling cases takes too long. Now, thenew rulescriminalize sexual abuse, grooming, covering up abuse, and possession of child pornography. The penalties can include ""deprivation of office"" and defrocking – one of the most severe punishments in the church. And civil authorities could also issue their own punishments. The changes will be effective starting Dec 8. And will provide a legal framework for the 1.3 billion-member Catholic Church to follow. Peru. Earlier this week, gov officials there said they undercounted the country's coronavirus death toll, raising it from over 69,000 to more than 180,000. Officials reportedly blamed a lack of testing in part for the undercount. Throughout the pandemic, Peru has struggled to test its citizens and has dealt with an overwhelmed health care system and lack of oxygen tanks. And because many peoplelack fridges, Peruvians go to the market regularly – increasing their risk of exposure. Now, the country has the highest virus-related death rate per capita in the world, according to one analysis. And uncertainty looms over the upcoming second round of presidential elections. Around the continent: The virus is reportedly spreading faster in South America than on any other continent. Organizers ofCopa Américamoved the major soccer tournament to Brazil from Argentina, which is experiencing one of the worst outbreaks in South America. President Biden. Yesterday, he announced new steps to reduce theracial wealth gapas the US marked the 100th anniversary of theTulsa Race Massacre– one of the worst episodes of racial violence in the country. Black Americans have long faced housing, banking, and workforcediscrimination. The median net worth of white households is abouteight times more than Black households. So Biden announced plans to reverse Trump-era housing rules that weakened protections for Black Americans. He also wants to create more federal contracts for small disadvantaged businesses and launch an initiative to target discrimination in the housing market. The Biden admin's. Yesterday, it suspended oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge – undoing one of former President Trump's major environmental acts. The former admin auctioned off the right to drill in Alaska, home to tens of thousands of caribou and polar bears...just before President Biden's inauguration. Now, the Biden admin says all leases are on hold pending a review. But Alaskan officials said the Biden admin's suspension is illegal and hurts the state's economy. Malala Yousafzai.

On “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace pressed Walensky to clarify what was behind the seemingly sudden shift in the CDC’s recommendations for mask wearing, asking her to confirm that pressure from lawmakers such as Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) had nothing to do with the decision.“Yes, I can [confirm],” Walensky said.“I can tell you it certainly would have been easier if the science had evolved a week earlier and I didn’t have to go to Congress making those statements, but I’m delivering the science as the science is delivered to the medical journals,” Walensky said. “And, you know, it evolved over this last week. The cases came down over the last two weeks. And so that’s — I delivered it as soon as I can when we had that information available.”Wallace questioned whether the CDC was being overly optimistic in relying on the “honor system” for people to abide by the new mask guidelines.“We’re still vaccinating somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million people a day. And so every day, more and more people are getting vaccinated. The honor system is, to be honest, with yourself,” Walensky said. “If you are vaccinated, we are saying you’re safe. You can take off your mask, and you’re not at risk of severe disease or hospitalization from COVID-19. If you’re not vaccinated, you are not safe. Please go get vaccinated or continue to wear your mask.”Walensky confirmed that there were no plans to roll out vaccine passports on the federal level but acknowledged there “will be places at local levels” that might require proof of vaccination.",3,Reliable,0.1222546897546897,0.4149098124098124,434,3,The Hill
392,'Data' Has Become a Dirty Word to Public Education Advocates. It Doesn't Have to Be (Opinion),-4.33,39.33,https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-data-has-become-a-dirty-word-to-public-education-advocates-it-doesnt-have-to-be/2021/02,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-09,25,"Since the federal No Child Left Behind Act was enacted in 2002, the words “data collection” have inspired fear and mistrust in education circles. For many educators, the term signifies bureaucrats’ weaponized use of standardized-test scores to monitor and punish districts, schools, and teachers for failing to meet seemingly arbitrary standards of test-score gains. For some, data collection also represents an assault on public education—a tool to support market-driven approaches (read: charter schools and vouchers) at the expense of the nation’s traditional system of community-based public schools. But a revamped approach to data collection could help restore and re-energize a community focus on public education—and also help the incoming Biden administration avoid a bruising partisan battle. The Biden team is weighing education measures that include massive increases in federal funding to improve the academic achievement of disadvantaged students, to open universal prekindergarten for all 3- and 4-year-olds, and to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for middle- and lower-income families. These changes are well worth fighting for but likely to trigger strong Republican opposition, fueled by indignation over Washington’s further incursion into an area that some feel should never have been wrested from state and local control in the first place. I believe the administration could sidestep some of this anger by using its bully pulpit and leveraging grants to build a community-friendly national culture of data generation, dissemination, and use. A reimagined system of data could encourage a bottom-up use of information nationwide—particularly at the local level—removing ideological barriers to collaboration and speaking to Republicans’ belief that innovation and creativity take place locally. What might this new use of data look like?Consider the“Data Walk” methodemployed by the Urban Institute to empower local communities as partners in designing policies and programs to address their own needs. During a Data Walk, program participants, community residents, and service providers jointly review and interpret data in small groups and collaborate to improve policies, programs, and other factors of community change. Data Walks have helped design a sexual-health and -safety curriculum for youths and adults living in a public-housing development in the District of Columbia and improve employment and education services in low-income neighborhoods in Chicago and Portland, Ore. Similarly, the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership, a learning network also coordinated by the Urban Institute, provides independent partner organizations in more than 30 cities with neighborhood-level data. I offer these as illustrations, not specific endorsements. The philosophy they share is that bydemocratizing information, residents and local organizations can develop a stronger voice in improving their own communities. Animated by this kind of vision, the Biden administration could repurpose the collection of education data. Data could serve democratic rather than bureaucratic accountability. It could empower parents to act collectively, as citizens, rather than individualistically, as consumers. But can data use really be stage-managed from the White House? NCLB, launched under Republican President George W. Bush, and Race to the Top (RTTT), an initiative by Democratic President Barack Obama, showed that top-down efforts to incentivize data use triggered unanticipated effects, ranging from gaming the system to outright backlash. Yet for all their problematic consequences, NCLB and RTTT showed that the federal government can nudge and prod better data systems into existence. From 2009 to 2014, the number of states investing their own funds increased from eight to 41, and a subset of those states have made timely and useful data available to parents, teachers, and others. Armed with new information about the relative academic performance of historically disadvantaged students, advocates have pressed districts to make equity a higher priority. The incoming administration can build on these lessons about how to nudge states and districts to build and use data systems through encouraging demonstration projects, supporting dissemination of best ideas, reconfiguring criteria for competitive grants, fostering capacity-building at the community level, and targeting research funds. Such efforts could unite a range of stakeholders to ask for information about important schooling outcomes beyond those assessed through standardized tests. Local groups have become accustomed to putting data to use, but there’s demand for a wider array of measures, which can help with establishing a shared focus among often disparate collaborators. Two experts working with local partnerships put it this way: “Agreement on a common agenda is illusory without agreement on the ways success will be measured and reported.”As my colleagues and I discovered in a2016 studyof 183 locally-based, cross-sector collaborations in education, 40 percent had a portion of their websites devoted to data, which they used to draw attention to underappreciated problems or opportunities, provide guidance for action, or monitor impact. Most of these data presentations relied on readily available measures such as test scores and graduations rates, but some found ways to track kindergarten readiness, children’s social and emotional development, college advisement, disciplinary practices, technology use, and parent engagement. These kinds of indicators get closer to the concerns and interests community stakeholders care about, but without a strong federal push, they are not consistently and reliably collected. None of this would be easy. Many federal and philanthropic efforts to empower communities have fizzled or otherwise gone awry. Information on its own won’t stimulate needed structural changes. It needs to be accompanied by resources, a strategy for shifting power relationships, and a patient investment in sustainable initiatives. But done well and wisely, a federal commitment to a re-envisioned application of data can help broaden and fortify a grassroots constituency to support the values the Biden administration hopes to bring to the fore.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1515371102327624,0.3623298199385155,1204,3,Education Week
393,Gyms remain open despite recent outbreak at Pacific Beach business,-5.0,44.0,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/story/2020-07-30/gyms-remain-open-despite-recent-outbreak-at-pacific-beach-business,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,20,"Multiple gyms across San Diego County remained open Thursday, despite the outbreak reported this week at one Pacific Beach fitness business, The Gym, that had been operating illegally. The Gym was closed Thursday afternoon, and inside a person could be seen measuring a floor mat. The nutrition shop attached to the gym remained open. The clerk at the shop said the gym was in the process of readying its equipment to move outdoors. Three people or more testing positive for COVID-19 is considered an outbreak. Of the 235 outbreaks so far countywide, five were in gyms, a county spokesman said Thursday. About half of all outbreaks were in congregate care facilities. No gym is allowed to operate indoors under the county health order first issued in March and updated again Thursday, the spokesman said. He could not say which other gyms had reported novel coronavirus cases. Many of the large chains such as Crunch and 24-Hour Fitness are closed, but some of the smaller, independent gyms have defied the county order. Another fitness center called The Gym, with different owners, was filled with clients Thursday morning in Vista, many not wearing masks or maintaining the required 6-foot distance. Co-owner Todd Danner said the management planned to move their equipment outside to the parking lot, and he did not look happy about it.“Some of these (weight) stacks weigh 1,000 pounds,” Danner said. Movers were coming to help carry things, and he needs to buy tents and artificial turf for the asphalt. He feels like his business already complies with the county’s emergency public health order, he said. Still, Vista city officials sent him a list of things that needed be done. Later Thursday, the Vista Sheriff’s Station received a formal complaint about the business, said Lt. Ricardo Lopez, media relations director for the Sheriff’s Department.“Deputies visited the business just before 12:30 p.m. to notify gym staff they were in violation of the public health order,” Lopez said by email. “They were given an updated copy of the current order. A formal crime case is being written and will be submitted to the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office.”Violation of the county health order is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, up to six months in jail, or both, Lopez said. No one answered the phone at The Gym in Vista late Thursday afternoon. The county had issued a total of 144 citations for violating the county health orders through Wednesday, according to the Sheriff’s Department’s website. Boulevard Fitness in City Heights was open and operating Thursday morning in a large open area with open garage-door-sized windows that opened nearly an entire wall of the multi-level building to open air. Fans on the floor and ceiling created a noticeable breeze throughout the space. Some areas, such as an area with treadmills and an exercise room, were closed off because they did not have windows or doors to the outside, said owner Shawn Gilbert. Customers, almost all of whom were wearing face coverings, sanitized their hands and got their temperature taken before being allowed inside. Machines were spaced 6 feet apart – Gilbert said they measured carefully – and there was a covered, open-air area outside the big windows with equipment in it where people who wanted to be all the way outside could work out. The gym was not accepting new members and it had limited use to 50 percent of the facility’s capacity, Gilbert said. He said the gym would be closed on Sunday for professional deep cleaning. Gilbert said police had come by twice about a week ago in response to a noise complaint about the music in the gym. Gilbert said the music didn’t seem particularly loud to him, but he turned it down and police left. He said police did not express any other concerns about the gym’s operations. No county officials or any sort of multi-agency “strike teams” had come to the gym, Gilbert said. He said he had not received any cease or desist letters from the county, nor any public health orders to close, and he felt “1,000 percent” sure the gym’s operations were permissible under public health orders. No classes were underway Thursday ata jiu-jitsu gymin Normal Heights that had opened in defiance of the county’s public health order in May. One employee was inside the building. The main entrance was locked and the lobby was dark. A phone call to the gym reached voicemail and an email was not immediately answered Thursday afternoon. Weights were being lifted at the Metroflex Gym in Oceanside, where owner Lou Uridel was briefly arrested in May for re-opening after a two-month closure in violation of the county health order. He has a court hearing scheduled for September.“Right now, we feel we are in compliance,” Uridel said Thursday afternoon. Mask-wearing, which for a time was optional, is now mandatory, he said. He and his employees emphasize self-care, cleanliness, and distancing, and they encourage their clients to maintain a safe distance. Occupancy of his building is limited to a maximum of 35 people, about 20 percent of its normal capacity, he said. Fans have been added and a rear door opened to keep air moving through the interior. Foot traffic is routed in one door and out another. Police officers frequently stop by to check on his business, Uridel said. He tells them he is complying with the rules and that nothing has changed, and they leave. Uridel, an attorney licensed in California and Illinois, said COVID-19 and its prevention has become a political issue and he appears OK with that. He recently decided to run for Oceanside mayor in November, and a big plank in his campaign is support for small businesses. Located close to Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, almost three-quarters of the clients at Metroflex are active-duty military or veterans. Some said they feel like a family. Don Butts, a trainer who works six days a week at Metroflex, said he feels safe there.“I haven’t gotten sick,” he said. “None of my clients have gotten sick.”Oceanside police spokesman Tom Bussey said Thursday it is the county’s responsibility, not the city’s, to enforce the public health order. Police have often said enforcement of the state and county public health orders is difficult for many reasons. Some people claim that requiring a business to close violates the owner’s rights under the state and federal constitutions. Also, because the health orders are issued by the state and county, city police departments may not have the authority to enforce them. County officials said this week they plan to form enforcement teams with representatives from each city in an attempt to improve compliance.",3,Reliable,0.0140675255133086,0.3904092560719066,1426,3,San Diego Union-Tribune

395,In Defense of Liberal Conspirators,-20.67,33.33,https://newrepublic.com/article/162318/astra-taylor-defense-liberal-conspirators,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"The following is an excerpt from Astra Taylor’s new book,Remake the World.“It’s as natural as breathing” is a cliché because, when all is going well, nothing else is more effortless than inhaling and exhaling, something we do approximately twenty thousand times a day. Typically, most of us don’t think much about it. We breathe as we sleep, breathe as we eat, breathe as we move, and breathe as we talk. But that changed in 2020. We worried about our lungs and gasped for air. A novel illness sickened millions and tanked the global economy, thousands ingested tear gas protesting police violence, and cities were smothered by plumes of dark, noxious smoke from nearby forest fires. During the first tense few weeks of the Covid-19 shutdown, we thought we could stop the spread of the disease by washing our hands. Our hands were something we could control. We could keep them in our pockets, wear latex gloves, have sanitizer at the ready, and scrub off the pathogen with soap and hot water. We didn’t have all the facts. The coronavirus, as U. S. authorities knew by early February, is airborne, transmitted through invisible particles and droplets emitted and ingested during the most automatic of physical acts. The pandemic has revealed “that our bodies function more like sponges than fortresses,” my sister, the disability rights activist and scholar Sunaura Taylor, observed. “In a variety of visualizations, we see our bodies extending beyond their usual bounds: graphics of our coughs, sneezes, and even breath show how far beyond our own skin our bodies reach; the six-foot rule of social distancing a daily acknowledgment that our bodies not only leak and ooze, but that they absorb the conditions of others.” Epidemiology and physics colluded to prove that even at a seemingly safe distance, we touch by virtue of breathing the same air. In the worst cases, Covid-19 causes acute respiratory distress. Experts describe succumbing to the disease as akin to drowning. Early in the outbreak I read a piece by a doctor attempting to educate readers about how our lungs operate and what contracting the illness might entail. A healthy lung is so soft, she wrote, it “has almost no substance”; touching it feels like “reaching into a bowl of whipped cream.” Covid changes that, filling the twin organs with a yellow goo that blocks the free flow of oxygen: “The lung texture changes, beginning to feel more like a marshmallow than whipped cream.” To be soft and permeable like a sponge is to be healthy. To be rigid and closed off, fortresslike, spells doom. This is true, it turns out, not just for our lungs but also for our very selves. When we breathe, we pull air into our windpipe, or trachea. That pipe than splits into our lungs’ two main airways, calledbronchi, which then branch off into smaller and smaller passageways, leading to tiny twig-like tubes calledbronchiolesthat culminate in clusters of microscopic sacs calledalveoli. In medical diagrams these passageways resemble the branches of an upside-down tree, as though every human being contains a piece of an inverted forest inside their chest. It’s a fitting image, because if it weren’t for trees, we wouldn’t be able to breathe. By photosynthesizing, plants generate carbohydrates and oxygen in equal measure, nourishing our bellies and filling our lungs. Without them we’d starve, but not before we choked on lethal levels of carbon dioxide. In this sense, the thousands of fires that raged across North America in 2020, burning more than eight million acres, charred the lungs of the earth. In those months, some communities gagged on smoke, others on pepper spray. On May 25, forty-six-year-old George Floyd was asphyxiated by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police offer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds with an expression of untouchable, detached superiority. Floyd’s alleged transgression was using a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. The assault was caught on video, and perhaps because the pandemic had slowed things down, people paid attention. Floyd’s murder galvanized the biggest protest movement in U. S. history, attracting up to twenty-six million participants by midsummer. Police and federal agents responded with unrelenting force, blinding over a dozen eyes with rubber bullets and burning thousands of people’s lungs with chemical weapons, including smoke grenades. In Portland, Oregon, residents used leaf blowers for self-defense, redirecting fumes away from innocent crowds and back toward the cops. Floyd’s last words echoed Eric Garner, who uttered a phrase that would become a common chant at Black Lives Matter protests as he was killed by police in New York City in 2014: “I can’t breathe.” In streets full of tear gas, demonstrators couldn’t breathe either. The right wing, predictably, responded to these developments with aggressive denial. Millions of people already devoted to conspiracy theories merely had to add a few new twists to preexisting narratives to bring them up to date. The coronavirus, like global warming, was a hoax, an elaborate ruse by an elite and evil cabal to control the populace—not a pandemic but a “plandemic.” Likewise, the fires in California and Washington were not connected to shifting weather patterns caused by greenhouse gas emissions, but the result of arson, violent acts committed by mythic anarchists and anti-fascists who were never found but who were certainly in cahoots with Black Lives Matter. From his White House perch, Donald Trump amplified falsehoods, uplifted racists, and sowed confusion and doubt. Research showed he was the single largest source of disinformation about Covid-19. While condemning millions to disease and destitution, Trump told his followers they were victims not of a vastly unequal society (helmed by a sociopathic plutocrat no less) but of public health protocols and marginalized groups seeking equal rights; he comforted those afflicted with delusions that a reassertion of white supremacy and a revolt against a spectral “deep state” could cure the crisis. A network of right-wing individuals and foundations funded and fomented discontent, emboldening armed vigilantes who gathered at state capitols demanding a return to business as usual. In Michigan, fourteen men, aggrieved by coronavirus restrictions, were arrested for plotting to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Court documents show they also discussed storming the legislature to “take hostages, execute tyrants, and have it televised.” Instead of being snapped back to their senses by a deadly illness, people retreated further into fantasy and fallacy, in which face masks were part of a far-reaching conspiracy to suffocate patriots and stifle freedom. According to my dictionary, a conspiracy is “a plotting of evil, unlawful design; a combination of persons for an evil purpose.” This is the definition that describes the most popular conspiracy theories of our day, which claim to ferret out a demonic sect pulling society’s strings, whether they are nefarious globalists, Jewish bankers, a Satanic pedophile ring, a “shadow government,” or some dastardly combination thereof. While such misapprehensions are as old as the nation itself—some historians point out that the United States was born of a conspiracy theory, as evidenced by the Declaration of Independence’s paranoid litany of Britain’s “abuses and usurpations,” including unleashing “merciless Indian savages” and “absolute despotism”—the Trump era was uniquely steeped in them. Trump’s rise to power began with the racist lie of birtherism (insisting that Barack Obama was not a true U. S. citizen) and ended in the authoritarian insistence that the election was rigged and stolen by “socialist” Democrats, with the help of some disloyal Republican officials (among them Attorney General William Barr). While people on the political left are not immune to it, this kind of conspiracism is more endemic among and useful to the right wing. If we go further back, however, we’ll find the wordconspiracyhas a different, more profound meaning that might help us comprehend our present predicament. It comes from the Latinconspirationem,“agreement, union, unanimity,” andconspirare,“to be in agreement; to ally”—or, literally, “to breathe together.” That is what the more powerful segment of society, the ruling class, have never wanted the rest of us to do—to come together as allies and, god forbid, form unions. Throughout U. S. history, the most influential and destructive conspiracies have emanated not from the fringes but from the country’s political and financial centers of power, and their goal has been preventing regular people from banding together to improve their lot. Polls reveal shockingly high levels of isolation and loneliness among the U. S. population, conditions that are known to make people more susceptible to the destructive, paranoid conspiracy theories that abet the right wing. We are all living amid the wreckage of a long, ongoing, and intentional sabotage of progressive collective action: a profit-driven health care system ill-prepared to cope with a pandemic, runaway climate change threatening the future, a bigoted and broken criminal justice system, a misinformation-addled (and conspiracy-promoting) corporate media sphere, and an economy in which the majority of people can barely keep their heads above water. Our inability to truly conspire is why so many people are struggling to breathe today.“The power to define what is and is not a conspiracy is a jealously guarded privilege,”Michael Mark Cohenwrites in his fascinating bookThe Conspiracy of Capital: Law, Violence, and American Popular Radicalism in the Age of Monopoly. In the early days of the United States, this battle would be fought overwhelmingly in the courts. The first labor conspiracy case in the United States was thePhiladelphia Cordwainerstrial of 1805 to 1806, and it remains one of the most significant trials in labor history to this day. “A group of journeyman shoemakers attempted to combine to demand higher pay and prevent the hiring of replacement workers,” Cohen explains, and in response they were charged with forming “a combination and conspiracy to raise wages.” Shoemaking was one of the city’s most profitable industries, and it was also the most contentious. A dispute over wages led to a seven-week strike and then a lawsuit, with eight journeymen indicted. A scab testified that the “workers were foreigners seeking to overthrow the laws of the United States” (the trope of the outside agitator was already in effect). The prosecution argued that the workers’ collusion threatened not only the shoemaking industry but also the entire city’s economy. While the workers got off with a small fine, the case set a disturbing precedent. Other courts interpreted the verdict as a ban on labor unions, which meant that organizing efforts were henceforth subject to suppression from both employers and the state. Between 1806 and 1842 there were more than twenty-one labor conspiracy trials involving “cordwainers, tailors, hatters, spinners, and carpet weavers,” Cohen reports. Strikers won six of them. But in each and every case, unions were deemed illegal “combinations” and “conspiracies” and forbidden. Speaking for countless others, Philadelphia labor leaderStephen Simpsonrailed against a double standard that tilted the playing field in favor of employers. “If mechanics combine to raise their wages, the laws punish them as conspirators against the good of society, and the dungeon awaits them as it does the robber,” he wrote in 1831. “But the laws have made it a just and meritorious act, that capitalists shall combine to strip the man of labour of his earnings, and reduce him to a dry crust, and a gourd of water.”Robert G. Ingersoll, a famed agnostic and social reformer, would later express the same sentiment in a pithier formulation: “If the rich meet to reduce wages, that’s a conference; if the poor resist the reduction, that’s a conspiracy.” The double standard would be etched into law: At the same times workers were under attack, the owning class was provided with a bevy of new rights. A corporation would be redefined as a “legal person” entitled to equal protection. Limited liability companies received state sanction and support while labor unions were deemed illegal. As the age of monopoly wore on, conspiracy charges ramped up. The common law doctrine of criminal conspiracy allowed the captains of industry to regulate working-class organization with incessant litigation, turning courtrooms into centers of class conflict. A vague and broad accusation, the conspiracy doctrine implied guilt by association and was used to suppress dissent, “to ban unions, outlaw strikes, pickets, and boycotts, to criminalize radical ideologies like anarchism and communism,” in Cohen’s words. The doctrine was considered “the darling of the prosecutor’s nursery” for its sweeping application and loose evidentiary rules, which meant it was perfect for suppressing dissent—anyone could be sucked into the ring of conspirators, even those who had never met before. “If there are still any citizens interested in protecting human liberty, let them study the conspiracy laws of the United States,” the famed radical lawyer Clarence Darrow, implored. “No one’s liberty is safe.”Born in 1857, Darrow defended countless workers and organizers from conspiracy charges over his career, inspired, in part, by the famous Haymarket trial, a miscarriage of justice that saw eight anarchists charged with conspiracy and seven sentenced to death for an explosion at a small rally (a pardon would be issued in time to save three of them). In an attempt to mount more successful defenses, Darrow dug into the conspiracy doctrine’s history to uncover its basis in English common law, only to discover that its original purpose had been turned on its head. First codified in 1305, the conspiracy doctrine began as a medieval English law designed to prevent malicious persecution. “It was an ancient law that a man who conspired to use the courts to destroy his fellow-men was guilty of treason to the state,” Darrow concluded. “He had laid his hand upon the State itself; he had touched the bulwark of human liberty.”The Age of Revolution flipped the script, shifting the doctrine’s purpose from the prevention and punishment of private abuse of the jury system to the subversion of efforts to build working-class solidarity. In 1721, English judges ruled inRex v. Journeymen Tailors of Cambridgethat workers’ efforts to strike to raise wages amounted to an unlawful and criminal conspiracy, setting the stage for the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800, which made trade unionism illegal in Britain, though laborers continued to put up fierce resistance. “The aristocracy were interested in repressing the Jacobin ‘conspiracies’ of the people,” Cohen explains, while “the manufacturers were interested in defeating their ‘conspiracies to increase wages.’” The Combination Acts did both. A cross section of elites gained power, and labor was forced into the shadows. As a result, the historian E. P. Thompson notes in his study of the English working class, organizing became more furtive, or “conspiratorial” in its modern-day sense. Workers could unite only in secret, ever watchful for employers, magistrates, parsons, and spies who might be their undoing. Workers fought back, but always from a defensive crouch. In the United States, laborers exploited on the job faced retaliation for demanding better treatment. They could be fired, wounded, or lynched, whether by hiredPinkertonguards or volunteer reactionary mobs. World War I inflamed ethno-nationalist tensions and put targets on the backs of radicals, with thousands arrested and often deported in the infamous Palmer Raids. The wartime Espionage Act strengthened the hand of the state, making it possible to prosecute labor partisans for words alone. The legendary organizer Eugene Debs was jailed for declaring that the only war in which he would enlist “was the war of the workers of the world against the exploiters of the world.” Voicing that sentiment landed him in prison for sedition, a charge held up by a unanimous Supreme Court decision. With hindsight, we regard theHaymarket affair, the first wave of the Red Scare, and the Palmer Raids as egregious abuses of state power. But rather than being aberrations, they epitomize a troubling current that has coursed through U. S. history since the colonial days, carried across the Atlantic via British common law all the way to the present day—a disastrous determination to squelch the efforts of working people to become organized. “The most dangerous conspiracy theories, especially rightwing conspiracy theories, do not exclusively populate the extremist margins of American politics and history,” Cohen observes. “Rather, the most dangerous conspiracy theories in American politics emerge from the very center of power, in which white supremacist, anticommunist, and anti-terrorist ideologies, each defined by shifting fears of subversive conspiracies, are promoted and enacted by presidents, business leaders, military men, judges, prosecutors, police, and vigilantes.” The most destructive purveyors of conspiracy theories are not average people who anxiously embrace half-truths. Rather, the real threat comes from those who hold official positions of influence and who actively trade in damaging lies to maintain dominance, fully aware that their continued authority depends on the disorientation, distraction, demoralization, and disarray of millions of others. If that sounds conspiratorial, it is. “I think a little conspiratorialism on the left is sometimes healthy. There actually is a cabal of ruling elites that seek to poison and imprison this world in the name of profits,” Cohen told me by email. “And those people have names, addresses and regularly meet to plot their crimes against humanity and nature. We have much to gain by naming and fighting them both individually and as a group.”In 1961, sociologist Daniel Bell speculated that there is “in the American temper, a feeling that ‘somewhere,’ ‘somebody’ is pulling all the complicated strings to which thisjumbled world dances.” The esteemed historian Richard Hofstadter echoed that sentiment, publishingThe Paranoid Style in American Politicsto great acclaim. Over the course of the Trump presidency, countless op-eds, journalistic exposés, academic articles, and books have articulated a similar concern, citing the explosion of conspiracy theories and the elevation of some of the most outlandish ones to the halls of power. The same election that evicted Trump from the White House secured victory for two congressional candidates who publicly supportedQAnon, a convoluted conspiracy devoted to interpreting message board missives from “Q,” a mysterious figure and supposed government insider with knowledge of Trump’s plan to vanquish the Devil-worshipping, child-molesting globalists who currently run the world and send them to Guantánamo Bay with the help ofJohn F. Kennedy Jr., who faked his own death in 1999 and has been in hiding ever since. At the end of 2020, NPR and Ipsos published the results of a poll assessing QAnon’s reach. Seventeen percent of respondents said it was “true” that “a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media,” and 37 percent more said they didn’t know. Without a doubt, it is alarming when millions of people reject basic reality, even the reality of something as banal as a celebrity’s death. Yet attempts to diagnose the problem’s source and identify possible cures too often fall short. The bookA Lot of People Are Saying,from 2019, epitomizes the genre. Authors Nancy Rosenblum and Russell Muirhead describe what they call the “new conspiracism,” or “conspiracy without theory.” In their schema, classic conspiracism’s evidentiary basis (picture dozens of JFK assassination aficionados poring over photographs of the grassy knoll) has been abandoned in favor of pure affect; hypotheses and suppositions gain purchase through repetition, not proof. Digital networks drown internet users in dubious information designed less to persuade than to overwhelm, as social networks circulate and recirculate sensational claims. Those who know how to game algorithms amass enormous followings, and those with the most “engaging” content always win, accuracy be damned. In 2020, millions of jobs evaporated overnight, but hucksters hit pay dirt. The clickbait economy launched the careers of an astonishing number of “conspiracy entrepreneurs,” a handful of whom, like Alex Jones, are national figures while the vast majority carve out a specialized niche, perhaps exposing “crisis actors” (the people who purportedly pretend to be victims of mass shootings as part of a larger plot to undermine the Second Amendment) or tracking “chem trails” (mind-controlling vapors allegedly released by planes). Rosenblum and Muirhead quoteStefanie MacWilliams, a twentysomething woman fromBelleville, Ontario, who gained notoriety for propagating the myth of “Pizzagate,” which held that prominent Democratic political operatives (includingHillary ClintonandJohn Podesta) ran a pedophile ring housed at a popular pizza parlor inWashington, D. C., calledComet Ping Pong, which inspired a man to travel from North Carolina, enter the premises, and fire a military assault rifle, demanding the release of imaginary sex slaves he believed were being held in a nonexistent basement. Despite the fact that someone could have been killed during the commotion, MacWilliams was unremorseful: “I really have no regrets and it’s honestly really grown our audience.”A Lot of People Are Sayingmaintains that while conspiracism has long pervaded U. S. politics, something significant has changed in recent years. “Today, conspiracism is not, as we might expect, the last resort of permanent political losers, but the first resort of winners,” the authors observe, in a reference to Donald Trump’s rule asconspiracist-in-chiefand the Republican Party’stendency to paint itself as a victim even as it wields political power. For all the authors’ supposed historical acuity, their insistence that conspiracy theories originating from the powerful is anewphenomenon only holds if you selectively interpret and idealize the past. A cursory glance at U. S. history, or a close read of Michael Mark Cohen, shows that the powerful have claimed to be victims since the founding of the nation. The lies peddled by Trump and theGrand Old Partyare just the latest iterations of the truth-destroying, state-building ideologies of yore. Today we use the term Red Scare to indicate an overreaction, but the mania lasted the better part of the twentieth century, peaking twice, first around World War I and then after World War II. During the second surge, theHouse Un-American Activities Committee, or HUAC,devoted incredible energy to pinpointing communist influence in government and industry, an influence that zealots detected inNew Dealsocial programs, strong labor protections and trade union militancy, and the civil rights movement, whichRepresentative John Rankinof Mississippi denounced as “communistic bunk.” Operating in a similar vein, SenatorJoseph McCarthylaunched a crusade in Congress, seeking out subversive elements in Washington and Hollywood. His efforts lost steam only when they were broadcast on national television and public opinion turned against his inquisition (an unforeseen reaction that sparked the first denunciations of the “liberal media”). But of course, the conspiracism didn’t stop with the end of the demented government hearings. Under the fervid anticommunist leadership of J. Edgar Hoover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation continued to spy on citizens, including via COINTELPRO, a counterintelligence program designed to surveil, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt left-wing groups. As one official memo put it, the aim was to “enhance the paranoia endemic in [dissident] circles” and convince activists that FBI agents lurked “behind every mailbox.” A letter sent by the program tried to pressureMartin Luther King Jr.to kill himself. The CIA abetted the cause withOperation CHAOS, initiated by PresidentLyndon Johnsonin 1967 and expanded by Richard Nixon, which “infiltrated antiwar groups, black power organizations, and even women’s consciousness raising sessions to determine if foreign communists were secretly directing them.”As Kathryn Olmsted documents in her illuminating bookReal Enemies,U. S. citizens are suspicious of their government for good reason. Government lies have cost livelihoods and lives. In 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with a plan to deceive Americans into supporting a war on Cuba by launching self-inflicted terror attacks on U. S. soil. While that idea was scuttled, U. S. policies of deception and secrecy were par for the course in Vietnam, Cambodia, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, and elsewhere. In its final tally, anticommunism is responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide. As these and many other abuses of power were revealed, the public became increasingly perturbed. After HUAC, McCarthyism, Watergate, COINTELPRO, and the Iran-Contra scandal, anything seemed possible, and many assumed more explosive secrets must lie in store. September 11, 2001, appeared to validate their gravest fears. TheGeorge W. Bushadministration made an unprecedented grab of executive authority to battle a nebulous enemy and cooked up a baseless story about weapons of mass destruction to deceive the public into war with Iraq. Brown University’s Watson Institute estimates that over five hundred thousand people have perished as a result of the war on terror, not counting casualties in Syria. As if deception and carnage weren’t bad enough, a movement of9/11 “Truthers”are convinced something even more diabolical transpired—the destruction of the World Trade Centertowers was an “inside job.” There was no limit, some believed, to what the government might do. Bush-era conspiracy theorists, Olmsted notes, were “more interested in making accusations and identifying the government as irredeemably evil than enacting reforms.” The same holds for millions of suspicious minds today.“The new conspiracism drains the sense that democratic government is legitimate without supplying any alternative standards,” Rosenblum and Muirhead write inA Lot of People Are Saying. They’re correct, but we have to understand the cause. For the last century, anticommunism run amok helped repress legitimate and necessary alternatives, leaving nihilistic reaction and unhinged conjecture to fill the void. Eight months into the pandemic, a television news station in Kalamazoo, Michigan, broadcast a telling exchange. The newscaster stood in a desolate suburban parking lot, reporting on the reaction to the state’s new Covid-19 restrictions. The owner of a nearby establishment, a weary-looking older man, walked up and told the host he had something to say. He was resisting the shutdown and wanted to say why.“My government leaders have abandoned me,” he said. “They’ve put me in a position where I have to fight back.” Four trillion dollars of stimulus money was given to special-interest groups and campaign donors, he continued, “enough money to give every family,every family in this country,$20,000 to go home for two months.” If he were given that sort of support, the man said, he gladly would have closed shop and let the virus settle down. “But I’m not going to do it alone.” When asked if he would continue to violate the state order, the man was defiant. “This isn’t a state order; this is a conspiracy, a tyranny … and I’ve got patriots coming out and supporting me.” The eighty-second clip encapsulated the ways government failures fuel conspiratorial thinking. On one level, the man was correct and his indignation justified. When the bailout funds were dispersed in the spring of 2020, a conspiracy of sorts was indeed afoot—bankers and corporate executives made a mad grab for public money with few strings attached, while regular people, who should have been paid to stay home, scraped by on crumbs. But he was wrong to imagine patriotism and a reckless disregard for public health as the solution to a problem caused by plutocracy. After all, the rich can share citizenship status with poor and working people and still dispossess them. Numerous studies show that insecure, vulnerable, and threatened populations are more susceptible to conspiracism. “Conspiratorial ideation” is driven by both ideology and instability. Feelings of powerlessness, research shows, predict such beliefs. InRepublic of Lies,Anna Merlan cites an analysis of letters by readers ofTheNew York TimesandChicago Tribunebetween 1890 and 2010 that found that conspiracy theories fluctuated in response to times of enormous social upheaval, with the first spike around 1900. Research also indicates that conspiracy beliefs are high particularly among members of stigmatized minority groups. But as Merlan rightly points out, these groups have well-founded grounds for mistrust, given the violent history of white supremacy in this country. Not every community’s sense of persecution is equally valid. In a perverse way, many prominent conspiracy theories are a cry for justice and connection, even if they frame the world in a Manichaean binary of good versus evil, shunning a structural analysis along with complexity and contingency—positing a cadre of cartoon villains who possess the incredible ability to mastermind world events, leaving nothing to chance. Nevertheless, such theories are typically populist in form, in that they purport to expose the destructive actions of a power elite against regular, unwitting people (a power elite sadly often imagined in ways shot through with anti-Semitism). QAnon’s slogan, “Where we go one, we go all,” often shortened to#WWG1WGA, evokes the Wobbly motto, “An injury to one is an injury to all,” by way of theThree Musketeers. It’s a mash-up of cultural references, stereotypes, thwarted expectations, and dashed idealism. No doubt, many conspiracists are irredeemable racists and authentic fascists, but there are undoubtedly some who would likely be receptive to other messages if they were as omnipresent and aggressively promoted. We’ll never know how many people would prefer the opportunity to have a face-to-face conversation with a community organizer instead of watching a talking head spout nonsense online, because they never get such a knock on the door and a chance to talk. Far from the country of civic associations described by Alexis de Tocqueville inDemocracy in America,the U. S. today is a land of anomie where, sociologists observe, a growing number of people suffer from an “epidemic of loneliness.”The spread of misinformation and fake news has inspired hand-wringing among liberals, who bemoan the public’s gullibility and lack of knowledge. I confess I’ve wrung my hands, too. But it’s not enough to denounce fake news or bewail the inability of regular readers to verify facts or “trust science” (a telling phrase since “trust” is unthinking, an act of faith rather than critical reflection—it means, in effect, know your place). Of course, some people could use a look in the mirror—many liberals spent the Trump years deeply invested in “Russiagate,” which played into dated, xenophobic Cold War clichés about “the Russians” and exaggerated foreign influence while failing to acknowledge homegrown threats to democracy. After all, it was theElectoral Collegethat handed Trump the presidency, notVladimir Putin. Worse still, liberals came to lionize the very institutions—the FBI and CIA—that have been the primary agents of countersubversive conspiracies, trampling liberties and destroying lives around the world. As Jonathan Swift quipped in 1721, “Reasoning will never make a Man correct an ill Opinion, which by Reasoning he never acquired.” Ideologies are always shaped by emotions and informed by lived experience. The man in Kalamazoo represents millions who are justifiably angry because they have indeed been abandoned, and who are desperately grasping for explanations that make sense of their circumstances. The challenge is reaching them before mendacious narratives do. But given the right wing’s long and effective assault on labor unions, quality free public education, and nonprofit media—the means and channels through which understanding generally spreads—that is increasingly difficult. The bipartisan project of undermining the left in this country has been, quite literally, a fool’s errand. By destroying the social solidarity, economic equality, and class conscious worldview that a robust, organized left helps provide, ruling elites have created a vacuum in which unhinged conspiracies propagate. Far from being a rational system as proponents claim, capitalism ineluctably tends toward the illogical and ludicrous. Plutocrats will embrace and promote paranoia as long it is profitable; manufactured lunacy provides useful cover, distracting the public from unpopular policies (tax cuts, attacks on unions, a decimated safety net), just as obsessively naming enemies (Democrats, the press, communists, socialists, antifa, anarchists, feminists, intellectuals, “woke” students, and so on) deflects responsibility and blame. In the memorable words of Stephen Bannon, conservatives counteract the allegedly liberal media by “flood[ing] the zone with shit.” The goal is not to manufacture consent but to promulgate confusion, and digital capitalism expands the arsenal used to assault our senses. (In 2020, videos endorsing false claims of widespread voter fraud were viewed on YouTube more than 138 million times during the week of the election alone; polls soon showed that one-third of Americans believed that voter fraud helped Joe Biden win.) “Those who persistently blame others for indulging in conspiracies have a strong tendency to engage in plots themselves,” Theodor Adorno smartly observed in 1952, and so it goes today. The world is a complicated place, and we are permeable, interconnected beings subject to infection by ideas and viruses. We are connected across time and space: our beliefs shaped by past events, our bodies impacted by what happens on the other side of the planet, our lungs filled with air exhaled in the next room. Autonomy is an impossibility. Faced with the prospect of this revelation, some recoil, taking solace in revanchist notions of separation, nationalism, and self-reliance laced with magical thinking. To have a chance of bringing people back to reality, or preventing them from losing touch in the first place, we will need to speak to their apprehensions and misgivings. Consider the growing suspicion of vaccines, which correlates with religious affiliation and higher socioeconomic status, making it one of the preferred conspiracy theories of the comparatively privileged. While anti-vaxxers are a serious threat to public health, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Bill Gates using vaccinations to microchip the masses is not one of them. (Bill Gatesblocking researchersfrom waiving intellectual property protections to make Covid vaccines available to people in poor countries is the real concern.) Or take speculation about the source of Covid-19. The fact is, viruses don’t care about the imaginary boundaries human beings construct, whether those are national borders or the species barrier. Like other zoonotic diseases, the coronavirus jumped from one creature (likely a bat or pangolin) to our kind. It did so because industrial patterns of land use and meat production—picture clear-cut forests, crowded factory farms, and so-called wet markets—push human and nonhuman animals into ever-more intimate contact. In other words, while Covid-19 was not concocted in a Chinese lab or caused by 5G wireless towers, it has political dimensions worth unraveling and discussing, particularly if we want to prevent the next deadly pandemic. An ancient habit of the human mind, conspiracism will never be entirely stamped out, but it can be diminished if we deprive it of the instability, inequality, and isolation on which it feeds. “We will not be a less paranoid country until we are a fairer one,” Merlan correctly observes. You can’t fact-check people out of a problem that requires collective action, mass empowerment, and clearheaded strategy to solve. Instead of chastisement, we need a credible vision of better society and a recognition that it will take mass movements to manifest it. That means building the one thing nostalgic right-wingers and neoliberal centrists both hate to see—an organized and mobilized multiracial working class fighting for their shared interests. It will take a conspiracy of epic proportions to counteract this country’s ruinous and unrelenting war on people’s ability to come together for the common good, but that’s the only way we’ll all ever be able to breathe.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0539718758352298,0.4448318825182178,8296,2,New Republic
396,Census misses create worries of Hispanic undercount,-6.33,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/census-misses-create-worries-of-hispanic-undercount/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,23,"Joseph Garcia spent months working to ensure that Hispanic residents of Arizona got counted in last year’s decennial census. After this week’s release of the first set of results, he worries the government still missed thousands of them. Arizona, along with Texas and Florida — other states with large Hispanic populations — fell short of expectations in Monday’s reveal of census data, resulting in smaller gains in congressional seats than projected, or none at all. Historically, the census has missed portions of Hispanic communities, shortchanging them on representation and in millions of dollars in federal programs, said Garcia, executive director of the advocacy group Chicanos por la Causa Action Fund.“I just don’t want everyone to focus on ‘Oh, we didn’t get another congressional seat’; the harm is much deeper than that,” Garcia said. “It’s compounding because it’s going to be year after year after year over the next decade of less funding for all these services, which are really needed by many people.”In addition to apportionment, census results are used to draw legislative maps and help guide more than $1.5 trillion in federal spending every year. However, it’s uncertain at this point how many people the census process may have missed. During Monday’s reveal of the results, Census Bureau officials cautioned the apportionment totals did not include any demographic information. Additionally, they pointed out the population for states such as Texas and Florida came within 1 percent of the projections it previously made. Multiple experts said it could be months before the public gets a better picture of the accuracy of the 2020 census. Detailed redistricting information that will include race and ethnicity data is slated for release over the summer. Even the Census Bureau itself doesn’t know at the moment — much of the accuracy assessment for the count is based on a post-count survey the agency will complete by next year. In 2010, the Census Bureau’s post-enumeration survey indicated the agency may have undercounted the Hispanic population by as much as 1.5 percent nationwide. Tom Wolf, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said assessing potential undercounts is “really a story that is going to be compiled over the next year.”However, he pointed out there are “all sorts of factors that would trend toward decreasing the quality and equity of the count” that could show up in later data releases. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki referred questions about a potential undercount of the Hispanic population to the Census Bureau during a news briefing Tuesday. She noted, though, the Biden administration reversed the Trump administration’s effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from apportionment data and gave the agency extra time to finish the census results. Redistricting expert Kim Brace said Monday’s population results revealed the potential for a significant undercount of the Hispanic population nationwide. It will take more data to know for sure, he said, but if there are undercounts, it will make it harder to draw fair congressional and legislative seats in the coming months.“My gut tells me” that Hispanics who “got turned off by the Trump administration’s actions and the citizenship issue probably did not participate in the census. That doesn’t bode well for redistricting,” Brace said. Arturo Vargas, CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Education Fund, found it “surprising” that states with large Hispanic communities fell short of projections.“Once more details are released, we will be able to better determine to what extent the Latino population was fairly and accurately counted,” Vargas said in a statement. Still, half of the 10 states with the highest Hispanic populations — California, Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey and New York — beat the Census Bureau’s earlier estimates of their population growth. All five had significant statewide efforts to boost census participation, including a campaign of more than $180 million funded by California, which still lost a congressional seat. Vargas’ statement noted those efforts may have made a difference in beating estimates, however. The other five states with large Hispanic communities — Texas, Nevada, Florida, Arizona and Colorado — all came in under Census Bureau projections. Arizona had the largest miss in the country, with its population count coming in more than 3 percent below the Census Bureau estimate. Vargas had previously criticized the Trump administration for its failed attempt to include a citizenship question on the census and for attempting to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment process. Before the actual head count started, his organization released multiple surveys that found more noncitizen and undocumented immigrant respondents saying they would not respond to the census than the general public. As many as three-quarters of respondents in those surveys expressed concerned about what the Trump administration would do with census responses. Those concerns also surfaced in multiple lawsuits over the Trump administration’s actions and amid congressional oversight efforts. Federal law prevents the disclosure of census responses, and Census Bureau advertisements and outreach materials included that fact. However, the pandemic complicated in-person outreach and efforts to convince people to respond on their own by mail or online, Garcia said. He and other advocates had to pivot plans to convince people to respond in person to census door-knockers trying to find residents who failed to respond on their own. That added to the difficulty of convincing people frightened by the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the process, Garcia said.“It was a perfect storm, and I think it should be pointed out that Donald Trump artificially seeded the clouds on that perfect storm,” Garcia said.",3,Reliable,0.1700862989824029,0.4269625756638743,1171,3,Roll Call
397,Biden Admin Embraces ‘Racial Equity’ Ideology in Slew of Executive Action Announcements,17.0,24.33,https://www.theepochtimes.com/biden-admin-embraces-racial-equity-ideology-in-slew-of-executive-action-announcements_3664911.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/epoch-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,25,"President Joe Biden signed an executive order that opens the door for instituting the quasi-Marxist critical race theory across the federal government. The order is to “launch a whole-of-government initiative to advance racial equity,” his transition team said in a Jan. 20 release. Biden “will sign an Executive Order beginning the work of embedding equity across federal policymaking and rooting out systemic racism and other barriers to opportunity from federal programs and institutions.”Equity means equality of outcome, a concept tied to the critical theories that slice up society into identity groups based on race, gender, sexual proclivities, and others, while positing which groups are oppressed and which are the oppressors, similarly to how Marxism labels people as oppressors or the oppressed based on class. While the order notes fair treatment of all, its specifics indicate some people will be more equal than others, based on whether their demographics fit the administration’s profile of “historically underserved and marginalized.”“Each agency must assess whether, and to what extent, its programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups,” the order says. The assessment will consider “access to benefits and services in federal programs,” “taking advantage of agency procurement and contracting opportunities,” as well as “whether new policies, regulations, or guidance documents may be necessary to advance equity in agency actions and programs.”The order tasks the Office of Management and Budget to find ways “to assist agencies in assessing equity with respect to race, ethnicity, religion, income, geography, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability” and “study strategies, consistent with applicable law, for allocating Federal resources in a manner that increases investment in underserved communities, as well as individuals from those communities.”The administration also seeks to improve access to government benefits and services, “for example, by reducing language access barriers” and having agencies “engage with communities who have been historically underrepresented, underserved, and harmed by federal policies,” the release said. Trump’s order cited the work of Christopher Rufo, director of the Discovery Institute’s Center on Wealth and Poverty, who has been waging a “one-man war” against critical race theory in U. S. government. Rufo has repeatedly warned of the intrusion of the ideology into civil society, after obtaining documents showing the theory being pushed in various institutions. In a Jan. 20 release, Rufo called the theory a “grave threat to the American way of life” that “traffics in the pernicious concepts of race essentialism, race stereotyping, and race-based segregation—all under a false pursuit of ‘social justice.’”The theories have produced an industry of consultants and speakers who are hired by corporations and government agencies to train their employees on themes such as “implicit bias” and “white privilege.”Trump’s order said the concepts of the theory are “divisive” and lead to “race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating.”Biden’s release said such training is “important and needed.” His order says that federal agencies shall consider reinstating any contracts that were canceled or restricted due to Trump’s order. Rufo says the training sessions “advance the ideology through cult-like indoctrination, intimidation, and harassment.”He announced the formation of a coalition of law firms and legal foundations called “Stop Critical Race Theory,” saying the group has already filed three lawsuits, with the goal of having the Supreme Court rule that programs based on the theory violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Constitution.“When we are victorious in the courts, it will have an immediate ripple effect through every school, government agency, and private employer in the nation,“ Rufo said. ”We will effectively abolish critical race theory programs from American life.”",1,Questionable,0.1013544536271809,0.4723599632690542,835,0,Epoch Times

Because that's how long it is until the 2022 midterm elections. And history suggests a good chance Democrats will lose their narrow control of Congress, most likely by losing the House. Then gridlock resumes. It's doubtful that Republicans will have much interest in helping Biden further become a ""transformational president"" by passing more wish-list items from the progressive agenda. Democrats surely understand the clock is ticking. But they also have to be hoping that the extraordinary power of the emerging economic boom might make the 2022 midterms an exception to the political pattern. Moody's Analytics, for example, recently revised its 2021 real GDP growth outlook to nearly 7 percent and to over 5 percent next year. ""If we are right,"" chief economist Mark Zandi told clients in a report, ""and there's good reason to believe we will be, this will be the strongest two years of growth since 1950-1951 at the height of the post-World War II economic boom."" And Moody's is hardly alone in predicting warp-speed GDP and job growth this year and next. So we're really off the map here. Who knows, not only might the Biden Boom keep the House and Senate in Democratic hands, it might also make a second Biden term (or a first Harris term, perhaps) a pretty good bet. And when you think about it, two presidential terms might be what Democrats need to pass key legislation and then make sure those programs survive during an era of extreme partisanship. Democrats are already trying to undo the Trump presidency wherever possible, such as attempting to partially reverse the Trump tax cuts, restore environmental rules, and rebuild America's trade relationship with Europe.

But the political impact of an unprecedented economic surge isn't the only unknown here. Putting aside the possibility of a dangerous new COVID-19 variant, perhaps the greatest risk to the recovery — and thus the Biden legacy — is how Washington is helping generate that recovery. The stimulus continues to flow even as consumers boost spending and businesses fully reopen. And some Democrats still don't think there's enough federal dough being spent, such as those who wantrecurringstimulus checks to be sent out and the $2.3 trillion Biden infrastructure plan to be a$10 trillion plan. As is, the tsunami of spending might yet boost inflation, resulting in surprise action from the Federal Reserve and an unexpected slowdown. Imagining pre-election recessions during the first terms of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama creates a pretty interesting game of ""what if"" alternate history with Presidents Mondale, Kerry, and Romney. An inflation surprise is hardly the only risk. While the recovery is currently generating gobs of jobs, the expansion will eventually slow. And it might slow faster than necessary thanks to generous jobless benefits that could potentially discourage work and create shortages. The $1.9 trillion COVID relief package last Marchextendedsupplemental benefits of $300 a month through early September. It’s an argument sure to gain momentum after Friday's wildly disappointing April jobs report that showed 266,000 net new jobs were created last month vs. a Wall Street forecast of a million or so. Now fat unemployment checks might not be the main reason for that undershoot. Home schooling, a lack of child care, virus fears, and data issues all might have played a role. But the report does suggest why some economists are worried about the labor-supply impact of impact of jobless benefits as the economy continues to gain strength in the coming months. A worker shortage would also add to the inflation threat. Again, many Democrats don't seem at all worried, at least so far. Late last month, nearly 40 Democrats on Capitol Hill sent the Biden White House a letter proposing ""more generous and long-lasting jobless benefits on a permanent basis,""accordingto the. Then there's the proposed tax increases, more than $3 trillion worth — including a record increase in capital gains tax rates. A nation's tax burden matters. How an economy is taxed matters. What is taxed matters. Tax rates matter. And although the economy didn't soar after the Trump tax cuts, the impact of the business tax cuts might have been offset by the Trump trade war. It is generally accepted, however, that tax rates affect how much and where a company invests. More investment makes workers more productive and will, over time, boost their wages. There's an economic risk that these proposed Biden tax increases will hurt investment. While many Wall Street banks have some pretty rosy economics forecasts, they are generally not incorporating any downside impact of the tax hikes. Those same firms are also, for the most part, assuming the economy returns to its modest pre-pandemic pace in 2023. So there could be less room for economic policy mistakes than it seems right now. And Democrats — pushing for more, more, more — should be worried a transformational presidency might just end up transitioning back to a Republican one.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1475633889919603,0.4787827252112968,1151,2,The Week
399,Why have no Republicans turned on Trump?,-22.5,27.5,https://www.salon.com/2019/12/04/why-have-no-republicans-turned-on-trump_partner/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-12-01,25,"There is a very simple reason why some Republicans voted for the impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon, but none have so far broken ranks against Trump. That reason is acorrupted U. S. Supreme Court. In 1976 () and 1978 (First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti),the Supreme Court ruled that when corporations and billionaires purchase their very own politicians, it is constitutionally protected “free speech” rather than “bribery,” which is how we defined it from the beginning of our republic until 1976. In 2010, the Supreme Court doubled down on its betrayal of American democracy with itsCitizens Uniteddecision. After those twin decisions in the 1970s, money from corporations and the morbidly rich began to flow into the coffers of the Republican Party, hoisting Ronald Reagan into the White House. (Democrats were then still largely funded by unions, and thus not so easily up for sale.)The spigots of cash never turned off; the 2016 election was a$6.5 billion affair. As a result, today’s Republican politicians are wholly owned agents of corporations and the billionaire class, stoking extreme anger over a few social issues (immigration, guns, God, gays, race) and using it to bring in the Fox rubes that the billionaire Murdochs kindly hand them. Prior to this betrayal of America by the Supreme Court, politicians generally felt a need to respond to the wants and needs of their constituents. From Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s people-powered election in 1932 to Reagan’s inauguration in1981, politicians’ proposed legislation and votes tended to reflect what the people in their districts or states wanted. Nixon’s impeachment hearings happened in 1974,the Supreme Court legalized bribery—and so the Senatevoted 77-0to forward the investigation, and the Housevoted 412-3to accept the Judiciary Committee’s report showing “clear and convincing evidence” of Nixon’s corruption. Republicans were more concerned about their voters than about their donors back then. From the 1980s to today, though, as astudyby Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page shows, the politicaldesires of the economic bottom 90 percent of Americans are completely irrelevantto the introduction or passage of legislation. But the desires of the top 10 percent of Americans are consistently passed into law and policy. Republicans don’t want the money to stop, so they have to keep supporting Trump as he pushes the corporate- and billionaire-friendly policies of deregulation and tax cuts supported by their donors. When the billionaires abandon Trump, so will the GOP. It’s really just that simple. As long as the Supreme Court continues to assert that there is absolutely nothing wrong with billionaires and corporations owning politicians, the GOP will continue to be an extension of the lobbying industry and the morbidly rich. In exchange for deregulation and tax cuts, that bunch would work to keep a gerbil in the White House, if that’s what it took. And as long as their owners and funders continue to pay Republicans to keep Trump in office, they’ll continue to say, “How high?” every time Trump yells, “Jump!”",1,Questionable,0.1187281237281237,0.4383475783475782,669,2,Salon
400,“Overdue”: Biden sets Aug. 31 for US exit from Afghanistan,0.0,46.0,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/08/overdue-biden-sets-aug-31-for-us-exit-from-afghanistan/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,25,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Thursday the U. S. military operation in Afghanistan will end on Aug. 31, delivering an impassioned argument for exiting the nearly 20-year war without sacrificing more American lives even as he bluntly acknowledged there will be no “mission accomplished” moment to celebrate. Biden pushed back against the notion the U. S. mission has failed but also noted that it remains unlikely the government would control all of Afghanistan after the U. S. leaves. He urged the Afghan government and Taliban, which he said remains as formidable as it did before the start of the war, to come to a peace agreement.“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Biden said in a speech from the White House’s East Room. “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.”The administration in recent days has sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it’s an “unwinnable war” and one that “does not have a military solution.” On Thursday he amplified the justification of his decision even as the Taliban make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country.“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?” Biden said to those calling for the U. S. to extend the military operation. He added, “I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.”The new withdrawal date comes after former President Donald Trump’s administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the U. S. military mission by May 1. Biden after taking office announced U. S. troops would be out by by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden plotted from Afghanistan, where he had been given refuge by the Taliban. With U. S. and NATO ally forces rapidly drawing down in the past week, there was growing speculation that U. S. combat operations have already effectively ended. But by setting Aug. 31 as the drawdown date, the administration nodded to the reality that the long war is in its final phase, while providing itself some cushion to deal with outstanding matters. The administration has yet to complete talks with Turkey on an arrangement for maintaining security at the Kabul airport and is still ironing out details for the potential evacuation of thousands of Afghans who assisted the U. S. military operation. Biden said that prolonging U. S. military involvement, considering Trump had already agreed to withdraw U. S. troops, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops and NATO allies.“The Taliban would have again begun to target our forces,” Biden said. “The status quo was not an option. Staying meant U. S. troops taking casualties. American men and women. Back in the middle of a civil war. And we would run the risk of having to send more troops back in Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.”The president added that there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the U. S. war comes to an end.“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” he said. U. S. forces killed bin Laden in 2011. U. S. forces this week vacated Bagram Airfield — the U. S. epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks that triggered the war. Remaining U. S. troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagon said the top U. S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced U. S. military mission. Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday, said that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. The president also pushed back against the notion that such a scenario was certain.“Do I trust the Taliban? No,” Biden said. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”To be certain, the West hopes Taliban gains will be confined mostly to rural areas, with the Afghan government and its allies retaining control of the cities where much of Afghanistan’s population resides. And while the Taliban remain a major power in Afghanistan, the government’s supporters hope that Afghans will work out the Taliban role in the post-U. S. Afghanistan power structure more through political than military means, partly through the inducements of international legitimacy, aid and other support. Asked by a reporter whether rampant corruption within the Afghan government contributed to the failure of achieving the sort of stability that his predecessors and American military commanders envisioned, Biden didn’t exactly dismiss the notion. “The mission hasn’t failed — yet.”Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the U. S. military as translators, drivers and in other jobs. Many are fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the U. S. withdrawal is complete. The White House says the administration has identified U. S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentially stay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been granted special immigrant visas since he took office in January. Still, the president faced Republican criticism following his speech.“The Taliban is gaining more ground by the day, and there are targets on the backs of our people and our partners,” said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there are sufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partners safe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.”John Kirby, chief Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that the U. S. military is considering several overseas bases around the world as possible temporary locations for those Afghans awaiting a visa. So far, he said, the numbers of those who have decided to leave Afghanistan are not so high that they can’t be handled with a range of installations.“Our message to those women and men is clear,” Biden said. “There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose. We will stand with you, just as you stood with us.”Biden noted that as a senator he was skeptical about how much the U. S. could accomplish in Afghanistan and had advocated for a more narrowly tailored mission. He was somewhat opaque in answering whether the cost of the war was worth it, but argued that the U. S. objectives were completed long ago.“We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time,” Biden said. “The second reason was to eliminate al-Qaida’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives. Period.“That’s why I believe this is the right decision and quite frankly overdue.”—Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City and Lolita C.

The move is a rare turn in the tech industry, which has historically been resistant to formal labor organizing. But the announcement underscores a growing tide of activism in tech, where rank-and-file workers in recent years have spoken out on issues ranging from border surveillance to climate change. The Alphabet union is supported by the Communications Workers of America, and is open to full-time and contract employees. The group will have dues-paying members, an elected board of directors and paid organizing staff, according to a release. But the unionreportedly isn't seeking federal ratificationthrough the National Labor Relations Board, which means it won't have collective bargaining rights.""We are the workers who built Alphabet. We write code, clean offices, serve food, drive buses, test self-driving cars and do everything needed to keep this behemoth running,"" Parul Koul and Chewy Shaw, engineers at Google and chairs of the new Alphabet Workers Union, wrote in anop-ed in The New York Timespublished Monday. ""We want Alphabet to be a company where workers have a meaningful say in decisions that affect us and the societies we live in.""For years, Google has been the poster child for activism in tech. In 2018, more than 20,000Googlers walked out of their officesaround the globe to protest the handling of sexual misconduct allegations against senior executives. Workers at the company have also pushed back against Google's contracts with the US military and the company's work in China. In response to the announcement, Google on Monday said it has aimed to foster a supportive workplace for employees. ""We've always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce,"" Kara Silverstein, director of people operations at Google, said in a statement. ""Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we've always done, we'll continue engaging directly with all our employees.""But as efforts to organize grew within the company, Google has tried to rein in its more than 120,000 employees. In 2019, the company revised its internal guidelines to discourage political debates. In the same year, the company also hired IRI Consultants, a firm with a history of anti-union efforts, a move that riled activists at Google. In their op-ed on Monday, Koul and Shaw raised worker concerns over the search giant's cooperation with ""repressive governments around the world,"" profits from ""ads by a hate group,"" and failure to addressretention issues with people of color. Over the last few weeks, new labor issues have also cropped up at Google. Last month, the NLRB filed a complaint against Google for allegedly retaliating against workers who spoke out against the company. The complaint claims Google broke US labor laws by surveilling, interrogating and firing activist employees. The filing stemmed from terminations Google had made a year before, when the company dismissed employees who worked on responses to its hiring of IRI. Google has also been roiled by the departure of Timnit Gebru, a star artificial intelligence researcher who said she wasabruptly firedlast month over a research paper she co-authored that criticized the company's AI systems. Her exit sparked widespread outrage among Google employees and throughout the tech industry. The announcement of the union on Monday drew praise from some progressive Democrats. ""When giant corporations like Google have too much power, it's bad for innovation, bad for consumers — and bad for their workers,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from Massachusetts,wrote in a tweet. ""I'm standing in solidarity with Google workers as they fight back by unionizing.""Sen. Bernie Sanders, from Vermont, also applauded the union. ""What these workers are fighting for is not radical,"" hetweeted. ""They want fair wages and a workplace free from abuse, retaliation, intimidation and discrimination. And that is exactly what they deserve.""This isn't the first time Google has faced pressure from unions. In 2019,a small group of contractors in Pittsburghunionized with the support of the United Steelworkers Union. Also that year, a group of YouTube creators said theyjoined forces with IG Metall, a German metal workers union, to demand more transparency from the Google-owned video platform. At the time, YouTube said it would meet with the group but that itwouldn't negotiateon the union's demands.

Ashcroft, in an interview with the Post-Dispatch, said, “It’s ridiculous to say that I want people to die.”Asked if he regretted suggesting fathers risk death in order to send their children to in-person classes, Ashcroft rejected the premise of the question.“I didn’t suggest any other father do that,” Ashcroft said. “No I didn’t. I said I would risk that. And I didn’t know a father that wouldn’t. But I didn’t tell anybody else what to do. I just said we need to get schools going.”“I don’t think it’s fair to say that school automatically means death,” he said. “Now you may have to do school differently, and I think you should take precautions.“I want every parent to have the option to send their kid to school if they want,” Ashcroft said. “I’m not telling parents what they have to do with their children. I think they ought to have that option.”The criticism marked the second time in recent weeks that a Republican statewide elected official has had to defend comments on kids returning to school. Gov. Mike Parson drew national attention last month whenhe said kids going back to school would catch the virus, but that they’ll “get over it.”“These kids have got to get back to school,” Parson told a radio interviewer last month. “They’re at the lowest risk possible. And if they do get COVID-19, which they will — and they will when they go to school — they’re not going to the hospitals. They’re not going to have to sit in doctor’s offices. They’re going to go home, and they’re going to get over it.”Parson later said, in another radio interview, “I didn’t do a good job of explaining the point I was trying to make.”Ashcroft, asked if he could have done a better job making his point in the radio interview, said: “If someone had been asking me questions like you … yes, I probably would’ve explained it in more detail. But I was just saying — I want schools, I want our kids to get educated.”He then said that he could filter everything he says so that political opponents don’t “misconstrue” his statements. But, he said, “I hate that sort of politician that’s always sort of mealy mouthed and doesn’t want to say stuff.”Sign up now to get the most recent coronavirus headlines and other important local and national news sent to your email inbox daily.

405,Whatever Happened to the Populist Left?,12.33,34.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/whatever-happened-to-the-populist-left/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"Against the surreal backdrop of sometimes violent nationwide protests, one alarming story as reported byseems to have slipped under the radar. Law enforcement arrested a 21-year-old Idaho man on suspicion of firing a semi-automatic rifle at the White House. Several days prior to the arrest, the Secret Service had responded to reports of shots fired near the National Mall and pursued a vehicle departing the area on Constitution Avenue. They found the vehicle abandoned with an AK-47 and spent casings inside, and soon afterward extracted several bullets that had struck the White House. The suspect’s relatives told investigators he appeared to have a “fixation” on the White House and the president. Thisreally did happen, but it wasn’t during the chaotic “Stop the Steal” rally earlier this month, or even any of the fiery demonstrations across the country last summer. It was on Wednesday, November 16, 2011, during the Occupy Wall Street protests. As the media and the incoming Biden administration froth at the mouth over Trump’s failed “insurrection,” it is fashionable for conservatives to point out the obvious double standard the media employs when comparing the events of last week and the BLM and Antifa riots of the past year, the latter of which were many orders more violent and destructive. Axiosreportsthat the insurance claims for the riots could approach $2 billion, and that an estimated 30 people, many of whom were African Americans, have lost their lives. Yet what’s also interesting—and alarming—is the fate of the progressive-powered Occupy Wall Street movement and the left-leaning populist movement it helped ignite. If the bailouts of 2008 were their spark, where are they now amid the pandemic, whencorporateprofits have soared and middle-to-low-income workers have been crushed?The answer is that they themselves have been occupied—transformed, rebranded, and redirected by corporations and the media. As Vladimir Lenin once said, “The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.”The government’s response to the financial crisis of 2008 was unique in that it drew the condemnation of both the left and the right. Take, for example, the response it evoked from President Reagan’s first budget director, David Stockman: “A decisive tipping point in the evolution of American capitalism and democracy—the triumph of crony capitalism—took place on October 3, 2008.” On that day, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was passed to bail out Wall Street. Stockman’s book,, is a 768-page moral outrage manifesto, accusing the state and its central bank of becoming disciples of misguided “Keynesianism, monetarism, and supply-side-ism.”Despite promises of change, President Obama disappointed many of his optimistic voters. Asreportedbyin December 2011, Obama had secured more funding from the financial elite than all other GOP candidates combined. Simmering resentment and the let-down of the Obama presidency led to the birth of Occupy Wall Street, which launched in September 2011 and called for increases to the minimum wage, protections for the environment, and student debt relief. Their slogan was “We are the 99%” and their enemy was the other 1 percent: the corporate elites. The message from Occupy Wall Street was generally devoid of any mention of race, creed, or ancestry. It was Marxist in tone to be sure: the haves versus the have-nots, the oppressors versus the oppressed, the 99 percent versus the 1 percent. Yet while their solutions might have been wrong and unrealistic, their prognosis wasn’t exactly inaccurate. Wealth inequality had skyrocketed. The nefarious actions of Wall Street firms should have been punished, not rewarded. The bailout of AIG had dwarfed all combined expenditures of the food stamp program since its inception in the 1960s. Faced with seething anger, the corporate media soon went to bat to reprogram their attackers. Thanks to the meticulous research of political scientist Zach Goldberg, we know that the actions of the press following the Occupy movement didn’t fit a coherent, organized pattern. In an article formagazine in August 2020, Goldbergpresentsa graph that clearly shows that the media’s use of racial terms in its opinion and reporting skyrocketed around 2012. Goldberg points out that “wokeness”—what he defines as “sensibilities of highly educated and hyperliberal white professionals with elements of Black nationalism and academic critical race theory”—was present in our political discourse well before the BLM- and Antifa-led riots of the past year. As noted in his graphs, from 2011 to 2018, the use of the words “racist/racists/racism” increased inandThe Washington Postby about 700 percent and 1,000 percent, respectively. His conclusion is that the media was crafting a narrative that explained disparities in our society not due to talent or work ethic, or even the crony capitalists of Wall Street and the 1 percent, but bias—specifically racial bias. But was this reporting effective at reprogramming the left? Goldberg seems to think so: “Specifically, I find that the causal effects of race-related media coverage are strongest for white Democrats and liberals, weaker for nonwhite Democrats and liberals, and are largely nonexistent for white Republicans and conservatives.”Whether it is left-leaning or right-leaning, populism is the enemy of the current American regime. By enlisting left-leaning populists in the fight against “white supremacy,” that regime has managed to stave off a two-front war—and, in fact, to pit one of its enemies against the other. Corporate powers simply absorbed the left-leaning populist movement, pretending to lead it while launching an attack on right-wing populists in conjunction with the press and its government allies. The election of Donald Trump clearly shook the American regime to its core. Populism, left- or right-leaning, never bodes well for the elites, but during the Trump era, left- and right-leaning populists started sounding dangerously alike. The looming convergence posed the threat of a substantial, effective, anti-elite political movement. How the media crafted a corporate-friendly narrative to diffuse and then redirect this anger is quite remarkable. The metamorphosis of Bernie Sanders in 2016 to his candidacy in 2020 serves as an instructive case study. In 2015, Sandersattacked open bordersas a Koch brothers proposal, essentially tying corporate interests in lowering wages and maximizing profit to increased illegal immigration. Sanders’ populist message was devoid of race or religion, focusing only on class. Yet using their control of the moral narrative in the political space, the media and corporations reframed the fight for justice as one centered on race and oppression instead of populism and cronyism. The whole left, including its populist wing and the Bernie camp, was subsumed into the race narrative. It was no longer about economic oppression or injustice; it was aboutoppression and injustice. The problem we faced was not rule by the elites but the enduring reign of white supremacy. What the average person doesn’t understand is that when the modern, post-1619 Project left refers to “white supremacy,” they don’t mean David Duke or Nathan Bedford Forrest. They mean the Founding Fathers and the nation that was born following the Revolution. Just as the sin of Adam was passed down to all of mankind, so too were the sins of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson passed down to all white Americans. Ironic, isn’t it, that those same left-leaning protesters who a few years ago were calling for the prosecution and incarceration of bankers wereyear calling for (and attempting) the removal of a statue of President Andrew Jackson? Called the first populist president by many historians, Jackson actually fought the bankers, whom he called a “brood of vipers.” It was his stubborn resolve against Treasury Secretary Nicolas Biddle that ended the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, ensuring the absence of a central bank until the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1914. But Jackson’s sins against the Native Americans deny him any place in a new narrative focused on race. One of the great heroes of American populism becomes not just forgotten but demonized. Jackson gets a reckoning, and the bankers he condemned get off scot-free. Talk about misdirecting your enemies’ firepower.is a former Marine officer.

Kendi and Robin DiAngelo, two brazen race hustlers posing as “trainers,” to jam their radical racial separatist agenda down the throats of the city’s public school teachers. As reported by Christopher Rufo in“The training begins with a ‘land acknowledgement,’ in which the teachers are asked to accept that they are colonizers living on stolen Native American land. Then they are told they will experience ‘guilt, anger, apathy, [and] closed-mindedness’ because of their ‘white fragility.’”It gets worse. Much worse. A whistleblower secretly took notes and recorded screenshots of another teacher training session in San Diego. This one was held by Bettina Love, a race-obsessed college professor, who claims that American schools are guilty of the “spirit murdering of Black children.” She also insists that “Whiteness reproduces poverty, failing schools, high unemployment, school closings, and trauma for people of color,” and stealing a page from George Orwell’s, that white educators must undergo “antiracist therapy.” As if the above were not despicable enough, because too many black students are failing in San Diego schools, the district will no longer letlate work or bad behavioraffect a child’s grade. Seattle is no better. At a recent training in the Emerald City, lowly Caucasians were told that they possess “lizard-brains,” which makes them “afraid that [they] will have to talk about sensitive issues such as race, racism, classism, sexism, or any kind of ‘ism.’” The trainers also instructed educators that they should work toward the “abolition of whiteness.” Lest you think this conference was a one-off, a visit to theSeattle Public Schools websitewill disabuse you of that notion. Like Covid, the indoctrination pandemic is not location-specific. In New Jersey,S2781, a bill which passed 26-13 in the state senate, ensures that students will “examine the impact that unconscious bias and economic disparities have at both an individual level and on society as a whole.”In Minnesota, St. Paul public schools are on their way to making an “ethnic studies” class mandatory for graduation. But at the same time, as reported by the Center of the American Experiment, a draft of the new state social studies standards shows the standards arevery light on World War I, World War II, the Holocaust, the American Revolution, the Civil War, etc. In California, the latestEthnic Studies Model Curriculumdraft, which will make taking an ethnic studies class a requirement to graduate high school, has been released for public comment. Though not as vile as earlier versions, there is still plenty here to be concerned about. Critical race theory, which maintains that racism is pervasive and permanent, and divides students into “oppressor” and “oppressed” factions, is omnipresent. The question becomes, what can be done to stop the careening indoctrination train?In California, parents and the general public can weigh in andtell the California State Board of Educationby January 21 to oppose using critical race theory in Golden State schools. Also, the Family Policy Alliance has released a new book available for free online, “Back to School—for Parents,” which takes a “journey through each part of the school system where student andparental rights violations are trending,” and explains how to fight back against the radical agenda that is running rampant in our schools. And on a most interesting note, a Nevada mother has filed a lawsuit against her son’s charter school for refusing to let him opt out of a mandatory class that “promotes hostility toward whites as a race.” In the federal lawsuit, Gabrielle Clark claims that the school’s teachers and administrators coerced her son William “to accept and affirm politicized and discriminatory principles and statements that he cannot in good conscience affirm.” The litigation also alleges several constitutional violations including compelled speech, viewpoint discrimination, retaliation, etc. It’s worth noting that the student, who has a black mother and a (deceased) white father, is very light-skinned. His “whiteness” and refusal to lick the indoctrinator’s boots earned him a D-minus in the class, and he was subsequently suspended for committing “racism” according to the lawsuit. Ironically, the mother only learned about the indoctrination attempt by attending a distance learning class with her son. Too much of our education system has turned into-style brainwashing, and will continue unabated until parents—the schools’ customers—stand up and learn their rights, run for school board, litigate, and best of all, homeschool if possible.

Surging violence in Minnesota comes in response to the death of George Floyd, 46, who was suffocated to death by the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin on Monday amid pleas for oxygen and a warning that “I can’t breathe!”Chauvin and the other officers involved were fired shortly after chilling video of Floyd’s death reached the internet but calls for prosecution of Chauvin soon followed. The officers on the scene that day initially claimed that Floyd resisted arrest, but security footage of the incident indicated otherwise. Even amid pandemic lockdowns and a rapidly approaching presidential election, the violent and senseless killing of George Floyd, a man arrested for a petty crime, is the primary focus of the nation. And it should be. Every American should be outraged by the death of a person who dies at the hands of those sworn to ""protect and serve"" while begging for their life. But the destruction of property and violence that have followed the death of Floyd have only further driven a wedge between law enforcement and those outraged by a shocking death. A demand for justice for Floyd should unify the nation, not divide it so deeply that it may never be fixed. Widespread distrust of police and gaping fractures between American communities are only solidified by scenes of gutted department stores and burning police stations. There is nothing peaceful about arson and looting. Riots are doing nothing to perpetuate any type of conversation about what can be done to avoid future tragedies. There is no room for discourse when a city is reduced to ash and crime takes hold of the streets. There is no freedom on any street in America when families must barricade their doors and pray they aren't invaded by raging criminals leaning on a tragic death as an excuse to lay waste to an entire city. Riots and looting are violence and crime. In order to prevent further tragedy, law enforcement must keep the peace or anarchy will take hold. The president of the United States agrees with this and offered the support of the National Guard, saying the violent epidemic in Minneapolis was being committed not by peaceful protesters, but by thugs. Indeed, it is thugs who belittle the sorrow of a nation and cries for justice by committing felonies and putting more lives at risk. Only thugs would break the windows of a Target and steal with abandon just because they could. It is thugs who burn small businesses to the ground and do all of it in the name of ""protest.""Through the carnage, however, it was Trump's use of that word, ""thugs,"" that drove the story this morning thanks to Twitter's choice to place a content warning on his post. Though the president's message to America was a vow to help the ailing city, it was his use of the phrase, ""when the shooting starts, the looting starts,"" that caused Twitter to say the president was glorifying violence. In reality,President Obama freely used the word""thugs"" just five years ago during the Baltimore riots. Obama was very concerned about increasing violence in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and condemned ""criminals and thugs who tore up the place,"" just as Trump has done. And looting most certainly begets more violence, as Trump pointed out. The unrest in Minneapolis andother citieshas caused several troubling incidents of gun violence by civilians. Justice must be served, but violence, blame shifting, and political posturing are not the answer. This strife will only pour iron into a deep national fracture and prevent it from ever healing. The standoff between Americans, the police, and each other must come to an end as we strive for health, prosperity, equality, and justice for George Floyd.

There was Sean Spicer, who got off to a mess of a start on Day One, lying about the attendance at the inauguration. (Kellyanne Conway said he was using “alternative facts.”) Spicer came out of the gate so angry that he was turned into a “Saturday Night Live” skit featuring Melissa McCarthy on a podium that ran into people. Then there was Sarah Sanders, another confrontational press secretary who started having fewer and fewer press briefings. Then came Stephanie Grisham, who didn’t even bother to have one official White House briefing in her eight months on the job. Then came Kayleigh McEnany, perhaps the most incompetent White House press secretary ever. She spent more time wagging a finger at the media than doing her job, which was to answer questions about the president’s work, policies and decisions. So when Jen Psaki held her first press conference as Joe Biden’s White House press secretary on Wednesday, it felt like,as CNN’s Brian Stelter perfectly put it, a “return to normalcy.”Trump’s White House claimed he was making “many calls” and having “many meetings.” The Biden team is actually revealing who Biden’s calls and meetings are with. A return to normalcy…pic.twitter.com/Uqkb2x53XU— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter)January 21, 2021But let’s all be careful,writes Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan. Sullivan wrote, “The national press — battered by four years of abuse by the president, and by the incompetence and falsehoods of his spokespeople — is in a precarious position. We run the risk of being seduced by an administration that, in many cases, closely reflects our values: multiculturalism, a belief in the principles of liberal democracy, and a kind of wonky idealism. (Cue the ‘West Wing’ theme.)”But, Sullivan writes, there could be a return to another kind of normal: that journalists, in an effort to show toughness and objectivity, will become more confrontational. The job of the media, of course, is to hold the powerful accountable — especially the highest office in the land.“But,” Sullivan writes, “there’s a difference between truly holding power to account and grandstanding.”The press, according to Sullivan, needs to resist false equivalency. They need to call out lies. They need to use plain language, such as racism and white supremacy, instead of euphemisms. And they need to resist returning to the old journalistic norms. If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It's not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up.

411,The Equality Act.,-3.67,43.67,https://www.readtangle.com/p/equality-act-congress-joe-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-25,16,"It's a divisive piece of legislation. We’re covering The Equality Act. This is a really complex issue, and so we’ve skipped today’s reader question to give it extra space. Still, we’re just scratching the surface. We’ve also got some very interesting numbers about political priorities and a few quick hits you’ll need to keep an eye on. The Equality Act. This week, the House of Representatives is set to vote on the Equality Act, a bill that would make it illegal to discriminate against people based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. You probably remember last year when the Supreme Court ruled on, declaring that the protections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act also apply to lesbian, gay and transgender Americans (we covered that in Tanglehere). The court ruled that treating a man and a woman who are both in a relationship with a man differently for the same behavior amounts to sexual discrimination, which is protected under the Civil Rights Act. The Equality Act is Congress’s attempt to enshrine that ruling into law, and then expand the areas where it applies. Instead of tying the issue to sex, the Equality Act would apply those protections explicitly to matters of gender identity and sexual orientation. It would also expand them to cover “public accommodations,” which include things like retail stores or private establishments. This is notable, as the Civil Rights Act covers discrimination in employment and housing, but doesn’t expand into public accommodations (which this bill expands upon to include online retailers and transportation providers, meaning it also broadens what the Civil Rights Act would cover). Finally, the Equality Act includes language that will supersede the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). The RFRA is a 1993 law that sets a very high bar for the government to defend laws if people argue those laws infringe upon religious freedom. President Biden promised to sign a version of the bill into law in his first 100 days in Congress, saying “Every person should be treated with dignity and respect, and this bill represents a critical step toward ensuring that America lives up to our foundational values of equality and freedom for all.” Still, it faces a tough path to approval in the Senate. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) was the lone Republican to sponsor the bill, butbacked off her supportwhen she said revisions she wanted were not made. 10 Republican votes would be needed for the bill to become law. Today, we’ll take a look at how support and opposition are lining up for and against the bill. The left is supportive of the legislation, arguing that it’s long past time to have explicit protections for these groups. The Washington Post editorial board said“it remains legal to discriminate against LGBTQ people in a large number of states in an astonishing variety of circumstances.“Though many states have anti-discrimination laws, some lack comprehensive policies, and some offer few protections at all… it is legal in 27 states to deny people housing based on their LGBTQ status, while 31 states fail to bar discrimination in education and 41 allow discrimination in jury service.“Passing such an act would not only prevent LGBTQ people from being denied essential services based on prejudice; it would also send a message to the rest of the world. Much of the planet remains a dangerous place for LGBTQ people, who face official retribution if they dare to be themselves in public. It has taken time for U. S. democracy to grow into the notion that discrimination based on innate characteristics is particularly abhorrent.”Ryan Thoreson wrote that America“still needs the Equality Act.”“While courts and federal agencies increasingly endorse inclusive interpretations of sex discrimination, these are no substitute for an explicit nondiscrimination law protecting LGBT people.“Moreover, even inclusive interpretations of sex discrimination provisions leave LGBT people without protection in some circumstances. Existing civil rights laws regarding public accommodations only prohibit discrimination on the grounds ofrace, color, religion or national origin — not sex. Without the Equality Act, LGBT people have little recourse even when they experience blatant discrimination in a business that is open to the public.“In 2021, that leaves LGBT Americans with a patchwork of protections that can be unclear and unreliable — and that leave people vulnerable to humiliation and rejection. While recent advances are important, judicial interpretations and agency rulemaking cannot substitute for clear, comprehensive and durable protections under federal law.”In the University Star, Delilah Alvarado arguedthat in sports, trans athletes are not the problem; they are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. Alvarado noted that some biological women with high testosterone levels are now forced to suppress those levels to compete, while some trans boys who want to compete with boys are forced to compete with girls.“Women are the constant target, whether they are getting the beating or whether they have to prove they do not have an advantage,” Alvarado wrote. “Cisgendered women have faced a lot of scrutiny for just seeming more masculine than average. But if an apparent trans male wants to compete with men, it is not always allowed.“Hormone tests need to be less invasive to cisgendered women, but able enough to prove that a trans women [sic] can compete on the same level,” she added. “Trans women and men must be able to show they can compete in the division they want, but they should be provided with concise rules to follow. Athletic organizations need to reevaluate the rules for competition and find a balance on inclusivity. Remaining unclear with their guidelines has led to discrimination toward women in the sport and that is unacceptable.”The right is generally opposed to the bill over concerns about the threat to religious freedom and the impact the bill would have on women’s spaces. In Newsweek, Mary Rice Hasson argued that the Equality Act“makes no mention of what sex actually is: the unchangeable reality that a person is either ‘male’ or ‘female’ (intersex conditions are disorders of sexual development, not a different sex).”“Proponents of the Equality Act say it simply extends the logic of the Supreme Court's decision inwhich held that Title VII's prohibition of discrimination ‘because of...sex’ also prohibits discrimination because of sexual orientation and transgender status,” she said. “That's a deceptive argument. TheBostockCourt's premise in interpreting Title VII was that ‘sex...refer[s] only to biological distinctions between male and female’ and, ‘but for’ the ‘sex’ of each plaintiff, there would have been no discrimination.“Unlike thedecision, the Equality Act redefines ‘sex’ with no reference to ‘biological distinctions between male and female.’ Indeed, by defining ‘sex’ to include ‘gender identity’—in turn defined by characteristics ‘regardlessof...sex’—the Equality Act cements into the law the ideological belief that who we are is self-defined and has nothing to do with our bodies' biology. Sex does not matter.”In NBC News,Rabbi Avi Shafran said the bill threatens religious freedom.“Specifically, it would override the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which gives people a way to challenge government requirements that they feel impinge on their religious rights,” he wrote. “The religious freedom act was needed because of a Supreme Court ruling in 1990 that said First Amendment protections for religion couldn't be invoked to challenge a law if the law itself wasn't intended to specifically target religion (e.g., a measure like the Equality Act).“Without the ability to even appeal for those rights, the Equality Act would put religious Americans in unconscionable positions,” he added. For instance, religious hospitals and insurers could be coerced to violate their religious convictions by being required to offer gender transition therapies and to perform gender-transition operations. Faith-based adoption agencies could be forced to abandon their religious principles and place children entrusted to them with same-sex or transgender couples. In an insult to the religious concept of modesty, dressing room facilities and other traditionally sex-specific spaces could have to be open to any and all. Bathrooms and showers could well become places of embarrassment and fear for many.”In the Wall Street Journal, Inez F. Stepman argued that the Equality Act“makes women unequal.”“The Equality Act would threaten the existence of women’s prisons, public-school girls’ locker rooms, and women’s and girls’ sports teams,” she wrote. “It would limit freedom of speech, freedom of association, accurate data collection, and scientific inquiry. It would threaten the rights of physicians who doubt the wisdom of performing life-changing, reproduction-limiting procedures, and parents who seek to protect their minor children from such treatment.“This isn’t hyperbole. Similar state laws have already resulted in such harm. In California, Catholic hospitals have faced lawsuits for declining to perform life-altering ‘gender affirmation’ surgery in September 2016. In Connecticut, two biologically male athletes won a combined 15 girls state championship races, allegedly taking opportunities for further competition and scholarships from female runners in June 2019. Alaska’s Equal Rights Commission opened an investigation into a women’s shelter after it turned away a biological male in September 2019. H. R. 5 would impose the most extreme form of these laws on the whole country.”I should preface everything I’m about to say by noting that this is one of the more complex and difficult issues to write about, largely because both the right and the left are good at talking past each other to stake out a moral high ground. I’m also very interested to hear perspectives from my readers, especially if you are trans, religious, or work in the advocacy and law space on either side of this. Don’t hesitate to write in. First, I am inherently biased to the left’s position. I have a lot of friends in the LGBTQ community who have a personal stake in this legislation, and it’s clear to me we need. An estimated 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender, and5.6%of the adult population identifies as LGBTQ. Practically speaking, that means there are around 10 million Americans openly under this umbrella, millions of whom are still living in states where they have little or no recourse if they are discriminated against in ways we deem unacceptable for religious minorities or people of color. It’s unjust and un-American not to protect these gay, transgender and queer Americans. Full-stop. It’s also great to see Congress actually producing and debating legislation, not just fighting this stuff in court based on 50-year-old bills. I’m also, so far, skeptical of the most prominent arguments being made by the right. Nearly all of them center around the threat to women, specifically trans women operating in spaces like women’s shelters, prisons or sports. So I’m going to try to focus on those. The discourse on the right often describes these scenarios as if a man wearing a dress is going to simply walk into a women’s shelter and start sexually assaulting people. It’s absurd, offensive, and always reads to me like a continuous chain of assumptions and ignorance to get to the worst-case-scenarios. The framework often illustrates how little exposure many Americans actually have to transgender people, even now. In almost all these cases, the point is that we’re trying to solve for the opposite scenario to the one that the right constructs: it’s trans women and trans men who are far, far more likely to be thevictims of assault, violence, and hatethan the perpetrators of it. What happens to a trans woman who, by every societal framework, looks, acts and appears like a woman but is then forced into a men’s shelter? Isn’t she at a much higher risk than a group of women in a shelter who are joined by a single trans woman?Similarly, the general argument also seems to center on an assumption of some sexual deviancy merely by opening the doors of bathrooms or locker rooms to trans women. Which, again, strikes me both as absurd and offensive, but in this case is also hypocritical. This argument seems to most often come from the religious right, where the greatest threat to women or young boys and girls is not trans people but straight, cisgender men, specifically religious leaders, who have a long and storied history of sexual assault. If we must not ignore the reality that most people are born male or female, we must also not ignore the reality that every single study, statistic and piece of evidence we have indicates biological men are a far greater threat to these groups than are trans women. And that’s not a pot shot at the Catholic Church. I’m a semi-observant Jew and I have spent a lot of time in religious and Orthodox Jewish spaces that I love dearly. It’s a problem there, too. Just as it’s a problemin Islamic schools,in theChurch of Latter-Day Saints, inScientology, and in basically every other religious institution in America. Again, the entire construct seems to be obscuring a larger problem we should be trying to solve. All this is to say: it’s still not entirely clear to me what practical negative implication this bill has for straight, cisgender women. In her Newsweek article, Hasson argues that women’s lives were saved when medicine stopped treating the male body as the default — noting that heart attack symptoms in males are different than in females. This is true. But she doesn’t ever connect the dots as to how this bill would undo or damage that. She just says it as if those advancements are going to be reversed now. Doctors aren’t going to suddenly start treating women like they have male genitalia if they don’t. It’s a sort of fear-mongering threat with no actual conclusion. Again: I’m trying to understand, but I just don’t see it. I also don’t buy the argument that LGBTQ people are trying to redefine sex, because it’s LGBTQ people who are best at making the distinction between sex (a biological identifier) and gender (a social construct and identity). Most people who operate in spaces where LGBTQ people exist openly already know that, which is part of what undermines the right’s argument here. What Democrats appear to be doing is trying to make specific carve-outs for gender identity and sexual orientation and adding gender identity into the umbrella of sex — not superseding it. To put it into progressive terminology: that means straight cisgender women, trans women, and gay women will all enjoy the same protections and rights. It doesn’t mean trans women will be prioritized over cisgender women. All this being said, there are plenty of extremely complex aspects of this. One I’m particularly sensitive to is the impact it could have on women’s sports. I’ve participated in and observed competitive sports my whole life. I am a sports fanatic, and I got my journalism start as a sports reporter — which was also when this issue really began getting mainstreamed. It is undeniable that biological males on average have a distinct advantage in competitive sports; it’s also true that some transgender women have already dominated some women’s sports spaces. One of the few real-world applications we’ve seen in professional sports was in Mixed Martial Arts, when a trans woman named Fallon Fox fought Tamikka Brents. Brents was a world-class women’s MMA fighter and she was knocked out in two minutes, her orbital bone shattered, and Fox was promptly barred from fighting women again (:Fox was not actually barred: she had a green light from the Florida athletics commission to continue fighting. But she faced such a torrent of criticism from leaders at the UFC and fellow fighters that she never fought again). Brents, who was clearly open to accepting Fox in the sport, later said she’d never felt strength like that in her fighting career — saying “I’ve never felt so overpowered ever in my life… Her grip was different.” This case has since been used as an argument for better regulation when integrating trans women into women’s sports. Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a leader at the Women’s Sports Policy Working Group, has staked out a position on this I appreciate: she says competitive sports are akin to pregnancy and medical testing — areas that require a science-based approach for trans inclusion. I share this view: a trans woman should be allowed to adopt a child or apply for housing or go buy a drink in a store without ever facing discrimination. Full stop. But keeping the playing field level for women in an arena like sports requires a level of regulation and guardrails that these other areas don’t. Some have suggested regulations around whether someone goes through puberty as a boy or has undergonehormone treatment. I’m not well-read enough on the nuances of the science to say what would be most effective, but I’m open to these kinds of changes. I’m similarly sympathetic to religious liberty issues in the bill. It’s a plain and difficult fact that some people’s observance boxes them into opposing things like same-sex marriage, and I certainly understand a person’s faith overriding everything else. But we live in a country that is not just built on freedom of religion but freedomreligion — the distinct separation of God’s law from America’s law. We need to walk a line between not forcing religious institutions into violating their own faiths and not allowing the same institutions to force their faith-based beliefs onto the public at large. Especially when they’re exclusionary. Religious and non-religious Americans alike are expected to be tolerant of differing religious beliefs, so it is only fair to ask that religious Americans be tolerant of identities and lifestyles that compete with their religion's worldview. That’s the complicated, messy country we’ve all chosen. As such, my position is that a church should be able to ask its members to follow scripture by the letter and a religious baker should not be allowed to refuse to serve a gay couple. I think we are capable of holding these two things at once. The Equality Act, as it stands, doesn’t appear to have all this nuance carved out, but perhaps we can get there with adjustments to what exists now. On the whole, the framework and intent of the bill is something that has my support. But like any piece of legislation, it could use some refining. The New York Times is out with a fascinating piece on how race, class and social justice issues upended Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. A student there alleged racial bias from the school staff that resulted in suspensions, job losses and public criticism. But an independent investigation did not support the student’s claims, and the accused staffers have pointed to class issues as the heart of the division. The story is an interesting read about the challenges schools are facing to grapple with issues of race, class and power.

412,Woman Who Claimed Police Harassment On Instagram Video Arrested,1.67,43.0,https://patch.com/florida/southtampa/woman-who-claimed-police-harassment-instagram-video-arrested,https://adfontesmedia.com/patch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,20,"TAMPA, FL — Tampa Police have arrested a woman who attracted widespread publicity and caught the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union after she posted a video on social media claiming police harassed her when they pulled her over in a stolen car. Joneshia Wilkerson, 23, has been charged with failure to return a leased vehicle and fraudulent use of a credit card. According to Tampa Police detectives, on June 2, Wilkerson went to the Hertz Rent-a-Car at St. Pete-Clearwater Airport and rented a black 2020 Nissan Altima. She provided a driver's license and a credit card to rent the car. The car was due back on June 6 but was never returned. Hertz attempted to contact Wilkerson but discovered the credit card she used was stolen. The company subsequently filed a stolen car report with the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office on June 18. Later that same day, Tampa Police officers spotted a car matching the description of the stolen car on North 40th Street and pulled it over. Wilkerson was at the wheel and a 19-year-old acquaintance was in the passenger seat. Wilkerson told police she was on leave from the Army and had borrowed the car from a friend, not realizing it was reported stolen. Wilkerson is a member of the Army Reserve. Wilkerson filmed the traffic stop on her cell phone and posted the video on Instagram. She claimed police pointed a gun at her head even though she was complying with orders. On the Instagram video, she commented, ""I was scared and in fear with my life.""Tampa Police countered the criticism, releasing body camera footage of the incident in police officers can be heard speaking politely to Wilkerson and her passenger. Tampa Police said the officer who pulled the stolen car over called for backup before approaching the car. The officer drew his weapon because he didn't know whether the occupants of the stolen car were armed. At no time, said Tampa Police, was a gun pointed at Wilkerson's head. Police said both Wilkerson and her passenger were cooperative. Upon completing their investigation and impounding the stolen car, police released the two women and said they ""appeared to understand the explanation provided by the officers.""Afterward, the ACLU questioned whether Tampa Police made Wilkerson a target of harassment or endangered her by releasing the body cam video of the arrest in which Wilkerson gave police personal information, including her address on North Ola Avenue in Tampa and her telephone number. Tampa Police took the video down. In the meantime, Pinellas County Sheriff's detectives showed Wilkerson's Instagram video to the Hertz manager who rented Wilkerson the car, and the manager positively identified her. Hertz also provided the sheriff's office with surveillance footage showing Wilkerson renting the car inside Hertz office. Upon further investigation, Tampa Police detectives discovered the driver's license Wilkerson used to rent the car belonged to a friend to whom Wilkerson paid $200. The credit card number Wilkerson used to rent the car belonged to an Indiana resident who was still in possession of the original credit card. On Tuesday, Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputies arrested Wilkerson at her new address on Zachery Circle in Riverview. She was released from the Orient Road Jail on $10,000 bail.

413,Ex-Rep. Ryan Zinke eyes new House seat in Montana,-2.67,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/ex-rep-ryan-zinke-eyes-new-house-seat-in-montana/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,23,"| Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkeformed a committeeThursday to raise money to run for a House seat in Montana that will be created based onnew census data released this week. Zinke won two terms representing the state’s current at-large district before leaving to join the Trump administration in 2017. He was the first Montanan to serve in a presidential Cabinet, but heresigned in the face of ethics investigationsafter serving less than two years. In all, the former secretary came under at least 15 different investigations before leaving in January 2019. Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission indicates that the Helena-based campaign committee, Zinke for Congress, is geared toward fundraising for what will become Montana’s 2nd District. Boundaries for that seat will be drawn later this year, after more detailed census data is released. Lorna Kuney, who was listed as the committee treasurer and records custodian on the FEC paperwork, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Republican strategist involved in House races said it is not too early to lay the groundwork for a campaign, but other candidates are likely waiting to find out more information about where and how competitive the new district will be. Despite Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock spending $49 million last fall on a run for Senate, he and his party’s House candidate were shut out, and Montana voters went for President Donald Trump over Joe Biden, 57 percent to 41 percent. At least one of the two newly drawn seats is expected to be solid GOP territory in 2022. But there’s a possibility the new seat could be competitive, depending on how the boundaries are drawn by an independent commission, appointed mostly by state lawmakers.[]It is also unclear whether Montanans will penalize Zinke for his record at the Interior Department. In October 2018, about two months before Zinke left his post, the department’s inspector general referred an inquiry it had launched into Zinke’s conduct to the Justice Department. That probe centered on a land agreement Zinke reached with an executive of oil field services giant Hallibutron in Whitefish, Mont., his hometown. Also that October, the inspector general found that Zinkebroke federal rulesby allowing family members to travel with him in government vehicles. Zinke also asked if his wife, Lola, could join the department as a volunteer, the IG said in a report.“He denied that his intention in making this request was so that his wife could travel with him in an official capacity, which would have eliminated the requirement to reimburse the Government for her travel,” the report said. “Ultimately, the employees advised him that making her a volunteer could be perceived negatively, and she did not become one.”The inspector general also found that Zinke took a security detail with him on a vacation to Greece and Turkey, costing taxpayers $25,000. In April 2018, the IG cleared Zinke of misconduct in connection with travel arrangements, including on chartered and military planes. A former Navy SEAL, Zinke showed up to his first day of work as secretary on a horse. He pushed policies to relax fossil fuel extraction and supported shrinking the boundaries of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. Citing an inspector general report, House Democrats said the decision to shrink the size of those monuments was predetermined to benefit fossil fuel and mining interests. Zinke, whom the Senate confirmed by a 68-31 vote in March 2017, frequently used the phrase “energy dominance” to describe his efforts at the department to ease environmental regulations, and he backed a Trump administration move to allow offshore oil-and-gas drilling off every coastal state in the country, including in Florida, despite bipartisan opposition. Trump issued a moratorium in August last year to freeze oil and gas drilling in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The Interior Department unveiled Zinke’s official portrait in December. It shows him on horseback and is based on a photo taken when he visited Bears Ears in 2017.",3,Reliable,0.0696775446775446,0.3943667443667444,859,3,Roll Call
414,Pandemic Meat Shortage Spurs Calls to Shift Slaughterhouse Rules,-0.67,48.33,https://about.bgov.com/news/pandemic-meat-shortage-spurs-calls-to-shift-slaughterhouse-rules/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-19,17,"Empty fridges at grocery stores in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic exposed weaknesses in the meat supply chain that lawmakers are seeking to address in their last-ditch efforts to pass another stimulus bill. Outbreaks at meat-processing facilities caused temporary shutdowns that reduced the amount of meat available for sale. The disruption also exacerbated preexisting tensions over restrictions on meat sales across state lines. To get their meat to shelves, livestock farmers pay either state- or federally regulated slaughterhouses to butcher their animals. Meat from state-inspected facilities can’t be sold across state lines, making it more advantageous for farmers to work with the four federally regulated companies that dominate the market:Tyson Foods Inc.,JBS SA, Cargill Inc., and National Beef Packing Co. Lawmakers have offered bipartisan proposals to help small-scale processors and livestock producers access larger markets at fair prices, with House Agriculture Committee ChairmanCollin Peterson(D-Minn.) leading the charge. His legislation to make it easier for processing facilities to become federally regulated was added to House Democrats’ stimulus measure (H. R. 925), but it faces an uncertain future if last-minute stimulus negotiations fail.“The pandemic confirmed something farmers have known for some time: there is a severe shortage of local and regional meat processing facilities across the country,” Rob Larew, the National Farmers Union’s president, said in a statement. The Agriculture Departmentregulatesabout 6,500 slaughter and processing facilities nationwide, while 27statesmonitor about 1,900 small-scale processing facilities. Federally inspected plants have an expanded market throughout the U. S. and abroad. Large retailers will often only sell meat that carries the Agriculture Department inspection seal. Eight of the 27 states participate in a program that allows state-inspected plants to qualify as federally inspected establishments. Although state inspection programs are required to impose requirements “at least equal to” those of USDA, plants applying to become federally inspected often have to spend money to upgrade their facilities. Facility upgrades are the greatest barrier to businesses being able to qualify for USDA oversight, a department spokesperson said. Meatpacking giants running federally inspected facilities have come under fire for allegations of price gouging during the pandemic, sparkingoutrageamong lawmakers such as Sen. Chuck Grassley(R-Iowa) and prompting an investigation by the Justice Department. Peterson’s bill (H. R. 7490), incorporated in the stimulus package, would establish facility upgrade and planning grants for meat and poultry processors to qualify for federal inspection. The stimulus measure would set aside $100 million for the grants. Some lawmakers have taken an alternate approach to address processing industry issues. Reps. Chellie Pingree(D-Maine) andJeff Fortenberry(R-Neb.) introduced the Strengthening Local Processing Act (H. R. 8431) to aid small meat processors and boost state operations. The bill would expand the Agriculture Department’s portion of state inspection program costs. It would also offer grants to small and state-inspected plants, and set up two $10 million grant programs for meat-processing training. Fortenberry said the legislation would reinvigorate local meat processing as there’s “broadening concern over corporate concentration in the meatpacking industry.”The Cattle Market Transparency Act (S. 4647), introduced by Sen. Deb Fischer(R-Neb.), would address cattle industry issues by setting regional negotiated cash minimums and giving producers more market information, among other policy changes. The nation’s top four meat processing companies control about 80% of the slaughter market, according to Grassley. The North American Meat Institute estimates their share of beef production is actually closer to two-thirds. The companies last month persuaded a judge to temporarily toss a 2019lawsuitover alleged antitrust violations. JBS, Tyson, Cargill, National Beef Avoid Cartel Claims for NowCargill, with 12 federally inspected processing facilities primarily for beef and turkey, is “confident in our efforts to maintain market integrity and conduct ethical business,” Daniel Sullivan, the company’s media relations director, said in a statement. The other companies didn’t respond to requests for comment. Grassley urged government officials to look into possible cattle market manipulation by large beef-packing corporations in late March. A federal investigation is ongoing, he said in an Oct. 13 telephone interview, adding, “I really haven’t had this positive of a response from the Justice Department, Republican or Democrat, for years.”The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mike Stranz, vice president of advocacy at the National Farmers Union, pointed out that “98% of all meat processed in the U. S. goes through 50 plants,” making supply chain interruptions consequential, he said. However, National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said in an email that “there is no shortage of chicken plants in the U. S. and we did not experience any major disruptions in production this spring or summer.”To contact the reporter on this story:Megan U.

His endless list of indicted influencers proves it.,-12.33,29.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/trump-never-cared-about-americans-his-endless-list-indicted-influencers-n1274667,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,25,"An unregistered foreign agent told Trump 2016 campaign officials what to do — and they did it. When Donald Trump became president, the same foreign agent advised senior U. S. government officials on foreign policy — and they did what he wanted then, too. Barrack knew precisely who he was answering to and where his allegiance rested. Ultimately, that agent of a foreign power became the chairman of the 2017 Trump inauguration committee. He even sought out, albeit unsuccessfully, a more formal senior role in the Trump administration, including the job of special envoy to the Middle East, because that’s what foreign agents do: seek the most influential role they can find in order to serve their masters. This is all according to theU. S. Department of Justice's announcementTuesday of anindictment of Thomas Barrack, a wealthy close friend of Trump's, on charges of not disclosing that he was working for the United Arab Emirates to influence not only U. S. foreign policy but the Trump officials who seemed more than happy to be influenced. Two other men, Matthew Grimes and Rashid Sultan Rashid Al Malik Alshahhi, were also charged in the scheme. To be clear, this is not just a garden-varietyForeign Agents Registration Actcase. Nor is it a scenario where someone forgot to file a small fee and some paperwork to advise the U. S. Department of Justice that they are lobbying on behalf of another country. It’s also not a case where a foreign agent thought he was just working for some private interests as an “independent intermediary.”That’s whatBarrack has already tried to claim(and a spokesperson said he will be pleading not guilty) and will want you to believe — but that would be contrary to all known facts. The specific charge against Barrack, Grimes and Alshahhi is18 USC 951(a), which implies they were allegedly working directly with and for representatives of a foreign government. (According toBess Levinof Vanity Fair, as of Tuesday, Grimes' attorney could not be reached for comment and Alshahhi wasat large, the identity of his attorney unknown.)While it’s often said that the cover-up is worse than the crime, it’s also true that a cover up can help prove the crime. Here are the facts as set forth in the DOJ indictment, and here’s why we should all care. First, Barrack seems to have been operating as a kind of double agent for the UAE. Mere lobbyists advocate for their clients, but they don’t collect sensitive nonpublic information from our government and pass it to another nation. The DOJ announcement said, “As alleged in the indictment, the defendants used Barrack’s status as a senior outside advisor to the campaign and, subsequently, to senior U. S. government officials, to advance the interests of and provide intelligence to the UAE while simultaneously failing to notify the Attorney General that their actions were taken at the direction of senior UAE officials.”More specifically, the indictment alleges that “in May 2017, Barrack agreed to provide Alshahhi with non-public information about the views and reactions of senior U. S. government officials following a White House meeting between senior U. S. officials and senior UAE officials.”Second, according to the indictment, Barrack was in frequent contact with UAE government officials. The indictment alleges “Barrack and Grimes also solicited direction from senior UAE officials in advance of the publication of an op-ed authored by Barrack and published in a national magazine in October 2016 and removed certain language at the direction of senior UAE officials, as relayed by Alshahhi.” Remember that when Barrack tries to assert that he had no idea who he was actually working for. Because evidence indicates Barrack knew precisely who he was answering to and where his allegiance rested. The DOJ announcement said, “After one appearance in which Barrack repeatedly praised the United Arab Emirates, Barrack emailed Alshahhi, 'I nailed it. . . for the home team,' referring to the UAE.”And when Barrack tries to claim that his endeavors were all on the up and up, ask him why, as detailed in the indictment, he had to use encrypted communications to mask his talks with the UAE government. “In furtherance of the alleged criminal conspiracy and conduct, Barrack and Grimes, with the assistance of Alshahhi, acquired a dedicated cellular telephone and installed a secure messaging application to facilitate Barrack’s communications with senior UAE officials,” the DOJ said. It seems clearer with each new indictment of Trump cohorts that money and influence drove decision-making and access to power. Third, don’t let anyone fool you that the clandestine influence work ended with the Trump campaign and never impacted decision-making after Trump was in power. As the DOJ explained, “Following the 2016 U. S. presidential election, the defendants repeatedly acted at the direction of UAE officials to influence the foreign policy positions of the incoming administration in favor of UAE interests.”Fourth, Barrack allegedly lied to FBI agents in an attempt to obstruct their investigation of his work on behalf of the UAE. The indictment alleges that “On June 20, 2019, Barrack voluntarily met with FBI special agents. During the interview, Barrack allegedly made numerous false statements, including falsely denying that Alshahhi had ever requested that he take any actions on behalf of the UAE.”While it’s often said that the cover-up is worse than the crime, it’s also true that a cover-up can help prove the crime. In other words, if Barrack had no idea he was working for a foreign power to influence the U. S. president, and to pass government information to that foreign power, why would he lie about it? What is he covering up, and who is he covering for?If all this talk of foreign agents and lying in and around the Trump White House sounds eerily familiar to you, that’s because we’ve seen this before. Former Trump national security adviserMichael Flynn admitted to lyingabout his work on behalf of the Turkish government, andFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agentsabout his talks with a Russian ambassador. Former Trump campaign chairmanPaul Manafort was similarly convictedof violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act related to his work as an agent for Ukraine. As is alleged of Barrack and admitted to by Flynn,Manafort also liedto cover up his crimes. It seems clearer with each new indictment of Trump cohorts that money and influence drove decision-making and access to power. That’s not particularly unusual in Washington circles. Yet, when so many foreign agents are so close to a president, and wield so much influence over our foreign policy positions, we have to wonder, as we have for the last several years: Was anyone in the Trump administration actually working on behalf of the American people?Frank Figliuzziis an MSNBC columnist and a national security contributor for NBC News and MSNBC.

Since Dec. 14, theCOVID-19 vaccinedoses have started being administered throughout the states. If you think that after you receiveboth doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, you won't have to worry aboutwearing a maskor social distancing, think again. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it's important tocontinue following the protection guidelines in placewhile experts learn more about the protection theCOVID-19 vaccinesprovide, the possibility of vaccinated people continuing to spread the disease and more about immunity and reinfection if someone has recovered from COVID-19. Here's what health experts and the CDC have to say about why you need to continue wearing a mask and social distancingafter you get the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines are safe, even without long-term dataThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines come in two doses -- the first shot starts building protection, while the second shot is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer against thecoronavirus,according to the CDC. The first shot has beenproven to be highly effective, Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patient safety officer of Wexner Medical Center, told CNET. He said the second dose amplifies the protection and will extend the life of immunity. After you receive the second shot, your body needs time to build the protection needed to fight the virus. It could take up to two weeks foryour COVID-19 vaccine to begin protecting you against the coronavirus,according to the CDC. During that time, it's important to keep yourself and those around you safe by continuing to socially distance and wear a mask when around people outside your household. You may not get full protection from the coronavirus right away. Because the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine are both so new, there's not enough evidence at this point to know if people can still carry the coronavirus pathogens and pass them along to others without being infected themselves.""This gives enough time for the virus to grow in the respiratory passages and spread the infection to others, all while the body is fighting its own infection, aided by the vaccine,"" Gonsenhauser told CNET. There's a lack of data that shows whether or not a vaccinated individual canspread the virus after becoming infected, and a person could potentially be anasymptomatic carrier, he added.""While the vaccine is highly effective, there's still a slim chance -- 5 to 10% -- that after someone gets vaccinated, they could become infected,"" Gonsenhauser said. However, more data could become available as scientists and doctors learn more about the effects of the vaccine on COVID-19. COVID-19 reinfection: Can you get the coronavirus more than once? What we know so farUntil experts fully understand the protection a COVID-19 vaccine provides, it's important to continue wearing a mask and following social distancing protocols,the CDC says. This can help prevent the coronavirus spread among communities of people until more of the population is vaccinated against the coronavirus. Wearing a mask is ""adding on the protection of the vaccination,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy,said Dec. 14 on a CBS radio affiliate. The CDC says that together, wearing a face mask and getting vaccinated willoffer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19.""The immune response, including duration of immunity, to COVID-19 is not yet understood,""the CDC says. More research is needed to determine how likely you are to get reinfected, and the CDC says""it's not known what antibody levels are needed to protect against reinfection.""The defenses the body gains against the virus during and after infection seem to fade relatively quickly, making it difficult to achieveherd immunityover a longer period of time,according to Dr. William Haseltine, a former professor of Harvard Medical School who is renowned for his work on thehuman genome and HIV/AIDS.""The bigger concern is someone becoming reinfected with the same variant of COVID-19, not getting sick themselves, but still being contagious to others. You can get infected twice and be asymptomatic the second time around, and still carry it and transmit it to other more vulnerable people around you,""said John V. Williams, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh. So far, there have been very few cases ofreinfection of the coronavirus. In fact, reported cases of reinfection with COVID-19 remain rare,according to the CDC. However, if COVID-19 is like other types of coronaviruses, such as the common cold, reinfection will become more prevalent as time goes on,according to Scientific American. Reinfection of COVID-19 is a possibility. It's going to take months or longer for enough of the population to be vaccinated to start seeing case numbers go down substantially. Therefore, it's important to continue wearing masks whenever you're around people outside your household.""If after getting vaccinated, people stop wearing their masks, other people who haven't been vaccinated could start thinking masks aren't necessary anymore,"" Gonsenhauser said of social behavior. If those unvaccinated people have the virus, they can spread it faster by not wearing a mask. COVID-19 vaccine card is not an immunity passport. Here's the differencePeople in smaller groups are less likely to wear masks when together,according to a Vox surveyfirst published in November. Thirty two percent of respondents said they don't wear a mask when attending a sit-down gathering.""Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives,""the World Health Organization says. If 95% of the public wears a mask, tens of thousands of lives could be saved,according to a Nature Medicine study from October. Despite theCOVID-19 vaccines being proven safe, some Americans may avoid vaccination. Incorrectcoronavirus vaccine mythsand other misinformation have falsely claimed that the vaccine will include government-tracking microchips or be forcefully administered by the military. This is not true. Some may be wrongly concerned that the vaccine was developed too quickly to be safe. Both vaccines in the US haveundergone extensive clinical trialsand have been proven to be 94% and 95% effective, well over the 90% efficacy threshold required. While a vaccine won't completely stop the pandemic in its tracks, it's the direct route toherd immunity. However, in order to get there, more people will need to get the coronavirus vaccine. And, due to a limited number of doses, not everyone is able to get the coronavirus vaccine all at once. In fact,depending on which group you're in, you may be waiting until at least April to get the vaccine,according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert -- if not later. If a significant portion of the population refuses to take the vaccine, we will likely not see numbers of new cases decrease as rapidly as we'd like, says Gonsenhauser. He says he and other medical providers are doing everything they can to remind peoplehow safe the vaccine is-- from bringing relatable and accessible information to communities who have different oppositions to distrust the vaccine, to help them make better-informed decisions. Some people may think it's okay not to wear a mask after getting COVID-19. Currently, there's not enough information at this time to determine if or when the majority of the population can safely stop wearing masks and avoid close contact with others to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus,the CDC says, but it will likely come down to the numbers. When there are enoughobservable changes, such as cases dropping and the threat levels of community spread sharply falling. When that happens, medical experts can redetermine the need for mask-wearing. However, it could be well into 2021 before that happens.""We would need to see a dramatic decrease in the number of new cases per 100,000 of the population after enough vaccines have been administered,"" Gonsenhauser said. For more information, here are theCOVID-19 vaccine side effects and what we know so far, andhidden medical charges you could encounter after getting the vaccine. Also,here's where you can get the COVID-19 vaccine when it's your turn.",3,Reliable,0.1179998258446534,0.4627051301189233,1924,3,CNET
419,"Can You Get Covid-19 on an Airplane? Yeah, Probably",0.0,47.33,https://www.wired.com/story/can-you-get-covid-19-on-an-airplane-yeah-probably/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-10,25,"In March 1977,on a Boeing 737 making a run from Anchorage to Kodiak,a bunch of people got the flu. That’s not supposed to happen on airplanes. Influenza is a respiratory virus, most likely transmitted at least in part via airborne particles, and airplanes have recirculation, air filtration, and fresh-air injection systems burly enough to purge cabins of smoke if there’s a fire. They ought to do the same with a virus. So how’d those people get sick? That’s the interesting part. The flight made a stop on the way, in Homer, where a new passenger came on board. That person, the “index case,” had the flu. The 737 took off, but an engine problem forced it to return to the airport. There it waited—engines off, on the tarmac. Some passengers stayed on board; some waited in the terminal. Eventually, other planes took the stranded passengers on to their destinations, where nearly three-quarters eventually became sick with the flu as well—“secondary infections.” Almost all of them were the ones who’d spent their unplanned layover on the plane with the sick passenger rather than in the terminal. That choice—where they waited—was the crux. With the engines off, the 737’s air conditioner wasn’t working. The airplane cabin turned into the classic indoor, crowded, low-ventilation space you really want to avoid if you don’t want to pick up a respiratory virus like the flu—or, more relevantly today,Covid-19. It might not seem like it, but this story is actually good evidence for why it’sto get sick on an airplane, although folk wisdom might suggest otherwise. If everyone’s wearing a mask and the ventilation is blowing, it is indeed difficult to get Covid-19 when you fly. But it’s not impossible. And that’s where things get complicated. As most of the United States tips back into uncontrolled spread of the pandemic virus, with just a week before the traditional holiday travel season begins, it’d be nice to know: How risky are airplanes, exactly? The short answer is: No one knows, but risky enough. If you can avoid flying, avoid it. “The position that a lot of airline executives are stating now, publicly—that the risk is essentially zero—is just unrealistic,” says David Freedman, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who studies travel medicine. “I’m not saying the risk is high. And the risk is manageable. But to start from the position that the risk is zero on an airplane is like the politicians who are saying this is a hoax. It exists.”This position isn’t perhaps the sexiest. “Low-ish risk but nonzero, avoid unless you can’t” bears some explaining. Most scientists and health care workers now agree that the virus that causes Covid-19 can travel through the air, borne aloft in teeny globs of snot. Even people without symptoms can emit these particles, just by talking or breathing. Masks can stop some of them, though probably not all—but hey, nobody really knows how many you have to inhale to get sick, either. Another thing that helps prevent infection is being far enough away from people that whatever virus they’re giving off gets diluted before it gets to you; even better is being outside. Airplanes are definitely inside, and a fully-booked coach cabin doesn’t allow much leeway for social distance. But actually, the filtration and ventilation systems on airplanes are pretty great. Jet engines inhale great gulps of air, mix it with fuel, and set it on fire, which makes thrust. But some of that air (before the fuel and fire parts) gets diverted into the ventilation system. Because it comes from outside, at cruising altitude, that air is very clean and very cold. It feeds through air compressors (which heat the air way up, to hundreds of degrees) and then into air conditioner “packs” in the fuselage which cool it back down and send it to a manifold that mixes it with air from inside the cabin. It goes through ducts in the ceiling to vents that blow it downward through the cabin, and then it gets sucked into intakes next to passengers’ feet. About half of that then gets sent back outside, and the other half gets run through HEPA filters—very good at getting rid of even viral particles—and back to the manifolds, to meet a new gust of outside air. In a plane where everything’s working up to spec, the whole cabin gets an air change every two to three minutes. Tobacco smells, dust, pollen, germs, halitosis, sweat, farts—all gone. Whoosh. And yet. It’s clear that at least some people have gotten sick from air travel. It’s hard to track how many; no nation maintains a database of these infections. Contact tracing of air passengers during the Covid-19 pandemic has proven to be difficult—a plane might carry 300 people, and in the US, airlines, government agencies that deal with travel and border security, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have beenfighting since Februaryover whose job it should be to keep track of passengers’ personal and contact information after flights, in case of an outbreak. One potential point of failure might be on the ground. As in Homer in 1977, planes sometimes get delayed, and without power from the plane’s auxiliary power unit (APU) or ground-based air-conditioning, that shuts off the air exchange on the plane. “If they unhook the plane at the gate and there’s a delay in pushback, they’ll say, ‘Don’t worry that it’s getting hot in here, when we start the engines it’ll cool down,’” Freedman says. “That could be five or 10 minutes without proper air-conditioning.” Because the APU is essentially a generator, it has exhaust—and some airports around the world won’t allow planes to run it near the gate. But that can’t explain every case. Areview articleby Freedman and his colleague Annelies Wilder-Smith in thedescribed all the known cases up to its September publication, including three flights in March—before wearing masks was a thing—that led to what they call “mass transmission.” Acharter flightto bring home 11 Israeli passengers from the outbreak on board theDiamond Princesscruise ship, with at least one infected person on board, led to no secondary infections. Mask-wearing was rigorously enforced, and crew and passengers basically weren’t allowed to interact. Buta March flightin Australia with at least six infected people on board, all coming back from various cruise trips, and with minimal mask enforcement, led to nearly 60 people getting sick—eight with virus confirmed by genetic sequencing to have come from another passenger. Even after masking was more common, though, reports of rare midair infections have continued. Freedman and Wilder-Smith note a flight out of Italy in April with mandatory masking and one possible transmission. A more recentcase studyhinted at “widespread transmission” sparked by infections on a flight to Ireland, butother researchers pointed outthat the rapid onset of symptoms suggested infection before the flight, not on it. There just aren’t a lot of studies to go on here. But let’s stipulate that masks are now at least expected on a plane. “What happened in February, March, and April when nobody was wearing a mask is academic,” Freedman says. “The functional point right now is: Are we safe with precautions?”Masks themselves might not be enough just because of how people use them in real life. On long flights, people eat. They get up to go to the bathroom, where the mask might come off. They might take off the mask to speak, to be better heard over the noise of the engines—and speaking more loudly actuallyemits more viral particles, if you’re infected. (It’s also probably worth noting that airplane cabins tend to be very dry, because the outside air at altitude is low humidity—and that seems tomake fighting infections harder.)Plus, masks are only part of the equation. Seat maps of which people got sick on a given flight tend to show that the closer someone was to an index case, the more risk. And if that index case is asymptomatic, any seat could be a jackpot. “They do have high air change rates and use high-efficiency filters, but the closer they get to full occupancy on planes, the more close contact is going to be a concern,” says William Bahnfleth, an architectural engineer at Penn State and chair of the Epidemic Task Force of the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-conditioning Engineers. By October, this was all nervous-making enough that the air industry started being public about efforts to make people feel safe. “With only 44 identified potential cases of flight-related transmission among 1.2 billion travelers, that’s one case for every 27 million travelers,” said David Powell, medical advisor to the International Air Transport Association, in apress release. “We think these figures are extremely reassuring.”Actually, those figures may be misleading. The data came from Freedman’s review, but hedoesn't agreewith that conclusion—too few people have actually been tested, so it’s impossible to know whether all those 1.2 billion fliers were virus-free. When he and I spoke, Freedman had a bit more faith in other studies that the IATA press release was touting—computer simulations of airflow through plane cabins conducted by Airbus, Boeing, and Embraer, that showed how good their planes were at keeping the air clean. The air flowing from ceiling to floor creates an “invisible barrier,” according to apress releasefrom Airbus. Thanks to that and the HEPA filters, 1 foot of separation on an airplane is like 6 feet on the ground, says the release. To be sure, these companies have the most vested of vested interests in finding that their aircraft are safe. The infectious disease research community isn’t as confident. As with everything about this pandemic, the situation is complex. “Most of us who are following this think that transmission can happen on airplanes, and it's almost certainly higher the closer you're sitting to the infected person, but there aren’t sufficient data to quantify that risk,” says A. Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious disease researcher at UC Santa Cruz. “It obviously also depends on the level of infection in the community of people where the flight is originating. A flight from New Zealand or Australia right now has almost almost zero risk, whereas a flight from North Dakota would be a very scary thing.”More striking, perhaps, than the computational fluid dynamics simulations was a real-worldstudyconducted by the US Defense Department, with aid from Boeing and United Airlines. Run by the US Transportation Command, or Transcom, which flies military personnel around the world, thenew studyused mannequin heads rigged to emit fluorescent particles that mimicked the behavior and approximate count of viral particles in the cabin air, estimating a release of 4,000 infectious viral particles per hour. They tried it with the head masked and unmasked, in various seats and in the jetway that connects the gate to the plane. And they did it in the air and on the ground, using sensors in other seats to see how much pseudo-virus got to other passengers’ potential personal space. The researchers found that the amount of particles that made it even to the closest seats was barely detectable, only enough to account for one infection per 54 hours of time in the air. But they acknowledged that even their real-world methods weren’treal. The viral particles given off and infectious dose were still just estimates, and they couldn’t say what happened when people were eating or talking, or feeling free to move about the cabin.“It was an excellent study,” Freedman says. “But the Transcom study just doesn’t account for the vagaries of human behavior. What they were measuring was people in their seats.”That leaves out not just maskless eating, but also interactions with flight attendants—who are exposed to many more people over a day or week of work on airplanes than a passenger—and the chaos of boarding and deplaning, when the ventilation system might not be running at peak efficiency and people are even closer together. Kilpatrick agrees that the results aren’t clear. For one thing, the Transcom report wasn’t published in a journal or peer reviewed. For another, having Boeing and United on board presents a potential conflict of interest. But even on the raw science side, since nobody actually knows how many particles an infected person emits, or how many it takes to infect someone, it’s hard to build a study that depends on those numbers. “Without data on infectious dose and how much virus is actually expelled by an infected person, we can’t quantify the risk using an experiment like this,” Kilpatrick says. “If it was 10 times lower, and you still had a 4 percent chance of getting infected if you were seated next to an infected person on a flight, would you consider that low risk? I wouldn’t.”It seems like even the Transcom researchers agreed. Sometime after publication, they added a statement to their report. “The viral aerosol production rates, infectious dose and general assumptions used to estimate a flight time of 54 hours to produce an infection are hypothetical and were not designed to provide actionable information about viral risk during flight, safe flight times or seating capacity,” they wrote. Your mileage, they seemed to be saying, may vary. The DOD public affairs person working on the study didn’t return my emailed requests to speak with the researchers for follow-up. It gets worse. Sitting on the airplane isn’t the only potentially risky part of air travel. No one has yet studied what happens in crowded airports, in waiting areas at gates, at baggage claim carousels, or riding rental car shuttles—in short, all the other crowded, uncomfortable parts of flying. “You have to look at travel overall—the process, and all of the different risks associated with different parts of it,” Bahnfleth says. “You may take public transit to get to the airport. You’re in the airport and may have a hard time avoiding close contact with people. Crowds just go along with airports.”Amajor report from Harvard University’s Aviation Public Health Initiative concluded much the same thing at the end of October. The researchers there found a small but not insignificant risk from flying, somewhat mitigated by rigorous mask use. The next phase of their research is supposed to look at the context and environment of air travel, the airport itself. A spokesperson says they’re “in the middle of the research” on that now. In the meantime, air travel is another one of those things that—for people who could afford it, anyway—used to range from innocuous to unpleasant, and now requires each of us to do some complicated risk assessment based on our own tolerance, need, and incomplete information. The risk is there, and the best way to mitigate it is not to fly. Stay masked if you do. Any better sense of the risk is still circling the runway.",3,Reliable,0.0776217535919028,0.4845353402816086,3289,3,WIRED
420,"During current COVID wave, Florida is outperforming California with fewer restrictions",2.33,45.33,https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/two-states-two-pandemics-how-florida-beating-california-covid-fewer,https://adfontesmedia.com/just-the-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-17,25,"California has some of the strictest policies in the country and some of the worst numbers. Published: January 16, 2021 2:32pmUpdated: January 17, 2021 6:55amAs the one-year anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States approaches, two of the country's three most populous states — California and Florida — are seeing two very different epidemiological curves. Hard-lockdown California is — perhaps counterintuitively — recording significantly higher new case numbers and hospitalizations compared to the more open, less restricted state of Florida. Florida as of this week has recorded a little over 1.5 million positive test results of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, while California has registered nearly 3 million. Per CDC figures,the two states are roughly equal in their population-adjusted case numbers per 100,000 residents, with California at around 7,300 and Florida at a little over 7,000. The two states have arrived at more or less equal case numbers after roughly a year of divergent COVID-19 mitigation policies. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has imposed one of the harshest lockdowns in the country over roughly the past ten months, at times ordering wholesale closures of entire industries, the shuttering of private and public schools, and a statewide mask mandate. Throughout 2020 Newsom periodically ordered the shuttering of bars, indoor dining and other recreational businesses in counties he determined were experiencing dangerous levels of COVID transmission. In July, Newsom ordered a statewide shutdown along those lines. The state in August revealed a strict, color-coded blueprint to which counties would have to adhere in permitting businesses to open. In Florida, meanwhile, Gov. Ron DeSantis in the spring enacted numerous measures similar to those imposed by California around the same time, including bar closures and a stay-at-home order. By June, however, he had begun permitting the reopening of shuttered bars and restaurants. In September, DeSanis essentially lifted all statewide restrictions on the state's economy while prohibiting local officials from fining state residents who refuse to wear masks. DeSantis also successfully pushed for the reinstitution of in-person learning for Florida students in the fall. By mid-October, all of the state's 67 counties were offering in-person instruction for students, with DeSantis declaring further school closures ""off the table.""In California, meanwhile, the state is a rough patchwork of public school openings and closings based on the judgment calls of local authorities and/or state guidance. Newsom has lately been pushing for a February reopening of all the state's public schools. Though the states at the end of those divergent approaches have recorded roughly equal COVID cases, Florida thus far has recorded notably more deaths from the disease than California, with Florida posting about 110 deaths per 100,000 residents and California recording 81 per 100,000, according to the CDC. Florida's higher numbers may reflect its more aged population — a popular retirement destination, Florida's median age is 42 compared to California's 36. Yet, there are indications that California is catching up with Florida. The CDC data asserts that California's seven-day average daily deaths are at 1.4 per 100,000 residents, compared to 0.8 per 100,000 in Florida. Current average positive tests are markedly higher in California: As of Saturday, California had a seven-day average of 105 new cases per 100,000, while Florida stood at 64 per 100,000. Additionally, as of Fridaythe COVID Tracking Projectreported California's COVID hospitalization rate at about 56 per 100,000, with Florida standing at around 36 per 100,000. Experts have argued that hospitalization numbers invariably precede fatalities, with higher hospitalization rates likely pointing toward an imminent rise in deaths. The governors' offices of the two states did not respond to requests for comment on those contrasts. Multiple experts that spoke to Just the News, meanwhile, admitted that there was not a readily available explanation for the differences in pandemic numbers seen between the two states. Robert Cook, an epidemiology professor at the University of Florida, argued that the age differences between the two states may explain California's current higher hospitalization rate relative to Florida. California's lower average age ""could account for more cases in young persons in the first place, and then the older, more vulnerable have more infections around them which could explain the hospitalizations,"" he said. It ""could also be somewhat random trends over time,"" he posited.""If you look at the distribution of flu cases over the past several years, there are frequently very high rates in one part of the country compared to the other during one month, and a different pattern the next,"" he said. ""And the pattern is not really consistent from year to year. Florida had a peak of cases in the summer, whereas California did not.""Cook pointed out that ""while Florida may have 'looser' laws at the state level many municipalities in Florida have stricter laws."" He also noted that hospitalizations in the state have increased recently.""I think Florida has more hospital beds overall,"" he said, ""so they may not seem as 'overflowing' —but there are still many more hospitalizations in Florida compared to a few months ago.""Sander Greenland, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, offered a similar inconclusive assessment.""All I can say is that there is tremendous uncertainty about the reasons and political pressures from all directions to promote specific theories and express more certainty than warranted scientifically,"" he said. ""So I suspect you could ask a spectrum of nominal experts and you would get a spectrum of answers.""Steven Goodman, a professor of epidemiology at Stanford University, also declined to offer much in the way of speculation, but ""I think you should also query the reliability of the Florida numbers,"" he told Just the News. Florida's COVID-19 data has been the subject of periodic scrutiny over the course of the pandemic, with critics of Republican Gov. DeSantis claiming the state has manipulated its data in some way to present a more favorable picture. Last summer, a scientist who had helped design Florida's COVID-19 dashboardlaunched her own dashboard examining the state's numbers, arguing that the state had asked her to cover up certain data related to the pandemic. As of this weekend, the alternative dashboard showed a little less than 400 more deaths in the state compared to the state's official data.",3,Reliable,0.0729539177489177,0.4072009523809523,1414,2,Just the News

422,A Letter to Black America on the Anniversary of George Floyd’s Death From Poet Tracy K. Smith,-7.67,35.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/george-floyd-death-anniversary,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,23,"Dear Black America—I hear the birds outside in the spring air, and there is a part of me that can’t believe we’ve made it this far. It’s been a year sinceGeorge Floydwas stolen from his family and from us. A year since the whole world squeezed into the theater of our grief. What have we lived through? Where have we been?None of our losses were new. The ever-lengthening list of Black lives cut short by brutality, by fear, by racialized hate. Like a terrible procession, making its slow march through the ages. My grandparents knew it. Perhaps yours did too and theirs. My parents told me stories about how this form of loss had touched them growing up in Alabama in the 1930s and ’40s. Such stories were a way of warning me that justice was not guaranteed. Perhaps they also sought to underscore the enduring trauma such injustices instigate—how, even in loss, our Black lives continue to matter. All manner of stories were lumped together—like the one about my mother’s uncle or great-uncle who, in the early 1940s, had made a good deal on the sale of timber felled from his own land. At the end of a night spent celebrating his gains in a bar, he was shot and robbed by a white man who’d caught wind of the fortune in that uncle’s pockets. “Did the white man go to jail?” I asked, before I had learned enough to know that’s not how these stories ever end. But there was another kind of story too. When I was in my first or second year at Harvard, in 1990 or ’91, one of my mother’s sisters pulled me aside to tell me the story of B., a cousin who had attended Harvard in the early 1960s. If I’m remembering correctly, B. had lasted there barely a year. The proof of the psychic toll that place in that particular time had had upon her was that she had been found walking across campus one afternoon barefoot in the snow. Somehow her story, in its telling, was equal in strife to that of my mother’s uncle. Of course B. had gotten out with her life, but there was no way, my aunt seemed to be saying, to measure the psychic toll of what our cousin had endured or to know whether the damage of that time had come to an end. These family stories were meant to be extrapolated upon. I was meant to extract from them not just a private warning about how to protect myself, and whom it was unsafe to trust, but also a larger form of knowledge. I was meant to understand that our family stories were but a minuscule part of a centuries-old collective body of knowledge built of struggle, punctuated by loss, and kept alive by love. I was meant to understand unreservedly thatour storieswere indispensable to the full story—the true story—of America, a story America itself was unwilling to tell. But for a long time, all this knowledge did was coalesce into a painful spot in my mind, a site I tended to shy away from. If I’m being honest—with myself, with you—for a long time I coped with that particular pain by attempting to numb the area of my mind where it sat. On the night thatMichael Brown’s murderer was acquitted, I muted my rage, telling myself I had long ago been told (“Did the white man go to jail?”) what the verdict would be. I believe this numbness, this muting of feeling, was an attempt at self-protection. What would I have known to do with the force and the weight of such actual pain if I had been willing to truly claim it or claim a right to it? Would I have let it chase me out into the street or out barefoot in deep snow?Our family stories were but a minuscule part of a centuries-old collective body of knowledge built of struggle, punctuated by loss, and kept alive by love. I have always felt ashamed of my tendency toward silence, my habit of seeking to settle the emotions wishing to storm up and out in reaction. So I was eager to let this past year, with its convergence of crises, change me. The past year, so frequently and so inaccurately labeled unprecedented, was like a storm hammering down on all of us at once, held as we were at home in lockdown. In its conflagration of deaths—to police brutality and to subtler but no less virulent forms of racialized disregard—history seemed to be insisting that we acknowledge how little had changed:It seemed that the age-old patterns my parents had insisted I see were registering in the collective imagination. Not as proof of how things had always been but as an argument for how things must begin to change. The world’s watching, and its reacting, refused to let me retreat into numbness. Thanks to activists in Minneapolis, New York, D. C., and communities across the country, I felt myself to be in a strange new Now that was bound up—this time willingly and actively—with the past. History, no longer behind us, was right there, nudging us to act. And act we have. Even in moments of peace, I feel now the guiding presence of history. Savoring a delicious meal, I am for a flicker of a moment a child again at my mother’s table. Snuggling next to one of my children at bedtime, I feel myself be wrapped up again in the cherishing crucial to my own experience of childhood—the tenderness and instruction intended to buoy me through day after day, to keep me intact in a world where so much would be intent upon my diminishment., history seems to say. And, finally, I obey. Black America, I’m trying to make or preserve the space where the We of Blackness can count on the wider, whiter world to have our backs. But I’m also wary of such trust. How many times in this very same year, in moments where my advocating for smaller justices—in the literary community or on the campus where I have long taught—was met by attack, have I been made to feel the silence of my white peers as a form of annihilating violence?Chasteningly, it is in those very circumstances—in the pain of feeling betrayed—that I’ve been made to see how dangerous for us all the tendency to muteness and the ability to go numb can be. My own included. Black America and all of us willing to honor and protect Black life: We know how exhausted this year has left us. We also know our strength. We know our laughter is a way of digging into the work to be done. And we know a song or a poem or a prayer can summon others near so all the many of us can work together as one. Black America and all of us willing work not just in the here and now of our own time but in the wake of the labor of generations past: Mammoth is our task. I believe it will keep us busy into generations yet to come—our waves rippling out to merge into theirs, even if you and I are, by then, elsewhere. When I am overwhelmed, as I am so often this year, I close my eyes. Once, in what must have been a plea or prayer for help, I watched as the silhouette of a woman bathing in a river or lake took shape in my mind’s eye. I watched her in her wading, her diving and rising. Never facing me. Her back and shoulders rippling with agency. Then I felt a message rise in my mind:Black America and everyone who understands that a cherishing of Black life is essential to the enterprise of democracy: I’m talking to us, all of us. As we did so often in the past year, we find ourselves standing shoulder to shoulder—now in flesh, now in spirit—called upon to manifest the possible. Is it possible for us to reseed the imagination not just of ourselves but of our entire nation? Is it possible to fill it with tall climbing vines that lift our sights up from where they’ve been?",2,Generally Reliable,0.0200075213046911,0.4737715769555389,1725,3,Vogue
423,What happens if Trump refuses to concede the election to Joe Biden?,-5.1,44.2,https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2020/11/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-to-concede-the-election-to-joe-biden.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/syracuse-post-standard-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,25,"What happens if President Donald Trump refuses to concede the election? Every major news outlet projected Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential race on Saturday, with 290 electoral votes to Trump’s 214; Biden also won the popular vote by 4.5 million votes (and counting). Trump has repeatedly claimed voter fraud without providing any evidence andfiled lawsuitsover mail-in ballots in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan. But his attempted legal challenges, and recounts in states like Wisconsin and Georgia, arenot expected to change the overall outcome. Biden claimed victory Saturday and vowed to be a president for all Americans beginning Jan. 20, on Inauguration Day. The president-elect has also already begun making moves to get his administration started, announcing a coronavirus advisory board on Monday -- the same day Ben Carson, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, tested positive for Covid-19. Other leaders, including former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton,George W. Bushand Jimmy Carter, have all recognized and congratulated Biden as the soon-to-be 46th president of the United States. Bush, the last Republican to hold the nation’s highest office before Trump, said Sunday that “this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear.”Yet Trump’s team still has not started the transition process to ensure a smooth transfer of power to Biden. The Associated Press reports the General Services Administration, tasked with formally recognizing Biden as president-elect, has not started the process and has given no guidance on when it will begin. What happens if Inauguration Day rolls around and Trump is still refusing to leave the White House? Do squatter’s rights apply at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?The 20th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution is clear: “The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of their successors shall then begin.”Voxnotes that Trump could (and should) follow tradition and attend Biden’s inauguration, much like how Biden, Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did in 2016. But if Trump opts to stay in the White House until Biden is sworn in, Biden has the right to order the Secret Service to physically remove Trump like any other trespasser.“... The United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House,” Biden’s campaignsaidFriday. But don’t expect Trump to be dragged out of the building like WikiLeaks founderJulian Assangewas from the Ecuadorian embassy last year.“There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed inSeptember. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also promised to keep the military out of any election disputes.“This isn’t the first time that someone has suggested that there might be a contested election,” he toldNPR. “And if there is, it’ll be handled appropriately by the courts and by the US Congress. There’s no role for the US military in determining the outcome of a US election. Zero. There is no role there.”Dec. 8 is the deadline for resolving election disputes, including recounts and court contests, at the state level. The Electoral College formally votes Dec. 14, and then Congress counts the electoral votes on Jan. 6, two weeks before Inauguration Day. The New York Postnotes that if the election is somehow still in dispute, things could get complicated: Some states could deliver two sets of electoral votes and Vice President Mike Pence, who serves as president of the Senate, could opt to throw out both sets of votes from those states. If neither candidate has 270 electoral votes, then Congress would vote for president and vice president; the House of Representatives would need a majority by 26 votes to choose a president and the Senate would need at least 51 votes to determine the VP. In that unlikely scenario, if the Senate somehow chooses a vice president but the House doesn’t pick a president, the vice president-elect serves as president until all is resolved. If neither body of Congress can successfully vote by Inauguration Day, then the presidential line of succession takes effect and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would serve as president until a new president is chosen. ButABC Newsnotes no presidential candidate in modern history has ever refused to concede. Even Al Gore conceded to Bush in 2000 after a recount in Florida ended 36 days of uncertainty.“I accept the finality of the outcome, which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College,” Gore said. “And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.”But will it take Trump longer than Gore to admit defeat?The White House has not indicated Trump plans to concede — “That word is not even in our vocabulary right now,” campaign manager Jason Miller said Monday onFox Business— and Vice President Pence said Monday the race “AIN’t over” yet.“Told @VP Team Today: ‘It ain’t over til it’s over .. And this AIN’T over.!’ @RealDonaldTrump has never stopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted,” Pence’s official Twitter account said Monday. Trump also repeated a number of dubious claims about results in Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia on Monday.“The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated. A very large number of Ballots are impacted. Stay tuned!” Trump tweeted. Told@VPTeam Today, “it ain’t over til it’s over.. and this AIN’T over!” President@realDonaldTrumphas never stopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted! 🇺🇸The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated.

Mike Lee, R-Utah, says. That’s his perspective on thetearing downof statues such as Ulysses S. Grant, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. Protesters have vandalized and attempted to topple statues in the weeks since the May 25 death of George Floyd. Lee says peace is a more effective plan than violence, and even introduced a resolution condemning mob violence, which was rejected by the Senate. He joins The Daily Signal Podcast to discuss. We also cover these stories:“The Daily Signal Podcast” is available onRicochet,Apple Podcasts,Pippa,Google Play, andStitcher. All of our podcasts can be found atDailySignal.com/podcasts.

Well, my message to those trying to tear down any statue anywhere is stop. Mob violence just isn’t the answer in a civil society, and it certainly shouldn’t be in ours. Now, look, if New York City wants to take down a statue of Christopher Columbus on New York City property, or any other statue for that matter, the people of New York have every right to do so, but they should do it peacefully and through the process set up by their system of government, through their elected officials and not through mob violence. That’s one of the reasons why I introduced a resolution in the Senate earlier this month condemning mob violence, because some Black Lives Matter rioters shot one of my constituents in Provo, Utah—average ordinary man just driving home, minding his own business, when Black Lives Matter rioters were blocking the street, surrounded his car, and they shot him. This was a problem and it’s unacceptable. All I asked was for Senate Democrats to condemn mob violence, and they refused. Well, it needs to be condemned and hasn’t been condemned. One of the reasons why it hasn’t been condemned is that we’ve got a lot of people in America who seem to be applauding it. Many of those same people are being funded by our government. That’s why I think we need to start defunding those who hate America because they’re hating America on America’s dime. Colleges that punish free speech and discriminate against conservative viewpoints and religious students shouldn’t get federal funding. City councils who defund their police departments and who refuse to protect public safety shouldn’t get federal grants. School districts that embrace the ahistorical nonsense of the 1619 Project shouldn’t get federal education spending. None of these organizations should get a single dime of taxpayer dollars while they are effectively backing some of these things. It’s a problem. Well, every city that’s given into the demands of the Black Lives Matter movement has seen violence go up in their city. Murders are up in New York City. Murders are up in Minneapolis. Murders are up in Atlanta and in Seattle. You can’t improve public safety by defunding the police. We need the police. The police stop crime. The tragic part is that the poorest communities, those that suffer the most from the violence caused by the Black Lives Matter movement, those are the people in the communities who need the police the most. Now, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t problems that need to be addressed. There certainly are, but it does mean that the answer cannot be and certainly is not simply getting rid of the police. That doesn’t make any sense. You know, there are a lot of explanations for that. There are a lot of reasons that have contributed to that. I think you can point to a breakdown of the family as the fundamental unit of society. I think you can point to sometimes difficult to follow and difficult to trace lines of accountability. Law enforcement used to be primarily, if not exclusively, the domain of local officers who reported to local elected officials, and the more we’ve mixed state, local, and federal law enforcement funding, the blurrier those lines have become. As a result of that, we’ve seen a proliferation of laws and we’ve seen different law enforcement styles that sometimes have aggravated the problem. The introduction of drugs and the acceptance of drug culture certainly hasn’t helped in any of this, but we’re in the situation in which we now find ourselves. We have to address it. There are a number of ways that we can handle it. I think all of those approaches need to take into account: efforts to strengthen, not weaken, families; to strengthen, not weaken, the role [of] parents; to strengthen, not weaken, the resources available to police; while at the same time reforming standards of law enforcement personnel to make sure that officers who do go rogue are held accountable. One of the things that’s so unfortunate about what happened to George Floyd is that the officer who killed him had been subject to 17 formal misconduct complaints against him, and yet he was never held accountable for any of those. Had he been formally disciplined for any one of those complaints, George Floyd would probably be alive today. That is truly tragic, and I think that’s one of the reasons why we need a wake-up call for making sure that we don’t have police and other public employee unions effectively insulating police officers who have engaged in repeated acts of misconduct from any kind of disciplinary action. There certainly has been some private property damage. There have been people who have felt like they can’t go outside, who have felt like they’ve become prisoners in their own homes. You’ve had people whose automobiles have been vandalized or in some cases even destroyed. Now, we’re fortunate in my state. We haven’t had it nearly the same level that you’ve seen it in some other cities, including places like Minneapolis, and like Seattle, and like Portland, but you have seen a lot of people feeling like they’ve lost their sense of community and their sense of hope and faith in their community to operate in a place where mutual respect, and peace, and tolerance, and acceptance can pervade each community from one end to the other. That really is a tragic loss, and it’s something that people feel very deeply. I think Congress most of the time is not the owner of the statue. As I’ve said in the past, look, if someone owns a statue, if it’s their own personal private property, that person has the right to do anything with this statue they want. Most of the time they’re not going to decide to destroy it, but if they want to, they can certainly do that. But it’s not up to a third party to make that decision for them. By the same token, if it’s owned by a corporation, a corporate governance structure is going to decide who has the decision-making power over that statue. If, on the other hand, the statue was owned by the public, then whatever government owns it has the power to make and dispose of that. Most of the statues in this country, in so far as they’re publicly owned, are probably owned by state and municipal governments and not by the federal government. Those statues that are federally owned ultimately are subject to disposal or disposition only insofar as an act of Congress authorizes that, where only insofar as a previous act of Congress has authorized particular executive branch officials. I think there will continue to be reviews from time to time within Congress of what the policies should be and who should have the decision-making power, but in no circumstance should we just hand this over to whatever group of people decides to engage in lawless activity on a particular day and say, “If you feel strongly about something, you can take a statue that belongs to the American people and destroy it on your own initiative based on your own rage at the moment.” That’s never acceptable. Absolutely. Look, I wrote a book a few years ago that touches on some of these points. It’s called “Written Out of History.” It explains the dynamic that occurs when we see history being written by the victors, and it almost always is. Our history books reflect the worldview of those who won certain conflicts. For example, our look back on the American Revolution tends overall to take the view that it was a good thing that we defeated England in the Revolutionary War, and other viewpoints sometimes get suppressed in the process. It is important, just the same, to go back and review historical texts on any topic, on any significant decision, and make sure that we understand both viewpoints. So, as it relates to your specific question and statues, if we tear down every statue of every person whose viewpoints and whose behavior wasn’t always ideal, wasn’t always perfect, or wasn’t always acceptable according to our modern worldview, we’re going to have very few statues to begin with, but we’re also not going to know about many of the historical figures who, for better or for worse, shaped who we are and how we got here. I think it’s a good idea, generally speaking, to have more of a knowledge of more historical figures in our country than it is to have less. I think the single most upsetting aspect of it, other than what I think everyone would agree is the most upsetting part of that, is the loss of human life and the danger to life and limb, once you take it beyond that aspect of this violence, which is the most obvious and widely agreed upon consequence. If you’re looking at the most troubling secondary feature, I would probably say it’s that you’ve got people who consider themselves and are considered by society to be part of polite society, polite, educated society, the educational and corporate establishment of the United States and many government officials who seem to be just fine with this violence and in many cases are defending it, in many cases are applauding it, at least to the degree that they’re saying, “These people make some really good points, and I applaud them for showing how strongly they feel.”Now, look, it’s fine to accept the fact that there are legitimate viewpoints at play, and it’s fine to say that those people who are rioting have a right peaceably to demonstrate, but insofar as anyone in polite society is suggesting that the mob violence is in any way, shape, or form acceptable is what I find so incredibly disturbing and disheartening. We need to have a series of conversations as Americans not just in halls of government, in seats of power, but around the family dinner table, with our friends, our family, our co-workers, our neighbors, even those that we don’t know as well, and we need to start coming together around the fact that regardless of where we might disagree, we should all agree on the fact that mob violence is never acceptable. It’s one of the reasons why I’ve found the rejection of my resolution two weeks ago so incredibly disturbing. My message to those who still would like to tear down monuments and engage in mob violence is that we today live in the greatest civilization the world has ever known. We live in a country that while imperfect, because it consists of human beings, has done more to elevate the human condition, has brought more people out of poverty, has educated more people than any other civilization that I know much about. It’s a country that, while imperfect, has a form of government that was put in place in the Age of Enlightenment and based on principles that, while not universally consistently followed, are themselves inspiring. The idea upon which America is founded was and is good. Insofar as we can unite behind those principles and respect each other’s decency, and dignity, and right to live and exist, we’ll be much better off. Peace is a much better path than violence. Accept peace and let’s move forward. Thank you very much.",1,Questionable,0.1344635565380246,0.4539260768782046,2609,1,Daily Signal
425,Gun Shops Flouted State Closure Orders in April as Industry Notched Another Big Month,-7.0,48.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/05/coronavirus-gun-sales-state-closures-background-checks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-14,16,"Gun stores in several states have defied orders to close their doors as the coronavirus pandemic drives historic demand for firearms, according to background check data maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and interviews with shop owners. Governors of five states — Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington — ordered gun dealers to close in April under statewide stay-at-home directives. But FBI data from April shows that dealers in those states initiated tens of thousands of gun background checks. In Washington State, where gun shops were shuttered by a March 25 stay-at-homeorder, 42,000 checks were initiated in April. Some businesses sell guns in addition to food and other household items that have been deemed essential — Walmart and hardware stores may have firearms departments, for example. At least two of the five states — Michigan and New York — permit these stores to continue selling guns under their orders, which may explain a portion of the checks in the FBI’s data. However, big-box stores typically account for only afractionof all gun sales. And phone calls to more than 50 dedicated gun dealers confirmed that many remained open in defiance of state orders to close. During April, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) processed 2.9 million checks, making it the fourth highest month on record, dating back to 1998. The Trace compared the number of background checks for handguns, long guns, and transactions involving both types of gun with the same figures for 2019. Our analysis found that in some of the states where stores were ordered closed, dealers conducted more checks in April 2020 than during the same month in 2019. In Washington State, for instance, checks increased 45 percent over April 2019, and in New Mexico, they increased 15 percent. In Michigan, checks increased by 112 percent, but at least part of the surge may be attributed to a March 3rulingby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to a spokesperson for the Michigan State Police. That ruling said that firearms dealers cannot accept a Michigan-issued concealed carry permit in lieu of conducting a background check, meaning that gun transfers to permit holders, which were previously not counted in the FBI data, are now included. Anthony Coulson, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who is an expert on the background check system, said the increased gun sales rendered states’ stay-at-home orders “meaningless.”“What’s the motivation for implementing a nonessential order if it’s not going to be enforced and has no impact?” Coulson asked. The two states that didn’t register any year-over-year increase in firearm background checks were New York and Massachusetts. In New York, the number of checks hovered just below normal levels. In Massachusetts, background checks saw a significant year-over-year decrease, falling 66 percent. Store owners offered a litany of reasons they are violating the orders. Some considered them a breach of their Second Amendment rights. Some felt emboldened by a March 28 revision to Department of Homeland Security guidance that deemed the gun industry an essential business during the pandemic. The DHS guidance, which is nonbinding, was heavily pushed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry trade group. Other store owners said they felt that, if they took reasonable precautions, they could operate safely. Still others said they considered their businesses exempt from statewide restrictions.“I would say that I’m supposed to be closed,” said Dennis Brown, who owns Shoreline Tactical, a gun shop in Shoreline, Washington. But with so many stores closed, “people can’t get their guns. So I’ve elected to stay open on an appointment-only basis.”Defiant stores more often than not went unpunished, The Trace found, despite proclamations from several governors that states would mete out harsh penalties to noncompliant businesses of all types. The April background check numbers continue a trend firstspottedby The Trace in early March, when gun store owners along the West Coast saw a surge in Asian-American customers fearful of xenophobic backlash to the virus. By the end of the month, fears of social unrest spread to the general public, driving a historic sales bump. The FBIprocesseda record number of checks in March, outstripping the prior high by 12 percent. As USA TODAY hasreported, the increase has overwhelmed the federal background check system, prompting the FBI to warn gun retailers that screenings could take up to a month to complete. An FBI spokesperson said NICS “remains fully operational and will continue to process requests.”In each of the five states where gun stores were deemed nonessential, The Trace contacted retailers to inquire whether they were open. In Michigan, 15 of 20 stores said that they were open to walk-in customers. The remaining five did not answer their phones. In Washington State, all 10 dealers contacted were also selling guns, but some emphasized that they required customers to schedule appointments to ensure social distancing. In New Mexico, 9 out of 10 dealers contacted were open throughout April; in New York, 4 out of 10 stores contacted said the same. The remaining stores in both states did not answer calls. Only in Massachusetts did most gun stores appear to be closed. Of 20 firearm retailers contacted in the state, only one — in Montague — reported being open. Three others declined to answer questions; the rest did not answer calls. Shawn Brancheau, who runs Guns Galore in Fenton, Michigan, said that he considers his store an essential business even though Governor Gretchen Whitmer has said the opposite.“Home defense needs to be a consideration of the governor at a time like this,” he said, adding that he felt justified staying open because of the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance. He questioned the constitutionality of any order that would require gun stores to close and said local police had already been in his store to shop, and took no action.“Either there is no Second Amendment or you have the right to bear arms,” Brancheau said. Steve Hayes, an owner of Bob’s Gun and Tackle Shop Inc. in Hastings, Michigan, said he understood that state orders superseded the federal guidance, but said Michigan’s order was too ambiguous. A call to the state Attorney General’s Office, he says, provided little clarity.“Local authorities are giving different answers,” he said. “It’s been very confusing for a lot of store owners, and probably for customers, too, when they see one store shut and one store open.”Hayes said he received a written exemption from his local police department allowing him to stay open, but declined to provide a copy of the document. Calls to the Barry County Sheriff’s Department, which has jurisdiction over Hayes’ store, were not returned. Other store owners said their livelihoods depend upon keeping their doors open. Chris Burnett, who operates Kokopelli Pawn and Gun in Aztec, New Mexico, opened his shop just before the coronavirus reached the U. S. He says the New Mexico State Police have visited three times in the last month, instructing him to close his store. On the third visit, troopers fined him $100 and warned him that continued noncompliance could result in a six-month jail sentence. Still, he stayed open. “I just threw everything into my business,” he said. “I have two little girls at home to feed.”Some retailers said that even in states where the closure orders were unambiguous, they had found wiggle room to continue operating. Ryan Blake, who runs High Plains Gun Shop six hours east of Burnett’s store, in Clovis, New Mexico, said his store had been approved to stay open by local authorities.“We’re essentially a department of an essential business since we’re located in a hardware store,” he said. “So we’ve fallen under a gray area.”Likewise, Paul Smith, who runs S&S Gun Sales in Auburn, New York, said he found a loophole in Governor Andrew Cuomo’s order.“We were not originally on the list of essential businesses, but being a single proprietor gun store owner, I realized I could be open when I choose to,” he said. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office, which has the authority to issue exemptions to New Mexico’s stay-at-home order, did not respond to requests for comment. In New York, a spokesperson for the Empire State Development Corporation, which determines which businesses are considered essential under Cuomo’s order, said that gun stores, like all nonessential retail, were permitted to have one person in the shop to fulfill online orders. As USA TODAY hasreported, many states have struck a hard tack on businesses violating stay-at-home orders, threatening fines and criminal charges for those who ignore initial warnings. But noncompliant firearm retailers appear to have largely avoided such penalties outside of New Mexico. A spokesperson for the New Mexico State Police said that six gun dealers there were issued cease-and-desist letters in April. In Michigan, for example, a spokesperson for the state’s Attorney General’s OfficetoldThe Detroit Free Pressthat nonessential businesses could face forced closures and up to 90 days in jail for refusing to comply with the governor’s order. The Michigan State Police recentlycitedan Owosso barber shop for noncompliance, asking it to close or face harsher penalties. But several of the Michigan gun retailers interviewed for this story said that local authorities were aware of their operations and had taken no action. When provided background check data suggesting noncompliance among gun stores in the state, a spokesperson for the Michigan Attorney General’s Office said that enforcement was being handled at the local level. He added: “There has been nothing in Governor Whitmer’s executive orders that has specifically referenced firearm retailers.”In Washington, Governor Jay Insleeoutlineda three-tier penalty system for offending businesses: one violation earned a warning; another led to citations and possible business license revocation; one more could result in criminal charges. But news media reports suggest that few if any Washington State businesses have been hit with severe penalties. The Seattle TimesandKOMO TV Newshave reported on lax enforcement efforts for noncompliant businesses like gyms and construction sites. According to records obtained from the Washington Military Department, which receives complaints about compliance in the state, several gun stores also have continued to operate after allegations of noncompliance. One, Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition, was the subject of more than 20 complaints in the state’s database, all of which alleged large crowds and a lack of enforcement of social distancing requirements. One complainant alleged that they had confronted the store’s proprietor and shown her that gun stores are not essential per the governor’s order. “She asked me to leave,” the complaint reads. A representative from Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition declined to comment. Overall, the Military Department received more than 200 complaints about noncompliant gun stores since the state’s stay-at-home order took effect on March 25th – and more than 100 requests from retailers for exemptions from the order. It’s unclear from the records whether any of those exemptions were granted. In Massachusetts, both the State Police and the Attorney’s General Office directed questions about compliance to the Governor’s Office, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the state’s enforcement efforts. The Massachusetts Department of Health said enforcement was handled by municipalities; spokespeople for police departments in Worcester and Framingham reported that gun stores in those cities were all compliant with the order. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the nation’s gun enforcement agency, said that violations of state and local laws could put dealers’ federal licenses at risk. Applicants must affirm that they are in compliance with local and state laws before licenses are conferred and every three years when licenses are renewed. License status for dealers charged with local offenses, the ATF said, likely would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The National Rifle Association referred questions to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. There, General Counsel Larry Keane said it was “not surprising” that gun sales did not suffer in states where firearms dealers were restricted or prohibited from operating during the health emergency. Keane said that local enforcement of the state executive orders has not been consistent across the states.“In some areas, local sheriffs are not going to force gun shops to close because that’s where law enforcement buys equipment to do the job,” he said. “We are aware that local law enforcement have been advising dealers in some cases not to close because that’s where they are buying ammunition and firearms.”Keane said the foundation has made no effort to advise dealers on actual operations. Rather, he said the group has provided the industry with a running list of orders approved by the state, including the essential business operations recognized in those jurisdictions.“We are not telling people to open; we are not telling people to close,” Keane said. “We’re just providing access to good information.”Christian Heyne, the vice president of policy for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence called gun stores’ disobedience deeply concerning. The United States relies on gun stores, as federally licensed businesses, to follow state and federal guidelines to ensure the safety of communities across the country, he said. “So it is incredibly alarming to think that there are a number of gun dealers that are essentially going rogue.”Meanwhile, the NRA hasvigorouslycondemnedstates that ordered gun retailers to shutter and filed lawsuits against governors inNew MexicoandNew York. MassachusettsandMichiganalso face lawsuits over their orders. As states phase in their reopening plans, the situation for gun sales is rapidly changing. On May 1, New Mexico’s governor said gun stores could reopen on an appointment-only basis. On May 7, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the state’s shutdown of gun stores was unconstitutional. Stores there officially reopened for business on May 9.",3,Reliable,0.0326700959682887,0.3521423355760704,2987,3,The Trace
426,Robinhood Is a Perfect Example of Fintech’s Insidious Power,-9.0,42.0,https://theintercept.com/2021/01/31/fintech-biden-nominees-robinhood/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,25,"This past week,we saw a perfect illustration of financial technology’s power. To spite “hedge fund bros,” retail investorsled a surgein GameStop’s stock price largely through the trading app Robinhood. While progressives relished watching Wall Street’s old guard scramble amid the chaos, fintech firms like Robinhood — apps for lending, investing, and so on — certainly aren’t seeking an end to financial capitalism. Indeed, once Wall Street began shrieking about amateurs beating them at their own absurd game, Robinhoodwarnedagainst the very market volatility it was facilitating, thenshut down tradingof GameStop and other memed stocks, leading to at least oneclass-action lawsuitandSenateandHouse progressivescalling for investigation. Ultimately, it looks like the hedge fund Robinhood users targeted, Melvin Capital Management, willjust be partly boughtby a different, larger hedge fund, Citadel Capital Management. A separate company called Citadel Securities — which has the same owner as Citadel Capital Management, Ken Griffin, therichest man in Illinois— facilitates some of Robinhood’s transactions. Robinhood itself makes money byselling data on users’ trades to giant Wall Street firms, who then stake their own positions based off what the little guy is up to. TheSecurities and Exchange Commissionalso charged Robinhood last month for offering bad trading prices to unsuspecting users, since those trades were routed through firms paying Robinhood. If true, Robinhood’s users were effectively paying a premium on their trades, despite the app marketing itself as “commission free.” This took place between 2015 and late 2018, when Robinhood was growing rapidly, according to the SEC. You wouldn’t know any of this from Robinhood’s faux-populist marketing about “democratizing finance.” But much like traditional Wall Street and Big Tech firms before it, fintech is building an echo chamber of industry voices and former regulators to ease oversight and permit its predatory practices. These range from,as The Intercept and Type Investigations have previously reported, high-interest lending like Best Egg to legitimately novel efforts (at least, in our lifetimes) to privatize and surveil the basic operations of the monetary system. Fintech is neither inherently good nor bad; rather, like any technology, its potential impact on society is closely tied to the policy decisions guiding its use — and the next four years could define how much the fintech industry is able to shape the financial system. Left to their own devices, fintech firms could swindle average people through ill-advised day-trading or high-interest loans, usher new systemic risks into the financial system, and develop traceable, privately owned currencies with the potential to replace cash. Responding to fintech will be a key regulatory challenge for the Biden administration. But it enters this fight with one hand already tied behind their backs. American financial law vastly predates the digital era and is often ill-suited to describing online financial activity. And plenty of fintech firms design themselves to deliberately evade falling under any legal classifications and the regulations that follow them. Michael S. Barr, dean of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, on Aug. 24, 2020. At least threepotential Biden nominees have connections to the financial technology industry. Early reportingin January named Michael Barr as Biden’s favorite to be the next comptroller of the currency, a crucial regulator of national banks. Progressive legislators and organizations (includingthe Revolving Door Projectat the Center for Economic and Policy Research, where the authors of this article work) pushed back, citing Barr’sprevious bank-friendly record in government and his close ties tofintech. Hecurrentlyruns a fintech project at the University of Michigan, works separately with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on fintech, and advises afintech-focused venture capital fund. Barr did not respond to a request for comment. Barr is also anadviserat the Alliance for Innovative Regulation, afintech-fundedthink tank, alongside Georgetown professorChris Brummer, who has been floated as a potential Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair. AIR’s “manifesto” for digital-age regulation argues that we need to overhaul the system — in the opposite direction, with a digital alternative that leaves as little oversight as possible. AIR’s regulatory manifestocallsfor using biometric data in lieu of traditional know your customer requirements, which are the parts of our anti-money laundering regime that require companies to verify that customers are who they say they are when making financial transactions. Brummer did not respond to a request for comment. Elsewhere, AIR calls to throw out or overhaulpractically everything that keeps the regulatory system accountable to the public, such as Freedom of Information Act processes or public comment periods, in favor of surveillance technology. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, which is technically part of the Treasury Department but operates with a great deal of independence, would be positioned to grant this major invasion of individual privacy. The industryclaimsthat biometric data will be far more secure (and cheaper to administer) than traditional anti-money laundering tactics. Lost in the glowing industry press releases is public input into whether people are comfortable having their faces, eyes, fingers, and voices recorded by giant financial companies — and whether the data is stored safely or sold to outside actors. There’s also the question of whether biometric data, once assembled, might be linked to a financial firm’s other activities, most especially lending decisions. Without proper regulations, companies would be able to factor your facial and voice data into its decision to lend to you. Barr also previously advised the fintech firm Ripple, which currently faces a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from theSEC. The SEC is charging that Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP, the third-largest worldwide, is an unregistered security that serves no purpose other than to funnel sales to Ripple. (Bitcoin, by comparison, isn’t produced by a single company, so it cannot be treated as a security; there’s no underlying asset that gains value if Bitcoin prices go up.) Ripple’s CEO was alsointerviewedby Brummer last year as part of “DC Fintech Week,” an annual confab between industry, regulators, and political leaders that Brummer facilitates. In response to the pushback against Barr,The American Prospectreported that the White House is now considering California regulator Manuel Alvarez for the OCC job. Alvarez is even more directly linked to fintech. From 2014 to 2019, he was the chief legal officer at e-lender Affirm, which offers “buy now, pay later” loans at checkout for retail transactions, as well as short-term loans aimed at consumers without credit cards. According toConsumer Reports, Affirm loans can run as high as 30 percent APR. Alvarez now leads California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, sometimes called “the mini Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.” But “innovation” refers to an office specifically set up to communicate with and encourage fintech development in California. Alvarez described the department’s goal toYahoo Financelast week as to “proactively engage with fintech in a non-confrontational manner, but also in a programmatic way so that we can try and … really develop a more holistic picture of innovation in financial services, and then let that inform the rest of the department’s work — let it inform the supervisory work with respect to even existing licensees like our banks and credit unions.”In an email to The Intercept, a spokesperson for Alvarez said that he does not support the idea of letting industry players dictate the terms of regulation. “The DFPI is proud to be leading the nation in developing a regulatory framework that balances consumer protection and responsible financial innovation through expanded enforcement capabilities, a market monitoring arm, increased consumer outreach, and early engagement with innovators,” Alvarez’s statement read. Joe Biden’s administrationwill also have to set itself apart from the Treasury Department under Barack Obama, which actively encouraged private fintech development. Other parts of the federal government built active fintech incubators, like OCC’s Responsible Innovation initiative and the CFPB’s Project Catalyst. Obama’s chief fintech policy adviser wasAdrienne Harris, who is now Barr’s close associate at the University of Michigan and anAIR board member. Harris also founded an online insurance company after leaving the Obama administration. Obama’s OCC comptroller, Thomas Curry (also on theAIR board), introduced a policy initiative called the special purpose bank charter in late 2016. A charter would bring fintech firms under OCC supervision, but grant them the license to operate nationwide as special purpose national banks with their full suite of financial products and no deposit-taking requirements. Such proposals to charter fintechs wouldlimitstates’ regulatory powers andempowerfintech firms to partner up with national banks, potentially furtheringconsolidationof financial services into a handful of too-big-to-fail institutions. Both of Donald Trump’s appointments to the OCCattemptedto implement Curry’s proposal despiteoppositionfrom state banking regulators. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jeff MerkleyopposedCurry’s push and the state of New Yorksuedthe OCC in 2020 after Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks reintroduced the fintech charter. In California, Alvarez has already pushed for other ways for fintech companies to sidestep regulation. A version of the legislation creating the “mini CFPB” thathe helped draft, but which was never enacted,called for the state government to specifically encourage fintechs to register in California as industrial loan companies. This somewhat obscure charter would allow fintechs to take consumer depositswithout being subject to federal banking regulation at all— a workaround to the OCC’s unwillingness to grant them bank charters. Of course, Alvarez could reverse this if appointed to lead the OCC. Alvarez told S&P Global that his support for the industrial bank charters stemmed from an interest in keeping fintech firms based in California. “We cannot compel interested groups to apply in California,”Alvarez wrote, “but we can certainly provide a glidepath.”Finally, shadow banking, or lenders that don’t take deposits and aren’t subject to regulatory oversight, are responsible for over50 percentof the home and personal loan market in the United States. Fintech firms are a major part of this lending boom, representing over aquarterof loan origination in 2015, whileofferingsignificantly higher rates than traditional banks and other shadow banking firms. And the lending gets even more dangerous when cryptocurrencies, famously volatile, are themedium of exchange. While still nascent, this development in fintech activity will soon merit firm and appropriate regulatory responses from the CFPB, the SEC, and other relevant actors. These turf fights over individual aspects of fintech or cryptocurrency are all ultimately proxies for a greater conflict: the “war on cash” and the right to a public, nontraceable currency, including on the internet, said Rohan Grey, a professor at Willamette University College of Law who studies financial technology and the history of money, in an email. “Fintech,” he wrote, is just the newest, brightest, shiniest manifestation of a long struggle over public commerce.“All the debates over ‘fintech,’ once you get beyond the scams and the hype, are really a debate about the future of money,” said Grey. “The recent rise of ‘fintech’ is just the latest saga in a centuries-old struggle between democratic accountability and unaccountable private power, with the latter hiding behind promises of technological innovation.”",3,Reliable,0.0685570386403719,0.4147811046977715,2567,3,The Intercept
427,Kyrsten Sinema Pressure Campaign Goes Up in Arizona,-20.0,40.33,https://prospect.org/politics/kyrsten-sinema-pressure-campaign-goes-up-in-arizona/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-prospect-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,25,"Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP ImagesSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) is under pressure to support filibuster reform in the Senate. Nearly the moment that votes were tallied in Georgia, formalizing Democratic control of the Senate, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin began to object: to $2,000 stimulus checks—which even President Biden himself pledged to pass—to filibuster reform, to the size of the stimulus package, to passing it via budget reconciliation. Manchin, who frequently voted with President Trump, wanted to make it clear that he would be a willing obstacle to the Democratic agenda, according to his own whims and fancies. Just a handful of days later, in a series of media appearances both national and local, Manchin vocalized an openness to checks, to the bigger spending package, and to passing it without Republican support. He even wavered ever so slightly on the filibuster. What changed? A series of radio spots went up in the state, paid for and produced by No Excuses PAC, a group founded by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez alums Corbin Trent and Saikat Chakrabarti and Justice Democrats co-founder Zack Exley. The ads identified Manchin as the obstruction standing between West Virginians and desperately needed relief. PerThe Intercept’s Aída Chávez, Manchin was “getting pounded at home by a brutal radio ad.” And, not inconsequentially, he changed his tune. Now, No Excuses is launching its second pressure campaign, targeting intransigent Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin to showcase her willingness to be an obstacle, and grab some of that spotlight from Manchin as the foremost Democratic opponent of filibuster reform in the Senate. And unlike Manchin, she’s doing it from a purple state Joe Biden won in 2020. The group is up with radio ads across the state of Arizona, informing voters that their senator is one of Washington’s top obstructionists. It hammers Sinema not just on her support of the filibuster, but on the broad embrace of inaction that the filibuster necessitates. “She seems to think the Senate needs to do more talking and less doing,” said Trent, co-founder of the group and the voice-over artist on the ad spot. “Countless hours of partisan bickering and back-and-forth, they don’t prevent one case of COVID, they don’t stop one death, they don’t create one job,” the ad asserts. “It’s time Kyrsten Sinema stood up for the people and stood against the filibuster.”The new ad is part of a multi-week multimedia campaign in Arizona. No Excuses has also taken out ad space in, the state’s largest newspaper, to drive home the message. And this time, the messaging comes with a recruiting pitch: No Excuses is looking for candidates who could primary Sinema from the left when her term is up in 2024. The strategy is a new addition to Democratic politics, where it has not been commonplace to hit representatives back home for their work in Washington outside of an election cycle. While progressive primary challenges have pressured Democrats to move left in the House, the Senate, with its six-year terms, is more sheltered from that threat. No Excuses is hoping this strategy will make the left-wing presence a more persistent one, and help facilitate primary challenges of moderates if need be. “We’ve gotta create a little political gravity on that side of them,” said Trent. Sinema’s stubbornness is especially confounding, at least compared to Manchin, given the respective political contexts of their states. Manchin is one of the only Democrats left at any level in arguably the country’s reddest state, one that has run away from Democrats at an astonishing pace. While Arizona can credibly be called purple, Joe Biden won the state in November, and it now sports Democrats in both of its Senate seats. Arizona’s fast-growing metropolitan areas and large Latino population, combined with significant organizing networks and popular movement groups, mean it’s a state where the progressive agenda has purchase now, and it will likely have even more in the future. The state recently legalized recreational marijuana and passed a substantial taxincreaseon high earners via ballot measure. Sinema won in 2018, a wave election for Democrats, who rebuked Trumpism and overachieved all over the country. She beat extremely unpopular Republican Martha McSally, who went on to lose to Democrat Mark Kelly two years later for the state’s other Senate seat. Sinema, a former Green Party member who then became a conservative Democratic vote in the House, portrayed herself in the campaign as an independent. But the notion that a maverick Democrat can only win in Arizona through a willingness to defy the party’s priorities makes little sense in the current political climate. Most importantly, said Trent, it brings “very little benefit for the people she represents,” which is the message Arizonans are now hearing over the airwaves. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin to showcase her willingness to be an obstacle. In some sense, the No Excuses operation buttresses the Biden administration’s, and helps the president and party enact their agenda. Bidendispatched Vice President Kamala Harristo West Virginia for a media tour and pressure campaign of their own, hoping to drum up public support to sway Manchin. (Harris, who is not popular in West Virginia, did a clumsy job of it, talking about “abandoned land mines” instead of “abandoned mine land” when extending an olive branch to coal country.) If the party had better message discipline or could be counted on to vote the party line as Republicans do, none of this would be necessary. But that’s not the Democratic Party that exists. So far, the inside-outside game seems to be working, at least in a limited fashion. Manchin has not had a total political epiphany. Justyesterday, he did a YouTube live stream where he refused to support ending the filibuster and championed the legacy and reputation of notorious segregationist Robert Byrd as a roundabout way of supporting the Byrd Rule and the filibuster’s broad scope. And he appears to be themain obstacleto increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour within the COVID relief package. But he’s fallen in line on the overall bill, which was in no way a certainty. Even Republican West Virginia governor Jim Justice recently called on him to support the bigger stimulus package. Whether it will be enough to change Sinema’s tune is yet to be seen. But already, frustration is mounting in Arizona. Activist groups made up an important part of the coalition that helped Sinema across the finish line just over two years ago, and they’ve made their displeasure with her stance on the filibuster known. It’s clear that it will be harder for Democrats to hide behind claims of Republican obstruction, when they are well within their abilities to enact meaningful legislation. Doing so immediately is a top priority, given the fragile trifecta Democrats currently sport. With redistricting looming and a fearsome 2022 midterm cycle, inaction would be tantamount to suicide for Joe Biden’s agenda. If Sinema and Manchin, under threat of relentless public pressure, do come around, it will mark another lesson from the mistakes of the Obama years that Democrats seem to be learning, grudgingly.",3,Reliable,0.0795909208545078,0.4610473131940523,1620,2,American Prospect

She packed a lot into her time and the moment became one of the most talked-about of the night. Here’s what she said:Good evening, bienvenidos, and thank you to everyone here today endeavoring toward a better, more just future for our country and our world, in fidelity and gratitude to a mass people’s movement working to establish 21st-century social, economic and human rights, including guaranteed health care, higher education, living wages and labor rights for all people in the United States. A movement striving to recognize and repair the wounds of racial injustice, colonization, misogyny and homophobia. And to propose and build reimagined systems of immigration and foreign policy that turn away from the violence and xenophobia of our past. A movement that realizes the unsustainable brutality of an economy that rewards explosive inequalities of wealth for the few, at the expense of long-term stability for the many. And who organized a historic, grass roots campaign to reclaim our democracy. In a time when millions of people in the United States are looking for deep systemic solutions to our crisis of mass evictions, unemployment, and lack of health care, en el espíritu del pueblo, and out of a love for all people, I hereby second the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont for president of the United States of America. Many applauded AOC for her message, but for those who didn’t know the story behind why she ended her speech by nominating Sanders,Vox explains:Her speech was not an endorsement of Sanders in some ongoing contest with former Vice President Joe Biden, but rather part of standard practice at the DNC, where any candidate who secures enough delegates is eligible to get “nominated” to the party’s ticket. Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks Tuesday evening were a symbolic nomination of Sanders aimed at acknowledging his run and his contributions. While she didn’t mention Biden in her speech, a short time after her remarks, she tweeted:“Congratulations,@JoeBiden– I deeply look forward to fighting for our future together and reclaiming our democracy in November. Thank you@DemConventionfor having me deliver Sen. Sanders’ roll call nomination speech. It’s been an absolute honor.#NotMeUs&#Biden2020″She also tried to clarify the rules. If you were confused, no worries!Convention rules require roll call & nominations for every candidate that passes the delegate threshold. I was asked to 2nd the nom for Sen. Sanders for roll call. I extend my deepest congratulations to@JoeBiden– let’s go win in November. ??— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)August 19, 2020The 30-year-old says this was a case of people not doing their research. NBC News, for one, tweeted out,“In one of the shortest speeches at the DNC, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez did not endorse Biden.”AOC responded saying,“This is completely unacceptable, disappointing, and appalling. The DNC shared the procedural purpose of my remarks to media WELL in advance.@NBCknew what was going to happen & that it was routine. How does a headline that malicious & misleading happen w/ that prior knowledge?”NBC did offer a clarification, but the NY Congresswoman pointed out the damage that had already been done, writing“You waited several hours to correct your obvious and blatantly misleading tweet. It sparked an enormous amount of hatred and vitriol, & now the misinfo you created is circulating on other networks. All to generate hate-clicks from a pre-recorded, routine procedural motion.”Editor's note and clarification (2/2):Ocasio-Cortez was asked by the DNC to second Sanders' nomination.

429,COVID-19 vaccine inequity: Inside the cutthroat race to secure doses,-5.0,46.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/covid-19-vaccine-inequity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"PARIS — No one disputes that the world is unfair. But no one expected a vaccine gap between the global rich and poor that was this bad, this far into the pandemic. Inequity is everywhere: Inoculations go begging in the United States while Haiti, a short plane ride away, received its first delivery July 15 after months of promises — 500,000 doses for a population over 11 million. Canada has procured more than 10 doses for every resident; Sierra Leone’s vaccination rate just cracked 1% on June 20. It’s like a famine in which “the richest guys grab the baker,” said Strive Masiyiwa, the African Union’s envoy for vaccine acquisition. In fact, European and American officials deeply involved in bankrolling and distributing the vaccines against coronavirus have told The Associated Press there was no thought of how to handle the situation globally. Instead, they jostled for their own domestic use. But there are more specific reasons why vaccines have and have not reached the haves and have-nots. COVID-19 unexpectedly devastated wealthy countries first — and some of them were among the few places that make the vaccines. Export restrictions kept the doses within their borders. There was a global purchase plan to provide vaccines for poorer countries, but it was so flawed and underfunded that it couldn’t compete in the cutthroat competition to buy. Intellectual property rights vied with global public health for priority. Rich countries expanded vaccinations to younger and younger people, ignored the repeated pleas of health officials to donate their doses instead and debated booster shots – – even as poor countries couldn’t vaccinate the most susceptible. The disparity was in some ways inevitable; wealthy nations expected a return on their investment of taxpayer money. But the scale of the inequity, the stockpiling of unused vaccines, the lack of a viable global plan to solve a global problem has shocked health officials, though it wasn’t the first time.“This was a deliberate global architecture of unfairness,” Masiyiwa told a Milkin Institute conference.“We have no access to vaccines either as donations or available for us to purchase. Am I surprised? No, because this is where we were with the HIV pandemic. Eight years after therapeutics were available in the West, we did not receive them and we lost 10 million people.”“It’s simple math,” he said. “We have no access. We have no vaccine miracle.”___The World Health Organization has duly updated its epidemic playbook after every outbreak, most recently with Ebola in mind. Then, as often in the decades before, an emerging illness was largely contained to countries lacking robust public health services, with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions and limited travel connections. For years, the WHO assessed countries’ readiness for a flu pandemic: The United States, European countries and even India ranked near the top. The U. S. readiness was 96%, and Britain at 93%. On Jan. 30, 2020, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak in China to be a global emergency. It would be months before the word “pandemic” became official. But that same day, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations, or CEPI, was planning for the worst. CEPI announced “a call for proven vaccine technologies applicable for large scale manufacturing,” according to minutes from its scientific advisory group. CEPI said it would be critical “to support the strategy for global access” early in the game. CEPI quickly invested in two promising coronavirus vaccines being developed by Moderna and CureVac.“We said very early on that it would be important to have a platform where all countries could draw vaccines from, where there’s accountability and transparency,” said Christian Happi, a professor at Nigeria’s Redeemer’s University and a member of CEPI’s scientific advisory committee. “But the whole idea was that we thought rich countries would fund it for the developing world.”Happi said officials never expected the pandemic would strike first and hardest in Europe and the U. S. Or that their assessment of preparedness in the world’s most advanced economies would prove horrifically optimistic. Global health experts would soon come to realize that rich countries “could sign a piece of paper saying they believe in equity, but as soon as the chips are down, they will do whatever they want,” he said. On March 16, five days after WHO first described COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” the novel mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna was injected into a trial participant for the first time. By then, the disease was tearing through the elderly populations of Europe and the United States. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were the first companies to come out with an mRNA vaccine, devising methods of mass production almost on the fly. Scientists at Britain’s Oxford University also came up with a vaccine with a more traditional platform, and Bill Gates brokered a deal for them to partner with AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company with global reach but no experience in vaccine production. On April 30, the deal was confirmed: AstraZeneca took sole responsibility for the global production and distribution of the Oxford vaccine and pledged to sell it for “a few dollars a dose.” Over the next few weeks, the U. S. and Britain secured agreements totaling 400 million doses from AstraZeneca. The race to make and secure vaccines was on, and the United States and Britain were leagues in front of the rest of the world — a lead they wouldn’t lose. Still, both countries would see life expectancy decline by at least a year in 2020, the biggest drop since World War II. In the European Union, 22 countries saw their average lifespans cut short, with Italy leading the list.___But as grim as the situation was, all those countries had a major advantage: They were home to the pharmaceutical companies with the most promising vaccine candidates, the world’s most advanced production facilities, and the money to fund both. On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump announced Operation Warp Speed and promised to deliver vaccines against coronavirus by New Year’s. With unparalleled money and ambition behind the project, Warp Speed head Moncef Slaoui was more confident than his counterparts in Europe that a vaccine was in the offing. He signed contracts almost without regard to price or conditions.“We were frankly focused on getting this as fast as humanly possible. If I had to redo it, I probably should have voiced more of a global dimension,” said Slaoui. “The operation had focused, which was frankly also part of its success, on staying out of the politics and making the vaccines.”The idea of including clauses to ensure that vaccines would go to anyone besides Americans wasn’t even considered. At the same time, the U. S. repeatedly invoked the Defense Production Act — 18 times under the Trump Administration and at least once under Biden. The moves barred exports of crucial raw materials as factories were ramping up production of the as-yet-unapproved vaccines — and eventually, of the vaccines themselves. But it also meant those materials would run low in much of the rest of the world. The U. S. stranglehold would lift only in spring 2021, and only partially. Operation Warp Speed supercharged the global race to secure vaccines, but it would still take another two weeks until COVAX — the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility — was formally announced as the entity to ensure equity, with the Serum Institute of India as the core supplier for the developing world. COVAX had the backing of the World Health Organization, CEPI, vaccines alliance Gavi and the powerful Gates Foundation. What it did not have was cash, and without cash it could secure no contracts.“Operation Warp Speed signed the first public deals and that started a chain reaction,” said Gian Gandhi, UNICEF’s COVAX coordinator for supply. “It was a like a rush on the banks, but to buy up the expected supply.”Some involved in the COVAX project flagged India as a potential problem early on, according to minutes of meetings in late spring and early summer of 2020. India’s government had blocked exports of protective gear, but many global health authorities who hadn’t fully grasped the extent of pandemic nationalism found it unimaginable that the country would block vaccines when the world was counting on them. Also, India had so far been spared the waves of death that were sweeping across Europe and the Americas. A separate plan put forward by the government of Costa Rica and the World Health Organization to create a technology-sharing platform to expand vaccine production foundered. Not a single company agreed to share its blueprints, even for a fee — and no government pushed them behind the scenes, according to multiple people involved in the project. On the global scale, the one organization that could have pushed for more technology sharing was the Gates Foundation, whose money to WHO nearly matches that of the U. S. government. Instead, Bill Gates defended stringent intellectual property rights as the best way to speed innovation. His foundation poured money and influence into the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which also failed to generate the money or influence needed to ramp up production outside already existing hubs. In the United States, meanwhile, manufacturing and the trials went on in parallel, which is where taxpayers and the companies took enormous risks that paid off for both. But in retrospect, Slaoui said, given the sheer amount of taxpayer money involved, each time they signed new contracts the U. S. and other countries could have pushed companies harder to share their knowledge, if only for the duration of the pandemic.“From a geopolitical standpoint, it’s critical that they do that,” he said. Nowhere was the situation more dire than Africa. In February, WHO’s African expert in vaccine development, Richard Mihigo, was among many who said the continent’s experience with other pandemics had uniquely prepared it for a complex vaccine deployment. Five months later, contemplating the plight of a continent that gets 99% of its vaccines from abroad, Mihigo adds a rueful footnote: “One of the lessons we learned from this pandemic is how badly prepared we were in vaccine production in the region and how dependent we were on imports.”Those imports have only barely begun to materialize — and they are insufficient to meet even the limited goals of the COVAX initiative to vaccinate at least 20% of the population of 92 low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year.___From the start, the coalition of organizations that created COVAX found themselves fighting the last war. The plan was designed as an international pool to spur demand for vaccines and treatment of diseases with a relatively small global footprint, said Winnie Byanyima, head of UNAIDS. Something like Ebola. But the coronavirus pandemic looked nothing like an Ebola outbreak.“That itself was a structural weakness,” she said. Although the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had between them set aside billions for vaccinating the developing world, that money was intended to go to countries and was out of bounds for a global vaccine sharing plan like COVAX, said Mike Muldoon, managing director for innovative finance at the Rockefeller Foundation. Meanwhile, governments competed to secure contracts for vaccines by the hundreds of millions. On Dec. 8, Britain became the first country to formally authorize a start to widespread vaccinations, injecting 90-year-old Margaret Keenan with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Six days later, the United States started its own vaccinations. And on Dec. 26, the EU followed suit. China and Russia had been vaccinating even before releasing data from their homegrown inoculations. The Western companies with the most promising doses, including Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, had by then been churning out vials for months before formal approval, based on pledges from the wealthy countries that an enormous market awaited. Those doses were stockpiled in Europe and North America and a small number of countries, like Israel, that paid a premium. COVAX pleaded for cash to do the same. Instead, it got pledges.“As time passed and it became clear which vaccine candidates were going to be the leading contenders and which were most likely to succeed, the governments that had resources went and bought the supplies,” CEPI chief executive Dr. Richard Hatchett told the AP. “COVAX was not in a position to do that.”Months later, when COVAX finally had the money to sign deals for global supplies, Hatchett acknowledged they were at the end of the line. The lack of capital available to vaccine makers to boost their capacity outside the small number of existing manufacturing hubs was also “a lost opportunity,” Hatchett said.“We approached the international financing institutions, including the World Bank and the (International Finance Corporation) about making those investments and they were not willing to do that,” he said. CEPI ended up investing about $1.5 billion, far less than what a major financial institution might have been able to commit. COVAX missed its own goal of beginning vaccinations in poor countries at the same time as rich ones. It finally delivered vaccines on Feb. 24, to Ghana, a load of 600,000 AstraZeneca doses manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and transported by UNICEF planes. By that date, 27% of the population in Britain had been vaccinated, 13% in the U. S., 5% in Europe — and 0.23% in Africa, in countries that had secured their own bilateral deals after growing impatient with COVAX delays. The rift was growing by millions of doses every day. And pharmaceutical plants were beginning to crumble under the promises they’d made. AstraZeneca announced repeated delivery cuts to Europe. Pfizer’s production briefly slowed. A fire at a Serum Institute construction site prompted a letter to Brazil warning that “supply to you cannot be guaranteed in the foreseeable months.” Moderna supply cuts soon followed to Britain and Canada. In the United States, officials tossed millions of corrupted doses of vaccine from the Emergent Biosolutions plant in Baltimore after discovering that workers had inadvertently blended ingredients from the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. An untold number of doses were never produced because of new restrictions meant to prevent errors. Many of those vaccines were intended for export. So COVAX had to hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine being produced in India would come through, because it had secured few of the innovative mRNA doses that are now considered the most effective against the coronavirus variants. The initial refrigeration requirements were daunting, and the price was higher than the traditional vaccine candidates. The mRNA vaccines are widely considered a scientific and manufacturing triumph — and a risky bet. Never before approved for use against any disease, they are now considered a hugely promising medical innovation and a potential gamechanger against infection. But by the time it was clear the mRNA doses were a viable alternative, even in poor countries with limited cold chain, the available supply had been snapped up in Europe, the United States and Canada. And India, in the throes of its own COVID-19 surge, diverted its vaccines for its own use. According to the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a grouping of human rights organizations advocating for broader sharing of vaccines and their underlying technology, the coronavirus has created nine new billionaires. The top six are linked to the successful mRNA vaccines. For Byanyima, of UNAIDS, this is a travesty and a sign that the world has learned little in the decades since the AIDS pandemic was brought under control in the United States, only to kill millions in Africa because treatments were unaffordable: “Medicines should be a global public good, not just like a luxury handbag you buy on the market.”COVAX has delivered only 107 million doses, and now is forced to rely upon uncertain donations from countries that may prefer to donate directly to the needy, so they can receive the credit. A readout from its June board meeting slipped in an acknowledgement that it needed to better interpret and respond to market conditions and “the reality that a higher risk appetite is needed in a pandemic setting.”___For the pharmaceutical industry, mRNA is the ultimate confirmation that hard work and risk-taking is rewarded. And those companies keep tight hold on the keys to their successful vaccines. When Moderna and Pfizer created new production lines, it was in the insular European and American manufacturing networks that had as much stake as anyone in both ensuring that the injections meet the highest standards and keeping promises not to abuse intellectual property. Many public health officials have pushed for technology transfer during the pandemic. Initially resistant, the Gates Foundation has changed its position in favor of sharing. Dr. Clemence Auer, the EU’s lead negotiator for vaccine contracts last summer, said the question of compelling pharmaceutical companies to suspend their vaccine intellectual property rights to increase the worldwide supply of coronavirus vaccines never even came up.“We had a mandate to buy vaccines, not to talk about intellectual property, ” Auer said.“The global community should have had this discussion back in 2020 but that didn’t happen,” he said. “Maybe we should have done it last year, but now it’s too late. It is spilled milk.”CEPI includes equity clauses in the vaccines that it invests in, among them the successful Moderna candidate, but has yet to invoke them during the pandemic. Some include requirements to make a vaccine available to populations in need at affordable prices, as is the case in CEPI’s Moderna contract. But Moderna was first available exclusively in wealthy countries and even now only limited amounts are going outside Europe and the United States. A separate push to lift intellectual property restrictions on vaccines and medicines has also gone nowhere in the World Trade Organization. And WHO is reticent to criticize donor nations or the pharmaceutical companies. The U. N. health agency works by consensus and needs them for other aspects of global health — and for its own continued existence. The Biden administration has reversed Trump’s decision to defund and leave WHO, but the damage has been done.“A lot of these multinational organizations, these plans, these coalitions, they don’t have teeth to enforce what they think is a fair and equitable way to distribute resources,” said Dr. Ingrid Katz, an infectious disease researcher at the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. She said the key question is whether vaccines and essential medications are a commodity or a right.“If it’s going to be a commodity, we’re going to keep walking down this road every time we have something like this,” she said. And if it is all going to rely on the generosity of rich countries, a lot of people are going to die. Four million have died already. In all, at the recent Group of Seven meeting of wealthy nations pledged to donate 850 million doses, compared with the 11 billion that WHO says will be needed to end the pandemic. A close look at the G-7 promises of donations shows that most aren’t expected to be delivered until well into 2022. The Biden administration fell short on its pledge to send 80 million doses abroad by the end of June: By mid-July, at least 44 million doses had been sent, including 2.5 million to Canada, which has already given at least one vaccine dose to more of its population than any other country. Africa has yet to receive its doses from the United States.___Oceans away from the deprivation of the developing world, 7-year-old Russell Bright and his 5-year-old brother went to Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans to get their shots — part of a trial for young children. Maybe they got the vaccine; maybe they got the placebo. Wearing a Spider-Man mask, Russell said he longs for a vacation trip to the water park and then a return to school without having to wear masks and stay at arms’ length from his friends.“Both me and my wife are already vaccinated,” said his father, Adam, “and so the sooner I can get them vaccinated and to feel comfortable being outside, not having to wear a mask, I thought the easiest way to get it is to go through the trial.”Scientists agree that children are at low risk from COVID-19. But that hasn’t stopped richer countries from stockpiling precious vaccine supplies to inoculate the young, even as poor countries have few or no shots to give. A recent meeting of WHO’s vaccine allocation group disbanded with nothing accomplished, because there was no vaccine to allocate. “Zero doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, zero doses of Pfizer vaccine, zero doses of J&J vaccine,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior advisor at the organization.“Every single one of our suppliers is unable to supply during this period because others are making demands on those products, others who are vaccinating very young populations that are not at risk,” Aylward said. Both Trump and Biden administration officials reject the notion that the U. S. or any country would share vaccines until they’d protected their own. And they both note that the U. S. bore the brunt of the pandemic last year, topping the world in confirmed cases and deaths.“We had a responsibility to what I say, ‘put on our own oxygen masks before helping others,’” CDC Director Rachelle Walensky said in May. But a plummeting jet takes all passengers with it, whether or not they are wearing masks. And the failure to provide vaccines across the globe ensures that COVID-19 will continue to spread, and mutate, and sicken, and kill.“It speaks volumes about where we are as a globe when you have the source of decision-making sitting with very few people who have a lot of wealth and are essentially making life and death decisions for the rest of the globe,” Mass General’s Katz said. “Every month that we lost put us further and further behind.”___Maria Cheng reported from London, and Aniruddha Ghosal from New Delhi.

Arrest warrants issued Aug. 26 led to the arrests of Antwane Moseley, 39, and Taunisha Whyte, 27, both of Las Vegas. Las Vegas police said they were called at 2:34 a.m. Aug. 15 to an apartment complex on the 4900 block of Dean Martin Drive. A woman told police she was pistol-whipped, beaten, choked and sexually assaulted by Moseley because she refused his demands to work as a prostitute.“Moseley wanted her to go out onto Tropicana Boulevard and work as a prostitute for him to make money so he could pay the hotel, get his items out of pawn and have money to spend,” police wrote in the warrants. The woman said she was punched, beaten with a phone and choked to the point of unconsciousness. She accused Whyte of punching and biting her, then participating in efforts to keep her from leaving. She escaped when her assailants fell asleep. Police were called when a security officer found the partially clothed woman running through the complex and yelling for help. Las Vegas Justice Court records show Moseley is charged with seven felonies, including sex assault, kidnapping, sex trafficking of an adult, conspiracy, battery by strangulation and domestic battery. Whyte is charged with sex trafficking of an adult, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and first-degree kidnapping. Both suspects are scheduled to appear Sept. 10 in Las Vegas Justice Court.

432,"Americans say schools are less safe since Columbine, despite data",-0.33,43.67,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2019/0417/Americans-say-schools-are-less-safe-since-Columbine-despite-data,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,25,"The deadly attack at Columbine High School in 1999 seemed to usher in a new era of school shootings. Two decades later, polls consistently capture growing fears among American parents that their children face imminent danger whenever they go to school. Those fears have only intensified since attacks at an elementary school in 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut, and last year at a high school in Parkland, Florida. In the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, some research suggests that gun violence is a near-daily experience at schools. Other studies indicate that deaths from school violence have actually declined since 1991. A March survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a majority of Americans believe schools and colleges, along with places of worship, have become less safe compared with 20 years ago. Wide shares of Americans also believe parents, the internet, and news coverage of similar attacks are at least partly to blame for school shootings. About 2 in 10 parents are not at all confident or not very confident in their child's safety while at school. About a third of parents are very confident or extremely confident, according to the poll. But fewer Americans put blame for shootings on schools themselves. According to data compiled by Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, who has been researching gun violence for decades, school shootings were more frequent in the 1990s than today. From 1991 until the Columbine shooting, an average of 19 fatal school shootings happened each year, with about 22 people killed. In contrast, over the past eight years, an average of about six fatal school shootings happened each year, with about 14 killed.""First of all, schools are safe, and if you consider the over 50 million schoolchildren and the over 100,000 schools that we have, the risk of a student or a faculty member being killed by gunfire, it's extremely low,"" Mr. Fox told AP. ""The one-homicide-is-too-many mantra is quite true. Yet when you do the calculations, the probability is very small.""Other data, such as that compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety, captures a broader spectrum of gun-related violence, including non-fatal shootings and drive-by shootings in which the perpetrators do not have a direct connection to the school. That research paints a different picture that suggests gun violence – from random gunfire to suicides – is a frequent occurrence. Everytown, which began tracking school shootings after Newtown, notes that attacks such as those at Sandy Hook Elementary School and Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School are not commonplace and represent less than 1 percent of the school gun-violence incidents. Mr. Fox chalks much of it up to the attention such crimes receive in the news. A generation ago, there were many fewer cable TV news channels and websites covering the events 24 hours a day. One school shooting he cites happened in 1989, when a gunman killed five elementary school students and wounded 32. The shooting in Stockton, California, is barely remembered. Columbine was among the mass shootings in recent decades that sparked the ""No Notoriety"" movement, an appeal by both gun-control and gun-rights activists to avoid repeated reporting of the names and biographic details of gunmen. They hope denying attention to the attackers prevents inspiring a new crop of future shooters. The early 1990s were plagued by a high homicide rate overall around the country, and that's reflected in school shootings. Many of the attacks in that decade were gang-related. Gang warfare spilled out from the streets into the halls of the schools, but those shootings ""were not the type of events that got a lot of attention, except for locally,"" Mr. Fox said. In more recent years, most school shootings are either related to perceived bullying or to reasons that cannot be definitively explained. The Columbine shooters still retain influence. Peter Langman, an expert on the psychology of school shooters, has found more than 30 other rampage attacks, from California to Germany, have been inspired in some manner by Columbine.

The Reformed Christian leaderwroteabout the “sins that destroy people” through the “deadly influences of a leader,” arguing faithful Christian voters shouldn’t only be concerned about abortion, but should also stand against “the culture-infecting spread of the gangrene of sinful self-exaltation, and boasting, and strife-stirring.”Piper did not name specific presidential candidates or parties, but then heclarifiedonline: He would not be voting for either Joe Biden or Donald Trump. Though he hadcalledthe president “morally unfit” in 2017, Piper isn’t in the habit of speaking out about politics or political candidates. His Twitter feedin recent months is almost entirely Bible quotes and Bible commentary. He’s mentioned Trump just a few times in the past couple years, mostly to pray for him in accordance to Scripture. So it was, in the words of Liberty University spokesman Scott Lamb, “an unfortunate coincidence in timing” that Piper’s contentious reflection on the 2020 election came out a day after he spoke at the Christian college’s weekly convocation. Two videos of a discussion with Piper and Southern Baptist Convention president J. D. Greear were removed from Liberty’s social media and its convocation page at the direction of interim president Jerry Prevo. Prevo cited negative feedback and the controversy surrounding Piper’s article, Lamb said. The now-pulled convocation session was not politically themed. This year marks the 20th anniversary of Piper’s famous sermon “Don’t Waste Your Life” (alsoknown asthe seashells message). He teamed up with Greear, whose new book asks, to challenge a new generation with a message about living faithful and missional lives. The pair recorded the session with pastor David Nasser, the senior vice president for spiritual development at Liberty, on October 12. The two-part discussion aired October 21 and 23. Comments on Facebook posts promoting the Piper-Greear convocation appeared to be directed at both speakers. One Trump supporter called out “Calvinist heresy!” while several commenters decried “wokeness” and a “social justice agenda.”Lamb said the feedback over Piper was “a controversy we did not seek out or desire” and came from “both those who would praise us for having him [and] those who would critique us from having him.” He said that it is possible the clips will be restored once the heat of the election season has died down. Greear said in a statement to CT that he was “disappointed” in the decision to remove the video.“The sole purpose of our conversation was tochallenge Liberty studentsto consider how God wanted to use their lives in the Great Commission,” he said. “As followers of Jesus, mobilizing ourselves for the Great Commission is the most important thing for us to do, and our commitment to Jesus and his mission is something we can all be unified around.”The school’s most recent convocation was an election-themed discussion with Republican Senator Ted Cruz and evangelist Tim Lee, a Liberty trustee and an outspoken advocate for Trump. Itaired Fridayand is still available online. Liberty’s former president Jerry Falwell Jr. was famously friends with Trump, who visited the school as a candidate in 2016 and returned to offer its commencement address as president the following year. The university, which touts its convocation as the largest weekly gathering of Christian students, has hosted politicians from both parties, including Bernie Sanders during his primary run and former President Jimmy Carter, who spoke at commencement in 2018. Under Falwell, the university became home to the Falkirk Center, a think tank formed in partnership with conservative political activist Charlie Kirk. The Turning Point USA founderrecently criticizedPiper while speaking at a Tennessee church, saying the pastor has “no idea what he is talking about politically” and “he should stay out of this space, because he is a fool when it comes to this stuff.”“So to Kirk, the preacher must stay out of politics, but the politician and his pundit can wade neck-deep into the church,”wroteMatthew Boedy, professor of rhetoric at the University of North Georgia. “Now that is some theology. And some political power.”In his post, Piper twice wrote his stance was not prescriptive for all Christians (“my way need not be yours”), though it was the perspective that swayed him the most this election. His position was also misread by some “Never Trump” evangelicals who are campaigning for Biden this election. A group called Christians Against Trumpismran an adin thethanking Piper among other Christian voices who stood up against the president. Piper objected to the political use of his name, saying he had had not signed on to the statement. His refusal to vote for either major party candidate puts him in the minority among evangelicals. According toLifeWay Research, only 2 percent of evangelicals are backing a third-party candidate in 2020, compared to 8 percent four years ago. While abortion ranks among the top political priorities for evangelical voters, evangelicals are less than half as likely as Americans on average to say the president’s personal character is a deciding factor.",3,Reliable,0.0493234584652495,0.3356663651439772,1132,3,Christianity Today
436,The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election,-3.0,53.33,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,25,"A weird thing happened right after the Nov. 3 election: nothing. The nation was braced for chaos. Liberal groups had vowed to take to the streets, planning hundreds of protests across the country. Right-wing militias were girding for battle. In a poll before Election Day, 75% of Americans voiced concern about violence. Instead, an eerie quiet descended. As President Trump refused to concede, the response was not mass action but crickets. When media organizations called the race for Joe Biden on Nov. 7, jubilation broke out instead, as people thronged cities across the U. S. to celebrate the democratic process that resulted in Trump’s ouster. A second odd thing happened amid Trump’s attempts to reverse the result: corporate America turned on him. Hundreds of major business leaders, many of whom had backed Trump’s candidacy and supported his policies, called on him to concede. To the President, something felt amiss. “It was all very, very strange,” Trump said on Dec. 2. “Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint the winner, even while many key states were still being counted.”In a way, Trump was right. There was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes, one that both curtailed the protests and coordinated the resistance from CEOs. Both surprises were the result of an informal alliance between left-wing activists and business titans. The pact was formalized in a terse, little-noticed joint statement of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day. Both sides would come to see it as a sort of implicit bargain–inspired by the summer’s massive, sometimes destructive racial-justice protests–in which the forces of labor came together with the forces of capital to keep the peace and oppose Trump’s assault on democracy. The handshake between business and labor was just one component of a vast, cross-partisan campaign to protect the election–an extraordinary shadow effort dedicated not to winning the vote but to ensuring it would be free and fair, credible and uncorrupted. For more than a year, a loosely organized coalition of operatives scrambled to shore up America’s institutions as they came under simultaneous attack from a remorseless pandemic and an autocratically inclined President. Though much of this activity took place on the left, it was separate from the Biden campaign and crossed ideological lines, with crucial contributions by nonpartisan and conservative actors. The scenario the shadow campaigners were desperate to stop was not a Trump victory. It was an election so calamitous that no result could be discerned at all, a failure of the central act of democratic self-governance that has been a hallmark of America since its founding. Their work touched every aspect of the election. They got states to change voting systems and laws and helped secure hundreds of millions in public and private funding. They fended off voter-suppression lawsuits, recruited armies of poll workers and got millions of people to vote by mail for the first time. They successfully pressured social media companies to take a harder line against disinformation and used data-driven strategies to fight viral smears. They executed national public-awareness campaigns that helped Americans understand how the vote count would unfold over days or weeks, preventing Trump’s conspiracy theories and false claims of victory from getting more traction. After Election Day, they monitored every pressure point to ensure that Trump could not overturn the result. “The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation,” says Norm Eisen, a prominent lawyer and former Obama Administration official who recruited Republicans and Democrats to the board of the Voter Protection Program. For Trump and his allies were running their own campaign to spoil the election. The President spent months insisting that mail ballots were a Democratic plot and the election would be “rigged.” His henchmen at the state level sought to block their use, while his lawyers brought dozens of spurious suits to make it more difficult to vote–an intensification of the GOP’s legacy of suppressive tactics. Before the election, Trump plotted to block a legitimate vote count. And he spent the months following Nov. 3 trying to steal the election he’d lost–with lawsuits and conspiracy theories, pressure on state and local officials, and finally summoning his army of supporters to the Jan. 6 rally that ended in deadly violence at the Capitol. The democracy campaigners watched with alarm. “Every week, we felt like we were in a struggle to try to pull off this election without the country going through a real dangerous moment of unraveling,” says former GOP Representative Zach Wamp, a Trump supporter who helped coordinate a bipartisan election-protection council. “We can look back and say this thing went pretty well, but it was not at all clear in September and October that that was going to be the case.”This is the inside story of the conspiracy to save the 2020 election, based on access to the group’s inner workings, never-before-seen documents and interviews with dozens of those involved from across the political spectrum. It is the story of an unprecedented, creative and determined campaign whose success also reveals how close the nation came to disaster. “Every attempt to interfere with the proper outcome of the election was defeated,” says Ian Bassin, co-founder of Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan rule-of-law advocacy group. “But it’s massively important for the country to understand that it didn’t happen accidentally. The system didn’t work magically. Democracy is not self-executing.”That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream–a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it. And they believe the public needs to understand the system’s fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures. Sometime in the fall of 2019, Mike Podhorzer became convinced the election was headed for disaster–and determined to protect it. This was not his usual purview. For nearly a quarter-century, Podhorzer, senior adviser to the president of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest union federation, has marshaled the latest tactics and data to help its favored candidates win elections. Unassuming and professorial, he isn’t the sort of hair-gelled “political strategist” who shows up on cable news. Among Democratic insiders, he’s known as the wizard behind some of the biggest advances in political technology in recent decades. A group of liberal strategists he brought together in the early 2000s led to the creation of the Analyst Institute, a secretive firm that applies scientific methods to political campaigns. He was also involved in the founding of Catalist, the flagship progressive data company. The endless chatter in Washington about “political strategy,” Podhorzer believes, has little to do with how change really gets made. “My basic take on politics is that it’s all pretty obvious if you don’t overthink it or swallow the prevailing frameworks whole,” he once wrote. “After that, just relentlessly identify your assumptions and challenge them.” Podhorzer applies that approach to everything: when he coached his now adult son’s Little League team in the D. C. suburbs, he trained the boys not to swing at most pitches–a tactic that infuriated both their and their opponents’ parents, but won the team a series of championships. Trump’s election in 2016–credited in part to his unusual strength among the sort of blue collar white voters who once dominated the AFL-CIO–prompted Podhorzer to question his assumptions about voter behavior. He began circulating weekly number-crunching memos to a small circle of allies and hosting strategy sessions in D. C. But when he began to worry about the election itself, he didn’t want to seem paranoid. It was only after months of research that he introduced his concerns in his newsletter in October 2019. The usual tools of data, analytics and polling would not be sufficient in a situation where the President himself was trying to disrupt the election, he wrote. “Most of our planning takes us through Election Day,” he noted. “But, we are not prepared for the two most likely outcomes”–Trump losing and refusing to concede, and Trump winning the Electoral College (despite losing the popular vote) by corrupting the voting process in key states. “We desperately need to systematically ‘red-team’ this election so that we can anticipate and plan for the worst we know will be coming our way.”It turned out Podhorzer wasn’t the only one thinking in these terms. He began to hear from others eager to join forces. The Fight Back Table, a coalition of “resistance” organizations, had begun scenario-planning around the potential for a contested election, gathering liberal activists at the local and national level into what they called the Democracy Defense Coalition. Voting-rights and civil rights organizations were raising alarms. A group of former elected officials was researching emergency powers they feared Trump might exploit. Protect Democracy was assembling a bipartisan election-crisis task force. “It turned out that once you said it out loud, people agreed,” Podhorzer says, “and it started building momentum.”He spent months pondering scenarios and talking to experts. It wasn’t hard to find liberals who saw Trump as a dangerous dictator, but Podhorzer was careful to steer clear of hysteria. What he wanted to know was not how American democracy was dying but how it might be kept alive. The chief difference between the U. S. and countries that lost their grip on democracy, he concluded, was that America’s decentralized election system couldn’t be rigged in one fell swoop. That presented an opportunity to shore it up. On March 3, Podhorzer drafted a three-page confidential memo titled “Threats to the 2020 Election.” “Trump has made it clear that this will not be a fair election, and that he will reject anything but his own re-election as ‘fake’ and rigged,” he wrote. “On Nov. 3, should the media report otherwise, he will use the right-wing information system to establish his narrative and incite his supporters to protest.” The memo laid out four categories of challenges: attacks on voters, attacks on election administration, attacks on Trump’s political opponents and “efforts to reverse the results of the election.”Then COVID-19 erupted at the height of the primary-election season. Normal methods of voting were no longer safe for voters or the mostly elderly volunteers who normally staff polling places. But political disagreements, intensified by Trump’s crusade against mail voting, prevented some states from making it easier to vote absentee and for jurisdictions to count those votes in a timely manner. Chaos ensued. Ohio shut down in-person voting for its primary, leading to minuscule turnout. A poll-worker shortage in Milwaukee–where Wisconsin’s heavily Democratic Black population is concentrated–left just five open polling places, down from 182. In New York, vote counting took more than a month. Suddenly, the potential for a November meltdown was obvious. In his apartment in the D. C. suburbs, Podhorzer began working from his laptop at his kitchen table, holding back-to-back Zoom meetings for hours a day with his network of contacts across the progressive universe: the labor movement; the institutional left, like Planned Parenthood and Greenpeace; resistance groups like Indivisible and MoveOn; progressive data geeks and strategists, representatives of donors and foundations, state-level grassroots organizers, racial-justice activists and others. In April, Podhorzer began hosting a weekly 2½-hour Zoom. It was structured around a series of rapid-fire five-minute presentations on everything from which ads were working to messaging to legal strategy. The invitation-only gatherings soon attracted hundreds, creating a rare shared base of knowledge for the fractious progressive movement. “At the risk of talking trash about the left, there’s not a lot of good information sharing,” says Anat Shenker-Osorio, a close Podhorzer friend whose poll-tested messaging guidance shaped the group’s approach. “There’s a lot of not-invented-here syndrome, where people won’t consider a good idea if they didn’t come up with it.”The meetings became the galactic center for a constellation of operatives across the left who shared overlapping goals but didn’t usually work in concert. The group had no name, no leaders and no hierarchy, but it kept the disparate actors in sync. “Pod played a critical behind-the-scenes role in keeping different pieces of the movement infrastructure in communication and aligned,” says Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party. “You have the litigation space, the organizing space, the political people just focused on the W, and their strategies aren’t always aligned. He allowed this ecosystem to work together.”Protecting the election would require an effort of unprecedented scale. As 2020 progressed, it stretched to Congress, Silicon Valley and the nation’s statehouses. It drew energy from the summer’s racial-justice protests, many of whose leaders were a key part of the liberal alliance. And eventually it reached across the aisle, into the world of Trump-skeptical Republicans appalled by his attacks on democracy. The first task was overhauling America’s balky election infrastructure–in the middle of a pandemic. For the thousands of local, mostly nonpartisan officials who administer elections, the most urgent need was money. They needed protective equipment like masks, gloves and hand sanitizer. They needed to pay for postcards letting people know they could vote absentee–or, in some states, to mail ballots to every voter. They needed additional staff and scanners to process ballots. In March, activists appealed to Congress to steer COVID relief money to election administration. Led by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, more than 150 organizations signed a letter to every member of Congress seeking $2 billion in election funding. It was somewhat successful: the CARES Act, passed later that month, contained $400 million in grants to state election administrators. But the next tranche of relief funding didn’t add to that number. It wasn’t going to be enough. Private philanthropy stepped into the breach. An assortment of foundations contributed tens of millions in election-administration funding. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative chipped in $300 million. “It was a failure at the federal level that 2,500 local election officials were forced to apply for philanthropic grants to fill their needs,” says Amber McReynolds, a former Denver election official who heads the nonpartisan National Vote at Home Institute. McReynolds’ two-year-old organization became a clearinghouse for a nation struggling to adapt. The institute gave secretaries of state from both parties technical advice on everything from which vendors to use to how to locate drop boxes. Local officials are the most trusted sources of election information, but few can afford a press secretary, so the institute distributed communications tool kits. In a presentation to Podhorzer’s group, McReynolds detailed the importance of absentee ballots for shortening lines at polling places and preventing an election crisis. The institute’s work helped 37 states and D. C. bolster mail voting. But it wouldn’t be worth much if people didn’t take advantage. Part of the challenge was logistical: each state has different rules for when and how ballots should be requested and returned. The Voter Participation Center, which in a normal year would have supported local groups deploying canvassers door-to-door to get out the vote, instead conducted focus groups in April and May to find out what would get people to vote by mail. In August and September, it sent ballot applications to 15 million people in key states, 4.6 million of whom returned them. In mailings and digital ads, the group urged people not to wait for Election Day. “All the work we have done for 17 years was built for this moment of bringing democracy to people’s doorsteps,” says Tom Lopach, the center’s CEO. The effort had to overcome heightened skepticism in some communities. Many Black voters preferred to exercise their franchise in person or didn’t trust the mail. National civil rights groups worked with local organizations to get the word out that this was the best way to ensure one’s vote was counted. In Philadelphia, for example, advocates distributed “voting safety kits” containing masks, hand sanitizer and informational brochures. “We had to get the message out that this is safe, reliable, and you can trust it,” says Hannah Fried of All Voting Is Local. At the same time, Democratic lawyers battled a historic tide of pre-election litigation. The pandemic intensified the parties’ usual tangling in the courts. But the lawyers noticed something else as well. “The litigation brought by the Trump campaign, of a piece with the broader campaign to sow doubt about mail voting, was making novel claims and using theories no court has ever accepted,” says Wendy Weiser, a voting-rights expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. “They read more like lawsuits designed to send a message rather than achieve a legal outcome.”In the end, nearly half the electorate cast ballots by mail in 2020, practically a revolution in how people vote. About a quarter voted early in person. Only a quarter of voters cast their ballots the traditional way: in person on Election Day. Bad actors spreading false information is nothing new. For decades, campaigns have grappled with everything from anonymous calls claiming the election has been rescheduled to fliers spreading nasty smears about candidates’ families. But Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories, the viral force of social media and the involvement of foreign meddlers made disinformation a broader, deeper threat to the 2020 vote. Laura Quinn, a veteran progressive operative who co-founded Catalist, began studying this problem a few years ago. She piloted a nameless, secret project, which she has never before publicly discussed, that tracked disinformation online and tried to figure out how to combat it. One component was tracking dangerous lies that might otherwise spread unnoticed. Researchers then provided information to campaigners or the media to track down the sources and expose them. The most important takeaway from Quinn’s research, however, was that engaging with toxic content only made it worse. “When you get attacked, the instinct is to push back, call it out, say, ‘This isn’t true,'” Quinn says. “But the more engagement something gets, the more the platforms boost it. The algorithm reads that as, ‘Oh, this is popular; people want more of it.'”The solution, she concluded, was to pressure platforms to enforce their rules, both by removing content or accounts that spread disinformation and by more aggressively policing it in the first place. “The platforms have policies against certain types of malign behavior, but they haven’t been enforcing them,” she says. Quinn’s research gave ammunition to advocates pushing social media platforms to take a harder line. In November 2019, Mark Zuckerberg invited nine civil rights leaders to dinner at his home, where they warned him about the danger of the election-related falsehoods that were already spreading unchecked. “It took pushing, urging, conversations, brainstorming, all of that to get to a place where we ended up with more rigorous rules and enforcement,” says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who attended the dinner and also met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others. (Gupta has been nominated for Associate Attorney General by President Biden.) “It was a struggle, but we got to the point where they understood the problem. Was it enough? Probably not. Was it later than we wanted? Yes. But it was really important, given the level of official disinformation, that they had those rules in place and were tagging things and taking them down.”Beyond battling bad information, there was a need to explain a rapidly changing election process. It was crucial for voters to understand that despite what Trump was saying, mail-in votes weren’t susceptible to fraud and that it would be normal if some states weren’t finished counting votes on election night. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic former House leader turned high-powered lobbyist, spearheaded one coalition. “We wanted to get a really bipartisan group of former elected officials, Cabinet secretaries, military leaders and so on, aimed mainly at messaging to the public but also speaking to local officials–the secretaries of state, attorneys general, governors who would be in the eye of the storm–to let them know we wanted to help,” says Gephardt, who worked his contacts in the private sector to put $20 million behind the effort. Wamp, the former GOP Congressman, worked through the nonpartisan reform group Issue One to rally Republicans to the effort. “We thought we should bring some bipartisan element of unity around what constitutes a free and fair election,” Wamp says. The 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans on the National Council on Election Integrity met on Zoom at least once a week. They ran ads in six states, made statements, wrote articles and alerted local officials to potential problems. “We had rabid Trump supporters who agreed to serve on the council based on the idea that this is honest,” Wamp says. This is going to be just as important, he told them, to convince the liberals when Trump wins. “Whichever way it cuts, we’re going to stick together.”The Voting Rights Lab and IntoAction created state-specific memes and graphics, spread by email, text, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, urging that every vote be counted. Together, they were viewed more than 1 billion times. Protect Democracy’s election task force issued reports and held media briefings with high-profile experts across the political spectrum, resulting in widespread coverage of potential election issues and fact-checking of Trump’s false claims. The organization’s tracking polls found the message was being heard: the percentage of the public that didn’t expect to know the winner on election night gradually rose until by late October, it was over 70%. A majority also believed that a prolonged count wasn’t a sign of problems. “We knew exactly what Trump was going to do: he was going to try to use the fact that Democrats voted by mail and Republicans voted in person to make it look like he was ahead, claim victory, say the mail-in votes were fraudulent and try to get them thrown out,” says Protect Democracy’s Bassin. Setting public expectations ahead of time helped undercut those lies. The alliance took a common set of themes from the research Shenker-Osorio presented at Podhorzer’s Zooms. Studies have shown that when people don’t think their vote will count or fear casting it will be a hassle, they’re far less likely to participate. Throughout election season, members of Podhorzer’s group minimized incidents of voter intimidation and tamped down rising liberal hysteria about Trump’s expected refusal to concede. They didn’t want to amplify false claims by engaging them, or put people off voting by suggesting a rigged game. “When you say, ‘These claims of fraud are spurious,’ what people hear is ‘fraud,'” Shenker-Osorio says. “What we saw in our pre-election research was that anything that reaffirmed Trump’s power or cast him as an authoritarian diminished people’s desire to vote.”Podhorzer, meanwhile, was warning everyone he knew that polls were underestimating Trump’s support. The data he shared with media organizations who would be calling the election was “tremendously useful” to understand what was happening as the votes rolled in, according to a member of a major network’s political unit who spoke with Podhorzer before Election Day. Most analysts had recognized there would be a “blue shift” in key battlegrounds– the surge of votes breaking toward Democrats, driven by tallies of mail-in ballots– but they hadn’t comprehended how much better Trump was likely to do on Election Day. “Being able to document how big the absentee wave would be and the variance by state was essential,” the analyst says. The racial-justice uprising sparked by George Floyd’s killing in May was not primarily a political movement. The organizers who helped lead it wanted to harness its momentum for the election without allowing it to be co-opted by politicians. Many of those organizers were part of Podhorzer’s network, from the activists in battleground states who partnered with the Democracy Defense Coalition to organizations with leading roles in the Movement for Black Lives. The best way to ensure people’s voices were heard, they decided, was to protect their ability to vote. “We started thinking about a program that would complement the traditional election-protection area but also didn’t rely on calling the police,” says Nelini Stamp, the Working Families Party’s national organizing director. They created a force of “election defenders” who, unlike traditional poll watchers, were trained in de-escalation techniques. During early voting and on Election Day, they surrounded lines of voters in urban areas with a “joy to the polls” effort that turned the act of casting a ballot into a street party. Black organizers also recruited thousands of poll workers to ensure polling places would stay open in their communities. The summer uprising had shown that people power could have a massive impact. Activists began preparing to reprise the demonstrations if Trump tried to steal the election. “Americans plan widespread protests if Trump interferes with election,” Reuters reported in October, one of many such stories. More than 150 liberal groups, from the Women’s March to the Sierra Club to Color of Change, from Democrats.com to the Democratic Socialists of America, joined the “Protect the Results” coalition. The group’s now defunct website had a map listing 400 planned postelection demonstrations, to be activated via text message as soon as Nov. 4. To stop the coup they feared, the left was ready to flood the streets. About a week before Election Day, Podhorzer received an unexpected message: the U. S. Chamber of Commerce wanted to talk. The AFL-CIO and the Chamber have a long history of antagonism. Though neither organization is explicitly partisan, the influential business lobby has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Republican campaigns, just as the nation’s unions funnel hundreds of millions to Democrats. On one side is labor, on the other management, locked in an eternal struggle for power and resources. But behind the scenes, the business community was engaged in its own anxious discussions about how the election and its aftermath might unfold. The summer’s racial-justice protests had sent a signal to business owners too: the potential for economy-disrupting civil disorder. “With tensions running high, there was a lot of concern about unrest around the election, or a breakdown in our normal way we handle contentious elections,” says Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer. These worries had led the Chamber to release a pre-election statement with the Business Roundtable, a Washington-based CEOs’ group, as well as associations of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, calling for patience and confidence as votes were counted. But Bradley wanted to send a broader, more bipartisan message. He reached out to Podhorzer, through an intermediary both men declined to name. Agreeing that their unlikely alliance would be powerful, they began to discuss a joint statement pledging their organizations’ shared commitment to a fair and peaceful election. They chose their words carefully and scheduled the statement’s release for maximum impact. As it was being finalized, Christian leaders signaled their interest in joining, further broadening its reach. The statement was released on Election Day, under the names of Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, and the heads of the National Association of Evangelicals and the National African American Clergy Network. “It is imperative that election officials be given the space and time to count every vote in accordance with applicable laws,” it stated. “We call on the media, the candidates and the American people to exercise patience with the process and trust in our system, even if it requires more time than usual.” The groups added, “Although we may not always agree on desired outcomes up and down the ballot, we are united in our call for the American democratic process to proceed without violence, intimidation or any other tactic that makes us weaker as a nation.”Election night began with many Democrats despairing. Trump was running ahead of pre-election polling, winning Florida, Ohio and Texas easily and keeping Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania too close to call. But Podhorzer was unperturbed when I spoke to him that night: the returns were exactly in line with his modeling. He had been warning for weeks that Trump voters’ turnout was surging. As the numbers dribbled out, he could tell that as long as all the votes were counted, Trump would lose. The liberal alliance gathered for an 11 p.m. Zoom call. Hundreds joined; many were freaking out. “It was really important for me and the team in that moment to help ground people in what we had already known was true,” says Angela Peoples, director for the Democracy Defense Coalition. Podhorzer presented data to show the group that victory was in hand. While he was talking, Fox News surprised everyone by calling Arizona for Biden. The public-awareness campaign had worked: TV anchors were bending over backward to counsel caution and frame the vote count accurately. The question then became what to do next. The conversation that followed was a difficult one, led by the activists charged with the protest strategy. “We wanted to be mindful of when was the right time to call for moving masses of people into the street,” Peoples says. As much as they were eager to mount a show of strength, mobilizing immediately could backfire and put people at risk. Protests that devolved into violent clashes would give Trump a pretext to send in federal agents or troops as he had over the summer. And rather than elevate Trump’s complaints by continuing to fight him, the alliance wanted to send the message that the people had spoken. So the word went out: stand down. Protect the Results announced that it would “not be activating the entire national mobilization network today, but remains ready to activate if necessary.” On Twitter, outraged progressives wondered what was going on. Why wasn’t anyone trying to stop Trump’s coup? Where were all the protests?Podhorzer credits the activists for their restraint. “They had spent so much time getting ready to hit the streets on Wednesday. But they did it,” he says. “Wednesday through Friday, there was not a single Antifa vs. Proud Boys incident like everyone was expecting. And when that didn’t materialize, I don’t think the Trump campaign had a backup plan.”Activists reoriented the Protect the Results protests toward a weekend of celebration. “Counter their disinfo with our confidence & get ready to celebrate,” read the messaging guidance Shenker-Osorio presented to the liberal alliance on Friday, Nov. 6. “Declare and fortify our win. Vibe: confident, forward-looking, unified–NOT passive, anxious.” The voters, not the candidates, would be the protagonists of the story. The planned day of celebration happened to coincide with the election being called on Nov. 7. Activists dancing in the streets of Philadelphia blasted Beyoncé over an attempted Trump campaign press conference; the Trumpers’ next confab was scheduled for Four Seasons Total Landscaping outside the city center, which activists believe was not a coincidence. “The people of Philadelphia owned the streets of Philadelphia,” crows the Working Families Party’s Mitchell. “We made them look ridiculous by contrasting our joyous celebration of democracy with their clown show.”The votes had been counted. Trump had lost. But the battle wasn’t over. In Podhorzer’s presentations, winning the vote was only the first step to winning the election. After that came winning the count, winning the certification, winning the Electoral College and winning the transition–steps that are normally formalities but that he knew Trump would see as opportunities for disruption. Nowhere would that be more evident than in Michigan, where Trump’s pressure on local Republicans came perilously close to working–and where liberal and conservative pro-democracy forces joined to counter it. It was around 10 p.m. on election night in Detroit when a flurry of texts lit up the phone of Art Reyes III. A busload of Republican election observers had arrived at the TCF Center, where votes were being tallied. They were crowding the vote-counting tables, refusing to wear masks, heckling the mostly Black workers. Reyes, a Flint native who leads We the People Michigan, was expecting this. For months, conservative groups had been sowing suspicion about urban vote fraud. “The language was, ‘They’re going to steal the election; there will be fraud in Detroit,’ long before any vote was cast,” Reyes says. He made his way to the arena and sent word to his network. Within 45 minutes, dozens of reinforcements had arrived. As they entered the arena to provide a counterweight to the GOP observers inside, Reyes took down their cell-phone numbers and added them to a massive text chain. Racial-justice activists from Detroit Will Breathe worked alongside suburban women from Fems for Dems and local elected officials. Reyes left at 3 a.m., handing the text chain over to a disability activist. As they mapped out the steps in the election-certification process, activists settled on a strategy of foregrounding the people’s right to decide, demanding their voices be heard and calling attention to the racial implications of disenfranchising Black Detroiters. They flooded the Wayne County canvassing board’s Nov. 17 certification meeting with on-message testimony; despite a Trump tweet, the Republican board members certified Detroit’s votes. Election boards were one pressure point; another was GOP-controlled legislatures, who Trump believed could declare the election void and appoint their own electors. And so the President invited the GOP leaders of the Michigan legislature, House Speaker Lee Chatfield and Senate majority leader Mike Shirkey, to Washington on Nov. 20. It was a perilous moment. If Chatfield and Shirkey agreed to do Trump’s bidding, Republicans in other states might be similarly bullied. “I was concerned things were going to get weird,” says Jeff Timmer, a former Michigan GOP executive director turned anti-Trump activist. Norm Eisen describes it as “the scariest moment” of the entire election. The democracy defenders launched a full-court press. Protect Democracy’s local contacts researched the lawmakers’ personal and political motives. Issue One ran television ads in Lansing. The Chamber’s Bradley kept close tabs on the process. Wamp, the former Republican Congressman, called his former colleague Mike Rogers, who wrote an op-ed for the Detroit newspapers urging officials to honor the will of the voters. Three former Michigan governors–Republicans John Engler and Rick Snyder and Democrat Jennifer Granholm–jointly called for Michigan’s electoral votes to be cast free of pressure from the White House. Engler, a former head of the Business Roundtable, made phone calls to influential donors and fellow GOP elder statesmen who could press the lawmakers privately. The pro-democracy forces were up against a Trumpified Michigan GOP controlled by allies of Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chair, and Betsy DeVos, the former Education Secretary and a member of a billionaire family of GOP donors. On a call with his team on Nov. 18, Bassin vented that his side’s pressure was no match for what Trump could offer. “Of course he’s going to try to offer them something,” Bassin recalls thinking. “Head of the Space Force! Ambassador to wherever! We can’t compete with that by offering carrots. We need a stick.”If Trump were to offer something in exchange for a personal favor, that would likely constitute bribery, Bassin reasoned. He phoned Richard Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan, to see if Primus agreed and would make the argument publicly. Primus said he thought the meeting itself was inappropriate, and got to work on an op-ed for Politico warning that the state attorney general–a Democrat–would have no choice but to investigate. When the piece posted on Nov. 19, the attorney general’s communications director tweeted it. Protect Democracy soon got word that the lawmakers planned to bring lawyers to the meeting with Trump the next day. Reyes’ activists scanned flight schedules and flocked to the airports on both ends of Shirkey’s journey to D. C., to underscore that the lawmakers were being scrutinized. After the meeting, the pair announced they’d pressed the President to deliver COVID relief for their constituents and informed him they saw no role in the election process. Then they went for a drink at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. A street artist projected their images onto the outside of the building along with the words THE WORLD IS WATCHING. That left one last step: the state canvassing board, made up of two Democrats and two Republicans. One Republican, a Trumper employed by the DeVos family’s political nonprofit, was not expected to vote for certification. The other Republican on the board was a little-known lawyer named Aaron Van Langevelde. He sent no signals about what he planned to do, leaving everyone on edge. When the meeting began, Reyes’s activists flooded the livestream and filled Twitter with their hashtag, #alleyesonmi. A board accustomed to attendance in the single digits suddenly faced an audience of thousands. In hours of testimony, the activists emphasized their message of respecting voters’ wishes and affirming democracy rather than scolding the officials. Van Langevelde quickly signaled he would follow precedent. The vote was 3-0 to certify; the other Republican abstained. After that, the dominoes fell. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and the rest of the states certified their electors. Republican officials in Arizona and Georgia stood up to Trump’s bullying. And the Electoral College voted on schedule on Dec. 14. There was one last milestone on Podhorzer’s mind: Jan. 6. On the day Congress would meet to tally the electoral count, Trump summoned his supporters to D. C. for a rally. Much to their surprise, the thousands who answered his call were met by virtually no counterdemonstrators. To preserve safety and ensure they couldn’t be blamed for any mayhem, the activist left was “strenuously discouraging counter activity,” Podhorzer texted me the morning of Jan. 6, with a crossed-fingers emoji. Trump addressed the crowd that afternoon, peddling the lie that lawmakers or Vice President Mike Pence could reject states’ electoral votes. He told them to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” Then he returned to the White House as they sacked the building. As lawmakers fled for their lives and his own supporters were shot and trampled, Trump praised the rioters as “very special.”It was his final attack on democracy, and once again, it failed. By standing down, the democracy campaigners outfoxed their foes. “We won by the skin of our teeth, honestly, and that’s an important point for folks to sit with,” says the Democracy Defense Coalition’s Peoples. “There’s an impulse for some to say voters decided and democracy won. But it’s a mistake to think that this election cycle was a show of strength for democracy. It shows how vulnerable democracy is.”The members of the alliance to protect the election have gone their separate ways. The Democracy Defense Coalition has been disbanded, though the Fight Back Table lives on. Protect Democracy and the good-government advocates have turned their attention to pressing reforms in Congress. Left-wing activists are pressuring the newly empowered Democrats to remember the voters who put them there, while civil rights groups are on guard against further attacks on voting. Business leaders denounced the Jan. 6 attack, and some say they will no longer donate to lawmakers who refused to certify Biden’s victory. Podhorzer and his allies are still holding their Zoom strategy sessions, gauging voters’ views and developing new messages. And Trump is in Florida, facing his second impeachment, deprived of the Twitter and Facebook accounts he used to push the nation to its breaking point. As I was reporting this article in November and December, I heard different claims about who should get the credit for thwarting Trump’s plot. Liberals argued the role of bottom-up people power shouldn’t be overlooked, particularly the contributions of people of color and local grassroots activists. Others stressed the heroism of GOP officials like Van Langevelde and Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, who stood up to Trump at considerable cost. The truth is that neither likely could have succeeded without the other. “It’s astounding how close we came, how fragile all this really is,” says Timmer, the former Michigan GOP executive director. “It’s like when Wile E. Coyote runs off the cliff–if you don’t look down, you don’t fall. Our democracy only survives if we all believe and don’t look down.”Democracy won in the end. The will of the people prevailed. But it’s crazy, in retrospect, that this is what it took to put on an election in the United States of America.–With reporting by LESLIE DICKSTEIN, MARIAH ESPADA and SIMMONE SHAHWrite toMolly Ballatmolly.ball@time.com",3,Reliable,0.0726269315352284,0.4614503012756289,9081,3,Time Magazine
437,A reporter shares her minute-by-minute recollection of being trapped in the Senate on Jan. 6,-5.33,45.33,https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2021/a-reporter-shares-her-minute-by-minute-recollection-of-being-trapped-in-the-senate-on-jan-6/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,24,"I was in the Senate print press gallery when all hell broke loose. As the reporter for CBS News covering the Senate on Jan. 6, my job was simple. Electronics aren’t allowed in the Senate chamber, and C-SPAN cameras only point at the dais in the front of the room and whoever happens to be speaking at the moment. My task — as it had been during the impeachment trial last year — was to sit inside the Senate chamber and take notes on what was happening. Who was chatting, who was taking notes, who was fidgeting, who was on their phone. I like to think of it as gauging the “vibe” in the chamber, and my regular email updates to the rest of the CBS News bureau amounted to “vibe checks.” I would spend about half an hour in the room, and then return to the print press gallery to shoot a mass email to CBS about what was going on inside. The print press gallery is a series of rooms that opens into a balcony overlooking the Senate chamber. Imagine the chamber as a fish bowl. The bottom of the fish bowl is the floor of the chamber on the second story of the Capitol; that’s where the senators meet. There are balconies around the edges of the chamber on the third floor of the building — the lip of the fish bowl. Members of the press have one side of the fish bowl all to ourselves and are able to stare over the edge of the balcony and observe the pontificating subjects below. Even before the rioters overran the building, I could sense a disturbance within the fish bowl. Outside, there were demonstrators screaming and threatening violence. Inside, several senators were calmly arguing in favor of doing the very thing that the demonstrators wanted — seeking to overturn the election. I usually walk to the Capitol. It’s a brisk walk, about 20 minutes from where I live, and one that I treasure. But I promised my boyfriend that I would take an Uber to the Capitol instead that day because he was concerned about protesters gathering around the building to object to President Joe Biden’s election. I wasn’t really concerned about violence. I tend to downplay the seriousness of any potentially catastrophic event — my natural disaster planning is terrible because I always assume that things will just work out on their own. But my boyfriend was worried, and my friends were worried, so fine, I would be cautious. I took an Uber and arrived at the Dirksen Senate Office Building shortly after 9 a.m. I was on the Senate side of the Capitol for the majority of that day. Occasionally I would leave the Senate TV/Radio press gallery, a windowless maze tucked next to the Senate chamber that served as the workspace for network reporters, and takea look outside at the protesters gathering behind barricadeson the east side of the Capitol. I could hear chants of “stop the steal” from the corridor on the third floor., I thought, in the understatement of the year. I was tasked with sitting in the House chamber when the day’s proceedings began, then returning to the Senate when both houses went into session to consider objections to Arizona’s Electoral College count. It was already a weird day. First of all, I was rolling into the Capitol sporting a KN95 mask, because, oh right, we’re still in the middle of a devastating pandemic. But also, the day’s events were anything but normal. A large number of Republicans sought to overturn the results of the election and would object to the Electoral College counts from several states despite little to no evidence of voter fraud. Federal judges, many of them nominated by the president, had dismissed dozens of cases by the Trump campaign challenging the election results. Neither the president, his campaign, nor the lawmakers who supported him had provided legitimate evidence of any wrongdoing. But on Jan. 6, Republican senators and representatives were nonetheless trying to overturn the election results to appease a man who wouldn’t accept that he had lost, and to satisfy that unwavering base of supporters who hung onto his every false word about the election. I knew that I was witnessing history, that I was watching democratic institutions be challenged and maybe even strained to the breaking point. I didn’t yet know the extent. By the afternoon, I was hanging out in the print press gallery of the Senate. I had left my backpack — filled with snacks and chargers — in the radio/TV gallery, foolishly believing I could return whenever I needed. I was writing my email with my latest batch of observations when rioters overran the building. That email remains in my drafts, overshadowed by the events of the next few moments. By this point, I had heard murmurs that the Capitol was in lockdown and a House office building had been evacuated, but I didn’t know much.“To put it simply, the vibe in the chamber is incredibly weird,” I wrote in my unsent email. “Protesters are overrunning the barricades outside. But inside the Senate chamber, it’s like another world, cushioned from outside interference by thick walls and C-SPAN cameras.”“There’s an extreme dissonance between the mood outside of the building and inside the Capitol. Objecting senators are acting as if this is business as usual,” I continued. As I finished writing these words, Paul Kane of The Washington Post emerged from the Senate chamber. “Pence has left!” he shouted. He jogged through the rest of the gallery, shouting his message, the Paul Revere of the Capitol Hill press. I assumed that the demonstrations outside must have gotten a bit too rowdy and Secret Service had removed Vice President Mike Pence out of an abundance of caution. Instead of sending my wordier email describing the mood in the chamber, I sent an email at 2:14 p.m. with the subject line “Pence has left.”“Pence has left Senate chamber, perhaps for security reasons. They’re locking us in the press room,” I wrote. A frazzled Capitol police officer had just told Senate gallery staff to lock the doors. I learned several days later that the rioters almost got into the Senate chamber at just about 2:14 p.m. Igor Bobic of HuffPost filmed a video, whichhe tweeted at 2:16 p.m., of Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman directing shouting demonstrators up the stairs and away from the Senate chamber. If Goodman hadn’t been there, if he hadn’t instead herded the rioters into a corridor where other Capitol Police were waiting, they probably would have entered the chamber then, seriously endangering Pence, around 100 senators and the reporters on the balcony. Shortly after I sent the email about Pence, staffers shouted to the rest of us still sitting in the gallery that we needed to get inside the chamber. I hesitated, unwilling to leave my laptop and phone while I was locked in. I impulsively grabbed my laptop and ran to the door just as they were locking it. I squeezed in through the door onto the balcony, getting bruised as it hit me. This was around 2:16 p.m. I sent an email to my editors at 2:17 p.m. with the subject line, “We are locked in the Senate chamber.” A Senate gallery staffer shouted at me to put away my computer and phone. I pleaded with them, saying I needed to let my editors know what was going on. After a few moments of stalemate, I relocated to another part of the balcony, where I unsubtly pulled out my phone and began to shoot missives to my editors. At this point, the texts and messages from my family, friends and vague acquaintances were streaming in. I probably should have reached out to my mom and my boyfriend immediately, letting them know I was safe. But even then, I didn’t realize how serious it was. My boyfriend was at home, watching the rioters overrun the Capitol. I was actually in the Capitol, and I had no idea what the situation truly was. Inside the chamber, it was barely contained chaos. Senators were standing, some clustered in nervous groups, many of them on their phones. Police surrounded the room. At one point, an officer shouted that the senators needed to step away from the doors. Senators milled around, confused or unable to process what the officer said. Sen. Amy Klobuchar angrily shouted to her colleagues to stay away from the doors.“Shots fired,” she said. “This is serious.”I felt tears beginning to prick the corner of my eyes. I brushed them aside and took deep breaths., I told myself. You can feel this later. Right now, you have to work. After about half an hour, the senators were suddenly evacuated. They streamed to the open doors on one side of the room like fish caught in a current. Sen. Cory Booker, who was on the tail end of this exodus, looked up at the reporters in the Senate gallery and asked how we were doing. He said it casually, with a smile on his face.“We’re doing OK,” I said, my voice likely tinged with hysteria. It seemed at first like the senators would be evacuated but the reporters would remain trapped in the chamber.“What about us?” a Senate gallery staffer shouted down to the police officers, notifying them that the reporters and staffers needed to evacuate, too. Without that staffer’s quick thinking, we probably would have been trapped in the chamber when the rioters entered it just moments later. The reporters were shuffled off of the balcony and out of the press gallery. Many of us headed for the stairs — the same stairs that had been overrun with rioters redirected by Officer Goodman. There was a police officer at the top of the stairs who told us to take the elevator.“They’re on the stairs,” he said, referring to the rioters. I crammed into an elevator with several other reporters, including Nicholas Fandos of The New York Times, who thankfully knew to press a button to bypass all other floors until we hit the basement. We half walked, half jogged behind the senators in the path between the Senate subways. Police officers asked us to show our badges regularly and urged us to stay calm. On our way to the secure location where we spent the next five hours, we passed two Capitol maintenance workers.“Are you evacuating?” I asked them. They looked confused and said no. “You need to evacuate,” I said.“You need to get beyond a locked door, now,” said Katherine Tully-McManus of Roll Call, who was jogging alongside me. For a moment, I marveled at the fact that these workers hadn’t even been notified of the danger.(Worth noting, perhaps, that the majority of workers in the Capitol complex — including these two that I passed — are black. Many of the rioters were white supremacists, with one photographed carrying the Confederate flag through the building.)Reporters were initially put in the same room as the senators, but we were quickly moved to a sort of anteroom right outside. I guess the senators didn’t want to be stuck with the reporters who would undoubtedly ask uncomfortable questions. Then I sat on the floor for, oh, around five hours, or a little less. It was alternately boring and horrifying. There was initially talk of senators getting bussed out of the Capitol, but those plans faded quickly. Reporters huddled on the floor, sharing chargers and what little news we could glean from Twitter and overheard reports from officers’ walkie-talkies. We all gasped when we saw pictures of the rioters inside the Senate chamber just moments after we had left. We observed nervously as various law enforcement officers wearing full tactical gear came and left the room and its surrounding hallways. We chatted. We wrote emails. I gave an interview for a special report for CBS News while sitting on the floor. It seemed surreal to me to be talking about an attack that I had just barely missed, while I sat safely, if uncomfortably, in a secure location. It’s probably good that I felt as safe as I did at the time. With every day that passes, I learn more about how close I came to witnessing the possible assassinations of lawmakers and how reporters were targeted by rioters, and I become a bit more terrified. I had no idea at the time that rioters had hanged nooses around the building, had called for assassinating lawmakers, and even were targeting members of the press. When I returned to the Capitol complex, I saw the words “MURDER THE MEDIA” written on a door in red. At one point, Capitol food service workers wheeled in meals to the senators. I was pretty hungry — my backpack of snacks was still in the radio/TV gallery — but I was barely able to eat when the workers handed reporters leftover trays of chicken and beef. I texted my colleagues in the House chamber. Before they were moved to a secure location, they had been barricaded in the room while officers had a standoff with armed rioters just outside the door. Shortly after 5 p.m., the president released hisvideo message on Twittercalling the violent rioters “special.” I listened in disbelief as another reporter played it on his phone. How could the president say that he “loved” the people who had desecrated the Capitol, who had threatened to kill lawmakers, including his own vice president? The video was taken down, but its message stayed with me. Senators occasionally emerged from their room to talk to reporters. At one point, Sen. Ted Cruz left the larger room and briefly walked into our domain. Jason Donner of Fox News asked Cruz, a leader of the efforts to object to the Electoral College results, if he felt any responsibility for what had happened. Cruz turned around and reentered the senators’ room without answering. At around 7 p.m., we were told that it was safe to return to the Capitol. I and several other reporterswalked behind the staffers carrying Electoral College ballotsthrough the Senate subway. If a fast-thinking aide hadn’t quickly grabbed the ballots on her way out of the chamber, they likely would have been destroyed by the rioters. The floor of the Capitol was chalky from spent fire extinguishers. We were told not to touch any railings, as tear gas had been employed. But my backpack up in the radio/TV gallery was blessedly safe. I returned to the print press gallery, waiting for the Senate to reconvene at 8 p.m. We were briefly forced out of the rooms as a bomb squad came through, with an adorable yet intimidating bomb-sniffing German Shepherd in tow.“Why were we allowed back in the room if it hadn’t yet been swept for bombs?” a reporter asked. A Senate gallery staffer said we hadn’t actually been allowed back into the gallery, but we had all entered before we could be notified. The mood was somber when I reentered the chamber, weighed down by everything that had occurred. In a rare show of bipartisanship, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle gave Pence a standing ovation after he made brief boilerplate remarks. I wondered if the events of the day would have changed senators’ minds, if they would now choose to accept the Electoral College results. Some, such as Sen. James Lankford, did change their vote in light of the insurrection. But others — including Sen. Josh Hawley and Cruz — did not. A handful of Republican senators and the majority of House Republicans voted to overturn the will of the voters in Arizona and Pennsylvania. The lawmakers went back to work as if nothing had happened, and so did I. Biden received over 270 electoral votes at 3:33 a.m., cinching his victory. I finally left the Capitol at around 4 a.m., picked up by my boyfriend because I didn’t want to get into a car with a stranger to ride home. For several hours, I had been thinking about the moment I would enter my boyfriend’s car and finally let my guard down. I expected to break down crying. But I didn’t. It had been an exhausting day, and the events hadn’t sunk in yet. I was still functioning as if everything was normal when I knew that it wasn’t. I slept for 11 hours on Thursday, from 5 a.m. to 4 p.m. I woke up around noon and tried to get ready for work but laid down on the living room floor and cried, realizing that I needed more sleep. So I informed my very understanding editor and went back to sleep. Every day, we learn more about what happened, what almost happened. Every day, the events of Jan. 6 become more real and terrifying to me. People keep checking in, asking how I’m doing, and I honestly don’t know. Sometimes I’m fine, sometimes I want to sob for hours, sometimes I just want to sleep. Like I said, I tend to downplay traumatic events, so I’ve been telling myself for days that it wasn’t that bad. I was very lucky. I wasn’t hurt. I was evacuated safely. I’ve had to repeatedly remind myself that yes, it was bad. It was horrifying. It was awful. It was one of the weirdest days of my life. I returned to the Capitol on Jan. 13, exactly one week after the attacks on the Capitol, to report on the historic vote to impeach Trump for the second time. When I entered the building, there were thousands of National Guard troops. As I passed through the Capitol Visitor Center, an airy complex usually filled with tourists, I saw hundreds of guardsmen lying on the hard marble floor cradling their guns, napping after a long overnight shift. The guardsmen were friendly and chatted with reporters. I heard from multiple guardsmen that this was their first time at the Capitol, and they saw their deployment there as an opportunity to tour the seat of the nation’s legislature. At one point, a guardsman asked me what it was like to see my place of work filled with thousands of troops. I told him, honestly, that it was extremely bizarre. He asked me if I felt safer with the National Guard there. I wanted to say “no.” I wanted to say that seeing the guardsmen there had made the events of last week more real, that I had cried in the bathroom in the House press gallery after walking past all of them in the visitor center. But I didn’t say that. I told him that yes, I felt safer, but I was concerned about what their presence meant — that we might still be in danger.“Don’t worry,” he said, and I realized suddenly that he and I were probably around the same age. “We’ve got this.”If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It's not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up. But few share Trump’s disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let’s build proper support systems and processes to deal with high levels of stress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I’m sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.’Our working paper found that the tech giants owe publishers billions of dollars.

438,Rachel Cohen on the Great Charter School Controversy,-8.33,40.0,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/interview-rachel-cohen-on-the-great-charter-school-controversy,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-17,25,"Are charter schools the future of education in the United States, or just another billionaire-backed technocratic scam?a podcast interviewfeaturing our beloved outgoing host Pete Davis and journalist Rachel Cohen. The following transcript of their conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. Hello,listeners. It’s your host, Pete Davis, here [with] Rachel Cohen. Hello Rachel! Welcome to theCurrent AffairsWorld Headquarters. Hey. Thanks for having me. So glad to have you here. Listeners, Rachel Cohen is an amazing journalist. She writesprimarily now for thebut has been published all over. And though she covers many issues, she’s one of the leading lights covering the education beat, which is why I brought her here today because I have so many questions about American education policy. It has been so, so strange following it over the past 10 years, it’s like a hall of mirrors—so many terms, so many interlocking concepts, so many shady things going on, and Rachel is here to unpack it. And the biggest mystery of all is that 10 years ago, I [was] in college and everyone [was] talking about education “reform.” Teach for America [was] the cool thing to do after college. Michelle Rhee [was] on the cover of magazines. Charter schools [were] popping up everywhere. Everyone [was] talking about how teachers’ unions [were] bad and standardized tests [and] beloved data [were] good. This movie[a documentary about the U. S. public school system] comes out to bring it all together, and Obama is cheering on all of this. And then 10 years later, Teach for America and charter schools and standardized tests are viewed with a lot more skepticism. Michelle Rhee has been deposed from Washington—run out of Washington, D. C. Teachers’ unions are striking everywhereto great fanfare. And many Democrats—not all, but many—aretaking the union’s sideagainst the charters and the “reform movement.” There is so much going on here. So Rachel, I thought you could help guide us through all of this. Let’s start 10 years ago. What was this so-called education reform movement? Where did it come from?Well, that was actually an excellent summary because you are right that in, at least as I think about it, [2009-2011] was the peak. That was really the most powerful time for this movement, and I think to explain how that came it [helps] to go back a little bit further. So one funny thing is that there is this myth that charter schools were actually invented by teacher unions. And the narrative goes: Albert Shanker, who was the head of the teacher unions in the late ‘80s, [wrote a]op-edwhere he said we could have this new kind of school that could be called “charters,” where teachers could innovate new educational approaches and have more freedom to experiment out of the rules. And this idea that charters came from teacher unions is something that both reformers and unions say because it is a narrative that could be helpful to both sides. Teacher unions can say, “Oh, we have always been for innovation and reformers co-opted it and ran away and took it from us and it was co-opted by billionaires, and our vision of charters was stolen.” And then reformers can be like, “It’s so crazy [that] unions are bashing on charters because it was their idea. They are selling out the thing that they originally supported.” I do not know if this is all making sense, but my point is there is this narrative that is still pretty strong. It is really easy to find both Randi Weingarten, who is the head of the [American Federation of Teachers (AFT)], [and] the head of big charter organizations claiming that charters were really a union idea. But the truth ischarters actually got their start a decade earlier. They sort of came out of the same movement for deregulation that we saw in other industries, like airlines, in the ‘70s breaking up large parts of the economy. There were these people who were like, “Let’s break up the monopoly of school districts, and we will inject competition into school districts, and then they will compete with each other and improve.” So that was the original thinking. And then while you can definitely find some more progressive people who were like, “Yeah, this could be a way to have teacher-led schools or more progressive [ones], maybe we can use the charter idea to inject new things into education,” the real power behind the movement was never really coming from them. And so then what happened was, in the ‘90s, Bill Clinton and the New Democrats—the [Democratic Leadership Council (DLC)], they got very excited by the idea because it was a way to seem creative on education while also not advocating to spend more money, which they did not want to do because they werepeople. And it was also sort of this exciting opportunity for them to distance themselves from teacher unions who they cast as “special interests.” So this whole idea that Democrats would [call] teacher unions “special interests” that we should distance ourselves from—that is a very destructive idea that really carried all the way through the Obama administration, and now we are seeing a shift away [from it]. But that really has been a two decade-long journey. So, we have talked about two strands so far, and I really want to unpack them for listeners. [One] strand is charter schools. On the surface, [the] nicest case for charter schools is the one that they put forward, [which] is a charter school is a way to innovate and try [something new]. It sounds very lefty and dreamy. It says there is a high-bound way we do education. We can experiment with this new way of doing education, with a blank canvas that does not have all this bureaucracy. It sounds like something a utopian dreamer would think up. Usually our listeners would be like, “Oh, that sounds like a great idea.” But what is the insidious aspect of charter schools? Just back to the basics—what is the problem with [that]?Well people have different opinions on what exactly is the problem. But certainly charters—while they do not have to be non-union—the majority are [not unionized]. The big funders behind the movement want to keep them non-union, and I have been [following] the movement by charter school teachers to try to get unions. But by and large, the idea is we will not have unions [in charter schools], which can make the schools more flexible. [Most] of them are nonprofits or for-profits. They are publicly funded, but they are not publicly managed like a traditional public school. They are run by private organizations like any nonprofit or for-profit company, and so you have less access and control over that institution than you would a traditional public school. There are a lot of concerns about democratic control, democratic access, privatization, and teacher rights, and things like that, [plus] general oversight and accountability for these schools. So those are sort of some of the main challenges that people have[raised]. So it’s a roundabout way to [break] teachers’ unions. [It’s] kind of crazy that there are for-profit charter schools in the first place. But even if they are nonprofit, there is no democratic oversight, and it is kind of a form of privatization with public money. Just to say, some states do a better job with imposing rules over what you can do for oversight. But in Washington, D. C., where I live, I have just been writing and complaining for several years about how we are so bad at [this]. I have heard vaguely that [charter schools’] big claim is that they will be able to do better with this hard challenge of providing quality education in a poor neighborhood or something. But what I have heard from folks like [former U. S. Assistant Secretary of Education] Diane Ravitch, is: does the data even show that they are doing any better at achieving ends? What is the state of the data on the outcomes for charter schools?For a long time, it was showing that charters were performing no better thantraditionalpublic schools and in a lot of cases that is still true. There are some cities, like notablyBoston as an example, where the charter schools, study after study, their kids score higher, and they are going to college more. There are some places where charters are doing well. But I think what gets really lost in those studies is that when people like [charter school advocate] John Tate cite them all the time, [they obscure the reality] that having some limited number of [successful] charters in a district in a city with above-average regulation and control [does] not mean that if you then triple the number of charters in that city it is all going to still be successful. Even though Boston, for example, has relatively high performing charters compared to other parts of the city, in 2016, voters (including the majority of Boston residents)rejected the idea of expanding thembecause the proposal would have been to massively accelerate the expansion of charter schools, and all of the reformers were like, “We need to, because Boston charters are good.” And everyone was like, “No, that would be a disaster. Unfettered growth does not mean that the success that we have seen would continue.”And isn’t the whole idea that the charters could produce experimental results and then the public schools could change to learn from those results? It’s not that you would expand the experiment, it would be that you would take the learnings and bring it back to the [normal school with democratical oversight]. Yeah. And that does not happen at all. That has not happened. And some reformers try to say, “Oh, well you know, just being around charters spurs the district schools to get better. They have to compete and so they all get better.” I find that research very weak and not convincing. But there are definitely reformers who say, “We just expand charters, and the district schools will feel so stressed that then they will be motivated to be better.” And there is some evidence that sometimes that happens, but I do not think it works as they want to believe. So, there is this second element of the education so-called reform movement, which is not just charters—it’s people in the public schools demanding more data, more standardized tests, more accountability, [moreRace to the Top-type policy] saying, “We will fund you if you take this data and follow this data.” What was that branch of the education reform movement?Yeah. That was a super powerful idea in the Obama administration. Well, it really started withNo Child Left Behind, which said we need to collect more data. There’s a positive way to look at it. Civil rights groups are really behind the idea [that] if we don’t know where the gaps are, then we can’t better target resources to where they should go. And underserved, [vulnerable] students are most likely to be missed or overlooked. So there is a big civil rights framing to the drive for data, and that was how the Obama administration and all of the liberal education reformers [see] themselves: as these civil rights advocates for pushing [data-centric policies]. But they went really strongly overboard, in my opinion. Because then [the reformers] said, “Well, if the data shows that this school is not producing [good enough] test scores, then we should hold them ‘accountable’ and maybe close their school…. Oh, if your test score says this, then we should get rid of this teacher,” things like that. And collecting data is not bad necessarily, but they all wanted these consequences that very understandably started a huge backlash politically. You wrote thisarticle on D. C.’s school miracleand the measurement questions around it. [The basic idea of] the article was D. C. had this kind of miracle success. Everyone agreed D. C. was one of the best-reformed school systems. But then when you looked into the data, it gets really, really complicated and there are scholars out there that are saying, “This is way, way overstated.”And I am just interested in the theory of measurement. Because here are a few weird aspects about measurement. One is the famous case of“juking the stats,”which [means that] as soon as you start measuring something, everyone starts [focusing on] making that measurement go up without holistically doing things, so they drill and kill for the specific tests while ignoring everything else.[Then] there is this other aspect which [that] so much [depends on] demographics. Like if you just have an increase in rich families in the schools your test scores go up. I’m from a wealthy suburb of D. C., Falls Church of Virginia. We brag every year [that] we’re the No. 1 school in Virginia, but then I look, and [we] have the lowest [rates of students receiving] free and reduced lunch. That’s why we’re No. 1, that’s why our SAT scores are the highest—because it is just a measurement of the economy around your school, not of the school itself. So I would love to hear, as an expert in this, what has been your experience of what can we actually measure?I mean, we can measure a lot—and that’s also why it was so obvious that the people that were pointing to D. C. were exaggerating it because it was so clear what they were ignoring. While there were some gains for some groups, once you have controlled for demographics, a bunch of the other gains disappeared. At the same time that some scores were going up, socioeconomic gaps were widening, and the gaps between white and Black proficiency rates was still 60 points. But there was this push to claim success—and not only claim success but replicate the model being used so quickly—and this was incentivized through Race to the Top, which was the Obama administration’s $4 billion program that pushed states to expand charter schools, tie teacher evaluations to test scores, make it easier to close schools—sort of the gamut of what we think of when we say “education reform.”And so, so much of that they pointed to Washington D. C. as like, “Oh, let’s see if it’s working. We’re now going to jangle a lot of money in front of states, so then they do what D. C. does.” [They] were also really overstating the effectiveness of [D. C.’s reforms] at the same time, but no one wanted to talk about that. Two more branches of this education reform push. One is TFA, Teach for America. What is the story with them, and what has been their role in this push?[So] Teach for America, for basically the first two decades of its existence, was so rarely criticized, critiqued, or thought about skeptically. It was just treated like the way we think of joining the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps or any sort of these public national services. At the same time—and I have actuallywrote about this recentlyfor the—Teach for America is and has been one of the most politically powerful bipartisan education organizations in Washington shaping education policy, and it was very effective at getting millions of dollars in grants and earmarks from federal agencies, from Congress.[Sometimes] I think we think all of these organizations are just bankrolled by billionaires, but I think it is also really important to realize [that] the federal government has funded Teach for America’s model to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and that is not what most nonprofits get. Teach for America… [has] this model where they take recent college graduates, they put them through a short five- or six-week summer training program, and then they put you in schools for two year stints, although not everyone stays two years. It’s not super uncommon for people to stay three years, but they do not expect you to. [You] can stay for longer, but most people do not. So it is generally thought of as a two-year commitment. And Teach for America inspired a lot of resentments among long-term teachers. One of the [reasons is that] Teach for America started in the ‘90s by saying, “We are going to help attract people to schools that have trouble attracting teachers, so we are going to help with the teacher vacancy problem,” which is a real problem in a lot of places in the country. But then what became clear was then they definitely shifted that goal in the mid-2000s, where then you had Teach for America teachers going into schools that were not having trouble attracting [teachers], like in San Francisco, in Washington, D. C., and popular cities, till it suddenly became not an organization to fill teacher vacancy gaps, but actually they really thought of themselves as better teachers. Like, “Our candidates are actually more talented than these deadwood, old teachers who are not even trying, and we are going to put bright, young energetic teachers who can work long hours.”[Teach for America teachers] also were really tied to charter schools, so the idea was if charter schools are expanding [in] the city, we now have this ready pipeline of teachers ready to go into them. Not all Teach for America teachers go to charter schools, but tons did and lots of Teach for America alumni then started charters.[I] remember when I started really following this stuff in 2013, people were barely even critiquing it then. It really started the next couple of years. And then there [were] alumni from Teach for America who started organizing and saying, “Hey, wait, this model has a lot of problems,” and that sort of helped give voice to some of the stuff that unions had been saying for a longer time that people had not been listening to. And so I have thoughts on how the critique of TFA ties into some of the other stuff we have been saying about ed reform, but I can wait and shut up for a second. No, tell us a bit about that. How is it tied in? I want to see [how] this whole network—you know, we’re on the bulletin board with the red string—how do they all connect to each other?So, the growing criticism and skepticism with education reform is wrapped up in, in my view, a couple other very, very powerful narratives that were unimpeachable a decade ago. And now more and more people are like, “Wait, no, that is actually bullshit,” or “That really isn’t founded.”So one of them is this idea of the skills gap. And the skills gap theory, which is so popular in Washington, D. C. among both parties and all the think tanks, [states] that the reason that people are struggling to pay their bills and in the economy is just because they do not have the skills necessary to get good jobs. And so, we need to train and educate workers and reskill them and give them the tools to be successful in the modern 21st century economy. [This] was such a—I can’t even stress how powerful this narrative is, everybody said it. And it really was not until maybe 2016-2017, even kind of more recently, [that] people started saying, “Wait, people working in tech and engineering, no one is getting raises in those sectors either. The only people who are getting raises are in the top 1 percent.” And then people also started to notice, “Hey, wait. People with these good credentials and qualifications are actually now taking jobs that previously required fewer [qualifications],” like people with bachelor’s degrees were now taking jobs that would not have normally required a bachelor’s degree. [People] without bachelor’s degrees [were] sort of being forced out [of the labor market].[I] rememberI interviewed Marshall Steinbaum, economist, on this when I was at the. [There] was a study that came out that showed, yes, a STEM degree—a degree in engineering and science—[can] protect you a little bit, but actually what they found was [people with these degrees] are still way less protected than they used to be prior to the Great Recession. So, the idea that just going and learning to code or getting an engineering degree would suddenly give you the security that you deserved or needed was suddenly coming under attack. And that was a very powerful narrative that was also very much tied to the education reform movement which said, “Our job is to give these children the skills they need to be successful.”Yeah, I’ve always wondered [about the logic behind] the skills gap [theory]. [It’s] these CEOs saying, “I can’t fill my positions. Therefore the country needs to educate workers to fill my positions.” But the funny thing is, [according to] Economics 101 [doesn’t] it say: if you don’t have enough people wanting to fulfill your positions, you need to raise the wages of the positions and that will induce people to want to fill them?But the answer is never, “Let me raise the wages of the position to attract more people.” It’s always, “Socialize my problems and have the government pay for it.”Or provide on the job job-training, which companies use to do. Internalize the cost, yes. We will take you as you [are], and we will train you how to do this. The idea that we should be having first graders learn to code so that maybe when they are 22 they could get a job is actually so sick, because technology is going to change so much in that time. [It] really revolts me. Amen. The second [argument for charter schools]—which is similar but a little different—… is that the best pathway out of poverty is through education. And everybody says this. Obama said it, like every [time he gave a speech on the topic]. This is the mantra of education reform, of the Democratic Party, and then some people started challenging that. I remember reading Matt Bruenig when I was in college, and he was like, “Well, actually Social Security was the most effective pathway to bring people out of poverty.” I wrote a story in 2017 called“Why Education Is Not the Key to a Good Income,”and it was looking at this growing body of research that showed it was not your level of education that determined your chances of rising economic mobility. It was these other factors—like what kind of industries were in your community, union density, some of it was marriage.[So] I just basically [argued that the research’s conclusion] doesn’t mean that we should abandon school improvement, because there are a million other reasons you can think of for why people should go to great schools. But the idea that we should be doing school improvement in order to boost someone’s economic position when they are older is not really an efficient or coherent [strategy]. [It’s] not really the right way to be thinking about society, public policy. Anyway, I wrote this piece, and I can tell you I have never gotten more vitriolic responses to anything I have written. Reformers hated this piece. They were like, “How could you say this?” and, “This is a blasphemous concept.” And it was so interesting because I have never had that before but now, I think more people are finally being like, “Well the evidence is kind of overwhelming.”It’s so funny how, when you strike a nerve and people just start irrationally yelling at you, it really reveals the dominant ideology of the day. It’s like it shows you the water that we’re [swimming] in. These things that we take for granted, like “Oh, education is the path to everything,” that is like the meritocratic ideal. I’m also interested in—this is maybe one of my weird hobby horses—but I always think that we totally undervalue the network elements of school for the literal things you are learning. The high school movement at the turn of the century that established public high schools was a positive addition, you know. And Bernie pushing for free college and getting more people into college, people seem to love going to college. But [the real value of college is] not what you learn in the classes, it’s not how good you do on the tests—it’s a civic institution that attaches you to a network of the community, so you’re not alone in your house. And that network introduces you to a bunch of mentors and it introduces you to a bunch of things in the community and attaches you to a bunch of possibilities.[Having] these institutions of community connection seem to be more important than if you are learning to code there. And the problem with these neighborhoods is: if a neighborhood has been completely marginalized and completely disconnected from the broader economy, if it has been deindustrialized, it doesn’t matter how much you are learning in the school. If you’re embedded in a social network that’s not connecting you to the connections that get you into the college, that get you the job, that get you the internship, you are not going to be able to use it as a thing to ascend like the rest of us are. I do not know, does that resonate with your research at all or… ?I mean, just personally, I think that totally hits at what another part of the backlash of the past decade. Which is: with the education reform theory and school choice in general, [the goal is to do] whatever you need to do, [to find] the best school… so that you can get the skills so that you can succeed in this highly competitive global economy. And there are just a lot of people that are like, “Wait, no, we want to protect our communal institutions that serve the public, that are for everyone.” I think what you said about schools being for more than just skill acquisition, but actually just being parts of society [was correct]. [There] were these waves of school closures that happened because we said, “Oh, if we close these schools, we’ll be able to open up better schools and that’s good,” and a lot of people were like, “Wait, is that good? I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s good that this school that was in my neighborhood for a hundred years is now gone and replaced with a charter school.” There were all of those feelings. And I also think, speaking to what you said about marginalized communities and networks, the argument was if kids can score a certain level, if we can get kids at a certain level of proficiency, then they can go to college, and then if they can succeed in college, then they will be able to get a certain job, and then they will be living a certain life, and then we will have done our part. [It] was this assemblage of school successes getting kids in the position where then they could get into college and succeed in college. [It’s] not that that is bad, but I think there’s now just a much broader understanding [that] everyone should have the ability to go to college and they shouldn’t drown in debt if they do. [That’s] where the free college movement is really powerful. But there’s also a recognition that if we think just sending everyone to college is going to get you a good job, why do we not just send everyone to law school? Why do we not just send everyone to medical school because doctors make a lot of money? If everyone just got a bachelor’s degree, that would not actually solve the problems of our economy that we have right now. Yeah, and I guess that’s connected to what you’re saying—which is we have had a lot more people get bachelor’s degrees in the last 30 years, but [because they ended up working jobs that previously didn’t require bachelor’s degrees, they’re not actually advancing]. If the structure of the economy doesn’t have enough slots at the top, you need to change the structure, not just get more people into the slots. So here’s a question about [the charter school] movement before we turn to the [argument] against it: how much of it is earnest [idealism] and how much of it is a secret anti-union privatization push? Because this is what’s so hard when you’re looking at it. Like you look at [activist] Geoffrey Canada, and you hear speeches of the [educational organization] Harlem Children’s Zone, and you talk to some of these Teach for America teachers [who say], “I was inspired, I want to be part of the civil rights movement of our time.” They sound very sympathetic, and I think many of them really believe that they want to help with this. And then meanwhile you have the [billionaire] Walton family, which has shown no care at all for this country, funding [the push to privatize schools]—so I know there’s something craven going on. So what is the balance inside? … What percentage is ideology and what percentage is grift and what percentage is actual good work among the reform movement?It’s a great question, and it is something that people are grappling with all of the time. I know tons of charter school teachers, and they’re all great. Teaching is so hard, and it is so thankless, and… sometimes a lot of charter school teachers are working under even worse conditions than in traditional public schools, because they are nonunion mostly, and they can be fired at will. [I] also think that lots of people who went into Teach for America, like as I said earlier, for literally two decades no one questioned it. It didn’t have any stigma attached. You had a lot of basically young idealistic people who were like, “Oh, here’s an opportunity to teach.” And I think in the past five years there is a lot more awareness going in that maybe you are going to a controversial model. But I think that there are a lot of people [working in charter schools] who… don’t appreciate people bashing their schools because they’re like, “You’re not actually in the trenches with kids every day. You’re not talking to families, and the families want their kids at this school, you’re being an armchair critic.” … I take [those objections] seriously when there are people who are working with real kids everyday and trying to teach them. But I think that it can’t be denied that some of the biggest financial backers of the movement are individuals who definitely would not want to see the charter schools’ union movement continue. They would prefer to have that go away as fast as possible. I think there are funders of the movement, like Michael Bloomberg, [who do really want] to see schools improve, and [they don’t] really need to make money [off charter schools]. I don’t think [their] interest in school reform was based on [wanting] to get rich, I think [they just have] this business-minded view of how good organizations work… “Oh, we can inject business principles into a school system, and the schools will be better.”So, that’s kind of a difference. I think there are some people who come at it from that perspective where they’re like, “Let’s just get schools to operate more like businesses and then they’ll be better.” And then are a lot of Obama-era liberal types who are like, “I’m coming at it from a civil rights perspective, and I want to give poor families the same kind of choice that wealthy suburban white families had when they moved to those communities.” [So] they come at it from that perspective [of], “Why should we deny these poorer families the choices that maybe I had when I grew up.”[There] are definitely wings of the coalition that are just conservative and they overlap with the business people. But they are like, “Why would we have these monopolies with teacher unions? [Weakening] all of that is going to lead to better outcomes.” … I think there is a lot of grift in the education reform movement, but actually, in my experience, a lot of it comes from the consultants. There are tons of consultants that [say], “Oh, school improvement. Oh, we’ll help you get your charter renewed. Hire us for all of this money.” Or education technology companies or real estate companies that profit off of getting the land that then the schools can go on. I think a lot of the people who work directly with kids are not doing it for grift because it is actually still really hard work, but it’s a movement and they all [are kind of complicit]. Does that make sense?[Yes], and of course I was not insinuating at all that any teacher was like this. It’s just [that prominent backers of charter schools like] Bill Gates, [billionaire heiress] Powell Job … kind of bought into the meritocratic mindset. Right, like the Waltons are not trying to get rich, exactly–but they definitely think they have a better vision for what schooling should look like, you know. So let’s move to—now that we have kind of covered the reform group–let’s move to what has changed. [Tell]l our listeners a bit about the teachers’ union strikes that have happened and how that has affected the Democratic Party’s warmth towards charters and the like. Yeah. So, the party started trying to warm up more to teacher unions in 2016 during the presidential election. Teacher unions, they hated the Obama administration policies, but they didn’t want to actually be seen as criticizing Obama because Obama [was] popular. So they basically just criticized Arne Duncan, who was the Education Secretary, and those policies. But there was certainly a recognition [by Democrats] that. And by this time, there wasn’t just a backlash to standardized testing from teacher unions, there was also this really interesting growing backlash to standardized testing from conservatives and red state politicians and parents and communities who viewed Obama-era reforms as big government coming in and telling us how to run our schools. Starting a couple years before the 2016 election, there started to be this big anti-standardized testing movement that was really bipartisan but actually had a lot of conservative momentum. I remember being at [the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)]. I went to CPAC one year, in 2014 I think, and there was a table there that was against Race to the Top, or something, that said, “Take back our schools for teachers and students.” And I was like, this could have been at a left-wing conference as well, so. Exactly. I forgot to mention [that] one backdrop of the past decade was a lot of states pulled back funding for schools during the recession, and even when their economies bounced back, they never restored the funding to the same level as of pre-2008. So, public schools in most states have really been struggling because their states didn’t refill the coffers from when they took really intense cuts during the recession. [That] is a huge undercurrent behind a lot of the strikes, and it’s just [the result of] underfunded schools and teachers who have felt disrespected for the past decade by these policies and the lack of consideration for how much more and more and more and more people are expecting teachers to do with less and less and less and less. So all of this is happening in [2018, then] theteachers’ strikes break out, and they also happen at the same time that America—especially the Democratic Party and I would say independents too— are starting to realize, “Wait, all of these attacks on unions [lead to things like] like unions voting for Trump, this is terrible, we need to win back labor if we are ever going to get back our country. Oh, we’ve demonized labor for so long, we need to become a party that can support them again.”This is all happening, and also—teachers are beloved. Like teachers, public safety officials, the military… these are people [who] in surveys forever have always [been] regarded highly even though we treat them like shit often. But, you know, [seeing] teachers on strike was a very powerful thing for people to also realize how [bad] the conditions that teachers have been working under were. [A] lot of people I think did not realize how many teachers struggle. All of these [things were] happening at the same time. [The] Democratic Party [was] realizing the need to be better on unions, and the Obama administration certainly was not great to teacher unions. [The] teacher strikes [were] a reaction to a whole bunch of things, but certainly [they were] partially [due to a] lack of funding and disrespect, and expansion of charter schools came up in a bunch of states…. Actually, as I was preparing for this [podcast], I went back and I reviewedEva Moskowitz’s memoir[from] 2018. Eva Moskowitz is the CEO of Success Academy, which is a chain in New York City. And it is really amazing. Reading her book, which only came out two years ago, [it] sounds like it is just so wistful for a decade ago… She urges the public to approach the incoming inequality issue “delicately in an age when hedge fund managers can work from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.” And she scolds Bill de Blasio for his class war rhetoric, and she calls it “imprudent” and “dangerous.” And it feels really out of touch. [She’s saying], “Respect the hedge fund managers in case they decide not to fund your schools,” you know.….[I’d love] to end on some notes of hope and action. So, I want to do an open-ended question, but before I do, I would love to just talk about this one model, which is Montgomery County, [Maryland]. And I keep hearing from lefty education people thatMontgomery County does something rightthat other places aren’t doing right. And you’ve written about Montgomery County before as an alternative to the standards and accountability [of Obama’s] top-downmovement. Could you talk a little bit about what they do?[One] of the interesting things there is that they also wanted to take on teacher evaluation reform, but not in the way that the Obama administration education reformers wanted where it was this penalized ranking of teachers into “bad,” “ineffective,” etc. They wanted to build a more constructive model for teacher reform that was more about helping to support and mentor and add resources. And [the] former president of their union, who I know, just really kept emphasizing to me [that] teacher evaluation doesn’t have to be a bad thing. There are ways to make teacher evaluation good and supportive and helpful, and it’s not like teachers don’t want to get better. Of course they do. But for the past decade, teacher evaluation has been associated with measuring a teacher’s worth by how their students do on standardized tests, and so it has become really toxic. So, I think [one benefit of Montgomery County’s approach was] getting out of that mindset and saying, “Of course we want to help teachers do better, but it doesn’t have to be in such a punitive way.” And the other thing that Montgomery County [does well]—although there are some challenges to this currently—but they have also taken intentional efforts to do school integration and do thoughtful redistricting and student assignment. They are, I think, grappling with some of that now, but that has been a value that they have brought.[In] terms of other models… there are a lot of alternatives. [School] reform has been associated with these narrow sets of things: charter schools, test-based teacher accountability, school closures, etc. But school reform, I think a lot of education advocates would tell you, can be really positive, and I actually think Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren’s education plans both [had] really amazing ideas in them that I think, if even like a quarter of [them were implemented]…This is why you’ve got to listen to the end of the interview, listeners. There’s always a surprise.[When] I read the plans that they put out—which [were] certainly, I think, influenced by a lot of people—[it shows that people] have just been waiting for a chance to push the country in a different direction. There are a lot of really good ideas there. I know we’re running out of time, but could you run through a few of the elements of those plans, [very] rapid fire? What are some of the [exciting ideas]? Just to give people a taste so they can look it up later. Oh sure. There [were] a lot of ideas about ways to support teachers and support families to help make schools [better and address]… the kind of issues we were talking about, [to] bring some social services to make schools central parts to the community. School discipline reform to figure out ways that are less punitive in those circumstances. A lot of social [and] emotional support. Lots of schools do not have nurses, and guidance counselors. [Strengthening] libraries, and really [investing] in school infrastructure. That’s a huge problem. Lots of schools… don’t have working heaters in the winter or air conditioners in the summer, and it hugely affects a student’s ability to learn. [Reformers] got really tied up with statistical tools to boost learning, but actually a lot of kids need glasses. They don’t have glasses. A lot of kids need non-stuffy classrooms. So there are [a] lot of basic things that we could be doing to make schools more comfortable and accessible and warmer places. Well Rachel Cohen, thank you so much for coming to the World Headquarters to talk about this. There [are] a lot of changes happening in this space… So, I encourage all of our listeners to keep following your work covering this. And is there a website or newsletter that you want to promote so that they can keep track with what you’re writing? Ora Twitter handle?Well, if you guys want tofollow my newsletter, I welcome that…Thank you so much Rachel, have a good one. Yeah, thank you.",2,Generally Reliable,0.177641454789342,0.467183390748531,9154,2,Current Affairs
439,"High risk for three weeks, 13 communities in Massachusetts are back to Phase 3, step 1",-0.67,49.0,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/25/metro/high-risk-three-weeks-13-communities-massachusetts-are-back-phase-1/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-25,25,"Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the phase that the communities will roll back to. They will roll back to Phase 3, Step 1. Thirteen communities in Massachusetts will roll back to Phase 3, Step 1of the state’s reopening plan Monday after being designated high-risk for COVID-19 for three straight weeks. For many businesses in those cities and towns, that means scaling back — or worse, closing their doors altogether. On Thursday,the state reported 986 new coronavirus cases,the highest count in nearly five months. The state also released its weekly town-by-town data,which identified 77 cities and towns as high-risk, including Boston. Among those 77 are the 13 that have been listed in the red, or high-risk category, for three consecutive weeks. The towns reverting back to Phase 3, Step 1 are Acushnet, Brockton, Chelmsford, Holyoke, Hudson, Kingston, Leicester, Malden, Plymouth, Randolph, Waltham, Webster, and Woburn. Capacity will be cut back from 50 percent to 40 percent in arcades, driving and flight schools, gyms, libraries, and museums. Indoor theaters and performance venues, as well as roller skating rinks, trampoline parks, obstacle courses, laser tag and escape rooms must close. Some businesses now closing had only reopened a few weeks ago when the state moved into Phase III, Step 2, on Oct. 5. That’s the case at Roller Kingdom in Hudson, which reopened Oct. 5 for the first time since the governor declared a state of emergency in March in response to the pandemic.“We’ve been so careful, taking every precaution, and now we’re told we have close again,"" said Lisa Hores, an assistant manager at Roller Kingdom. Guests at the roller rink have their temperatures checked before coming in, Hores said. Everyone wears a mask, she said, and staff are frequently disinfecting surfaces around the facility. If any kids, or grown-ups, forget their masks, Hores said they keep fresh extras on hand to give out.

Kate Brown announced Wednesday morning she was extendingher executive order, allowing for the continued joint command as votes continue to be counted in the presidential election. The order places more law enforcement officers in Portland and allows for their potential use of tear gas to respond to any civil unrest that might arise from election results this week. It also keeps the Oregon National Guard on standby if needed. The initial order had been set to expire at 5 p.m. Wednesday.“Across the United States, elections officials are working hard to ensure that every vote is counted, and it may be several days until we know the results of this election,"" Brown said in a statement. “It’s important to trust the process, and the system that has ensured free and fair elections in this country through the decades, even in times of great crisis.”The governor again cautioned that any “political violence, intimidation and property destruction will not be tolerated. We are all in this together - so let’s work together to keep our fellow Oregonians safe.""Portland’s streets remained peaceful Tuesday night as more than 200 people marched through Southeast Portland as polls closed and election results started to be released. A much smaller group of protesters dressed all in black gathered on Southwest Main Street near the Justice Center later in the night and danced to music outside Portland Police Bureau headquarters on Southwest Second Avenue into the early hours. Late Tuesday,lawyers for the U. S. Department of Justice asked a federal judge to put an emergency hold on his order thatrestricts federal officers from engaging in crowd control actions beyond a nine-square block area outside the federal courthouse in downtown Portland as the government appeals.

The 44th president got some flak for the remarks, which he expanded on in an appearance on “The Daily Show” on Tuesday, Dec. 15. He told hostTrevor Noahthat he was a staunch supporter of the explosion of activism that has occurred in the last year.“Nothing made me more optimistic during a very difficult year than the activism that we saw in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, and Black Lives Matter,” Obama said. “And I have consistently believed that, their courage, activism, media savvy, strategic resolve, far exceeds anything that I could have done at their age and, I think, has shifted the conversation in ways that I would not even have imagined a couple of years ago.”The former president suggested that the reason his words “caught attention” was because people believed he was arguing that the phrase prevented Democrats from doing better in the congressional elections.“That actually was not the point I was making,” he said. “I was making a very particular point around if we, in fact, want to translate the very legitimate belief that how we do policing needs to change and that if there is, for example, a homeless guy ranting and railing in the middle of the street, sending a mental health worker rather than an armed, untrained police officer to deal with that person might be a better outcome for all of us and make us safer.”“That if we describe that to not just white folks but, let’s say, Michelle [Obama’s] mom, that makes sense to them,” he continued. “But if we say ‘defund the police,’ not just white folks but Michelle’s mom might say, ‘If I’m getting robbed, who am I gonna call, and is somebody gonna show up?’”Obama indicated that, ultimately, he wasn’t trying to imply that people should be made to feel “comfortable” as opposed to confronting those speaking truth to power.“The issue, to me, is not making them comfortable. It is, can we be precise with our language enough that people who might be persuaded around that particular issue to make a particular change that gets a particular result that we want. … What’s the best way for us to describe that?”When Obama originally made his comments concerning “defund the police” on the Snapchat political show “Good Luck America,” he immediately faced backlash, particularly from progressive Democrats. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar wrote on Twitter in response, “We lose people in the hands of police. It’s not a slogan but a policy demand. And centering the demand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country gets us progress and safety.”Kentucky state Rep. Charles Booker also sent out a Tweet that said, “We didn’t lose Breonna because of a slogan. Instead of conceding this narrative, let’s shape our own.”US Rep.-elect Jamaal Bowman posted on Twitter, “The problem is America’s comfort with Black death — not discomfort with slogans.”Damn, Mr. President. Didn’t you say “Trayvon could’ve been my son?”In 2014,#BlackLivesMatterwas too much. In 2016, Kaepernick was too much. Today, discussing police budgets is too much. The problem is America's comfort with Black death — not discomfort with slogans. so, in the same interview, Obama himself criticized his party for not properly recognizing its more progressive members, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been vocal in her support of defunding the police departments to institute structural changes in the law enforcement system.",3,Reliable,0.1623983739837398,0.4136178861788618,809,3,Atlanta Black Star

Drain the swamp, and all that. He came into office almost four years ago vowing to upend Beltway norms, and now he insists on leaving in similarly unconventional fashion. It is too fitting that the Trump presidency concludes amid a babel of bluster and bravado. But the president does a disservice to his more rabid supporters by insisting that he would have won the Nov. 3 election absent voter fraud. That’s simply false. Amid a flurry of lawsuits in battleground states — including Nevada — Mr. Trump has yet to admit defeat. It’s possible that he’ll never offer an official concession to Joe Biden. The president’s campaign is certainly within its rights to request recounts or challenge what it believes are improprieties. If GOP legal efforts are successful at identifying instances of voter irregularities or highlighting election procedures that invite abuse, they will not be for naught. There is no evidence, however, that fraud cost Mr. Trump the election, no matter how much the president tweets the opposite and his supporters wish it so. Mr. Trump would still trail in Pennsylvania even if mail-in ballots received after Election Day were discarded. He would remain well behind Mr. Biden in Nevada even if unverified GOP claims of thousands of illegal votes were dropped from the tally. In fact, rhetoric from Trump surrogates alleging widespread illegal activity has been devoid of detailed evidence supporting the charge that there was a concerted effort to “steal” the election through corruption. An electoral system that involves the participation of 150 million Americans will have its share of issues, but it’s an insult to reason and logic to argue that isolated irregularities constitute proof of a grand national conspiracy. Why, if there were some orchestrated Democratic attempt to rig the balloting, did the party underachieve in congressional and statewide balloting across the country?Occam’s razor applies here. The simplest explanation is typically the correct one. Mr. Trump indeed faced an overtly hostile press, a political establishment that treated him as an enemy occupier and an opposition party that took leave of its senses at the mere thought of his existence. But Mr. Trump lost this election because he ultimately didn’t attract enough votes and failed to win a handful of swing states that broke his way in 2016. Mr. Trump can keep fighting — and no doubt will. In the meantime, however, he has nothing to lose by cooperating with President-elect Biden’s transition team. Mr. Trump expected no less from the Obama administration in 2016 even as Hillary’s acolytes floated ways to manipulate the Electoral College vote. Mr. Biden deserves the same consideration today regardless of how long the president seeks to delay the inevitable.",3,Reliable,0.0326984126984127,0.4837698412698413,584,3,Las Vegas Review-Journal
443,White House Officially Endorses “Long Overdue” DC Statehood,-14.33,39.67,https://truthout.org/articles/white-house-officially-endorses-long-overdue-d-c-statehood/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"The White House officially endorsed the effort to make Washington, D. C. the 51st state on Tuesday, calling the region’s statehood “long overdue.” The endorsement comes ahead of a vote on Thursday when the House is expected to pass a bill making D. C. a state. “The Administration strongly supports H. R. 51, the Washington, D. C. Admission Act,” reads the statement from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). “For far too long, the more than 700,000 people of Washington, D. C. have been deprived of full representation in the U. S. Congress.” “This taxation without representation and denial of self-governance is an affront to the democratic values on which our Nation was founded,” the statement continues. “H. R. 51 rights this wrong by making Washington, D. C. a state and providing its residents with long overdue full representation in Congress, while maintaining a Federal District that will continue to serve as our Nation’s seat of government.” The Statement of Administration Policy is stronger and more formal than President Joe Biden’s support of D. C. statehood that White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed last month. Statements of Administration Policy are official actions taken by the OMB to register the viewpoints of the White House with Congress. Tuesday’s statement “calls for the Congress to provide for a swift and orderly transition to statehood for the people of Washington, D. C.” The House will likely pass H. R. 51 this week, but it stands little chance of passing the filibuster threshold in the Senate. This will mark the second time the House has passed legislation to make D. C. a state. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting House representative for the region, expressed gratitude for the OMB statement on Tuesday. Norton has been pushing Congress to make D. C. a state for 30 years. “Thank you to the Biden administration for to day’s statement supporting H. R. 51,” Norton said in a statement. “The residents of our nation’s capital deserve voting representation in Congress and full local self-government, and with Thursday’s House vote and expected passage, along with Democratic control of the Senate and White House, we have never been closer to statehood.” Democrats have renewed the statehood push this year as they took control of Congress and the White House. The legislation has over 200 co-sponsors in the House and 44 co-sponsors in the Senate. Advocates argue that the statehood push is about representation for all of D. C., but especially the many disenfranchised Black residents who live there. D. C. is 46 percent Black, though that percentage has shrunk over the years as the region has been gentrified. The history of the push to make D. C. a state has been fraught with racism as white legislators fought to keep the formerly majority-Black area disenfranchised. “In the midst of our national reckoning on racism — and those who are quick to quote Dr. King and John Lewis, but obstruct things like DC statehood — uplifting Black political power must be a part of the conversation. We cannot allow electoral justice for the people of Washington DC to be denied any longer,” said Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts) during a hearing last month on H. R. 1. Pressley argued that statehood is an issue of racial justice. Republicans remain staunchly opposed to D. C. statehood and have offered a plethora of absurd reasons for their opposition. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) claimed on Tuesday that D. C. wouldn’t qualify as a congressional district — but the area is home to more people than the entire state of Wyoming. Others have claimed that it shouldn’t be a state because it doesn’t have a car dealership or airport, ignoring the fact that it does have car dealerships and many of the other states incorporated in the 1700s didn’t have them back the n, either. At the end of the day, these absurd statements are cover for the fact that Republicans simply don’t want D. C. to become a state because it leans heavily Democratic, which means that Democrats would get more seats in Congress. Advocates argue that, whatever the political leanings of the region, its residents deserve voting representation in Congress. “Washingtonians have waited over 200 years for the representation we deserve as American citizens,” said D. C. Mayor Muriel Bowser in January. “To paraphrase Dr. King: when any American is denied democracy, our entire nation is denied those voices and votes.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.0556966726084373,0.3950746965452849,988,1,Truthout
444,Talking Trash: Unfortunate Truths About Recycling,-10.33,39.5,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/16/talking-trash-unfortunate-truths-about-recycling/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"Americans have come to embrace recycling their trash with an almost religious fervor, but in some sense they are praying to a false god. In the quarter-century over which its acolytes have swelled, recycling has almost come full circle, from near total indifference all the way around to near total impossibility. In between, and especially over the past couple of years, just when many localities had seen the light, their recycling efforts started bogging down. It wasn’t just that China banned imports of raw recyclables from the US in early 2018, although that was a wallop that the industry hasn’t recovered from. A 2018reportfrom the Washington State Ecology Department notes:China is the largest consumer of North American recyclables. One-third of all scrap material collected in the U. S. is shipped overseas, with the large majority going to China. In 2016, the U. S. exported $5.6 billion in scrap commodities to China. This makes recyclable materials the sixth largest U. S. export to China.[1]The prime reason China gave for rejecting American trash was that its valuable plastics were laced with non-recyclable contaminants. This was true, and I’ll talk about why, but Trump’s tariffs and geopolitical rivalry probably made it happen when it did. Regardless, even had China not shut that door, we would still be in a tizzy over how to make our vast waste stream go away. Americans simply buy and toss too much stuff and their expectations that it will all be magically disposed of properly simply don’t jibe with reality. When I first lobbied for recycling more household waste in the 1980s, few types of rubbish could be handled by recycling facilities—if you or your department of public works could find one. A lot has changed for the better since then. Accordingto the economic consulting firm John Dunham & Associates, by 2017 the US recycling industry had an economic impact of $117 billion and directly or indirectly employed more than 534,500 workers to collect, haul, process, and furnish facilities, equipment, transportation, and supplies.[2]But how can we tell if that money is well spent, how well are towns, cities, states, and the industry handling all the stuff we keep throwing out, and what’s a citizen-consumer to do about it?Last year, our town just west of Boston switched solid waste vendors to boost trash collection to new heights of automation. Within a month, its new contractor had distributed two massive two-wheeled receptacles to every household: a black one with a 64-gallon capacity for garbage, and a bigger blue 96-gallon one—large enough to stuff a couple of non-dismembered bodies into — for recyclables. The town instructed residents to wheel out their carts and line them along the curb on pickup day, front facing the street, with lids closed. Citizens dutifully obey, emplacing the sturdy sentinels to form temporary no-parking zones. And in winter, when snow mounds up over curbs, the carts make driving along narrow streets even more of a slalom. My household’s carts are rarely more than a quarter full. As they are a pain to rumble out to the curb, I’m sometimes tempted to deposit our one or two waste bags in a neighbor’s cart. But that somehow feels more transgressive that it should, and, as many residents top theirs off and some keep going, there might not be room in it. It’s hard to imagine how one family can possibly generate that much solid waste, but a lot of them do. Overflowing carts are officially prohibited, but they get emptied anyway, with occasional spillage for critters to root through. Trash gets picked up every week; recycling every other week on the same day. Two sets of towering garbage trucks lumber through the streets with retractable robot arms that grasp one-inch-thick steel bars on the bins to tip them into their hoppers, and then set the empties down with a resounding thud. As the new carts plus contents are too heavy for most mortals to lift, the robots are necessary. And, whereas each truck formerly had a driver plus one or two sanitation workers to pick up and empty our old trash barrels, now only the drivers remain. Even aided by cameras and other sensors to deploy the arms, the driver has more to do than before, and the workers that formerly rode with them are ostensibly looking for jobs, perhaps repairing robots. The new receptacles are unwieldy, hulking eyesores that clog curbs and take up more space to stow than the barrels they replaced, which either now clutter yards and driveways or were pitched into the waste stream. The new bins’ greater capacity encourages residents to consume more stuff and, being free, deprive stores that sell trash barrels of accustomed revenues, their distant supplier having cut out those middlemen. On the plus side, we now have single-stream recycling, meaning we can chuck all our recyclable items, whether paper, glass, metal, or plastic, into the same bin. No more sorting conundrums like “Does this juice carton go with paper or plastic?” Nonetheless, such convenience comes at a price. After decades of nagging by environmental pressure groups and citizen activists, the public and municipal officials are starting to get real—even enthusiastic—about recycling. The same forces have pressured consumer product companies, food processors, and food vendors to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, with some success. But while less waste goes to waste than used to, much of it—particularly plastics—poses difficult challenges to recyclers as the composition of the waste stream and demand for recycled materials have changed. Take paper products: Thanks mainly to electronic documents and drastic declines in newspaper readership, there’s a lot less recyclable paper being tossed out and less demand for it. Also, the supply of corrugated cardboard (think home delivery detritus) keeps growing. Cardboard can be transformed into more of the same and building materials. For paper, less consumption means a smaller or stagnant market for recycled paper fiber. As waste paper becomes less valuable, fewer recycling haulers want to handle it, and those that do may charge municipalities more for the privilege. Increasingly replaced by plastic ones, fewer glass bottles and jars are being discarded. Their affixed labels make them unsuitable for remanufacturing, so most get get pulverized for mixing into concrete and asphalt, but that product isn’t very profitable. Too, the plastic containers superseding them keep getting flimsier. Many are made of lower-grade resin that isn’t economical to recycle into other products. And because they are so much lighter, a ton of them (the unit of measure for valuing most recyclable materials) takes up way more space than glass, metal, or paper, decreasing the tonnage and thus the value of a truckload of baled plastic. Many containers are made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate, a clear polyester resin, also made into plastic sheets and films). Despite possibly leaching endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the more rigid PET containers are sought-after recyclables. However, for PET to be eligible for remanufacturing, flimsy lower-grade containers must first be separated out. As triaging PET is labor-intensive, many processing facilities don’t bother to, prompting some of China’s complaints. To discover which type of plastic you are about to toss, you should refer to its resin code, fuzzily embossed within a triangle on container bottoms (keep a magnifier handy). But bearing such a brand doesn’t necessarily mean an item is recyclable. That totally depends on whether the recycling facility your trash gets sent to accepts that code, which isn’t generally easy to know (ask your local DPW.) Here’s a cheat sheet that identifies the seven most common resins, what they are used for, and what types of products they can be recycled into. PET’s code number is one. Confounding this regime, many containers for food and consumer products imported from abroad don’t carry resin identifiers, puzzling diligent consumers and complicating their recycling. In addition, many foods now come in even lighter packaging, such as thin-film pouches. Think about potato chips, which once came in wax or coated paper bags; now many are sealed in metalized Mylar (PET) pouches. While they create less waste, pouches aren’t a win for recyclers because there’s less substance to make new things out of and what there is may consist of compound materials that can’t be economically separated. And so, much packaging gets buried or burned. In a landfill, its half-life is measured in centuries. Combusted in a furnace, it fills the air we breathe with all sorts of exciting compounds. And even if recyclable, many plastics expose humans to allergens, immune suppressants, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens with effects such as adiposity, insulin resistance, and decreased levels of sex hormones, harming children most of all.[3]Those nice heavy-duty black takeout food containers—and in fact all black plastics—aren’t recyclable, by the way. Even though most are PET, as sturdy as they may be, they end up in landfills because the spectral scanners that inform automate sorting machines can’t see into them to determine what they’re made of. If you are presented with one, feel free to wash and reuse it and request that the vendor switch to paper containers like Chinese food boxes. Being plastic-coated, they aren’t recyclable either, but at least they aren’t completely plastic. And then there is food wrap, lightweight plastic grocery and produce bags, bubble wrap, and those puffy little pillows that you find nestled in delivery parcels that get thrown or blown into oceans and waterways, strangling or immobilizing marine animals. Nearly nine million tons of plastics enter the world’s oceans every year, much of which nature has kindly accumulated in five giant garbage patches around the planet, as The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and others have reported. The largest of these, thebetween Hawaii and the US mainland, is the size of France. Nonprofit organizationThe Ocean Cleanup[4]explains that, over time, plastic items degrade into tiny motes of “microplastic” that marine organisms ingest and pass up the food chain, eventually to people. Plastic bags aren’t suitable for recycling but many are disposed of as if they were, along with flimsy, clear clam-shell produce containers and crinkly beverage bottles—all low-grade materials that can’t be given a new life, despite being labeled with an acceptable resin number. They must be separated at the plant to prevent grinders from seizing up and reusable byproducts from being polluted. Given China’s trash embargo, there is room for improvement. To add to our confusion, different localities have varying rules governing what materials are accepted for recycling. You might be told not to recycle glassware along with bottles. Lids may or may not need to be removed from bottles and jars. Tinfoil, egg cartons, or empty pill bottles may or may not be accepted. Certain resin identifiers may be excluded, as may small metal items and scraps, but not cans. Accordingto the East Bay Express, even so-called “compostable bioplastic” containers, tableware, and utensils are likely to be unwanted. Sadly, although made from plant material such as starch, chitin, and sugar cane, they won’t degrade in your compost heap; it takes processing plants with high-temperature digesters to break them down, but once tossed into the waste stream they are rarely rescued. Same for compostable clear bioplastics made with PLA (polylactic acid, identified by a green stripe). Most consumers blithely recycle them along with petroleum-based plastics. If recyclers can’t sort them out, the batch is apt to be declared contaminated and sent to a landfill.[5]There’s a long way to go. Despite a leveling off of per-capita waste creation, our total waste production continues to climb:For further inconvenient facts and figures on recycling in the US, though not the most up-to-date, see, a publication by the EPA that quantifies trends in material generation and disposal methods between 1960 and 2015.[6]Among other things, it reveals that paper products by far have the highest rate of recycling: 66 percent, by weight, in 2015. The worst? Plastic, at 9.1 percent, as this chart (courtesy ofThe Technoskeptic) shows. See also theWaste360 website[7]for many interactive graphics depicting what gets recycled and what doesn’t.* * *You wanna help? Bring reusable bags with you when you shop. Top off a durable water bottle with filtered tap water and take it with you when you leave home. Don’t buy bottled water or any beverage in flimsy bottles. (In any event, bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline and may not be all that pure.) Tell your grocer you want to take home produce in paper bags or cardboard containers, not those clear plastic ones that are so hard to wrench open and whose future uses are limited to growing seedlings. Better yet, bring reusable produce bags with you when you shop. Also, ask the meat counter to wrap meat, poultry and fish in paper rather than put them out shrink-wrapped polystyrene trays, or at least to dispense with the trays. Buy beer and soda in cans or glass bottles. Lobby for “bottle bills” that require deposits on drink containers and for bans on disposable plastic grocery bags. Bring your own mugs to cafés and invest in a few metal straws. Compost food scraps and dispose of what you can’t in paper sacks rather than in plastic garbage bags whose sole mission is to be buried or burned. If you’re an apartment dweller, advocate for a municipal composting program to divert food scraps from landfills to community gardens. And when you need durable goods, find used appliances, furniture, clothes, and electronics on Craigslist or Freecycle or at rummage sales. Ten of my 12 cars were pre-owned. Each one avoided the junkyard for up to ten years and helped keep my auto mechanic in business. Join environmental groups working in your area to reduce the waste steam and ban stuff like Styrofoam containers, plastic bags, cutlery, and straws. Good progress is being made in banning or cutting down on non-reusable plastic items and toxic ingredients likebisphenol-A(BPA).[8]Even so, there’s only so much a person, an organization, or even the recycling industry itself can do to stem the tsunami of product containers, more and more of which are of such complex or exotic construction that they cannot be recycled at all. These sorts of trashy innovations have to be curtailed. The only reason for having a 96-gallon recycling cart is to hold all those boxes and containers that consumable products come in. If mountains of unusable refuse are the necessary price of economic growth, we need to rethink the whole economy, starting with home economics. Reduce mail orders. Buy locally made products from local retailers and pay them with cash or checks. (They’ll thank you.) Choose and demand low-tech packaging, preferably plant-based that can be recycled, downcycled, or composted. Bone up on which plastics can harm your health. Reuse empty containers that are hard to recycle to the extent it’s practical or safe. Walk, cycle, scoot, or take transit to the store and of course, don’t forget your shopping bags.[1]China’s Recycling Ban, Dept. of Ecology, University of Washington, [2]Global Recycling Magazine (2018),, [3]Rustagi, N., Pradhan, S.

The group, called the Coalition for TJ, contends that a new “holistic review” admissions program will significantly reduce the proportion of Asian-American students at the high school in Alexandria, Va.“Plaintiff’s data analysts project that Asian-American student enrollment at TJ will drop from 73 percent under the merit-based race-blind admissions system to 31 percent under the new racial-balancing admissions system for the Class of 2025,”says the lawsuit filed in U. S. District Court in Alexandria. “No other racial group is projected to lose seats. The greatest beneficiary of the new admissions system in terms of increased population will be white students.”The Fairfax County school district did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. According to the 187,000-student district, in suburban Washington, D. C., Thomas Jefferson had a 2019-20 student enrollment that was 71.5 percent Asian, 19.48 percent non-Hispanic White, 2.6 percent Hispanic or Latino, 1.72 percent Black, and 4.70 percent other. The school system, whose overall student enrollment is 38 percent White, 27 percent Hispanic, 20 percent Asian, and 10 percent Black, has made efforts to boost diversity at Thomas Jefferson in recent years, to little avail. The 2020 racial reckoning over the death of George Floyd in police custody and related events prompted renewed efforts to increase diversity at the selective school, which was founded in 1985.“Over the past 10 years, the [Thomas Jefferson] admissions process has undergone a series of changes that were intended to impact issues of diversity and inclusion,” the school systemsaid in a white paper last year. “Nonetheless, … these changes have not made a significant impact on the diversity of the applicants or admitted students.”Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brabrand last year proposed eliminating Thomas Jefferson’s admissions test in favor of five “regional pathways” based on middle schools, with each being allocated a set number of seats in the incoming first-year class to be determined by lottery. Under that plan, Black student enrollment would have increased to 7 percent, while Asian student enrollment would drop to 54 percent, and White student enrollment would increase to 25 percent. The Fairfax County School Board voted to eliminate the entrance exam in October. In December, the board adopted an alternative new plan. Under that plan, the top 1.5 percent of each of the district’s middle schools who meet certain minimum academic standards will be eligible for admission to Thomas Jefferson. The district will then conduct a holistic review that examines factors including each student’s grade-point average, a problem-solving essay, and “experience factors” that include whether they are economically disadvantaged, English-language learners, or from underrepresented middle schools.“Experience factors will allow consideration of contexts that require a student to demonstrate grit and persevere through challenges to meet the [Thomas Jefferson] applicant requirements,” the school system’s white paper said. The district did not offer specific projections for changes in racial and ethnic balance under the holistic review plan. The new system is taking effect this spring for the class of 2025 that enters the high school this fall. The lawsuit by Coalition for TJ argues that the new admissions system violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause because “although facially race-neutral, it was enacted with discriminatory intent.”The lawsuit cites a 2020 email from Thomas Jefferson Principal Ann Bonitatibus to the school community saying that the racial composition of the high school does not reflect that of the school system overall.“If our demographics actually represented [Fairfax County Public Schools], we would enroll 180 Black and 460 Hispanic students, filling nearly 22 classrooms,” the principal’s email said.“This email put the focus squarely on race and the racial balance at TJ, foreshadowing changes to come,” says the suit, which cites other comments by officials in the district about the need to make Thomas Jefferson more representative.“Defendants have been forthright that the changes to the TJ admissions policy are intended to reduce the proportion of Asian-American students enrolled at TJ because they are ‘overrepresented’ compared to the rest of [Fairfax County Public Schools],” the suit says.“They want to match the racial makeup of the county as a whole,” Glenn E. Roper, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing Coalition for TJ, said in an interview. “That was the motivating purpose. School districts can change an admissions program, but they can’t do it with a racially discriminatory purpose.”The lawsuit comes as the U. S. Supreme Court has upheld the holistic consideration of race in college admissions but has achallenge to Harvard’s race-conscious admissions programawaiting a decision from the justices on whether they will review that case. In 2007, when the U. S. Supreme Court struck down two school districts’ voluntary race-conscious plans for assigning students to schools, inParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote a concurrence that suggested there were permissible ways for districts to boost racial diversity through race-conscious means. One of those was “drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods,” Kennedy wrote in his concurrence, which some legal experts consider the controlling opinion inParents Involvedbecause much of the main opinion in that case was a mere plurality. The Fairfax County plan for Thomas Jefferson High aims to be a race-neutral plan for increasing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity, the very kind of plan that many advocates have urged schools and colleges to adopt instead of race-conscious policies. It will be up to a federal district court, for starters, to decide whether the plan was adopted with the impermissible racial motivation alleged in the lawsuit.",3,Reliable,0.0850461353982481,0.3197953376826615,1289,3,Education Week

The Ohio-based team's old name - adopted in 1915 - had long been criticised as racist by Native American groups. The new name references a pair of well-known statues in the city of Cleveland. Plans to change the name were first announced last December, in the wake of widespread racial justice protests. Team owner Paul Dolan at the time said he had an ""awakening or epiphany"" about the name following the death of George Floyd, an African-American man murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis last May. A year earlier, the team dropped their ""Chief Wahoo"" logo. That logo, first used in 1947, pictured a red-faced and smiling cartoon man wearing a single feather. Native American activists said it was an offensive racial caricature. The Cleveland Guardians owe their new moniker to the ""Guardians of Traffic"" statues on a local bridge. The Guardians have a new logo too - a baseball flanked with winged letter Gs. Actor Tom Hanks narrated the team's Twitter video reveal of the changes.""It has always been Cleveland that has been the best part of our name,"" he said. ""This is the city we love and the game we believe in and together we are all Cleveland Guardians.""These changes come amid widespread pressure to drop racist and offensive team names across the country. Last July, amid pressure from lawmakers and activists, Washington DC's American football team announced it was dropping its ""Redskins"" name. They have since been called the Washington Football Team. Activists also hope to change the names of a number of other teams that continue to invoke Native American stereotypes, including the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Blackhawks, and Kansas City Chiefs.

449,The US Blockade on Cuba Must End,-20.0,31.0,https://jacobinmag.com/2021/07/us-policy-cuba-blockade-embargo-protests-rubio-history-war-covid-food-medicine-shortages,https://adfontesmedia.com/jacobin-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,24,"For sixty years, the United States has aimed to strangle Cuba’s economy and inflict misery on the Cuban people. Blockades are methods of war — and it’s time for the war on Cuba to end. Richard Nixon, then Dwight D. Eisenhower’s vice president, met with Cuba’s Fidel Castro on April 19, 1959, in Washington, DC. Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today.“They always blame the United States,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)saidon the Senate floor this week. “The embargo, the first thing they blame, it’s the embargo. ‘The embargo is causing all this.’”Not long after the UN General Assembly voted for the twenty-ninth straight year to condemn the six-decade-long US embargo on Cuba — a 184-2 vote that pitted only the US and Israeli governments against the rest of the entire world — the country has erupted in massive protests over widespread food and medicine shortages. A chorus of voices, ranging fromBernie Sandersand othercongressionalprogressivesto former Brazilian presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvaand Mexican presidentAndrés Manuel López Obrador, have blamed the conditions on the long-standing US policy, and called for it to be finally lifted. Regime-change advocates like Rubio have pushed back against this. For them, the embargo is irrelevant to what’s now happening in the country, which they claim instead isa product of“six decades of suffering under totalitarian socialism and communism.” Predictably, their preferred response to the current protests doesn’t involve ending the policy. But the reality is that the US “embargo” — or blockade, more accurately — was designed to exacerbate scarcity and encourage social unrest in Cuba. For decades, the blockade has strangled the country’s economy and deprived Cubans of access to essentials like medical supplies, its success at creating misery only intensifying with the fall of the Soviet Union, the coronavirus pandemic, and four years of “maximum pressure” under President Trump. As eighty House Democratstold Joe Bidenat the start of this year, “with the stroke of a pen,” he could undo Trump’s actions and “assist struggling Cuban families and promote a more constructive approach by promptly returning to the Obama-Biden administration policy of engagement and normalization of relations.” But this obvious course of action is the very least Washington should do. The US blockade has been a generations-long undeclared economic war on Cuba, one that has consistently failed even on its own terms while inflicting enormous pain on ordinary Cubans. The US blockade on Cuba has been a key part of Washington’s long-standing war on the country, launched shortly after Fidel Castro led a revolution overthrowing the country’s US-backed military dictatorship in 1959. Thingsdidn’t start out entirely hostile. The Eisenhower administration publicly took a cagey wait-and-see attitude toward the new government. Meeting with Castro for three and a half hours, then–vice president Richard Nixon advised him, according to a post-meeting memo, “that it was the responsibility of a leader not always to follow public opinion but to help to direct it in proper channels, not to give the people what they think they want at a time of emotional stress but to make them want what they ought to have.” With a tinge of regret, Nixon recounted that Castro’s “primary concern was with developing programs for economic progress.”By September that year, as Castro restricted private ownership of agricultural land and prepared to nationalize foreign-owned industry, the US ambassador to the country expressed “our serious concern at the treatment being given American private interests in Cuba.” The next month, president Dwight Eisenhower approved a program backing anti-Castro elements — including Cuban exiles launching raids on the country and, later, US-supplied sabotage and bombing campaigns — in the hopes that it would topple Castro and make him appear to have caused his own undoing. By December, a CIA division head would advise that “thorough consideration be given to the elimination of Fidel Castro.”The Cold War gave this US mission extra urgency. Eisenhowerwarnedthe Soviets in 1960 that his administration wouldn’t tolerate “the establishment of a regime dominated by international communism in the Western hemisphere,” in line withlong-standing Washington doctrinethat the US government would intervene in countries in the hemisphere if they ran counter to US interests. Hoping to stop the spread of “Castroism” and end it in Cuba, Washington pressured other Latin American countries to cut off diplomatic ties, travel, and arms shipments to the country, threatening to suspend military aid and other penalties to those who didn’t comply, eventually twisting enough arms to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States. After successfully pressuring European and Canadian banks to cancel and refuse loans to the Cuban government, what was termed a US “quarantine” of the country began in October 1960, barring all exports to Cuba, aside from food and medical supplies, and over the next few years adding all trade, imports, and even goods from third-party countries containing Cuban materials. By 1963, under John F. Kennedy, the blockade as we know it today was fully in place. This was no small thing. A blockade —distinctfrom an embargo, by including imports and trying to coerce third-party countries — is amethod of warthat, under international law, is meant to only take place during armed conflict. It’s not for nothing thatlegal scholarshavearguedthat the blockade of Cuba is a serious violation of international law, not least for the fact that it’s aimed explicitly at forcing a change in government. Even the US government’s own legal advisorsdeterminedin 1962 that it “could be regarded by Cuba and other Soviet bloc nations as an act of war.”Just as Nixon would respond to the 1973 election of a socialist government in Chile byordering the CIAto “make the economy scream,” US policymakers openly hoped impoverishing and starving the Cuban people would lead them to overthrow Castro. “Every possible means should be undertaken promptly to weaken the economic life of Cuba,” one State Department officialwrote in 1960, in order “to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.” Eisenhowersaid it more plainly: “If they (the Cuban people) are hungry, they will throw Castro out.”As Cuba’s largest and closest trading partner, the United States produced animmediate impact on its economywhen it ended trade. The share of Cuban exports going stateside plummeted from the more than 60 percent it stood at through the 1950s to less than 5 percent by 1961, while the roughly 70 percent of imports that entered the country from the United States by the end of the 1950s cratered at less than 4 percent. By 2018, a UN agencyestimatedthe embargo had cost Cuba more than $130 billion over six decades, significant for a country whose average annual GDP is amere fraction of that sum. It was the Soviet bloc that kept Cuba’s economy afloat for decades, both through billions of annual subsidies and by filling the trade vacuum left by the United States, becoming responsible for 79 to 90 percent of Cuba’s overseas trade. From fuel, machinery, and parts, to fertilizers, pesticides, and even the fats used to make soaps, the resources that allowed life and the economy in Cuba to function normally flowed because of Cuba’s integration into a broader Communist camp. The Soviet Union’s dissolution in 1991 was the biggest of several shocks that hit the Cuban economy that decade, leaving it more vulnerable than ever to the US blockade. GDP nose-dived by 35 percent, while agricultural output and manufacturing capacity collapsed by 47 and 90 percent, respectively. Construction and passenger transportation plunged by more than 70 percent each, while food queues, hours of no running water, and blackouts became a regular part of life. With soap suddenly needing rationing, Cubans had to make do with four measly bars a year. Smelling blood, US lawmakers moved in for the kill. When Cuban trade with US corporate subsidiaries sharply rose in the wake of the Soviet crack-up, US congress passed the Cuban Democracy Act the following year to bar the practice, over the objections of the European Community and other allies, leading to the cancellation of dozens of trade deals with the country. On top of this, the law banned the sale of food for the first time (later repealed,sort of) and created a licensing regime for medicine and medical equipment so onerous that it functionally served to end medical commerce with the country. US lawmakers, it seemed, had no problem with heavy-handed government interference in the private sector, so long as it was at the service of overthrowing a government they didn’t like. The EU similarly objected to the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which took authority for the blockade away from the president and gave it to Congress, all but cementing it into place. Besides making revolution a prerequisite for lifting it, it further discouraged foreign investment into Cuba by, for instance, denying US visas to representatives of firms doing business with confiscated US property. This, even though a year later US military and intelligence agenciesdeterminedthat “Cuba does not pose a significant security threat to the United States or other countries in the region,” and the Pentagon concluded the same thing a year after that. The results, as you might imagine, were brutal. After a yearlong investigation, the American Association for World Healthconcludedin 1997 that the blockade had “dramatically harmed the health and nutrition of large numbers of ordinary Cuban citizens” and “caused a significant rise in suffering — and even deaths — in Cuba” through “critical shortages of even the most basic medicines and medical hardware.”The report painted a chaotic picture: increased disease as a result of more untreated water and less soap; ambulances, other emergency services, and health care facilities unable to function properly thanks to power outages and a lack of resources like fuel; high rates of anemia, iron deficiency, and undernourishment, the latter of which affected 22 percent of the population at one point; and hundreds of medicines out of reach or only sometimes available, made all the worse by pharmaceutical megamergers. Little surprise that 1994 saw similar civil unrest in Cuba as we’re seeing now. These conditions werecelebratedby the right-wing Heritage Foundation that year. Describing with relish reports of mothers turning to sex work, families subsisting on one meal a day, and the return of diseases like malaria, it urged the US government to keep the blockade in place until Castro’s government collapsed and to deny him a “much-needed safety valve” by turning away Cuban refugees. It casually noted the policy would likely lead tomorerepression for the Cuban people and possibly end in “bloodshed, armed conflict, and chaos,” before concluding, with no trace of irony, that “the United States must not abandon the Cuban people by relaxing or lifting the trade embargo.”So, when Marco Rubio says today that “food, medicine and gas shortages are sadly nothing new in Cuba,” he’s right: modern history’s longest blockade has ensured these problems have been going on for a long time. That Cuba weathered all this is a testament to the benefits of what’s possible with a government that takes an active role during crises and seeks to guarantee economic security. With belt-tightening inevitable, the government launched a program of “humanistic austerity,” with major cuts to the state sector but increased health care and social spending, and food, clothing, and other goods rationed to prioritize vulnerable groups like pregnant women and the elderly. Yet such temporary measures have their limits, as we’re seeing now. While Cuba’s economy is certainly plagued by serious issues separate from US policy, the ills being felt most acutely are overwhelmingly driven by two factors: the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” strategy and the pandemic. Over his four years in office, Trumpsignedmore than two hundred directives aimed at making Cuba’s economy scream. He sharply restricted remittances (to one family member at a maximum of $1,000 per quarter) beforeeffectively banning themoutright. He alsobarredUS travelers from carrying out any transactions with entities tied to the military and intelligence and security services, in practice an attack on both Cuba’s ability to draw foreign investment and its crucial tourism industry, given theheavy involvementof the military’s business conglomerate in, by one estimate,60 percentof the economy. And heput sanctionson shipping companies and vessels transporting oil to Cuba from Venezuela, on top of anexisting embargo on the country, which subsidized and supplied a third of Cuba’s oil consumption in 2019. The impact was swift and clear. The targeting of Venezuela’s oil exports hasledto more rationing of energy, shortages of personal hygiene products the government can’t afford while it buys fuel on the open market, and oxen replacing tractors on farms. Trump’s attacks on remittances led to the eventualclosure of Western Unionon the island, imperilinghundreds of thousands of Cuban families. And after anObama-era uptick in tourism, Trump’s variousrestrictions on travel, including a 2019 cruise ban, saw tourist numbers drop for the first time in a decade, by9.3 percentover 2018 to 2019, andnearly 20 percentover the year after that, with US visitors declining close to 70 percent. On top of all this, the decline in both remittances and tourism deprived the country ofkey sources of hard currency. That’scausedthe government’s furtherstruggle in payingoverseas creditors,hobbledits ability to import the60 to 70 percentof its food supply it gets from overseas, andmotivated its creationof the high-priced dollar stores that have been a coresource of angerdriving the current protests. While it may be true the US blockade technically no longerapplies to foodnor prevents tradewith other countries, Washington’s overlapping web of sanctions — by doing everything from depriving Cuba of oil and foreign-exchange currency to crippling its economy more generally and forcing tough trade-offs in overseas purchases — haseffectively closed the dooron both. All of this would’ve been hard enough to navigate at the best of times. But in 2020, Cuba, like the rest of the world, saw its economy further devastated by the coronavirus pandemic that exacerbated every one of these problems: itbrought tourism to a standstill, further strangled the entry of hard currency,worsened food shortages, and caused job losses that made Cubans ever more dependent on the foreign remittances Washington was determined to choke out. Over the year, the country saw its economyshrink 11 percent. As the pandemic magnifies the devastation of the US blockade, the blockade has in turn made it harder for Cuba to handle the pandemic. In July 2020, a UN special rapporteurconcludedthe blockade was “obstructing humanitarian responses to help the country’s health-care system fight the COVID-19 pandemic.” Among other things, the blockade stopped medical aid and money transfers from overseas companies and humanitarian organizations, denied Cubans the ability to use Zoom, precluded the country’s purchase of ventilators, and caused a shortage of these and personal protective equipment (PPE), whileblockinga donation of pandemic aid from China’s richest man. Oxfamreportsthe blockade has had a “drastic effect on Cuba’s vaccine industry,” making it difficult to obtain the necessary raw materials. Even so, the state’s generous and long-term investment in health care and education means it was able to develop its own COVID vaccine — only to then face ashortage of syringes, the blockade making it difficult to buy them from manufacturers. It’s the blockade, too, that has driven the pandemic’s resurgence on the island, a big driver of the current protests. The economic squeeze pushed a desperate Cuba to reopen the country to tourism in November, which, combined withshortages of PPEand a shortfall of 20 million syringes, led to ajump in cases. Still, it’s rich for the Rubios of the world to charge that “the regime’s disastrous COVID response is the predictable result of a corrupt government” as theybeat the drums of regime change, when, even with Washington’s determined effort to sabotage Cuba’s pandemic recovery, its response — with 1,608 deaths as of July 12 —doesn’t even come closeto the mass death of US citizensengineered by Rubio and his ilkduring the pandemic. Of course, none of this matters to Washington politicians who don’t think twice about casually starving and killing foreign people, whether by bombs or economic sanctions. But the irony is that the blockade has had a devastating effect on Cuba’s private sector, which is heavily dependent on tourism and on traveling to the US to buy materials. Nor is it particularly good for American industry either, with the blockadeestimatedto cost US businesses and farmers nearly $6 billion a year in export revenue. Nor is it popular. Foryears,pollinghasshowna majority of Americans, even afluctuatingmajority of Cuban Americans in South Florida, support ending the blockade, likely realizing that it’s both inhumane and, after nearly sixty years, ineffective. Unfortunately, true to hisTrump-liteapproach toforeign policy, Biden hasbroken his campaign promisesand is steadfastly continuing Trump’s Cuba policy, departing from the successful approach of the very Democratic administration he served in. Even as he “calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs,” Bidenrefusesto lift the Trump restrictions on remittances that more of those Cubans now depend on than ever. The unrest last week in Cuba cannot be fully understood outside the context of the blockade. None of this absolves the Cuban government over its repression of dissidents, or for the mistakes made in the course of the country’s economic management. But toput the stresson its “Soviet-style, centrally planned economy” and insufficient zeal in market reforms as the cause of the country’s woes, and not the more than half century of warfare waged by the world’s biggest power, is misleading to say the least. Short of sadism and imperial hubris, there’s no good reason for the blockade to continue against a country thatposesno threatto the United States, and which creates overwhelming misery for the ordinary people figures likeDonald TrumpandJoe Bidenclaim to stand with. And while removing it in full will be a heavy lift, requiring getting Congress on board, the president on his own could at least roll back the Trump policies he himself once acknowledged were an abominable failure. Not doing anything will only drive home how hollow establishment lip service to human rights is. Branko Marceticis aJacobinstaff writer and the author ofYesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden.

John McCain (R-AZ), whose death from brain cancer got entirely too much attention for the spotlight-seeking, thin-skinned president, on Sunday.

Like many Republicans disgusted with Trump’s embarrassing Twitter attacks and destruction of the GOP, he was appalled by Trump’s continued bashing of Sen. McCain. On Twitter, he referred to the attacks as “contemptible,” saying that they are “beneath our dignity as Americans.”Apparently, enough Americans have no dignity when it comes to politics, racism, misogyny, and Islamaphobia. No matter how many times Trump proves that he’s giving a voice and a platform to white supremacists, his fans remain, but only because they don’t care if white supremacy is emboldened by Trump. It doesn’t affect the vast majority of them, and neither does Trump’s complete annihilation of their own party. Weld had at least some supporters in his Twitter comments.

The analyst, who is not identified in the report, was fired from the FBI, but the Justice Department and its child exploitation unit declined to file criminal charges against him. The report goes into greater detail about the investigation into the analyst than dida summaryof the probe released by the Justice Department’s inspector general in April. That summary said that the supervisory intelligence analyst (SIA)admittedto viewing and downloading child pornography several years earlier, but did not give any other details about the nature of the content. The investigative report, which the DCNF obtainedthrough the Freedom of Information Act, paints a more disturbing picture of the analyst’s activities. The analyst admitted during a routine counterintelligence polygraph that “viewing and downloading [child pornography] of girls ranging in age between 9 and 17,” the report said. The analyst initially said he preferred pornography of girls between 15-17, before eventually acknowledging to having a preference for images of girls as young as 9 years old, and those “just starting to show signs of maturation,” according to the report.

The report said that the polygraph examiner conducted an interview with the analyst after he showed countermeasures, which are tactics intended to cheat a polygraph test. The analyst consented to allowing the FBI analyze his computers and phone. The FBI found 183 images of suspected pornography on the analyst’s computers and phone, but none were of underage girls, the report said. The report said that investigators with the inspector general’s office substantiated that the analyst knowingly possessed child pornography, a felony violation, but the Justice Department and its Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section declined prosecution. No identifying details of the SIA are included in the report. His position as a top intelligence analyst would suggest he worked for years at the bureau.

Brad Horrigan / Hartford CourantIn this April file photo, a man is swabbed by a Hartford HealthCare medical professional for a COVID-19 test. Earlier this month, Christopher J. Duff decided to get tested for COVID-19. He wasn’t feeling great and his two-year-old son was running a fever.“My symptoms were being extremely tired, some body aches and feeling very warm,” said Duff, who is 39 and serves on the Rocky Hill town council. “I’ve been working from home, social distancing and wearing a mask out in public, so I didn’t think I was likely to have COVID, but I wanted to rule it out and make sure, especially because we have a toddler and an infant.”The testing process, conducted at a CVS Minute Clinic in Rocky Hill, took a total of 30 minutes. Duff’s wait for the results took eight days. Across the state and the nation, wait times for some COVID-19 test results are stretching to a week or longer. Timely results are key to containing the spread of the virus, public health officials say. The longer a person is unaware of a positive test, the more time they have to infect others and lengthy delays can hamper contact tracing and other efforts to control outbreaks.“Five days is an eternity in COVID time,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday. “You don’t know what’s happened…in the five days it’s taking you to get that response.”In addition to causing stress and disruption for individuals, experts fear the rising backlog of test kits could jeopardize efforts to control the virus and reopen society.“We are concerned that the national demand for testing is causing longer wait times for test results,” said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of the state Department of Public Health.“Anyone that has a known exposure to a COVID-positive individual or who has symptoms should be in self-quarantine until they have a negative test result,” Gifford said. “That’s how were going to contain the spread of this virus…people [should] remain isolated from others if there’s a chance they may be infected. It’s very important…as inconvenient as we understand that is, that individuals remain in quarantine.”The wait for test results has grown longer in recent weeks, with national labs processing a spike in samples from Arizona, Texas, California and other hot spots. CVS Health attributed the “extremely high demand for tests” to rising caseloads in much of the nation.“This has caused backlogs for our lab partners and is delaying their processing of patient samples,” said Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for CVS Health. “Currently, due to these factors, it may take 6-10 days for people to receive their results and, in some instances, our lab partners may take even longer to return results. Our lab partners are working hard to address this issue.”With schools and businesses looking to reopen, demand for testing could swell even more, putting additional pressure on an already overburdened system, officials say. Early in the pandemic, Connecticut contracted with several in-state laboratories, which agreed to process a certain number of tests and to turn around results as quickly as possible. In most cases, the in-state diagnostic centers are reporting results within 24 hours, said Josh Geballe, Gov. Lamont’s chief operating officer. The state is currently in discussions with some of those facilities to take on additional capacity to help compensate for the backlog at the national laboratories.“We’re working as much as we can with our local labs and…there we’re getting a quick turnaround, 24 hours or less,” Lamont said. “We’re doing as much as we can to move all the testing analysis right here in the state of Connecticut and we’re not going to have that wait.”Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation’s largest labs, said it is trying to address the backlog. “At Quest Diagnostics, we are doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing to patients at this critical time,” the company said in a statement. Last week, the Federal Food and Drug Administration allowed Quest to pool its samples. Under this scenario, four samples can be tested at once; if the results are negative, all of those individuals are COVID-free. If it’s positive, the four samples are separated and tested individually to determine which is infected. Even as steps are taken to speed up the process, some state residents continue to face long waits for results. John Silver went to a mobile testing site in New Britain on July 9 for a COVID-19 test. He and his wife had several trips planned and wanted to make sure they weren’t infected before they set off. His results arrived nine days later, on July 18, and his wife’s arrived on July 20; both were negative. Although they had no symptoms and no reason to suspect they were sick, they isolated for the first two days following the test.“But nine days?” said Silver, who is 43 and lives in Farmington. “Just too much time.”Christopher Duff’s test was also negative.“Everyone’s symptoms lifted before we got results back,” he said, “although I was still concerned I could have it and be asymptomatic.”After eight days of waiting, “it was a relief,” he added.",3,Reliable,0.0656243235930736,0.4141799693362191,1220,3,Hartford Courant

455,Biden’s Distracting Parade of Celebrity Boomers,-15.0,36.5,https://newrepublic.com/article/159117/biden-celebrity-surrogates-carole-king-crosby-streisand,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"With the tiresome necessity of political convention season concluding, we now enter the homestretch of a long two years of presidential campaigning. Here, we will see exactly how Joe Biden plans to argue his case. According to an Associated Pressstoryon Wednesday, it will involve plenty of celebrities. Biden’s superstar backers are “flooding the zone as much as possible,” in the words of Michelle Kwan, the Olympic figure skater and a seasoned Democratic celebrity surrogate. It is hard not to get chills hearing about Biden’s reliance on his superstar allies, given how the same sort of strategic deployment turned out for Hillary Clinton. But so far, Biden is taking a slightly different approach. His gang is a little more …distinguished. Experienced. Seasoned. We’re talking Carole King, James Taylor, David Crosby, Barbara Streisand,Sheryl Crow—singers of the same vintage or earlier as the musicians Homer Simpson got roasted by his kids for liking in the “Homerpalooza” episode. Which aired in 1996. Perhaps Biden’s Boomer Bench is a little more authentic than the approach Clinton took four years ago, which dutifully trotted out huge millennial stars like Taylor Swift andKaty Perry, as if to say: This is the shit you idiot kids like, right? Her campaign also engaged in more niche, targeted pandering to young and trendy, more media-savvy audiences, like writing a post for the now-defunct website The Toast and appearing onBroad City. It is a little harder to imagine Joe Biden showing up on a Twitch stream or appearing on theOffice Ladiespodcast, but there’s plenty of time. After all, he does haveDiploin his corner. There are advantages to getting celebrities involved in your campaign. For a start, they are super rich. Secondly, their friends tend to be similarly wealthy. And maybe there’s a third advantage, who knows? Focus on the first two. In one revealing story,The Financial Timesnotedin May that wealthy participants in virtual fundraisers expect a “rain check” on the “perks” that they would usually receive at in-person events, such as getting face time with the candidate. This is the avenue of influence that causes campaign finance reform advocates to warn about these events. It’s definitely a more acute concern when it’s a lobbyist paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to whisper in the candidate’s ear, of course, but it’s not like these multimillionaire celebrities have no interests of their own. Still, the Biden campaign’s strategy of “flooding the zone” with celebrities may have more to do with trying to attract other, less famous wealthy donors than with attracting donations from the celebs themselves. A Biden campaign officialtoldThe Financial Timesthat they were “preparing to test new fundraising measures, such as deploying more celebrity surrogates,” to make up the gap with Trump’s more robust fundraising. Those less well-known but critical donors—your Average Joe Millionaire—might need an added inducement to shell out if they aren’t going to get to chat to Biden himself. The chance to speak with pop-cultural royalty about politics can at least serve as a memorable part of The Biden Experience. Celebrities have stumped for Democratic presidentialcandidatesforyears, but the genuine love celebrities and musicians had for Obama, who was also perhaps the only president we’ve ever had to come close to being “cool,” greatly accelerated this dynamic. It’s almost easy to forget that Obama was once an outsider candidate, challenging the Clinton status quo, and that—combined with the obvious fact that he stood to break the centuries-long cycle of white presidents—allowed him to accrue no small amount of street cred with hip backers. Obama used indie sad-dad rockers The National’s song “Fake Empire” (which actually doesn’t holda very positive messageabout America) in anadduring his primary campaign, and the band played a benefit show in their home state of Ohio for him. This was all very trendy stuff, in 2008. The excitement about Obama was inextricably wrapped up in celebrity, both his own and that of his famous supporters. Now the same celebs who loved Cool Obama are on the hook for Old Joe. At least one celebrity endorser even explicitly mentioned Obama when endorsing Biden. In anupdatedversion of “Lookin’ for a Leader,” Neil Young sang last month: “Yeah, we had Barack Obama, and we really need him now. The man who stood behind him has to take his place somehow.” Talk about damning with faint praise. But if Obama made it a trend, now it’s mandatory. One unspoken benefit of celebrity surrogates: It means Joe Biden doesn’t have to do all the campaigning himself, or more specifically, that he doesn’t have to talk so much, thus defusing some of his well-known gaffe risk. Bidenreiteratedlast week that he doesn’t intend to resume active, in-person campaigning, telling Reuters that he and his running mate, Kamala Harris, were “going to follow the science, what the scientists tell us” and that the campaign “will win” despite the candidate choosing to sequester himself at his Delaware home. It is true that staging large campaign events with lots of people presents unique dangers during the coronavirus pandemic. But there is evidence that suggests outdoor, socially distanced events with masks arelower riskand that President Donald Trump isembarkingon “an increasingly aggressive travel schedule” to battleground states, staging “open-air events with small crowds.” There is a whole world of activities Biden could do aside from packed rallies. He could visit reopened schools, or factories, or hospitals—all places where the people he’s asking to vote for him have been required to keep working. But why bother going places, when you have David Crosby just a Zoom call away?As Sarah Jones noted for thispublicationin 2016, Clinton’s campaign “employed a candy-colored brand of female empowerment seemingly based on the assumption that white women’s political priorities are influenced by the pop culture they consume.” This time, we have many of the same celebrities and the same heavy-handed effort to Reach Out to Voters, without even a half-hearted invocation of any kind of bigger reason to care about Joe Biden at all. The celebrities’ message will boil down to the same message his campaign has had all along: He’s not Trump. The Democratic National Convention essentially hammered this case throughout four evenings of virtual content, forsaking much mention of the policies Democrats intend to pursue and striving so mightily to draw disaffected Republicans away from Trump that it studiously avoided any criticism of the GOP beyond its current standard-bearer. It was in many ways reminiscent of Clinton’s myopic anti-Trump focus; the Biden campaign’s firm commitment to not really campaigning also feels eerily similar to Clinton, who spent the summer of 2016focusing on celebrity fundraisersover campaign events. This election is different for a thousand reasons, but it is hard not to feel the cold wind of November 2016 blowing again.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1436980218855218,0.5046539802789803,1557,2,New Republic

No one was surprised by the veto — had Trump wanted to comply with the resolution, he could have withdrawn support to Saudi Arabia at any time. But the passage of the resolution was notable given that it had bipartisan support. Seven Republican senators and 18 Republican House members voted for the resolution, in addition to all of the Democrats in Congress. Since less than two-thirds of either chamber voted to approve the resolution in the first place, there's little chance that the veto could be overturned. In vetoing the resolution, Trump lashed out at Congress for passing it.""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,"" he said in a veto message. ""The Congress should not seek to prohibit certain tactical operations, such as in-flight refueling, or require military engagements to adhere to arbitrary timelines. Doing so would interfere with the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, and could endanger our service members by impairing their ability to efficiently and effectively conduct military engagements and to withdraw in an orderly manner at the appropriate time.""But as the conflict in Yemen has dragged on, the situation on the ground has only worsened. The United Nations has warned that 12 to 13 million people could suffer from the growingfamineif the war continues. And as American weapons and technology have aided the war effort,thousands of Yemeni civilianshave been killed in air strikes, though the administration says it is working to reduce unintended casualties. All the while, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has been implicated in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a U. S. resident and journalist critical of the regime.

Land west of Lyons Road in the Agricultural Reserve in Boynton Beach on Monday, May 24, 2021. Huge parcels of undeveloped land, once dedicated to farmers, have vanished in Palm Beach County as developers raced to build thousands of homes on them. The future of the Agricultural Reserve, a 21,000-acre farming region west of Boynton Beach and Delray Beach, has been a subject of fierce debate over land preservation — a battle that ignited once again in recent weeks when the county allowedeven more homes and apartmentsto be built there. Since 2000, more than 9,400 homes have been built in the reserve, according to the county. And that number will continue to increase. On May 5, county commissioners approved a controversial deal allowing GL Homes, the largest housing developer in the Agricultural Reserve, to build over 300 new homes on existing farmland. Additionally, commissioners paved the way for a 520-unit apartment building to satisfy demand for workforce housing in western Palm Beach County. Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner, who voted against the county’s recent measures, said part of the reason he ran for office was because he was “born and raised near underdeveloped land and it’s part of the history culture of our county.”“From time and time, [the Ag Reserve] is chipped away at,” Kerner said. “I guess I’m one of the bad guys that tries to stand in the way of that.”Here’s a look at how the county’s undeveloped land has disappeared.1999: Voters want to preserve landEnvironmental advocates oppose letting developers build on land that has beenset aside for farming. They’ve raised concerns that development will put an end to a unique area in South Florida intended to limit suburban sprawl and preserve one of the nation’s most productive farming areas east of the Mississippi River. Many of those limits have gradually eroded, with rules rewritten to allow for more construction. “We’re continuing to undermine and gut the original intent of the [Ag Reserve] plan,” says Lisa Interlandi, of the Everglades Law Center, a firm dedicated toward environmental and land use issues. “We’ve ended up in a situation where we’re constantly, constantly changing the rules to accommodate more and more growth.”Persuaded by the threat of overdevelopment, voters support spending $100 million to buy about 2,400 acres in 1999, land that was leased to agricultural users in Palm Beach County. After the voter referendum, county planners compile a “Master Plan” for the Agricultural Reserve, placing limits on development. The county can require developers to save the majority of properties for conservation, agricultural uses or water storage in what’s become known as the “60/40 rule.” It requires that 60% of land is preserved, while 40% can be used for development. Originally, county planners require any lands being sold for development to have at least 150 contiguous acres designated for preservation.2005: Building a hospitalCounty officials allow construction of Bethesda West Hospital, a 63-acre facility not envisioned in the original plan. That leads to “significant development pressure to develop properties close to the hospital with commercial medical office development,” county documents say. County commissioners later allow the hospital to add two additional three-story office buildings and then loosen restrictions to allow more medical office development on agricultural land.2009: GL Homes adds more housesCounty commissioners grant the housing developer a major approval, allowing GL Homes to almost double the size of a new neighborhood in the Agricultural Reserve. The plan allows GL Homes to build almost 1,000 new homes on nearly 1,000 acres between Lyons Road and U. S. 441. GL Homes, which specializes in luxury homes and 55-and-over communities, has since created thousands of new homes over the past 10 years in West Boynton. Since 2009, four of its “Valencia” communities have opened along Lyons Road just south of Boynton Beach Boulevard, creating over 3,000 new homes. Individual Valencia communities range between 500 to over 1,000 homes.2015: Building homes closer togetherCounty commissioners vote to change a rule that requires any lands sold for development to have at least 150 contiguous acres designated for preservation, allowing for smaller parcels to be sold. As a result, more small, isolated parcels are designated for preservation, going against the original intent of the plan, according to county documents. Parcels as small as 5 acres are allowed to meet the preserve requirements, leading to more homes. The smaller 5-acre properties are “often squeezed in between development and other preserve parcels, which has resulted in incompatible and unsustainable development patterns,” according to county documents. Interlandi noted this ruling as being especially egregious, saying, “It’s hard for agriculture to exist in 1- or 2-acre dribs or drabs.”April 2021: Hundreds of new homesGL Homes finalizes a deal that will result inat least 277 new homes— and likely hundreds more in the future — south of Boynton Beach Boulevard and west of Lyons Road as part of a new upscale community. The project will be directly south of Valencia Reserve, a GL Homes property with more than 1,000 homes. In total, GL Homes will acquire 580 acres of land from the Whitworth family, which will be split into two phases. Construction on the first phase is projected to begin near the start of 2022, meaning homes could be finished by the end of that year. May 5, 2021: A ‘creative plan’In a controversial ruling approved May 5, county commissioners allow the Lake Worth Drainage District to sell GL Homes 276 acres along its canals within the reserve for $22 million. The Lake Worth Drainage District manages water resources for much of southeastern Palm Beach County and controls 500 miles of canals and 1,000 miles of associated rights of way, according to its website. While no one can build on the property along the canals, GL Homes gets rights for preserving that land and then can be allowed to build 313 homes on existing farmland elsewhere in the reserve. County planners and lawyers oppose the deal, but commissioners allow the sale to go through. Some county leaders argue that the government has done its part, buying up property to ensure it stays preserved. Commissioner Melissa McKinlay, who represents much of the western farming region, approves the recent deal, saying the Lake Worth Drainage District came up with a “creative plan” to raise revenue at a time when the county faces “potential water supply issues.”McKinlay says she feels the county has struck the right balance in terms of preservation and development.“The whole public outcry that we’re not doing what we promised the voters back in 1999 and early 2000s … we’ve got a 22,000-acre area of the county. Over 13,000 acres of it is in preservation,” she says. “We’ve added to our commitment and the $100 million we spent buying 2,500 acres — well, we still own all of that and that hasn’t changed.”May 5, 2021: Allowing apartmentsIn another instance of commissioners ignoring the advice of county planners, the board paves the way on May 5 for a 520-unit apartment complex in the reserve. At issue was the prior rule allowing for just one unit per acre in an attempt to limit density. Commissioners, however, allow the complex, Reserve at the Atlantic, to build the 40-acre site on the southeast corner of Atlantic Avenue and Half Mile Road with a density of up to eight units per acre. Prior to the decision, county planners object to the proposal, calling it piecemeal. Planners also worry that allowing the plan will “bring into question the future of the approximately 4,698 acres in preserve areas that are currently in private ownership.”Will development in the Ag Reserve continue?Interlandi is concerned that “if you continue to change the rules, the development will never stop.” It could lead to a situation similar to Broward County, she said: “Thousand-home developments directly up adjacent to the Everglades.”",3,Reliable,0.1204118250170881,0.4227762588288902,1747,3,Sun Sentinel

459,Almost all CU Boulder students suspended this year violated campus or local coronavirus mandates,-0.67,43.67,https://www.coloradodaily.com/2020/11/07/almost-all-cu-boulder-students-suspended-this-year-violated-campus-or-local-coronavirus-mandates/,https://adfontesmedia.com/colorado-daily-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,15,"Nearly every student suspended from the University of Colorado Boulder so far this year was suspended for violating local or campus coronavirus mandates, according to university leaders. CU Boulder hassuspended 24 studentsfor not following coronavirus public health measures as of Wednesday, and those students must reapply for admission next semester. The campus has seen “very little, if any” suspensions outside of coronavirus violations, said Devin Cramer, assistant dean of students. Cramer declined to give an exact number, citing concerns about student privacy. CU Boulder sees approximately 25 to 30 suspensions during a typical academic year, Cramer said, most of those in the fall semester.“That’s not comparing apples to apples this year. Outside of COVID-19 related suspensions, we’re seeing a lot less concerning behavior from students, a lot less concerning behaviors regarding alcohol,” Cramer said. “We’re not seeing many felony-type behavior or repeat behavior that we would in a regular semester.”Every suspension for coronavirus has been related to either hosting a party or for breaking isolation, Cramer said. There have been no suspensions for repeated smaller infractions, like not wearing a mask. The vast majority of students referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution are sent there for small violations, Cramer said, like students having too many guests in their dorm rooms or not wearing face coverings while going to the bathroom down the hall. Most of those students are not repeat offenders. Some of the referrals stem from confusion among students about changing coronavirus rules or not reading their housing contracts to see what’s required, Cramer said. For students who host parties, Cramer said he’s heard from several students this week that gatherings grew larger than they intended.“They’ll invite friends over and while that violates the public health order if it’s 12 or 15 people, those friends then invite 10 friends who invite 10 friends,” Cramer said. If a student is hosting a party that grows too large, they can contact police to help break it up and not be disciplined by the university, Cramer said. On-campus students who are not taking their weekly coronavirus monitoring tests are also referred to the conduct office, as that’s a requirement of living on campus. Most off-campus students are referred to the conduct office through the Boulder Police Department, as well as some reports from students and community members. On-campus students are mostly referred by student employees in residence halls or residential service officers who work for campus police. Resident advisors have always been tasked with enforcing campus policies, though that took on an extra layer of responsibility this year with new coronavirus rules. RAs received coronavirus training over the summer, said Director of Residence Life Crystal Lay, and are in regular contact with hall directors to ask questions or follow up. What’s been difficult is that the job has become much more about enforcement than about building community, Lay said. Community building is one aspect university leaders have pledged to improve during the spring semester.“The heartburn that I’ve heard directly is that they feel a little isolated and lonely, because it wasn’t as evenly balanced as in the past,” Lay said. “There wasn’t this large, in-person community feel and fun pieces that they were hoping for.”Departments across campus are collaborating to improve the student experience, Lay said, as well as asking students what they want to see more of while “balancing that community with safety.”“RAs have a really hard job. They are student leaders, they’re taking on this wonderful opportunity to really engage their peers, and I hope their peers see that and see them as leaders and helpers instead of solely enforcers,” Lay said.",3,Reliable,0.0794992094194221,0.3768671635692912,800,3,Colorado Daily
460,Chemical fire reported in Lake Charles following Hurricane Laura's landfall; shelter-in-place issued,-1.33,54.0,https://www.nola.com/news/hurricane/article_701d29c6-e87b-11ea-8de9-971e6dc5b55b.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nola-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,22,"Hours after Hurricane Laura made landfall early Thursday, a large chemical fire erupted at a chlorine production plant just west of Lake Charles, sending a billowing plume of smoke for miles and prompting an emergency alert for people to take shelter from chlorine gas and other harmful emissions. The sprawling BioLab Inc. complex just south of Interstate 10 in Westlake caught fire around 9 a.m., about seven hours after the hurricane blasted through the area. Gov. John Bel Edwards issued an emergency alert warning residents of Westlake, Moss Bluff and Sulphur to shelter in place, turn off their air conditioning and close windows and doors.“We don’t know everything there is to know about it,” Edwards said. “We have assumptions. … we know it’s a serious situation.”The fire, believed to have started when chemicals began reacting after the storm hit, released chlorine into the air, State Police Superintendent Col. Kevin Reeves said Thursday afternoon. Other emergency responders said much of the chlorine fell into nearby water bodies, including Lake Charles. Chlorine gas can be very harmful to humans and residents should take every precaution to avoid it, said Wilma Subra, a chemist with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network.""Chlorine gas moves offsite quickly,"" she said. ""When inhaled, chlorine can damage the lung tissue permanently. It never rejuvenates.""Chlorine gas is one of the most common gases produced in the U. S. and was used as a weapon in World War I, said Blaine Fisher, a health care and emergency management expert at Tulane University. In addition to lung damage, chlorine gas can cause blisters, a burning sensation in the eyes, nose and throat; nausea; vomiting; and headaches. Fisher said people who come into contact with the gas should rinse their eyes for 15 minutes. If symptoms don't subside in two hours, he advises medical attention. At the time of the fire, BioLab had been shut down and its employees were evacuated for the storm, a company spokesman said. A Louisiana State Police hazardous materials unit was called to the scene and the Lake Charles Fire Department entered the building at around noon. Troopers shut down I-10 from the I-210 exit to the west and the Lakeshore Drive exit at the foot of the bridge over the Calcasieu River. Witnesses first reported what appeared to be a gas, then a cloud of smoke that appeared to change color. Much of the smoke blew to the northeast, toward Moss Bluff. The fire was largely extinguished Thursday evening but flared back up and was still burning at 8:30 p.m., prompting the shelter-in-place advisory to be extended to 1 mile. The initial efforts to extinguish the blaze on Thursday morning were delayed while crews closed all of the facility's outfalls to prevent water from firefighters' hoses from mixing with chlorine and other chemicals and flowing off-site. Nearby, a large riverboat casino, the Isle of Capri, came unmoored and crashed into the I-10 bridge, wedging itself under the span and adding another element of chaos to the scene. The BioLab Inc. complex that was on fire the morning of Thursday, Aug. 27, 2020, in Lake Charles near I-10. This map was taken from BioLab's recent air permit application. Daniel Hoadley, a spokesman for BioLab's corporate parent, Kik Custom Products, said the company has sent in a specialized team ""to contain and mitigate the impact of this incident as quickly as possible,"" along with local first responders.""Our priority is the safety and well-being of the Lake Charles community, of which we are a part,"" Hoadley said. He added that all BioLab employees were safe. The DEQ is monitoring air quality near the site. Initial readings did not detect chlorine releases, but testing was ongoing, Langley said. Subra said it's no surprise the DEQ was not detecting chlorine.""By the time they got there, it would no longer be there,"" she said. ""It's still really windy, and that would spread the gas even quicker.""Here’s another look at the chlorine leak at production facility in Westlake, Louisiana. More details on that from@tristanbaurick: chemical produces a yellowish-green cloud that's heavier than air and tends to linger along the ground unless picked up by the wind. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to send an aircraft to do flyover monitoring. The facility mostly produces chlorine for swimming pools, said Langley, the DEQ spokesman. KIK, which is based in Toronto, Canada, bills itself as the largest independent producer of consumer products in North America. Some of KIK's products include Comet, Spic and Span and The Works household cleaners, and Clorox and BioGuard pool disinfectants. According to state permits, the facility can produce 115 million pounds per year of trichloroisocyanuric acid and disodium isocyanurate. Trichloroisocyanuric acid is often produced in a white granulated or powder form and can have a heavy ""chlorine"" smell. When heated, the material can release toxic chlorine fumes and nitrogen oxides, according to PubChem, an open database from the National Institutes of Health. The facility was categorized under federal standards as a major source of hazardous air pollutants. It released 21,900 pounds of chlorine last year, according to the Toxics Release Inventory, an EPA database of companies' self-reported toxic emissions. The complex has had uncontrolled chlorine releases before, but not on the scale that may have occurred Thursday. Those past incidents, however, highlight some former plant managers' concerns about the potential for chlorine air releases when chlorinated granules are heated up. In April 2009, the complex had a very small chlorine release after a nut broke loose from a bolt and caused friction inside a granulating machine. A year later, a followup report from the company to DEQ noted that heat from the friction caused granules to break down and release 5.5 pounds of the toxic gas. The release remained inside the facility.""Company explored options of using magnets and temperature gauges to prevent from happening again,"" the company told DEQ. ""However, quality assurance checks proved to be only feasible option.""When Hurricane Rita struck southwest Louisiana in late September 2005, it caused minor damage to buildings at the complex, according to a post-storm assessment for the state. At the time, the former owners of the complex, Chemtura Corp., said they expected to restart operations a little more than two weeks later. The BioLab complex is adjacent to Juniper Specialty Products LLC, a paraffin wax maker that has been shut down for several months. Juniper officials said the the facility was ""made safe"" and ""there are no danger or flammable substances on-site."" Another neighboring facility that produces rocket fuel evacuated Tuesday and all staff were reported safe, a spokesperson for the owner, Lonza Group, said.

Members of the group and others picketed Monday in front of the Macomb County administration building in Mount Clemens, marching down the sidewalk from the county courthouse. The county prosecutor's office is inside the administration building. This was the second straight day the group organized a picket in front of the courthouse in the county seat. The five arrested Saturday were being held in the county jail in Mount Clemens and were arraigned via video Monday at 41A District Court in Shelby Township. The picket was going on during the arraignments, with organizers watching and listening to the video court proceedings from their cellphones as people marched and chanted. The five each were given a $5,000 bond, with Detroit Will Breathe organizer and co-founder Nakia Wallace saying people were on their way to the jail to bond out those held, and that they plan to fight the felony charges. She said the group initially was told there were six people being held at the jail. She said 10 total people were arrested Saturday, with five released. Authorities said those arraigned Monday were:Police said all five were charged with assaulting, resisting, obstructing a police officer, a two-year felony. Additionally, Taylor, Deininger, Nadeau and Phillips were charged with disturbing the peace, a 90-day misdemeanor. Taylor and Deininger also were charged with refusing or resisting to provide DNA samples, a one-year misdemeanor.. Of the other five arrested Saturday, Shelby Township Police Deputy Chief Mark Coil said two were released pending further investigation and three others were arrested and bonded out when they returned to the police station Saturday night. At least two dozen people marched in a circle in front of the county administration building for about an hour chanting ""drop the charges,"" ""free the Shelby 6,"" ""this is what democracy looks like"" and ""these racist cops have got to go.""Many held signs, including ""Stop Shelide,"" referring to the Shelby Township Police Chief Robert Shelide, who was suspended for 30 days without pay earlier this year by the township's Board of Trustees for controversial social media posts that seemed to glorify police brutality. Many people wanted Shelide fired. In addition to the picket, Detroit Will Breathe also hosted a ""phone zap"" to the county prosecutor's office demanding the charges against the ""Shelby 6"" be dropped. Shelby Twp. police arrest 7 protesters at march against police brutalityIn a Facebook post Sunday, Detroit Will Breathe said 750 people have emailed the prosecutor's office demanding the charges be dropped. Wallace told those picketing Monday that this is ""the latest attack to silence this movement,"" adding: ""they don't get to silence us.""Detroit Will Breathe claimed in a tweet on Monday that a female protester was stripped to her bra and underwear by police in the street. But an in-car video released by township police Monday afternoon clearly shows the woman in the back seat of a squad car, freeing her flex-tied hands from behind her back and then stripping down to her bra and underwear. In the 109-second video, the woman frees her hands and then takes off her jacket, before saying, ""I'm dyin',"" and removing her shirt. She then takes her belt, pants and shoes off and says: ""There, now you don't need to search me. Make it easier on ya.""When the door opens from the outside, she says: ""Now it's easier to search me. Go ahead and search all of it.""Coil said she was taken out of the vehicle, re-secured and put on a transport bus. He and Wallace said the woman was arraigned Monday.""The video speaks for itself. The video is completely transparent,"" Coil said. ""This is the detriment of social media postings, often you have inaccuracies.""Shelby Twp. residents say police chief must go for tweets that glorify police brutalityShelby Twp. police chief suspended but will keep his job after controversial tweetsWallace said Monday she thinks it's clear from the video the person is experiencing some form of panic attack or a need of mental health attention and instead of giving her that ""officers decided to display her naked on Van Dyke.""Wallace said the interactions should have stopped, mental health attention given and a female officer called.""This is just a furthering of the callous way in which they interact with people with no regard for their safety -- physical safety, mental safety and emotional safety,"" she said. Saturday's protest started at 1:30 p.m. with about 100 people in a parking lot at 23 Mile Road and Van Dyke Avenue, police said.

462,"A century ago, some American women won the right to vote. Here’s what women say today",-6.0,43.25,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/a-century-ago-some-american-women-won-the-right-to-vote-heres-what-women-say-today,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,25,"Voting matters to American women, who prove it by showing up at the polls. In every general election since 1984,they have turned out at slightly higher ratesthan male voters. But it took hundreds of years before women in the United States gained the right to participate in the democracy they helped to create. If women were married, society viewed them as accessories to their husbands. They had no say in the policies and laws that shaped their lives, denied the right to go to the ballot box. Women from all walks of life rallied, protested and petitioned for change and a chance to be heard for decades. Finally, a century ago on this date, the 19th Amendment was ratified, promising millions but not all American women the right to vote — an incomplete victory. White women could vote, but women of color, particularly Black and Native American women, were left vulnerable and unprotected by the same constitutionally enshrined right up until the 1960s. Racial tension splintered the suffragist movement, said Fatima Goss Graves, president and chief executive officer of the National Women’s Law Center. Though the abolition of slavery and the fight for women’s equality had originally been aligned, white suffragists ultimatelysacrificed equal rights for allin order to gain the right to vote for some. A hundred years later, Goss Graves said the U. S. is “having those same conversations” and that the country “is acutely aware of the importance of our democracy and who gets to participate fully.” The rise of voter ID laws, voter suppression efforts and the lapse of the Voting Rights Act bring into sharp focus how fragile suffrage remains, she said.“In many ways, we missed out on the promise of what the 19th Amendment could have been,” she said. After President Trump’s inauguration, 54 percent of women said they disapproved of his performance, according to a February 2017 Marist poll. More than three years later, that perception has remained largely intact, rising to 59 percent. Trump has maintained higher approval ratings among men throughout his time in office. Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourThis week, Sen. Kamala Harris will officially become the Democratic vice presidential nominee, the first Black woman and the first Indian American woman ever to appear on a national ticket. (Despite the historic moment, Harris’ background as a prosecutor has also drawn criticism and claims that she didn’t do enough to combat racial inequity in the criminal justice system.)To C. Nicole Mason, president and chief executive officer of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, Harris’ nomination is a moment to be celebrated. Four years ago, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first woman ever to be named a major political party’s nominee for U. S. president. And while she lost the election to President Donald Trump, there were ripple effects: In the 2018 midterm elections, voters elected the highest number ever of women and people of color to Congress. And there area record number of women running for Congress in 2020— thanks in large part to a growing number of Republican women seeking office.“We’ve come a long way, but there’s much more work to be done in our efforts to secure women’s leadership at the highest level of our government,” Mason said. What does the right to vote mean to women across the U. S.? And what would they say to the women who fought for that right? Eleven female voters shared their perspective about this moment’s significance with the PBS NewsHour, in their own words. Photo courtesy Darrilynne Arnelle-Mazyck“There’s a picture of myself and my mother, me going to vote in 1972. I turned 18, and that was a big deal. Because I think they had just passed the law that 18-year-olds could vote because of the Vietnam War — that, you know, if you were old enough to fight, then you should be old enough to vote. So that was a momentous occasion for me personally. I wouldn’t be where I am without women fighting for the right to vote. Because 1972 was my first time voting, but I also was getting ready to enter college. And I was entering what had previously been an all-male college. I went on to medical school and, you know, these were very male dominated areas. And I don’t think that there would have been any kind of inclination to allowing women into those spheres without the right to vote. I mean, the right to vote brings pressure and in all sorts of places, not just the political sphere. I really believe that there is a certain segment of women who do not believe that women ought to be in leadership, and it’s their bias. I think that the media has a problem. The way that they speak about women, what things that they give credence to, what things that they will speak about — a woman’s sexual history as opposed to a man’s, how a woman dresses, whether she wears pants, whether she wears a dress. How does her hair look? You know, there are all these things that we would never think about talking about a man, maybe, but we talk about it when it comes to a woman. Number one [hurdle to voting] is that it’s not a national holiday. People have jobs, they have to work. People — unless you live in a relatively affluent community — you can count on staying in line for a number of hours and no one wants to do that, you know. So I think that not having it as a national holiday is a big barrier. Number two is, how elections are actually run and who runs them. No one is guaranteed to win. We abide by — or we used to abide by — who wins. And, you know, that it’s majoritarian rule. And that has made us great. It’s made us an example to the rest of the world that a multicultural, multiracial, religiously diverse population can do this, you know, peacefully.”My thoughts are just as equal as a man’s thoughts. I should be allowed to do just as what my husband is allowed to do. I think women have strong voices, loud voices, and we should be allowed to speak our minds. It really goes to equality. Many men these days don’t want to hear it. That’s their choice. My mom used to work for the League of Women Voters when I was growing up. The diligence and the hard work she put into that and to see the numbers change throughout the years and to see the group of women going out saying, ‘Look, you have a power in you. Let’s use that power in a positive way.’It’s about the right person. But if a woman gets in [the White House], I think that would move mountains. It would be unprecedented for the future of this country. I think we really need something like that. We still get the short end of the stick. I also think that some of the women don’t feel women can, and the big kicker is the emotion. That’s one of the greatest things I love about being a woman. I think that’s a barrier that shouldn’t be there. I know my vote makes a difference, but I feel like when you approach the people you voted for, you’re too small. They’re onto bigger things. What is the hot button? Who’s going to listen to this one little person unless something major were to happen. I do [plan to vote for Trump this November]. I’m not real proud to say that, but I’m scared of the other side. That’s kind of where I am.[To generations of women who were denied the right to vote], I would say I’m sorry that they were treated that way, that they weren’t treated equally. I would try to explain to them that even though they couldn’t vote, they still made a huge difference in our history, and they probably would have never known it, never felt that was what it feels like. I would say, ‘I’m sorry, but you did it. You helped pave the way.’”Photo courtesy Valaria DuckworthIt’s really easy [to vote] in Illinois. I’ve voted in every presidential election since I’ve turned 18. So it’s very much a habit. And it just seems like, you know, with everything going on, it’s pretty important to be heard and vote and be tallied out there. When my father walked me in to vote on my 18th birthday, he had to stand next to me because it turns out that my actual role model who was bringing me in there was a registered felon, and he had never told me that. But he didn’t have the right to vote anymore in Illinois. We had never had the discussion and it never crossed my mind the way he was so politically engaged that he didn’t vote, he couldn’t vote. He’s also a veteran, and our conversation after made me realize how important [the right to vote] was because he had had it taken away. The law wasn’t even on the books anymore that he’d broken — it was the unconstitutional gun ban in Chicago. He’s gotten it straightened out since then, but at the time, he couldn’t vote here. My maternal grandfather is a German immigrant. And my understanding is one of his first ballots was for Eisenhower. My [Black] grandmother on the other hand, didn’t start voting until, like, Kennedy. So it was harder for her to manage to get approval to vote being a southern Arkansas woman. And then even my grandfather — her husband, my paternal grandparents — my grandfather was a veteran, but he didn’t have a proper birth certificate because of where he was born in Mississippi. So the Black side of the family actually started voting later, even though they were here longer. I’ve worked in a couple of municipalities. Those local elections — that I was working on really early on at 19, 20 years old — told me that [that is] where your vote is more powerful because the margin is so small. It can be less than 1,000 votes — it can be a couple hundred votes — that makes the difference between who’s going to be sitting in that seat. So, you know, when people want to be apathetic about the big presidential election, the local ones still matter, too.[The women that came before me are] why I vote, you know, like it very much is. It’s for all of all the lost potential, all the misspent potential, all the potential that couldn’t be realized at the time for an artificial pyramid scheme. For all the women that couldn’t get their votes counted, like that’s why it’s most important for us to be voting right now.”Photo courtesy Barbara Fillion“2016 was such a shock. Our group of women chartered a bus from Cincinnati and went to the [Women’s March] and we stayed in touch. We have gotten active in local and state politics. A dear friend of mine was part of the founding board members for a new PAC that was formed in Ohio to help get more women in state and local office. I met the woman running to represent me in the Ohio State House. And she’s younger than my oldest son and is just fabulous. And so I’ve been her campaign mom for two races in a row now. My state rep, two years ago, won her seat by 56 votes. And I got to be one of her observers at the recount because, obviously, that was less than half a percent. And I actually felt better about how our board of election runs having seen how that works. On election night, she was 300 and a few votes behind. But we knew there were still outstanding absentee ballots and a lot of provisional ballots because [of] the scanning machine. And when they were counted, she was ahead by 56 votes. And that triggered an automatic recount. So I went, and it’s a fascinating process to watch. We are the majority gender. And we are the ones who are impacted first when issues like the current pandemic, the current economic downturn and the current issues with education go south. I mean, there aren’t a whole hell of a lot of men who are worried about staying home with their kids and making sure they’re doing their remote learning. It’s moms who are juggling: ‘Did you do your schoolwork? Did I get my project done for work? How many Zoom calls am I on today?’ I love one of the taglines for our Matriots PAC in Ohio, which is, ‘When women lead, Ohio prospers.’ I like the fact that my current state rep. says, ‘I don’t consider myself a politician. I consider myself a public servant.’ And I think that tends to be the type of leadership we need in our legislatures, from city councils to the Oval Office, is people who consider their work public service, not politics. We’re woefully lacking in those in our current political climate.”Photo courtesy Elizabeth Gallegos“It’s hard to say [how my life has been affected by gaining the right to vote] because I’ve always had the right to vote. Even today, I think, I saw a story about how people were beaten and arrested and died — you know, women — for the right to vote. And I think it’s a shame that anybody would not use that right or take advantage of it. It’s not honoring the past, the people who sacrificed to get us here. So I have just done it as a responsibility my whole life. Also, I like to tell people if they don’t vote, they lose the right to complain about the outcome!My grandmother, who was born in 1910 and passed in 2007, was one of my inspirations. She always, even in her 90s, kept up with current events in the country and the world by reading newspapers. She always expressed her opinion and always voted. I have never felt discouraged or that [my vote] didn’t count. I think if I did, I’d probably be less inclined to vote every election. But I truly believe that it does count so that I make it to every polling place, every time, whether it’s just a local or a national vote, it’s always important. I’m trying to make sure that [the women who couldn’t vote in the past are] counted now. Women sacrificed to get me here. So I have an obligation to carry it forward.”Photo courtesy Kaitlyn Hanks“Being a woman and voting to me is very important because it’s something that we weren’t able to do at one point. So I always feel the need to, like, if I have a chance to exercise a right that we fought for, I’m gonna go ahead and do that. My mom is very active. She voted every single year, every single election that she could. And it’s something that is really big in our family, and it means a lot to go out and vote. And it’s really cool that I actually got to do that with my mom this year and be there at the same time that she was voting and knowing I could vote right along with her. Not many people know how easy it is to register to vote. Not many people know where they can vote at, how to vote, things like that. Because it’s not broadcasted to our generation of younger adults. And people that are just now turning 18, at least the people in my community, a lot of our young voters aren’t registered to vote because they don’t know where to go and it’s just not broadcasted to people. Especially, like, our generation uses a lot of social media, and I can’t think of a day where I ever saw someone on social media talking about where to go register to vote, where to vote, who to vote for, candidates, things like that. It’s definitely important to have women in [office] to show our perspectives of what we see and how we feel and how we act. I think it’s really important that we should have a woman president, but I unfortunately don’t think that that’s going to happen anytime soon. There are tons of women who can vote now. And I’m so glad that they fought the way that they did, and they demanded their right to vote the way that they did. I am so incredibly proud of all of them who fought and fought and fought, because they definitely made a change in our society now. There’s a lot more women going to the polls than there was 100 years ago, and there’s a lot more women in political positions than there ever was.”Photo courtesy Jean Johnson“I generally always vote even in the smallest elections. Voting is a privilege, it’s a right. It’s an honor not only to take the time to research with the smallest elections, but nationally, the presidential election is huge. I worry about the state of the world if Trump were to get reelected. If I can find a way to get out of America, I will leave my stuff here. I wrote [Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer on my birthday, or the day before my birthday, thanking her because I got to celebrate another year because she shut down the state [for the coronavirus].“I’m grateful for the [women] that consistently marched in the streets for me to be able to vote.”I knew more than a dozen people that died. I stopped counting. There’d be days where multiple people I knew died who didn’t know each other. And then seeing people somewhere else in the country being like, ‘Do you know anyone that has COVID?’ Like, posting that. And like, I know people with COVID right now. It was terrifying. It was absolutely terrifying. And I’m glad I got to stay home. Voting for Gretchen Whitmer and seeing her response during the pandemic, keeping me and other people safe after Michigan was hit so hard early on, I’m so grateful I voted for her. I am so grateful people I know voted for her. I’m grateful for the [women] that consistently marched in the streets for me to be able to vote. To them, I would say thank you so much, because I regret the few times I did not vote. And I don’t take it for granted. I’m really grateful for the opportunity to get to have a say in my community and the nation.”“No, I doubt [I will vote this year]. I don’t know. They’ve got this whole United States — we don’t know if we’re coming or going, been there or already back. It’s a different story every time they open their mouths. … But boy, these Democrats and Republicans, all they do is fight and argue, and I don’t know anything about Joe Biden. Nothing. Personally, I think Trump’s done a decent job. So I don’t know if I’m gonna vote or not. I just feel like women should have always had the right to vote. … We’ve never had [a woman as president] and I don’t think we ever will. There’s women a lot smarter than a lot of these men.”Photo courtesy Dawn Mountain“Both of my parents were really encouraging when I started to get curious about the news. They didn’t always agree with me, but they would always try and talk about the issues with me and encouraged me to vote my conscience no matter what. I’m a libertarian. So Dr. [Jo] Jorgenson has gone out of her way to be supportive of absolutely every facet of civil rights. We have to be out there every day and be the feet on the ground that are actually spreading the message. I’ve done campaigning for candidates, I’ve been local treasurer for a candidate here in town and I’ve been a state representative for a campaign. And I’ve also been, you know, just the person calling, making those cold calls and asking them if they’ve even heard about the candidate. At that point, we’re fighting against a big media blackout. I think that if we were even to get half the media time share of coverage that Trump and Biden get automatically and for free, that everybody would be aware that they have more options.[Voting Libertarian] meant that I could actually vote for somebody as opposed to voting against somebody, which is what my dad does. He always said that there was somebody to vote against, and that way you can make sure that you essentially voted for the lesser evil. I don’t want to vote for evil. If I don’t have the choice to vote for somebody who I actually agree with and who I actually feel should run this country, then I don’t want to vote at all. And 46 percent of the voting population agreed with me in 2016, they abstained from voting.”“I probably won’t be voting Republican this time. I don’t like the way the country is going, and I don’t like Trump. I wish they’d be able to run some other Repubican in the election. I just don’t like the way he handles things. It’s always somebody else’s fault. I don’t think he’s very professional. He’s kind of a bully. [I have been voting Republican] since I started voting at 21.[Voting] makes me feel part of the citizens of the country. Women are valuable. I mean, as far as their opinions and all. I’m not what I would call a feminist. I’m just a regular citizen. I’m from a farming family. Farmers vote Republican in California. My grandparents — they always voted. My parents always voted. It was just something you did when you got to the age of being able to make a statement with your vote.”Photo courtesy Elizabeth Tang“My parents and I came to America, immigrated here in 2001. And it took us until 2012, I think, to get the citizenship. And so 2012, which was an election year between President Obama and Romney, that was the first election year that we were eligible to vote. It was so neat, such a new concept to us at that time. 2016 was the real official election year, or at least for our family. And on top of that, with Hillary Clinton being one of the candidates, such a historical moment — it made it extra special. In the ‘90s, we heard about Hillary Clinton. And she’s just always been a really admiring figure. So I volunteered, I became a delegate to the convention for her. I went to the AAPI caucus and met Rep. Judy Chu, who is also another role model of mine. She’s the first Chinese American congresswoman. And being from Georgia, I was lucky enough to stand right next to John Lewis when we did the roll call and vote, and I was able to talk to him a little bit. So when he passed, to a lot of us in Georgia, it was a very emotional time. On the day we went to vote, my mom and I went, and then it just so happened only a few days before, my grandma was able to join us from China for the first time. Because she’s like 86 already, so we’re taking care of her here. So it was her first time, like, seeing — obviously, she couldn’t vote — but it was her first time even seeing the voting process. Because in her, you know, 86 years of life, she’s never even seen anybody vote. I don’t know about Americans that are born here that are more familiar with the voting process. But to me, at least, a relatively new citizen, I almost felt like I needed to learn how to vote. Because in 2012, like I said, it was my first voting experience. I didn’t even realize, ‘Oh, there are judges on the ballot’ or there are these things that you should have really looked into beforehand to make a decision. And so for 2016, for that round, I learned to look at the ballots beforehand and do the research. I think it does come with homework. I wish [women in the past] could have been able to vote, because they were all smart people, like my grandma. I wish they were able to vote always, and maybe society would have turned out to be much more different and much more advanced because of the variety of opinions that this whole other gender would have been able to share.”",3,Reliable,0.1151184211663252,0.4429609296226066,5210,3,PBS
463,How Progressives (Inadvertently) Undermined a Bipartisan Civics Bill,0.0,37.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/how-progressives-inadvertently-undermined-a-bipartisan-civics-bill/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-05,17,"Every few years, civics education goes from being an ignored issue in American politics to briefly being a low-key issue. This is one of those years—and understandably so: 2021 started with an insurrectionist mob attacking the U. S. Capitol, so it makes sense for the question of how we teach rising generations about our form of government to merit at least a little public attention. Writingin theover the weekend, Ronald J. Daniels, the president of Johns Hopkins University, called for “making education for democracy a core element of higher education’s mission.” Our universities, Daniels wrote, “ought to be a bulwark” for our democracy, “bolstering a system of self-governance that is more fissured and fragile than at any time in decades.”And Robert Gates—himself a former university administrator, as well as a former defense secretary and CIA director—toldlast week that he worries about the “lack of understanding among school boards and others of the importance of civics education for the country as a whole.”From the pushers of the1619 Projecton the left to the supporters of the1776 Commissionon the Trumpian right, there is widespread consensus that American civics education needs improvement, even if there is little agreement about just what improvement would entail. As it happens, an obscure bill languishing in Congress seeks to address some of the problems with civics education. It is a sensible bill, and has attracted bipartisan support. But it has stalled—and the reasons it has stalled can tell us a great deal about the limits of bipartisanship in the Biden era. The Civics Secures Democracy Act (CSDA) was introduced in March by Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.)in the Senateand by Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), Tom Cole (R-Ok.), and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.)in the House. The bill would appropriate a billion dollars for grants to states, localities, universities, and nonprofit organizations for the purposes of creating and administering civics curricula in schools and through extracurricular activities. (By way of disclosure: I participated in one such program during my senior year of high school, and the organization that ran it, the Tennessee YMCA Center for Civic Engagement, could be eligible to receive a grant if the bill passes.)There are two things worth noticing about the bill’s list of sponsors. First, those original sponsors hail from both parties, and they each presumably have their own thoughts about the kind of ideological narrative that a civics curriculum ought to provide. Yet despite their differences, they all backed the bill. Also note that those original cosponsors are influential members of each chamber. Cornyn spent most of the last decade as the number-two Republican in the Senate. Coons is close to President Biden. DeLauro, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, is a powerful ally of Speaker Pelosi. Cole is the ranking member of the House Rules Committee. In addition, the Republicans who originally signed on to the bill (Cornyn and Cole) are not anti-Trump Republicans. Neither voted for Donald Trump’s impeachment or conviction either time; in fact, Cole joined those Republicans who voted against certifying the Pennsylvania and Arizona electoral votes following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. As a source close to the lobbying efforts for this bill confirmed for me, “You don’t get them”—DeLauro, Coons, Cornyn, and Cole—“unless there’s a possibility that the bill will pass.”But then things broke down. First, the bill was attacked from the right. Four days after DeLauro introduced the CSDA in the House, Stanley Kurtz, a conservative commentator who isperenniallyringingalarmbellsabout the politicization by the left of American education,wrote forthat the fight over civics education would be “the greatest education battle of our lifetimes.”Kurtz’s hyperbolic criticism of the CSDA was of a piece with his criticism of past efforts to revamp American civics education, in which he warned of far-left, anti-American, ultra-woke brainwashing. He wrote that Sen. Cornyn and Rep. Cole, the Republicans who cosponsored the CSDA, “have been hornswoggled and hogtied into backing legislation that is about as far from conservative as a bill could be.”But Kurtz’s claims about CSDA were practically unfounded. Contra Kurtz, the bill does not explicitly require or implicitly suggest the implementation of a national curriculum for civics education. It does not mention the bogeymen Kurtz invokes, such as critical race theory and “Action Civics.” It does not require or even hint at the adoption of left-wing material in the classroom, or anything like the 1619 Project. In short, Kurtz was crying wolf. Until he wasn’t. The CSDA is not the first bill of its kind. Earlier congressional actions created similar civics-education grant programs to be administered at the discretion of the Department of Education. Each new administration has different policy priorities that drive their competitive grant-making. New grant priorities are then proposed and adopted within the department to establish a written record of its new priorities for grant recipients. In April, the Department of Education releasednew proposed grant prioritiesfor an existing civics-education grant program. The introduction of the proposed priorities, released in the Federal Register, explicitly cited the 1619 Project and Ibram X Kendi’s “antiracism” teachings as examples of the types of curricula that grant-seekers should implement to receive priority in the grant evaluation process:There is growing acknowledgement of the importance of including, in the teaching and learning of our country’s history, both the consequences of slavery, and the significant contributions of Black Americans to our society. This acknowledgement is reflected, for example, in the New York Times’ landmark “1619 Project” and in the resources of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History. Accordingly, schools across the country are working to incorporate anti-racist practices into teaching and learning. As the scholar Ibram X. Kendi has expressed, “[a]n antiracist idea is any idea that suggests the racial groups are equals in all their apparent differences—that there is nothing right or wrong with any racial group. Antiracist ideas argue that racist policies are the cause of racial inequities.” It is critical that the teaching of American history and civics creates learning experiences that validate and reflect the diversity, identities, histories, contributions, and experiences of all students. This language seemed to confirm the fears and critiques of right-wingers like Kurtz, that the Biden administration aims to use civics education as a mechanism to indoctrinate American students in progressive ideologies. Lobbyists began to meet resistance from Republicans on Capitol Hill who had up to that point been considering signing on to or otherwise supporting the CSDA.“It was sloppy,” said the source familiar with lobbying efforts for the bill. “It was an unforced error that fed directly into [right-wing] fear.”Kurtz and others beganpressuringCole and Cornyn to revoke their support for the bill, and Cole in turn took the heat to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona,pushing himto withdraw the proposed grant priorities. Other congressional Republicans took notice; 39 Republican senators, led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, sent a letter to Cardona calling on him to withdraw the proposal. Cardona did eventually revise the grant priorities: When the actual invitation for applications was released in July, it included no references to slavery or the 1619 Project or Ibram X. Kendi. But the damage was already done. The CSDA, which previously had been largely received as a balanced, bipartisan solution to a serious problem (the need for better civics education), was now a “Trojan horse” for left-wing extremism. The Biden administration walked right into critiques about its progressive direction and lack of practical commitment to bipartisanship. How did this happen? Who is responsible for the ill-advised grant priority proposal that any political centrist could have warned would create a ruckus?The answer lies in executive branch process wonkery. Support for the controversial language about the 1619 Project and Kendi in the Education Department proposal could have come from the top down or from the bottom up. In other words, it’s possible that the Biden White House’s Domestic Policy Council or Secretary Cardona himself expressed favor for these more progressive civics programs and directed that they be included in the grant priorities. It seems more likely, though, that the low-level staffers tasked with drafting the proposal were proponents of these programs—but higher-ranking department officials would almost certainly have had to review the proposal before it was made public, meaning that at leastof the most powerful officials in the Department of Education, if not Secretary Cardona himself, were pushing the department in a more progressive direction. Still, whether the cause was sloppiness, an idealistic young staffer, or an attempt to push an under-the-radar progressive agenda, the disturbing lesson of this case is that incautious or imprudent executive-branch policy proposals can jeopardize substantive, bipartisan legislative wins. Shawn Healy, senior director for state policy and advocacy at CivXNow, a group advocating the passage of CSDA, acknowledged that many questions beyond the proposed grant priorities have come up in meetings with congressional Republicans, including Kurtz-like concerns about a national curriculum and the bill’s pay-fors.“In our outreach to members’ offices [over the Department of Education’s proposed civics grant priorities] we heard this in a couple of cases. It certainly was an issue, right?” said Healy. The CSDA bill “was artificially tethered to that controversy,” Healy said. “It’s been a political challenge for sure.”“I think what we don’t know is if the damage is too much,” said the source close to lobbying efforts for the bill. In the months since the controversial proposed grant priorities came to light, one Republican representative—Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania—signed on as a cosponsor of the bill. On its own, the addition of this one further GOP cosponsor provides little reason to think that the CSDA might get legislatively unstuck. But it does at least provide a glimmer of hope for a renewed bipartisan push for a civics education bill in a year desperately calling out for one.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1240619524324881,0.4611593614718615,2292,2,The Bulwark
464,Republicans blast Schumer deadline for infrastructure vote,4.67,45.0,https://nypost.com/2021/07/18/republicans-blast-schumer-deadline-for-infrastructure-vote/,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"​GOP senators pushed back againstSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer​for ​scheduling test votes Wednesday on a bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and a $3.5 ​trillion budget package, saying there are too many lingering questions — including how they will be paid for and what’s in them.“How can I vote for cloture when the bill isn’t written?” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) asked on“Fox News Sunday.”“Unless you want program failure, unless Schumer doesn’t want this to happen, you need a little bit more time to get it right.”Cassidy called on Schumer and the White House to work with them on a version that could pass the chamber.“Right now, I can frankly tell you that they’ve not. We’re competing with their $3.5 trillion plan. They want everything reasonable on their side, not helping us,” he said. “Again, we can pass this. We just don’t need program failure.”​But he said “if we get the pay-fors, we can pass this.”​​Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), like Cassidy one of the group of 22 bipartisan senators trying to hammer out the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal, ​said talks are continuing over the weekend on how to pay for the massive plan. ​“We are still negotiating. In fact, last night I was negotiating some of the final details with the White House​,​ and later today we’ll be having additional negotiations with the Republicans and Democrats who come together to put this bill into a track that’s very unusual for Washington,” ​Portman said onCNN’s “State of the Union.”“This is a little confusing for people because it’s actually 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats putting this together. Chuck Schumer, with all due respect, is not writing the bill. Nor is [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell, by the way. So that’s why we shouldn’t have an arbitrary deadline of Wednesday​,” he said. ​He said one proposal to help fund the deal by increasing Internal Revenue Service enforcement of tax cheats is no longer an option in the infrastructure legislation.“​That’s one reason we’re having initial meetings today and had more meetings over the past few days on this topic. There are other ways to do this,” Portman said. “I’ve been on the phone a lot with the congressional budget office and with the joint committee on taxation over the weekend. And we have a number of pay-fors. And that’s important that it be paid for.”GOP Sen. Rob Portman says the improvement of IRS enforcement of existing laws is not included in his proposal as a potential method to pay for the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal. “There are other ways to do this.”#CNNSOTUpic.twitter.com/OJbuPmeCAjH​e said the IRS proposal faced opposition from other Republicans and the budget bill, that Democrats are hoping to push through the Senate by reconciliation, ​also included proposals for the IRS. Boosting tax enforcement is estimated to raise $100 billion over 10 years.“One reason it’s not part of the proposal is, and we did have pushback. Another reason is that we found out that the Democrats were going to put a proposal into the reconciliation package, which was not just similar to the one we had but with a lot more IRS enforcement,” Portman said. He was asked by ​CNN ​host Dana Bash ​about why the Republicans had a problem with Schumer wanting to force a vote on cloture, ​a process that would allow for debate​ to begin​.“Start debate on what? We don’t have a product yet. And we won’t have a product until we can finish the negotiations properly,” Portman said.“Again, this is a complex bill. It involves several committees. It involves a lot of very tough issues, because we have got to resolve them between us first.”Schumer announced he had scheduled the votes for Wednesday, even though the details were being negotiated.“The time has come to make progress,” ​he said in a speech on the Senate floor. “And we will. We must.”Sixty votes are needed to begin debate on the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill – meaning 10 Republicans will have to vote with all 50 Democratic senators. ​While the bill addresses typical​ infrastructure projects like roads and bridges, the $3.5 trillion budget package includes a spending hike for education, efforts to battle climate change and social programs like Medicare. ​McConnell blasted the spending plan as “a grand socialist experiment.”​​Schumer said he wanted Democrats to reach an agreement on the $3.5 trillion plan​ so that all 50 Democratic senators would support the deal and ram it through the chamber with 51 votes under reconciliation, a parliamentary procedure that allows them to bypass the 60-vote filibuster with Vice President Kamala Harris’ vote topping the threshold. House Speaker Nancy Pelosisaid she wouldn’t consider the bipartisan bill until the Senate passed the larger package through reconciliation. Cassidy said he supports the infrastructure plan.“The $1.2 trillion is good for the United States of America. it would be bipartisan, representing the interests of all 50 states, not just those represented by Democrats, it actually addresses pent up demand for roads and bridges of my state, across the nation, and other things important,” Cassidy ​said on Fox News.​“Now the $3.5 trillion, if they want to go there on a straight party line vote, fueling​ ​..​. ​inflation, making people more dependent upon the government. They’re going to address that. I’m just trying to take care of the infrastructure that our country needs that my state needs​,” he said. ​",3,Reliable,0.0442890211640211,0.4367311507936508,1239,2,New York Post
465,Tokyo’s Olympics Have Become the Anger Games,-1.67,43.0,https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/tokyos-olympics-have-become-the-anger-games,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,25,"It’s surely a coincidence that Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee’s chief, arrived in Tokyo on July 8, 2021, a hundred and sixty-eight years to the day since an American naval fleet sailed into Edo harbor unannounced, forcibly ending more than two centuries of Japanese isolation and contributing to the nation’s ensuing societal and political turmoil. Bach’s appearance portends an eerily similar moment of high anxiety for the people and politicians of Japan: the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, finally set to kick off officially on Friday, after a yearlong delay. Once again, Japan finds its quarantine broken, not by a foreign fleet but by the arrival of thousands of foreign Olympians and their entourages. Now the city’s mood ricochets between fury and resignation, fuelled by a toxic mix of unpopular policies and scandals: Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s unalloyed boosterism for a sporting event that few citizens seem to truly want; a restriction of the operating hours of eateries and the sale of alcohol, measures intended to blunt the spread of-19; and, perhaps most grating, promises of safety that ring hollow. Suga’sinsistencethat the Olympics will serve as “proof that humanity has defeated the coronavirus,” despite evidence to the contrary, and Bach’s claims of “zero” risk to the public, despite athletes in the Olympic Village and dozens of other participants testing positive for the coronavirus, have inspired more unease than confidence—particularly given that the government has managed to fully vaccinate little more than twenty per cent of the Japanese population. Polls have consistently shown that a majority of people in Japanwould preferthat the Games be postponed again or abandoned altogether, and approval ratings of Suga’s cabinet are at anall-time low. As-19 cases rose relentlessly throughout July, the Prime Minister was forced to declare an official state of emergency in Tokyo from July 12th through August 22nd—thefourthsince the start of the pandemic, last year, and a span of days that will cover the entirety of the Summer Games. On Tuesday, a cabinet minister gave an anonymous interview with theAsahi Shimbun, describing the decision as “the worst-case scenario” for the government. There are a lot of other worst-case scenarios. These are the first Olympics to be held mostlywithout spectators, who are being asked to refrain from gathering on the public roads being used for marathons, triathlons, and cycling events. The prospect of competing in empty stadiums has “perplexed” athletes. “A lot of people’s tax money is going to hold these Olympics,” Maya Yoshida, the captain of Japan’s men’s soccer team, said. “Despite that, people can’t go and watch. So you wonder about who the Olympics is for, and what it is for.” A number of high-profile sponsors seem to be wondering, too. Toyota announced on Monday that it would not air Olympics-related advertisements on Japanese television, citing “mixed public sentiment towards the Games.” Other companies quickly followed suit: NEC, Panasonic, and Fujitsu are among the firms that have said they won’t be sending executives to the opening ceremony. In my own neighborhood, in the western suburbs of Tokyo, there is little to indicate enthusiasm for the proceedings. In the local park, public benches have been roped off with metres of bright-orange temporary fencing, to prevent groups from gathering, giving the area the dismal appearance of a crime scene. About the only signs of the impending Games are the lampposts from which “Tokyo 2020” banners are hung, fluttering weakly in an oppressive midsummer haze that reminds one of why the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games were actually held in October. As a longtime resident of Tokyo, I recall the widespread unease that many of my friends expressed upon hearing the announcement, in 2013, that we would host the Summer Games in 2020. The idea of holding a large-scale outdoor sporting event at such a dangerously hot time of year seemed ill advised. Now, with the coronavirus added to the mix, it feels like madness. Tokyoites regarded the idea of hosting with skepticism from the very beginning. The former Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara, apolarizing right-wing populistwhose hawkish rhetoric stoked fury domestically and abroad, first began pushing for the Olympics in the two-thousands. Critics derided his nationalistic appeals as “Olympic fascism.” In the lead-up to the Olympic selection, the approval rating for the idea of hosting the Games in Tokyo was the lowest of any of the candidate cities—in 2012, at the climax of the government’s efforts to secure the rights to the 2020 Games, justforty-seven per centof those polled in Japan said that they wanted them, as compared with seventy-eight per cent public support in the rival city of Madrid. Nevertheless, Tokyo won hosting privileges the following year; still, local enthusiasm remained lukewarm. And what little trust the public had in the promises of government officials to hold a “compact” Olympics were shattered in 2015, when the government of Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister at the time, announced that a new Olympic stadium’s estimated costs would toptwo billion dollars, which would likely have made it the most expensive sports facility ever constructed. The public outcry forced Abe to scale back, but total costs for hosting the Olympics have ballooned to $15.4 billion, more than double the initial estimates. Because of the pandemic, the people of Tokyo won’t even be able to make use of the facilities that they helped to pay for. I recently visited the new stadium, situated near Sendagaya Station. The streets were eerily quiet; the only signs of activity were police patrols and the occasional booming disembodied voice of a recorded announcement being tested. This was several days out from the opening ceremonies, but, as I gazed upon that giant, oval-shaped structure, I recalled the semiotician Roland Barthes’s 1970 book, “Empire of Signs,” in which he famously said that Tokyo “offers this precious paradox: it does possess a center, but this center is empty.” Barthes was referring to the terra incognita of the Imperial Palace: the vast, protected space that sits at the heart of a neon-ringed megalopolis. But it seemed a prescient metaphor for a luxurious custom-built stadium that would, in the end, seat no fans. Ambivalence and even outright opposition are not uncommon reactions among the residents of cities hosting Olympiads, but negativity often gives way to enthusiasm once the competition actually begins. The 2002 Winter Games, in Salt Lake City, got off to abumpy start, but they are remembered withprideby locals today. Even the beloved 1964 Tokyo Olympics had its critics. After they were first announced, in 1959, public opinion was mixed; today, they’re widely regarded as a watershed moment in Japan’s reinvention of itself as a global economic power. Were it not for the cosmic wild card of-19, it is likely that the 2020 Games would have benefitted from this rebound effect as well. But the coronavirus makes comparisons to previous Games all but impossible. The problems facing Tokyo’s Olympic organizers are a combination of the familiar—public opposition, budget overruns, logistical inconveniences, scandals—and the unprecedented hazards of holding an international sporting event amid a global pandemic still very much not under control. The same might be said of the Games themselves, which seem to generate some shocking headline day after day. Some of these news events are relatively minor gaffes, such as Bach’s mistaking Japanese for “Chinese people” during a recent address. Others are more troubling: Cornelius, the Japanese rock musicianhired to scorethe opening ceremonies, stepped down on Monday after old interviews surfaced in which he bragged aboutphysically and sexually abusingclassmates as a schoolboy, including one with disability. And some seem almost designed to sow doubt and confusion, such as the Tokyo organizers’ startling suggestion on Tuesday that they might pull the plug at the last minute, anyway. “These Olympics,” a Japanese journalist friend said to me, after this latest revelation, “are like a nightmare that doesn’t end.”The irony is that, when the opening ceremony commences, on Friday, the Games will become a collective nightmare. Tokyo is currently recording-19 cases at alarmingly high levels; Wednesday’s eighteen hundred and thirty-two cases represent a number not seen since January, before the introduction of vaccines to the country. While these Olympics might well go down as the least wanted in history, they will have succeeded in bringing a nation together, just not quite in the way that their organizers envisioned. The spectre of infection links the citizens of Tokyo in a far more intimate way than the people of any host city before: boosters and critics, participants and avoiders alike, watching, waiting, and hoping for the best.",3,Reliable,0.0648936631944444,0.3944235321969698,1922,3,The New Yorker

Wednesday’s final mayoral debate on Channel 4 was billed as a “leading contenders” faceoff, intended to focus on those with a real shot at winning.

Her rivals all come up short. Adams, our second choice, has too many questionable entanglements with donors who want something from the government he seeks to lead. He hasn’t given straight answers on his ownership of a Brooklyn property, anddidn’t declare rental income on several recent years’ tax returns. He’s also shown adepressing penchantfor excusing the inadequate secular education at some ultra-Orthodox yeshivas. Yang has buckled for the yeshivas, too. He’s also never voted for mayor, and has a kiddie-pool-shallow understanding of far too many of the city’s biggest problems.

When pitching municipal takeover of the MTA, he failed to demonstrate even the foggiest understanding of how the authority works.

BLK,+0.39%Chief Exeuctive Larry Fink says that with stocks knocking on the door of records, a surge to the upside appears more likely than a market collapse. That is because so many investors still have lots of cash to put to work, the head of the world’s largest asset managertold CNBCin a Tuesday interview.“Despite where the markets are in equities, we have not seen money being put to work,” Fink said. “We have record amounts of money in cash.”A meltup is often defined as a sharp and unexpected rise in the price of an asset class, driven largely by a stampede of investors who are more concerned about missing out on a big up move than by improving market fundamentals. Melt-ups are often followed by sharp market setbacks. After a steep fourth-quarter selloff that pushed the S&P 500SPX,+1.07%and the Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA,+0.35%into corrections but stopped just short of a bear market — defined as a 20% drop from a recent peak — stocks have roared back. For the year to date, the S&P 500 is up 15.9% and stands less than 1% below its all-time closing high of 2,930.75 set Sept. 20. Data from Lipper last week showed that U. S. equity funds saw $4.3 billion in inflows through the week ended April 10, but that followed a $19.7 billion outflow from the end of last year through April 3. Individual investors finally turn bullish, as stock market nears all-time highsThe stock-market rally so far this year has been partly attributed to a dovish shift by the Federal Reserve, which abruptly paused its policy tightening effort in January to adopt a wait-and-see approach after delivering four rate increases in 2018. Fed policy makers have signaled they expect no rate rises this year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank, which ended its bond-buying program at the end of last year, introduced a new round of bank stimulus in March in the face of renewed economic sluggishness. Fink said the dovishness of central bankers creates a shortage of “good assets,” which could serve as a trigger for a global melt-up in equity prices.

470,Why Hasn't Britney Spears Been Able to End Her Conservatorship?,-1.67,44.0,https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnagw/why-hasnt-britney-spears-been-able-to-end-her-conservatorship-legal-expert-interview,https://adfontesmedia.com/vice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,21,"Since 2008,Britney Spearshas existed under a conservatorship, through which other people control nearly every aspect of her life, including where she lives, what she does, and how her money is spent. Publicly, she’s said next to nothing about how she feels about the arrangement—but on Tuesday, thepublished a storythat reveals she’s had serious problems with it for years. According to sealed court documents obtained by the, Spears has repeatedly said she wants out of the conservatorship. She has reportedly told the court that at a minimum, she wants her father, Jamie Spears, removed as her conservator. (For most of the last 13 years, he’s been in control of both her finances and her day-to-day life. Two years ago, however,his role was adjusted, and he is now the co-conservator of her finances. Jodi Montgomery, a professional conservator, was appointed in his place in 2019.) Spears reportedly told a court investigator that her father has “taken advantage” of her at every turn, restricting her ability to make even the most basic decisions about her life and exploiting her for millions of dollars she’s earned as a performer. Among a litany of other complaints detailed by the, Britney Spears told the court she wasn’t allowed to make friends without her father’s approval. Once, when she wanted to restain the kitchen cabinets in her home, her father allegedly refused to let her, saying it would be too expensive. She also claimed he has forced her to perform against her will, including one occasion where she had to play a show with a 104-degree fever. From an outsider’s perspective, it’s hard to see why Spears still remains under her conservatorship now that we know she’s been unhappy with it for so long. To get a better understanding of why Spears hasn’t been able to get out of the arrangement—along with what it might take for her to ultimately escape it—I called upDon Slater, an attorney at California’s Barr & Young who specializes in conservatorship cases.story?I was disappointed and saddened. As this has gone on, I found myself really starting to hope that the conservatorship was a positive thing from Ms. Spears’ perspective, and that her problems with it were limited to whether it was her dad or someone else being her conservator. But I think that the statements in the New York Timesstory show that it runs much deeper than that. The court very well could have found that in 2008, Ms. Spears was being tricked into giving her money away. And that could have been the grounds, or part of the grounds, for the conservatorship: being susceptible to undue influence and fraud. It's possible that someone could recognize that in themselves and decide that a conservatorship is an appropriate way to protect them from themselves. That's hard to reconcile with thearticle’s allegations that Ms. Spears has wanted out the whole time. If the court found that Ms. Spears was susceptible to these sorts of influences, then perhaps the court is not convinced that that underlying reason is gone yet. It is very unusual to see someone of Ms. Spears’ age and apparent abilities under a conservatorship. Unfortunately, to get out of the conservatorship, she would have the burden to prove she no longer needs it. And I can see that being difficult. What facts and evidence do you have to show you don't need it if you're still in it? How can you show the court that you're not going to give your money away if you don't have money to give away? It might require a lot of medical and psychological experts to pull it off. Do you see Jamie Spears’ dual role—at once a conservator, but also motivated to make his daughter as profitable as possible for his own gain—as a problem?Oftentimes, that unity of interest is a good thing: The more the conservator makes for the conservatee, the better they both are. But in Ms. Spears’ case, the way that she makes her money, it's her performances. So that creates a unique conflict of interest in this case. I would hope that the court and the parties would be more scrutinizing of the management of the conservatee’s estate and the reasons for making financial decisions. I think the court should offer Ms. Spears a greater voice in what to do with her own estate, because it's her producing the money. Usually in conservatorship cases, the income is from public benefits, retirement income, passive income—it’s usually not people who are still working.has been forced to perform, including while she was sick with a 104-degree fever. That doesn’t seem like something a conservator would legally be allowed to do. I can't see a legal way to force someone to work. People are always allowed to refuse to work under our legal system. And when they do, maybe they've breached a contract, and they have to pay damages for refusing to work—but they still have the freedom to refuse to work. From a legal standpoint, I can't imagine [a conservator] having the legal power to do what Ms. Spears said happened. But at a human level, I can envision people feeling forced and pressured into doing things that they don't want to do. The conservatorship powers are crafted by the court. Let's assume that Mr. Spears did say those things. We'd also have to assume that he said those things because the court granted him those powers. The ability to control who a conservatee sees and visits is an extra power—you have to ask for that. You have to give the court facts for that. If part of the grounds for why Ms. Spears was put into conservatorship in the first place was that she had been taken advantage of by people around her, I wouldn't be surprised for a court to make some sort of order that the conservator could control who she sees. But those things should be under constant review. Circumstances change. If the need isn't still there for this sort of control, then I would hope that requests to modify those orders have been made. With regard to the cabinets, that is micromanaging. But technically, under the law, the conservator has the discretion to make a decision about every single dime spent. So if he thinks that painting the cabinets is a waste of money, that's his prerogative, unfortunately.reported. How could her father be allowed to force her into a mental hospital as an act of retribution?It is very, very difficult legally to force someone against their will into a mental hospital. The typical process in California is a 5150, where someone is a danger to themselves or others. Another legal way would be asking the court for permission to do that. And that's pretty much the peak of a conservator’s powers. You have to make quite a showing [of why that’s necessary]. There are huge due process concerns any time someone is forced to do anything against their will. It's possible for someone to be pressured or coerced into admitting themselves into a hospital, and you don't know what sort of things might be said to a person to [make them] admit themselves into a hospital. You can envision someone feeling like they've been pressured against their will to do something, and doing it against their will, even though they sign their name., she has wanted out for years?If we assume that Ms. Spears wants out of the conservatorship completely—which would require a petition to terminate the conservatorship—there are all sorts of non-legal reasons why one might not want to do that. It could be a very lengthy, costly, potentially humiliating trial. That might just not be worth it. That person might find themselves better off trying to make little modifications here and there, rather than having all these private details of their lives scrutinized in front of courts and lawyers and everyone else. It also could be strategic. The petition to terminate would likely require a trial, and the court would make a decision, and one side would win and one side would lose. It wouldn't be forever. But it sort of removes the leverage that both sides currently have. There may be negotiations happening between Ms. Spears and Mr. Spears. She may be asking for a compromise or concession, and they're considering it because of the threat that there could be a trial later. It might be that the trial isn't coming because they're still negotiating, or they're still gathering evidence, or they're just not ready. Or they just don't want to go through the trial. It’s not uncommon for the court to know the wishes of the conservatee long before anything is filed. The court-appointed attorney’s primary duty is to communicate what the conservatee wants. And in the background, they may be advising their client about the pros and cons, or risks and benefits, of what they want. So I can envision a court-appointed attorney constantly updating the court with what the conservatee’s wishes are. They're doing their first job, which is communicating to the court. And their second job would be to actually follow the instructions—do what their client wants them to do. It could be that Ms. Spears and her attorney are talking about the pros and cons of actually doing what it takes to end the conservatorship all the time. And it may be that the attorney doesn't have the instruction to do what it takes yet. Or maybe they have a strategic reason for waiting. It doesn't surprise me that her wishes are being expressed, but no action has been taken on it yet. That could be for many reasons, whether it's strategic, personal, private, or just simply fear of losing. One of the issues is that the longer he is her conservator, probably, the harder it is to remove him. He’ll always rely on his track record, and argue that it has been a success. I would argue, as an attorney, that her preferences, whatever they are, should be given great weight. If it's simply that she wants a different, equally capable conservator instead of her father, there's legal support for the argument that that should carry the day.",3,Reliable,0.0685055014430014,0.406140873015873,2243,3,Vice
471,The Emperor of America – Why Is Biden Governing by Decree?,20.67,13.67,https://www.libertynation.com/the-emperor-of-america-why-is-biden-governing-by-decree/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,18,"With Democrats in control of both branches of Congress, opening a wide berth for legislative action, the question persists as to why Joe Biden has shattered the previousrecordfor unilateral decrees — i.e.,executive orders— in the early days of his presidency. In response, ask yourself these fundamental questions: If you were just elected to the highest office in the land as the oldest president ever to take the oath of office, in declining neurological health, uncertain of just how long you will be able to manage the relentless day-to-day pressures of the job, how would you govern? Would you play the long game, working diligently with a friendly legislature to write permanent change into the law? Or would you decide to leave an immediate and substantial imprint on the nation with a seemingly unprecedented burst of executive action right out of the starting gate? Would this not serve as a hedge against your presidency failing to run its full course and becoming a mere footnote in history?These questions have certainly been answered with an exclamation point by the 46th president. With more than 40 strokes of his executive pen, Biden has front-loaded his fumigation of the Trump presidency and thrown the necessary bouquets to his party’s progressive base. With the iron hand of chief of staff Ron Klain carefully orchestrating access to and scheduling for him, Biden has so far been able to pull off a single-shift presidency, arriving and departing from the Oval Office and required appearances mostly during business hours in small, tightly scripted bursts, with much rest in between. He is the quintessential and polar opposite to his predecessor, famously a perpetual-motion machine who, despite his signature commitment to “drain the Swamp,” employed executive orders far less frequently than Biden in the early days of his administration. And Trump moved swiftly out of the gate in leading the charge or backstopping his own party’s congressional initiatives on a range of issues, from taxes to immigration. When will President Biden begin to employ the majorities he holds in Congress? Time is short for theDemocrats’ narrow controlin the upper and lower chambers. As 2022 looms, they know history has rarely been kind to the ruling party in midterm elections. At some point soon, Biden’s decree machine will start to lose steam. He has shot his load early. The people will inevitably tire of governance by fiat. So what happens when aggressive and energetic presidential support is needed to push controversial legislation across the finish line? Will Biden’s bully pulpit, fired up almost exclusively by teleprompter, generate enough credibility for him to sell the public on, for example, a public option added to Obamacare, as Obama was able to do with Democrat majorities in both houses in 2010? Will he stand behind the inevitable flurry of aggressive and explosively controversial climate change legislation Congress is chomping at the bit to pass, even as those bills would face likely defeat in the Senate? Will he explicitly lend his support to equally contentious race-based initiatives likely to emanate from the House?All presidents seek to leave an indelible mark on the government over which they preside, and Biden is no different. But his time in the Oval Office may be shorter than most. His challenge is twofold: to calm the stormy waters stirred up by his predecessor’s ongoing crusade for systemic change, while attempting to demonstrate that the many institutions and practices challenged and exposed by Trump are worthy of restoration. No easy task for even a president in the prime of life. And while ruling by executive fiat is permissible within clear boundaries in our constitutional order, Biden will soon realize that his legacy will hinge not on what he commands from on high but on what he can persuade the American people to embrace.",0,Problematic,0.1154459561602418,0.5535638699924414,797,0,Liberty Nation
472,Amanda Gorman Inauguration Poet Facts,-5.0,47.0,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a35266445/amanda-gorman-poet-inauguration/,https://adfontesmedia.com/harpers-bazaar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,16,"When President-elect Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States, Amanda Gorman joined the ranks of such massive figures as Robert Frost and Maya Angelou, stepping up to the podium as the president's inaugural poet. She was the youngest poet in the country's known history, presenting at a time unlike any her predecessors have faced. Gorman, 22, was asked to write a poem to symbolize all that Biden stands for—a poem about unity. But in the wake of four years under President Donald Trump, a time no one would describe as united, Gorman told, ""I'm not going to in any way gloss over what we’ve seen over the past few weeks and, dare I say, the past few years."" Her poem, titled ""The Hill We Climb,"" was universally praised, earning her enormous presales of her three upcoming books; nabbing her a modeling contract with IMG; and earning her a reading spot during the Super Bowl LV. Two years after her monumental entry into the spotlight, Gorman is still using poetry to raise awareness of America's unspoken history as well as the nation's current hopes and struggles. Here's who the poet is and why she was born for such a moment as this. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Gorman discovered her talent for poetry when she was still very young. A third-grade teacher captured her attention with Ray Bradbury's poem ""Dandelion Wine,"" according to the, and started her on a path to spend nearly every waking moment journaling. Quickly gaining attention with her work about race, feminism, and the struggle for civil rights, she was named the Youth Poet Laureate of Los Angeles in 2014, and published her first poetry collection, ""The One for Whom Food Is Not Enough,"" in 2015. Then, while studying sociology at Harvard University, she was named the first National Youth Poet Laureate in the United States. The new First Lady was the one who stumbled upon Gorman's work only days before the inauguration. She was watching a reading Gorman gave at the Library of Congress, according to the,when she asked if Gorman might read something for the inauguration. Over a Zoom call, she was told she'd been picked to present, and she'd need to be on a flight to Washington, D. C., soon.“They did not want to put up guardrails for me at all,” Gorman told the. “The theme for the inauguration in its entirety is ‘America United,’ so when I heard that was their vision, that made it very easy for me to say, great, that’s also what I wanted to write about in my poem, about America united, about a new chapter in our country.”While writing her poem, she listened to music that put her ""in a historic and epic mind-set,"" she told the,including the soundtracks from Netflix seriesThe Crown,as well as the soundtrack fromHamilton. But in the weeks coming up to Wednesday, January 20, Gorman hit a roadblock. The pressure to write something so inspiring it would transform a nation, à la Abraham Lincoln's or Martin Luther King Jr.'s addresses, was Herculean. It wasn't until she watched a pro-Trump mob descend on the Capitol earlier this month that she was able to finish ""The Hill We Climb.""After watching Confederate flags stormed through the seat of American government, she added the lines, ""We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it / Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy / And this effort very nearly succeeded / But while democracy can be periodically delayed / It can never be permanently defeated.""Like the 46th president, Gorman has a speech impediment she has worked to overcome. ""The writing process is its own excruciating form, but as someone with a speech impediment, speaking in front of millions of people presents its own type of terror,"" Gorman told theas she prepared for the inauguration. She describedto NPRthat, as a child, she struggled to pronounce certain letters of the alphabet, such as the letterand therefore had to constantly ""self-edit and self-police.""When she first started performing, she worried over which words to include in her poems, fearing that she might not be able to say them correctly.""I would be in the bathroom scribbling five minutes before trying to figure out if I could say 'Earth' or if I can say 'girl' or if I can say 'poetry,'"" she told NPR. ""And you know, doing the best with the poem I could.""She draws courage from the poets who have come before her—especially Angelou, who was mute as a child. ""I think there is a real history of orators who have had to struggle, a type of imposed voicelessness, you know, having that stage at inauguration,"" Gorman says. ""So it's really special for me.""According to the,Gorman plans to run for president in 2036, the first election cycle when she'll be old enough to campaign. Watching Vice President Kamala Harris's historic win solidified her plans.""It makes it more imaginable,"" she told theof Harris's election. ""Once little girls can see it, little girls can be it. Because they can be anything that they want, but that representation to make the dream exist in the first place is huge—even for me.""During the Super Bowl, Gorman's reading of her poem""Chorus of the Captains""was played before the on-field introduction ofthree Americans who received honorary captain titles for their service during the pandemic. Their names are Trimaine Davis, a teacher in Los Angeles; Suzie Dorner, a nurse manager in Florida; and James Martin, a Marine veteran in Pittsburgh who devotes his time to the Wounded Warrior Project and aiding local youth. The poem honored the three honorary captions' ""courage and compassion"" as well as their outstanding commitment to service during the pandemic. Ahead of her reading,the poet wrote, ""Poetry at the Super Bowl is a feat for art & our country, because it means we’re thinking imaginatively about human connection even when we feel siloed. I’ll honor 3 heroes who exemplify the best of this effort. Here’s to them, to poetry, & to a #SuperBowl like no other.""The poet-activist made her Met Gala debut as a co-chair at the September event. For the occasion, Gorman chose a strapless custom Vera Wang gown inspired by the Statue of Liberty. The royal blue gown featured a mini hem, a flowing draped detailing, andmore than 3,000 individually hand-stitched crystals, with the star accessorizing the look with a book-shaped Edie Parker clutch decorated with the text found at the statue's base, ""Give us your tired.""Gorman spoke out amid the back-to-back Buffalo andUvalde shootingslast May. On the day of the Texas shooting, the poet shared lines from a previously published poem on social media, along with a call to action which raised over $1 million for the nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety, perNPR. Later that week she published a new poem called""Hymn For The Hurting,""in memory of the victims. In an NPR interview, she said that she remained hopeful amid the collective anger and despair felt following the incidents.""I think in moments like this, I am hopeful, but I'm actually more stubborn than hopeful, meaning that I'm bringing my obstinance, my strong will, my beating heart,"" she said. ""I know there are forces in this world which would revel and celebrate and throw a party for my powerlessness, and they win unless I continue to show up every day and do what I know to be right.""Gorman's first two poetry books were published last year by Penguin Random House, one of which was a full-length poetry collection featuring her inauguration poem, titledThe book, which was formerly titledThe Hill We Climb and Other Poems,grappled with current events including climate change, the pandemic's exacerbation of existing inequalities, and the racial reckonings of summer 2020. She also released a children's book called, a ""lyrical picture book"" about a young girl on a ""musical journey"" with her friends. The book was illustrated by Loren Long, who also illustrated former President Barack Obama's ""Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.""Fans of Gorman's inauguration poem can also pick up aspecial collector's edition, which released in March 2021.

473,Biden Put Climate at the Heart of His Campaign. Now He’s Delivered Groundbreaking Nominees,-10.33,44.67,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17122020/biden-epa-interior-secretary-deb-haaland-michael-regan-climate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,21,"President-elect Joe Biden rounded out his climate and environment team Thursday with groundbreaking cabinet nominations at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, agencies critical to his pledge to combat climate change and emphasize environmental justice. Michael S. Regan, who has led a transformation of climate policy as North Carolina’s senior environmental official under Gov. Roy Cooper, was nominated to serve as EPA administrator. He would be the first Black man to run the agency that enforces such bedrock environmental laws as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, regulates power plant and tailpipe emissions and oversees cleanup of the nation’s most toxic dumps. U. S. Rep. Deb Haaland, a 35th-generation New Mexican from the Pueblos of Laguna and Jemez, was nominated as thefirst Native American secretary of the interior, which would put her in charge of a department that manages vast federal land holdings and oversees programs that serve 1.9 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Both posts require Senate confirmation. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. A third key environmental official, Brenda Mallory, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, was chosen by Biden to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality, a key coordinating body that will oversee newly elevated councils on environmental justice. Mallory previously served as President Obama’s top lawyer on the council. Biden’s transition team had previously announced the nominations of other key climate and environment team members: former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm for secretary of energy, former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy as national climate advisor and Ali Zaidi, a former Obama administration official now serving as New York’s deputy secretary of energy and environment, as deputy national climate advisor. Last month, Biden named former Secretary of State John Kerry, who helped negotiate the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as his global climate envoy and said he will also sit on the National Security Council. The Biden climate team faces what environmentalists describe as a Herculean rebuilding effort after four years in which the Trump administration has rolled back over 100 environmental regulations, withdrawn the nation from the Paris accord and promoted a fossil fuel agenda at about every turn. Biden put climate change near the center of his campaign, promising a $2 trillion climate and jobs plan for dramatically reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to an economy powered by renewable energy. But his political options will be limited even if he squeaks out a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, with two wins in crucialrunoff racesin Georgia on Jan. 5. Democrats hold only a narrow margin in the HouseWith the loss of one seat in Georgia, Biden could be forced to rely heavily on federal rule-making, which requires deft leadership and executive orders, which are less durable and subject to legal challenge. If confirmed, Haaland will inherit an Interior Department after an aggressive push by the Trump administration to expand oil, gas and coal development on federal lands, along with the taint of a corruption scandal involving Trump’s first Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke. Conflict-of-interest questions have also surrounded the office’s current occupant, David Bernhardt, and legal uncertainty has hung over the controversial tenureof William Perry Pendley as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management. Haaland will face the challenge of undoing dozens of conservative policies only recently embedded in the department’s energy, wildlife and tribal programs. A voice like mine has never been a Cabinet secretary or at the head of the Department of Interior. Growing up in my mother’s Pueblo household made me fierce. I’ll be fierce for all of us, our planet, and all of our protected land. I am honored and ready to serve. Interior’s portfolio also includes a mind-boggling—and contentious—array of duties, from managingone of every five acresin the United States and more than 400 National Park Service units, to protecting endangered species and carrying out the scientific work of the U. S. Geological Survey. Interior, with a record of suppressing the rights and taking the lands of Native Americans, also maintains programs for 574 federally recognized tribes through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Bureau of Education. In Haaland, the president-elect appears to be following through with campaign promises to elevate Indigenous leaders in his administration and to tackle climate change. The congresswoman, who made history two years ago as one of the first two Indigenous women to be elected to Congress, has experience in the fights for both climate and Indigenous causes. And advocates for the environment and for Indigenous rights applauded her nomination. The daughter of military service members, she spent four days in 2016 at the Standing Rock Sioux camps with activists protesting the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline.“Tribes came from everywhere to stand with the water protectors,” said Haaland, calling the effort in aarticleas “an environmental movement that was deep and meaningful,” especially among Native Americans. “It was significant that so many of us came together to protect water, our natural resources.”Haaland, 60, won reelection last month as one of three New Mexico Democrats in the U. S. House of Representatives after having served as vice chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, chair of the national parks, forests, and public lands subcommittee and as a member of the Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the United States. While her work includes keeping climate change at the forefront of the committee’s agenda, she’s also been known to press for clean energy policies that would help maintain jobs and paychecks in a leading state for fossil fuel energy. She has been a supporter of the Green New Deal and a fracking ban, which would put her at odds with Biden. With the Biden-Harris administration, federal climate action is back on the table,” said Zuni tribal member and New Mexico farmer Jim Enote, who’s also CEO of the Native-led Colorado Plateau Foundation and soon-to-be board chairman of the environmental advocacy group, the Grand Canyon Trust. The American Petroleum Institute’s Mike Sommers said in a news release that the oil and gas industry is ready to work with Haaland and the Biden administration on climate change.“In the year ahead, we will continue to advocate for policies that promote technological innovation, advance modern energy infrastructure and support access to natural gas and oil resources—both on federal and private lands—which will be critical to rebuilding our economy and maintaining America’s status as a global energy leader,” Sommers said, emphasizing that the campaign made promises to the energy work force and millions of indirect jobs. Regan may be especially well suited to lead the EPA, an agency that has been downsized and demoralized under Trump, with his fossil fuel and deregulatory agenda. Regan took over the leadership of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality in 2017 under similar circumstances, following the administration of Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, and his top environmental regulator, Donald R. van der Vaart, whom critics have described as a crusading idealogue.“They were taking climate change off websites,” Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said of van der Vaart’s leadership. “It wasn’t about science. It was about customer service and putting polluters first.”He said that “what Regan has done is phenomenal. Our loss will be the country’s gain.”Regan has done “extensive work in the realm of retiring coal plants and addressing the issue of coal ash and legacy pollution,” added Jennifer Rennicks, a policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a resident of North Carolina. She also credited Regan with carrying out Cooper’s broad-based climate agenda that has included an in depthexaminationof how global warming is affecting North Carolina, and an ambitiousclimate action plan. Cooper’s efforts have stood out in the South. There’s been a big focus on “addressing climate change through clean energy and electric vehicles and transportation,” Rennicks said. Cooper’s plan calls for transforming the state’s electrical grid to save energy and make it more resilient; reducing the energy burdens of low-income residents; and cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by 60 to 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, while working toward zero emissions by 2050, among other steps. National groups expressed support for Regan as EPA administrator. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said that Biden “ran on the boldest, strongest climate policy—one that centers climate justice—in history. As he continues to build his cabinet, perhaps no pick thus far emphasizes this focus as much as Michael Regan.”In North Carolina, Regan’s “attention to addressing environmental justice, cleaning up coal ash, and prioritizing clean energy is exactly what the country requires as the Biden administration seeks to rebuild after the worst administration ever for our environment and the climate,” Brune said. A top energy lobbyist also praised Regan.“Michael Regan has had an impressive rise, from the EPA air program to the public interest community to heading the North Carolina state agency,” said Scott Segal, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who works with energy clients. “He has brought fresh thinking along the way.“Regan understands that tough environmental goals tempered with economic and technological reality produce the best approach on everything from climate change to more local problems,” Segal said. “We look forward to working with him in his new post.”Dennis McLerran, the former EPA Region 10 administrator who left the agency in 2017, said Regan will have to immediately tackle matters critical to returning the agency to its role as an environmental watchdog.“Those include addressing the regulatory rollbacks that have occurred during the Trump Administration and bringing good science forward as the fundamental underpinning of regulatory policies and decisions,” he said. Regan will need to address climate change by restoring programs that address methane emissions and tailpipe emissions along with setting the course for the U. S. to achieve Paris-based emission levels, McLerran said. Bill Muno, former director of the EPA’s Superfund program for the Great Lakes Region from 1995 to 2005, echoed the hope of renewed emphasis on environmental justice, especially near Superfund sites. A recentinvestigationby Inside Climate News, NBC News and The Texas Observer found 945 Superfund sites nationwide vulnerable to climate-amplified hurricanes, flooding, sea level rise and wildfires.“To the degree that there will be a renewed emphasis on addressing sites in EJ communities, that will be a big positive for the Superfund program,” he said. “Hopefully the new administration will provide the funding to support this new emphasis.”Regan was reportedly Biden’s second choice for EPA. After an uprising by environmental justice and progressive groups, Biden passed over the candidate who was long thought to be the favorite for the EPA slot, Mary Nichols, a former assistant EPA administrator and the outgoing chair of the California Air Resources Board. Nichols has deep knowledge and hands-on experience with what is likely to be Biden’s top climate policy challenge at EPA, restoring strong fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles. After Trump jettisoned the single largest step that the Obama administration had taken to address climate, Nichols brokered a deal with five automakers to keep fuel economy improvements on track—an agreement that is thought to be a likely template for a nationwide auto industry deal. But 70 national and California environmental justice groups and other organizations sent a letter to Biden’s transition team last week blasting Nichols as having a “bleak track record in addressing environmental racism.”At the center of their dispute is California’s cap-and-trade program to cut carbon emissions. Minority communities who are already overburdened with pollution say it has allowed them to become sacrifice zones, as polluters take easier steps to meet their obligations, like purchasing offsets. Veloz, a nonprofit electric car advocacy group that Nichols was instrumental in getting off the ground, had an online tribute to her tenure at CARB that seemed designed to address the environmental justice groups’ concerns; they showed a slide of Nichols in the 1963 March on Washington for civil rights, and talked about her work in the 1960s registering Blacks to vote. But opposition to her appointment by the activist groups that had worked hard for Biden’s election proved too difficult to overcome. The controversy shows how environmental justice and climate policy are becoming intertwined as never before, and as the Biden administration takes shape. It also shows how cap-and-trade, once thought to be the most politically viable climate solution, has fallen deeply out of favor. Biden has not talked about it as part of his plan, but activists were determined not to see a California-style cap-and-trade program emerge from Biden’s EPA.“We’re glad to see President-elect Biden listen to frontline communities and pass over … Nichols,” said Lisa Ramsden, a Greenpeace senior climate campaigner. “In doing so, Biden gave himself the chance to choose an EPA administrator who will prioritize justice for the communities most impacted by fossil-fueled pollution.”",3,Reliable,0.1011166426166426,0.420987012987013,2753,3,Inside Climate News

Greg Abbott signed the “Heartbeat Bill” into law. The law prohibits all abortions in the state after about six weeks into pregnancy, which is generally when a heartbeat can be heard on ultrasound. The law has provisions that would allow private citizens to file civil lawsuits against doctors, staff, or even a patient’s family or friends who “aid and abet” in such procedures. BREAKING:@GovAbbottsigns a bill into law banning abortion after a child's heartbeat can be detected. THANK YOU to the human rights advocates who brought this bill through the finish line. Much work is still to be done, but this is a great step forward.— Live Action (@LiveAction)May 19, 2021The Associated Presshad this to say:Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday signed a law that bans abortions in Texas before many women even know they are pregnant and differs singularly from similar efforts nationwide: leaving enforcement to private citizens, who can sue doctors or anyone who helps a woman get an abortion. The law puts Texas in linewith more than a dozen other statesthat ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, possibly as early as six weeks. It would take effect in September, but federal courts have mostly blocked states from enforcing similar measures. The dominoes are falling, in what is hoped to be a complete knockdown of. As I reported a few days ago, thepro-abortion machineis noting these moves and sounding the alarm bells. The pro-life movement is finally learning how to play hardball and strategizing for the long game. At least 13 states have moved to introduce this type of legislation, drafted their own heartbeat-style bills, or signed them into law. So far they include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, and Tennessee. Despite some of these laws not having been implemented because of the pro-abortion lobby blocking with lawsuits and countersuits, the Population Research Institute, which tracks this form of legislation and its effectiveness, sees them as a strong part of the strategy tooverturn, by further eroding the law from statehouse to statehouse. Heartbeat laws ban abortion from the moment in pregnancy that a heartbeat can be detected. Heartbeat laws are among the strongest pro-life laws ever adopted on the state level since the U. S. Supreme Court in its 1973decision prohibited states from banning abortion prior to viability. Additionally, these laws may prove to be key in leading the Supreme Court to reconsider and possibly overturnRoe v. Wade. An embryonic heartbeat can be detected very early in pregnancy, typically by 6-10 weeks gestation using the best methods of standard medical practice and typically by 7-12 weeks via transabdominal ultrasound.1However, some studies claim to have been able to detect embryonic heartbeats via ultrasound even earlier than 6 weeks.2Studies have shown that less than 5% of normal, natural pregnancies result in spontaneous miscarriage after a heartbeat is detected.3,4,5This has been shown to hold true even among women with clinically diagnosed threatened miscarriages.6,7The presence of a fetal heartbeat is a very strong indicator that a child will survive to birth. In light of the 2019 Tennessee heartbeat law going before the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals today, as well as Monday’sSCOTUS decisionto hear, the abortion lobby is moving into hyperdrive to discredit and destroy the pro-life argument of heartbeat viability as just a marketing ploy used to manipulate the public in championinglaws that further restrict abortions. Yet bans pegged to the “fetal heartbeat” concept have been signed into law in 13 states, including Cackovic’s home state of Ohio. None has taken effect, with all but the most recently enacted being struck down or temporarily blocked by the courts. Now, one of the most restrictive, signed by Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee last year, goes before the 6th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday. Proponents of these so-called “heartbeat bills” are hoping for a legal challenge to eventually reach the U. S. Supreme Court, where they look for the conservative coalition assembled under President Donald Trump to end the constitutional right to abortion protected under the high court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The notion that abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy “stops a beating heart” helped propel the measures to rise above persistent constitutional concerns in the states that have backed them. The concept’s originator, Ohio anti-abortion activist Janet Folger Porter, spoke openly about her strategy in an email to supporters last year — deftly side-stepping whether the packaging of the bill was medically true.“The slogan, ‘Abortion stops a beating heart,’ has long been an effective way to highlight the injustice and inhumanity of abortion,” Porter wrote of the state’s law, the Ohio Heartbeat Protection Act. However, the pro-abortion lobby’s argument of “science” has been weakened by anti-life politicians and so-called health officials making the 2020 pandemic a political football. As the dust settles on the lockdowns and their adverse effect on not only the economy, but the toll on human lives outside of the virus, the Left’s use of science as a cudgel for control, as opposed to a defense of life and freedom, will be the lingering stain on the pro-abortion/anti-choice movement.",1,Questionable,0.1385727879206139,0.4399700943179203,1186,0,RedState

We’ll get into the philosophical discussion about all of this in a moment but, on a personal note, I find it rather exhausting just attempting to keep up with whom or whatever they are mad at during any given moment. At this point, I’m not even certain there are any statues left in America. What we’ve witnessed in recent weeks is truly a descent into madness. Criminals are taking over cities with the backing of the elected officials who run those cities. Those same officials are proudly abandoning their police forces to score points with a bunch of Marxists, then predictably seeing violent crime skyrocket overnight. We are supposed to believe that this is all being done in the name of delivering some long-overdue justice. It’s all bunk. The always-eloquent Thomas Sowell put it very well ina recent conversation with Mark Levin:Right off the bat, Levin asked Sowell about theriotingthat has gone on nightly in America since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. “I’m regarded as pessimistic,” Sowell said, “but I was never pessimistic enough to believe that things would degenerate to the point where they are now, where adult human beings are talking about getting rid of the police … what is frightening is how many people in responsible positions are caving in to every demand that is made, repeating any kind of nonsense that you’re supposed to repeat. I do believe that we may well reach a point of no return. I hope, of course, that will never happen.”Count me among the pessimists. We’re not focusing on riots today but this is all tied together. It’s only Tuesday and the grievance-mongers have been busy. They pulled off the seemingly impossible,making Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder back downafter years of saying that he wouldn’t change the team’s name. Barely pausing to take a breath, the grievance mob thendecided to go after the Texas Rangers. That’s a rather ambitious Monday. But wait, there’s more!ran a post yesterday titled “Don’t Stop at Statues. Demand a Reconsideration of Place Names Too.”This grievance slope isn’t just slippery, they’ve now got a free army of people to keep covering it with Vaseline. We’ll be sliding down it forever at this rate. I don’t care if people have hurt feelings. Everybody has hurt feelings at one time or another. The thing is, the lunatics that are becoming a bigger blight on America every day always have hurt feelings. They wake up aggrieved, and the day just becomes one long list of grievances that is updated hourly. Though it may seem impossible, there is an inexhaustible supply of grievances to keep them raging. Back in the Occupy days, I kept saying and writing that the rage was the endgame for them. It’s basically the same now. They keep saying they want change, and I don’t doubt that they would like to affect some political change here and there, but that won’t make them any less angry. There is nothing that will make them less angry simply because angry is what they want to be. The grievance freaks will always find another grievance. They’re addicted to it. What’s disturbing about the last couple of months is the pace at which they’re finding new ones. As we have seen with the destruction of the statues, they are alsonot very discriminateabout focusing their wrath. It’s very aggravating that there are so many Republicans in Washington who don’t understand this. We’re fighting for the soul of America and we’ve got Republicans in Congress going on about statues as if they’re trying to get dates with antifa. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Mitt Romney at the next statue-toppling. He and his ilk are forever convinced that, if they just give the grievance crowd one more concession, everything will be roses and puppies. There is no telling how long we’re going to be subjected to this nonsense that’s largely being fueled by woke white people at theandNew York Times, but it will no doubt be a while. We may truly have reached a point of no return. The inmates are most definitely running the asylum right now. Yeah, yeah, I know…that’s offensive to crazy people.

Mitch McConnellblinkedWednesday afternoon and indicated that Republicans would not filibuster legislation to lift the debt ceiling for the next few months. Schumerreported the resultson the floor Thursday morning: ""We have reached an agreement to extend the debt ceiling into early December.”That agreementreportedlywill increase the borrowing authority of the Treasury by $480 billion, enough to fund borrowing until Dec. 3. That'sthe same daythe continuing resolution that is currently funding government operations expires. McConnell only blinked enough to set up a double whammy of hostage-taking to once again ruin the holiday season. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen informed Congress a few weeks ago that she would run out of options for paying our bills on Oct. 18. Andfor weeksRepublicans have been insisting that they would not help Democrats pay the bills, including the$7.8they amassed in the last four years under the former guy, with the massive tax giveaway to the super rich. In fact, 46 of themsigned onto a letterback on Aug. 10 saying: ""We … are letting Senate Democrats and the American public know that we will not vote to increase the debt ceiling, whether that increase comes through a stand-alone bill, a continuing resolution, or any other vehicle.""At least six of them are liars, because 10 of them are going to help Democrats increase the debt ceiling in a stand-alone bill either Thursday or Friday. That's possibly because McConnell hadreal fearthat his intransigence was finally going to make Democrats nuke the filibuster, if just for the debt ceiling. He and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin havereportedlybeen in discussions about it throughout the week. Because of course Manchin is going to coordinate with McConnell. McConnell himselfsuggestedthat on the floor Wednesday, in typical troll-like fashion: ""It's not clear whether the Democratic leaders have wasted two-and-a-half months because they simply cannot govern, or whether they are intentionally playing Russian roulette with the economy to try to bully their own members into going back on their word and wrecking the Senate,"" he said. It's entirely possible that Democrats were on that brink. One told Politico: ""The filibuster is McConnell’s instrument of obstruction … He wants to protect that at all costs. He was at real risk of overplaying his hand as he faced the growing prospect that we would have 51 votes to waive it for the purpose of dealing with debt. He wanted to avoid creating that precedent. Still, would have been better for us to just do it."" Yes. It would have. The good news is it could happen in December just as easily, when hopefully they will at the same time just decide to take the whole bogus weapon of the debt ceiling away from McConnell for good. There's one loud voice for finally ending this stupid fight. ""We always do this fucking dance,""saidMontana's Sen. Jon Tester a few weeks ago. ""I don't know if people are going to put their sane minds on and do what needs to be done, or shut it down. This is just a ridiculous exercise … I can't even compare it to anything I do on the farm that's this stupid.""Thursday is likely to be largely devoted to coming to agreement with Republicans onthe debt ceiling vote will occur. Schumer filed for cloture on it Thursday morning, and it would normally take 30 hours to ""ripen"" for the first procedural vote. He'strying to ""hotline"" itwith McConnell, and get agreement from all Republicans to get it done before Saturday. That's probably not going to happen, as ""a lot"" of Republicans are ""mad as fire"" at McConnell for capitulating, at leastaccordingto a Fox News reporter. That makes sense, since the former guy still rules their worlds, and he blasted McConnell after news of the agreement. ""Looks like Mitch McConnell is folding to the Democrats, again,"" hesaid. One of those angry Republicans is Trump's loyal puppet and caddy, Lindsey Graham. “I'm upset with us because we had a strategy to make them [Democrats] pay a price to raise the debt ceiling […] We blinked and why because two people are normally made more or threatening to change the rules of the Senate, we make it hard,"" hetoldreporters. Then hegavesome good advice: ""The next thing you know the filibuster dies or carve outs.

President Joe Biden, in his first address to a joint session of Congress in April,outlinedwhat he hoped would be a historic $1.8 trillion investment in policies such as paid family and medical leave, universal pre-kindergarten and two free years of community college. It was unclear at the time whether Biden’s American Families Plan would move forward on its own, given near-total Republican opposition, or whether it would be paired with Biden’s infrastructure-focused $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. Democrats subsequently decided to pursue a narrower, bipartisan infrastructure package on its own, then turn to a process known as reconciliation, which allows them to avoid overcoming a typically required 60-vote threshold in the evenly divided 100-seat Senate, to pass a version of Biden’s families proposal with only Democratic votes. When the bipartisan group of senators engaged in infrastructure negotiations returned to the White House on Thursday, they announced they had agreed to invest $1.2 trillion over eight years, including more than $500 billion in new spending. Biden said “none of us got what we all would’ve wanted” and there were “serious compromises on both ends.” Democrats will negotiate child care and other “human infrastructure” using reconciliation as the two proposals move on a “dual track,” Biden said. But Democratic lawmakers have said that before they can approve the infrastructure deal, they need to see the parameters of the second spending package that will fund paid leave, education and other party priorities. Some would also like assurances from moderate colleagues such as Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona that they will not derail the second spending package.“One can’t be done without the other,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters as he left a meeting with top White House aides on Wednesday night.

You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had met with Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Shalanda Young, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice to discuss both the bipartisan infrastructure negotiations and the American Families Plan.“They underscored the importance of extending the child tax credit, and investing in the care economy, including expanding child care, to help ensure that women can return to the workforce,” the White House said. Both the House and Senate are aiming to vote on both bills sometime in July before Congress begins its August recess. Pelosi said when leaving the meeting that the House would vote on the bipartisan infrastructure package “as soon as we see a reconciliation bill.”On Thursday Pelosi was more blunt, saying the House would not vote on the bipartisan infrastructure package until the Senate has passed both the infrastructure and reconciliation bills.“There ain’t going to be no bipartisan bill unless we have the reconciliation bill,” she told reporters in her weekly briefing. Biden said shortly after that he agreed with Pelosi’s approach. “I’m not just signing the bipartisan bill,” he told reporters. Some senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have likewiseindicatedthey would prefer to vote on, not just see, a reconciliation bill before voting on the infrastructure measure. The vehicle to set the parameters for what will make it into the American Families Plan will be budget resolutions passed by the House and Senate. The negotiations begin in the budget committees, and a draft proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Massachusetts, who chairs the Senate panel, is already circulating in Washington. Budget resolutions are non-binding blueprints that help guide congressional committees in areas like education and energy as they help assemble broad spending bills that are eventually passed and signed into law. Sanders has proposed spending nearly $6 trillion over a decade — about $1.6 trillion more than Biden’s proposals — on investments that include $200 billion in universal pre-kindergarten, $300 billion on child care, $225 billion on paid leave and $390 billion on education programs, including free community college, according to a draft reviewed by The 19th. Manchin, one of the Democrats on the bipartisan infrastructure negotiation team,said this week that he supports using reconciliation to make such investments in “human infrastructure.” But he alsosaid recentlythat two free years of community college may not help students graduate, illustrating the extent to which Democrats will likely need to negotiate over Biden’s families plan before agreeing to its passage.",3,Reliable,0.0821896853146853,0.3411931818181818,1079,3,19th News
481,“Settle for Biden” Instagram Account Hopes to Influence Young Voters,-5.67,46.0,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/settle-for-biden-instagram-interview,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"Rememberthe mid-2010s, when memes of Vice President Joe Biden became so ubiquitous that he couldn’t hold anice cream cone,wear aviator sunglasses, or showaffectionto President Barack Obama without unleashing a fresh serving of shareable content? Or when Twitter agreed we would most definitely allow ayoungeriteration of the current Democratic presidential nominee to leave us on read?Now, those trends feel like totems of a more stable time gone by — one in which many young peoplesupportedthe nation’s top leaders and felt they were doing an okay job. Their attitudes towards those in or seeking power have since grown much more complicated. Biden’slack of interestin defunding the police or embracing “Medicare for All,” combined with hishistoryof allegations of inappropriate behavior toward women (which he has vehemently denied), have leftincreasingly progressiveGen Z and millennial voters with a moreapathetic viewof the former vice president. Recentpollshave indicated that while people between the ages of 18 to 29 say they’d choose Biden over Donald Trump, they have a less favorable view of him than older registered voters — and young voterstend to turn outat lower rates than their older counterparts. One increasingly popular Instagram account is trying to disrupt these expectations, encouraging young voters to simply “settle” for the former VP. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. In late spring, as it became abundantly clear that Biden would win the nomination, Sam Weinberg, a 19-year-old Illinois native and former backer of Senator Bernie Sanders’s candidacy, experienced what he called “a bit of an internal freakout.”“I just thought, 'I’m going to do everything within my personal power to make sure that Donald Trump doesn’t have a second term,’ because I know that I certainly don’t have it in me to deal with four more years of Trump and the people who are going to be even more affected certainly don’t have it within them,” he toldVogue. Thus, Settle for Biden was born. In Weinberg’s words, the Instagram account slash digital organizing platform is, “a combination of sardonic millennial and Gen Z humor combined with...you know, substantive policy proposals.”The introductorypostfrom early April, which garnered more than 600 likes — as well as comments like, “Burn in hell, everything that comes out of your mouths is a lie,” and quite simply, “no thanks” — noted that the page’s founders saw Biden as “bad,” but better than our current president, encouraging followers to shift their support to the nominee.“Now is not the time to be petty; now is the time to defeat Donald Trump and his dangerous agenda,” Weinberg warned in the post. The account’s follower list has since shot up to more than 129,000 and includes major public figures, from actor Kerry Washington to noted activists like Black Lives Matter cofounder Patrisse Cullors. Weinberg, who says he managed the account by himself until June, has had to expand operations due to its unexpected success. By enlisting a bevy of student volunteers, like Aditya Bhalla, a friend who attends Pomona College, Weinberg has built what he refers to as “a grassroots collective,” of other young former supporters of Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren across the United States. In addition to Instagram, the group now produces content for Twitter and Facebook, and is currently in talks with a few other digital organizing platforms. Bhalla, a double major in political science and math, is charged with creating some of the viral-worthy graphics, includingoneof famous abolitionist and Black Panther Angela Davis, whosaidin July that she would cast a vote for Biden’s bid because he “can be most effectively pressured” by the left. Alongside her photo was the question, “She’s settling for Biden. Why can’t you?”Just after Senator Kamala Harris was announced as Biden’s pick for vice president, Bhalla made agraphiccomparing Pence and Harris that highlighted the stark differences between the two — from opinions on climate justice to. It would soon become the most-liked post on the account, boasting nearly 41,000 likes as of late August. For Bhalla, “settling” applies to both candidates on the ticket. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.“People view Kamala’s record as a prosecutor and say she’s just as bad, and I understand that. I understand why Kamala wouldn’t be your ideal choice for vice president,” he told. “At the same time, I do think there is a certain amount of value in terms of being the first Black female vice president. She’s half Indian. She has a very far-left Senate record, and I do think that has value.”Though Trump’s record was more than enough for Weinberg and Bhalla to back Biden, they’re keenly aware that getting others to coalesce around the Democratic nominee won’t be quite so simple. Weinberg described hate mail as “frequent,” but says he remains unfazed. His focus is on encouraging the persuadable to come around to his side, noting that Instagram users have repeatedly reached out to credit the account’s content for convincing their friends to register to vote.“This is the first election year where millennials and Gen Z will make up [such a large percentage] of eligible voters. But all odds are that they will not be the majority of people who actually cast ballots, so, we’re doing everything that we can to make sure that young people go to the polls and vote for the right person,” he explained. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Bhalla, on the other hand, is more empathetic to fellow young supporters of former candidates like Sanders and Warren who feel reluctant to shift their support to an establishment Democrat.“I think initially, my thought process before shifting to settling for Biden was that Democrats and Republicans are kind of on two sides of the same coin. They’re both controlled by the corporate elite. There’s a lot of money in politics, so it really doesn’t matter. But as time went on and the coronavirus continued to grow, we saw howDonald Trump handled protesters outside the White House, how he continues tosabotage the Postal Serviceand to me, those are threats to democracy,” Bhalla said. “Biden isn’t going to fix all of our problems, but he is not going to threaten a lot of the institutions that we do hold sacred, including our right to free and fair elections.”ByP. Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara DelgadoWeinberg’s mix of “sardonic humor” and “flashy” graphics may not ultimately convince young people to cast ballots. This isn’t 2016. People are more suspicious of how candidates are marketed online. However, Bhalla is banking on two things very relevant to young people: peer pressure and social media trends.“That 18-to-24 demographic is very involved, they’re paying attention, they’re protesting on their social media feeds, they’re reposting things about how to be an ally, how to be an advocate, how to become more politically involved. The way we see it, maybe we can capitalize on this recent shift in social media,” he says. “If you see a lot of people around you voting and posting that they’re voting and saying, ‘I’m going to vote,’ perhaps it has an effect on the rest of the demographic.”Weinberg and Bhalla won’t say whether or not they think Biden will actually win or whether or not they’ll be able to deliver on their platform’s mission, but they are optimistic about being able to continue to push the party left, with Bhalla pointing to the recent wins of progressive congressional candidates likeBlack Lives Matter organizer Cori Bush in MissouriandRepresentative Ilhan Omar’s resounding reelection victory in Minneapolis. “Settling,” it seems, is just one step in a continued fight to elect more progressives to office and keep up the pressure on Biden. But for now, the Settle for Biden team is focused on November.“Voting is one of the easiest things [youth] can do to make the changes they want to see, whether that’s the climate crisis, making college affordable, increasing the minimum wage,” Bhalla said. “Those are all things that are part of the Biden platform, and if people really care about those things, then they will go out and vote.”?

He was responding to a question from a reporter about the alleged role of ""platforms like Facebook"" in spreading falsehoods about vaccines and the pandemic. The White House has been increasing pressure on social media companies to tackle disinformation. Facebook says it is taking ""aggressive action"" to protect public health.""They're killing people,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House on Friday. ""The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated.""US health officials have warned that the country's current spike in Covid-19 deaths and infections is exclusively hitting unvaccinated communities. BBC Reality Check debunks five false vaccine claimsEarlier on Friday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Facebook and other platforms were not doing enough to combat misinformation about vaccines.""Obviously, there are steps they have taken,"" she said. ""It's clear that there are more that can be taken.""A spokesman for Facebook, Kevin McAlister, said the company would ""not be distracted by accusations which aren't supported by the facts"".""We've removed more than 18 million pieces of Covid misinformation [and] removed accounts that repeatedly break these rules,"" the company said in a separate statement. You get the sense Facebook is becoming increasingly tired of being criticised by US governments. Mr Trump and fellow Republicans believed Facebook was restricting free speech by cracking down on voter-fraud conspiracies. Mr Biden and his team have a different criticism - that Facebook doesn't do enough to take down conspiracies - such as anti-vax content. Last week the president signed an executive order aimed at trying to check the power of companies like Facebook. Facebook is by no means the only company that has been accused of failing to act on conspiracies. YouTube, for example, has been slammed for its moderation practices. That Mr Biden picks out Facebook is indicative of a personal grudge he has with the company. In January 2020 he told the New York Times: ""I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan. I think he's a real problem.""Concerningly for Facebook, Mr Biden is now the president, and his rhetoric is only getting harsher. Facebook has faced criticism for its moderation, and misleading content about the pandemic is still widely available on its platforms. Earlier on Friday Rochelle Walensky, director of the US public health body Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters: ""There is a clear message that is coming through: this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.""About 67.9% of US adults have received one dose of the vaccine, while 59.2% of adults are fully vaccinated. Many eligible people refusing vaccinations in the US have said they don't trust them. In March, a report said anti-vaccine activists on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter had reached ""more than 59 million followers, making these the largest and most important social media platforms for anti-vaxxers"". That same month, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey - the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter respectively - were questioned in Congress over disinformation. Mr Dorsey told the senators that Twitter was committed to moderating posts. Mr Pichai said YouTube worked to remove misleading content, and highlighted its role in relaying vaccine information. It comes after social media platforms admitted censoring revelations about politically embarrassing emails leaked from Mr Biden's son's laptop in the run-up to last November's presidential election.

483,The Next Robert Mueller … or a Liberal Brett Kavanaugh?,-10.33,40.33,https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/the-next-robert-mueller-or-a-liberal-brett-kavanaugh/93473,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2019-04-17,25,"Shakespeare couldn’t have written two better foils when Elizabeth Prelogar and Brett Kavanaugh squared off in a makeshift courtroom that December night in 2016. The former Miss Idaho was a prosecutor — an appellate attorney to the U. S. solicitor general — and a Democrat who had donated to the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Kavanaugh, then a judge with the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals, was a member of the conservative Federal Society who would later spark liberal outrage with his appointment to the Supreme Court by Donald Trump. Despite their differences, fate had brought them to Washington’s Shakespeare Theatre Company for a mock trial of Friar Laurence for the “wrongful death” of Romeo and Juliet. And through the comedic evening, their similar wit emerged. When Prelogar introduced Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” into the record, Kavanaugh noted that the song replaced Shakespeare’s tragic ending with a happy one. “This court can’t rewrite history like that — we’re not the Ninth Circuit,” he said, a dig at the West Coast appellate court’s progressive bent. “They have tried to impugn [the friar’s] character. And to that I say: When they go low, he goes high. Really, really high. He’s with Him,” Prelogar said, pointing to the heavens with a political nod (to Michelle Obama) of her own. If all the world is a stage, then Prelogar is poised to become one of its major players. The 39-year-old fluent Russian speaker worked as a top prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 election while on loan from the U. S. Solicitor General’s office, reportedly tasked with research and interviewing key witnesses. Before that, she clerked for Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Kavanaugh, too, clerked on the highest court (for Justice Anthony Kennedy) before serving on a special counsel investigation (for Ken Starr’s Bill Clinton probe). Which makes it worth wondering: Is Prelogar headed toward a future that looks more like Mueller’s or Kavanaugh’s? “There are several facets that are important to presidents when they nominate — and some of that dovetails with Elizabeth,” says Adam Feldman, a court scholar who runs the blog Empirical SCOTUS (neither Prelogar nor the solicitor general’s office responded to requests for comment). While any such forecast is fraught with hypotheticals, Prelogar seems poised for a possible judgeship or a long career as a prosecutor, particularly under a potential future Democratic president. She has already argued six Supreme Court cases since 2014, including the historic first argument of the 2016 term, which had an equal number of men (five justices) and women (three justices, two attorneys) considering a case bearing on the issue of double jeopardy in Bravo-Fernandez v. United States. The year prior, less than 20 percent of the lawyers appearing before the court had been women. Feldman is aware of only one other instance where women stood on equal footing with men in a Supreme Court case. That experience, plus her youth, is an advantage. “The legacy aspect is big,” Feldman notes: Presidents want to see their picks stay on the court for decades. “She definitely has a stage presence that is not typical for a high-powered lawyer … she is personable, has a lot of wit,” says David Lat, the founder of the legal profession news site Above the Law, who has met Prelogar and followed her career. Her work at high-powered law firm Hogan Lovells could pay off during a confirmation, Lat says, when she can retort to Republicans: “How much of a leftist can I be?” Still, the donations to Obama and Clinton could hurt her if she ever faces a nomination process from a Republican Senate, or if she’s ever considered as a Mueller-style, nonpartisan figure to investigate a president. And before she gets on any Supreme short lists, she’d likely need to serve time as a judge to show the kind of reliable ideological bent presidents have come to count on for their high court nominees. Regardless, there is time for Prelogar to don a judge’s robes — a far cry from the gowns she wore years ago as a head-turning beauty queen. She shone there, too, winning the “Triple Crown” of pageants: Miss Teen Idaho (1998), Miss Idaho USA (2001) and Miss Idaho (2004). As a slogan-bearer for the state, Prelogar honed her voice, showing a particular softness to the children she met. “As long as I brought the crown with me, it was easy to get them to listen,” she told Emory College, where she was an undergraduate, after becoming a Rhodes Scholarship national finalist in 2002. “Then afterward, they would all want to try it on — even the boys.” Following a master’s in creative writing at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, she was accepted to Harvard Law — but deferred to pursue a yearlong Fulbright Scholarship in St. Petersburg, where she won an Overseas Press Club Foundation award for an essay documenting censorship of the Russian press. Her interest stemmed from wanting to read the great Russian authors in their native language. “Now I can read poetry in the original, which is wonderful because in poetry especially so much is lost in translation,” she told Emory. An interesting twist to Prelogar’s story is her Forrest Gump–like cameos in the lives of those making news in national politics today. She was a contender in the 2001 Miss USA contest where Trump (who owned the competition as part of the Miss Universe umbrella) was later accused of purposefully walking in on half-dressed and naked contestants on multiple occasions. And before working for Ginsburg and Kagan, Prelogar clerked for Merrick Garland, the D. C. Circuit Court judge Republicans famously refused to consider for the Supreme Court in 2016. Those instances, in addition to her comedic bout with Kavanaugh and others, matter more than mere kismet. They illuminate her status as a capital insider, Feldman says, which bodes well for her chances of being nominated to the D. C. Circuit one day — a feeder for the highest court: “If that’s an interest of hers, she knows the right people.” Soon her mock court sparring could become Washington reality.

S. Air Force could be one year away from being able to load its cargo planeswith pallets of smart weapons, transforming them into strike aircraft without the need for expensive and lengthy modifications. In August, the Air Force Research Laboratory awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth up to $25 million to develop a palletized munitions system, Scott Callaway, director of the company’s Advanced Strike Systems division, told reporters during a Oct. 29 briefing. Under the terms of the agreement, Lockheed will demonstrate the new system in flight tests scheduled for 2021, he said. During the tests, parcels filled with Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range weapon, or JASSM-ER, will be rolled on a cargo plane, dropped out the back, and then — when at a safe distance from the aircraft — the missiles will deploy. The goal is to reconfigure Air Force airlift assets, which are normally employed for nonlethal missions such as the transportation of personnel and equipment, so they can cheaply launcha mass of standoff weaponswithout having to move into contested airspace. The demonstration will be done using standard airdrop procedures used to deliver supplies and people, and it will not require aircraft modifications.“The ability to use the same airlifters to deploy missiles without modification provides flexibility that could save billions in platform modification costs and also provides a new capability to get a large number of airborne [strike] assets into the theater,” Callaway said. Large airlift planes like the C-17 could deploy up to 32 JASSM-ERs based on initial studies, but those numbers could change during development, Callaway said. The system itself is being designed with a common interface so it can drop other munition types.“We’re working with the Air Force now to come up with that optimal payload and optimal loadout,” he said. “It’s partially a function of the deployment airdrop system, the missile being loaded onto the system and the range that the aircraft is flying. Obviously as smaller munitions come online, we expect that loadout to increase without the need to design a new palletized munition system.”The missiles would be configured with preplanned routes before launch, but the system will also include a mission computer that lets operators update target information, he added. Lockheed demonstrated an early version of the capability last month during thesecond Advanced Battle Management System experiment. During the event, an unnamed Air Force Special Operations Command aircraft dropped a mock pallet of JASSMs out the rear of the plane. In a separate demonstration, Air Mobility Command conducted a simulated drop of palletized munitions using a C-17, according to an Air Force news release“A palletized munitions capability could enable various airlift aircraft to employ a range of weapons en masse via a self-contained, roll-on/roll-off palletized system, and may offer an alternative way for the Air Force to bring more mass to the fight,” said Dean Evans, the Air Force Research Lab’s palletized munitions experimentation program manager. Earlier this year, Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote, currently the head of the Air Force’s strategy, integration and requirements office, said that as technology for palletized munitions matures, the service must determine how to control a mobility asset that is playing a combat role similar to a bomber.“Some kind of extremely streamlined command and control is going to be necessary, or else you must have an integrator somewhere,” said Hinote, who added that cultural barriers inside the Air Force could be harder to overcome than the technological challenges of creating palletized munitions.

As of Wednesday, we've added another character to the books with news that the Manhattan district attorney officially filed criminal tax charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer,Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg plans toplead not guilty to the charges, his attorney said.)A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political. It is no surprise that the corporate defendant in the New York criminal case is owned by former President Donald Trump. This is the same Trump whorepeatedly called the Russia investigation a “witch hunt”and verbally abused special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions. This is the same Trump who showed contempt for elections in November 2020 when he asked the Georgia secretary of state to “find 11,780 votes,” and when that didn’t work met with top advisers toconsider declaring martial lawto redo the election — and finallyincited an insurrectionat the Capitol on Jan. 6. Trump’s four-year presidency can be summed up in the words of the New York State Bar Association statement condemning his 2020 pardon of convicted felonRoger Stone, a key witness in the Mueller investigation: “This is a perversion of justice, plain and simple.”The former president may soon fade from the political scene as his legal troubles worsen. But even without Trump, we must confront the perversion of justice that typifies the modus operandi of so many others like him in business, the entertainment industry and politics. Bernie Madoff, Harvey Weinstein and countless others in positions of power and prestige showed contempt for the law. They pervert justice because they think the law is an obstacle to be overcome. First, the powerful claim they are immune from the law. Often, they prove this to be true. Some likeBill Cosbyclaim immunity from prosecution because their lawyers negotiated a strategically advantageous deal with prosecutors. Others claim immunity from prosecution because they are U. S. presidents. They hide behind a constitutionally dubious presidential immunity theory blessed by the Department of Justice in three separate memoranda written during the presidencies of Nixon, Clinton and Trump. Donald Trump’s own lawyers, appearing before the 2nd Circuit in their effort to prevent the Manhattan DA from subpoenaing Trump Organization tax records, claimed the president was immune from subpoena and evencould shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and still be immune from prosecution. Trump’s defenders would have us believe that it’s the law, not his actions, that are wrong. Others in positions of power — many child molesters, for example — claim immunity because they avoided getting caught until after the statute of limitations expired. Still others think their immunity stems from their social class. As New York real estate mogulLeona Helmsleyfamously told her maid, “Only the little people pay taxes.” Unfortunately for Helmsley, she was not immune from prosecution and was carted off to prison. A second approach is to attack those who enforce the law, whether it be Mueller and his band of “angry Democrats,” the four agency inspectors generalfired by Trump in the middle of investigations, the United States attorney in Manhattan also fired by Trump in 2020, or now the verbal assaults launched at the Manhattan DA from Mar-a-Lago. Trump’s strategy appears to be: When caught violating the law, deflect one’s own narcissism onto law enforcement and hope that sticks in the court of public opinion. A third related strategy is to denigrate the rule of law itself. Claim that the law is perverse, either because the law is just political or because the law is irrational in making some things illegal and others not. A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political. In the far-right media, if Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden did it, it’s per se criminal. If Trump did it, it’s perfectly legal and any prosecutor, inspector general or member of Congress who suggests to the contrary is just on awitch hunt. Many on the left have a similar narcissistic attitude, even if not the media platform to express it, often insisting that law is defined by politics and has no moral integrity on its own. The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is not simply perverse or political either. For over a century, nihilistic legal commentators have re-enforced this view. The German theologian andlegal philosopher Carl Schmittin the 1920s published “The Concept of the Political,” in which he argued that law is not based on neutral principles but is simply a byproduct of politics. Academic commentators on the far right and far left today quote Schmitt, who joined the Nazi Party in 1933, frequently for the same proposition: Law is all about politics. There is no objective truth, no just concept of right and wrong underlying the law. This nihilism, like bad wine, is poured into the fancy bottles of academic theory, but it is peddled to a far larger audience under the more plebeian labels of right-wing radio, TV and internet. Finally, there are the many clever ways to get around the law. In the 1970s, before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan reduced taxes on the rich, some academic economists sympathized with those who did not want to pay whatever taxes the legislature deemed to be their fair share. Arthur Seldon of the London School of Economics and a group of co-authorscoined the term “avoision”to describe manipulative tax strategies that combined ethically problematic but legal tax avoidance (for example, moving from one jurisdiction to another to pay lower tax) with illegal tax evasion (for example, pretending to have moved from one jurisdiction to another in order to pay lower tax). Another common avoision strategy is paying an employee’s rent, private school tuition or other benefits rather than paying reportable income. This, of course, is what the Manhattan DA now alleges the Trump Organization and its CFO did to avoid paying taxes. By the 1990s Seldon’s phrase “avoision” was so widely used that it appeared on “The Simpsons” as Bart Simpson explained why Krusty the Clown was in prison for tax fraud: “I don’t say 'evasion.' I say 'avoision.'”According to a 2019 New York Times article, several generations of the Trump family have been doing just that to “avoid” taxes since the 1970s. And on Wednesday, the Manhattan DA, after a lengthy fight just to get the Trump Organization's financial records, and a 2020 victory in the Supreme Court, finally had enough evidence to hand down an indictment. Trump is the epitome of the avoision man. And the law may be catching up with him. But we cannot just focus on Trump without looking at the underlying problem ­— the narcissistic view of the law that gave rise to Trump and caused so many to celebrate him first as a real estate tycoon, then as a media star and finally as a president. The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is not simply perverse or political either; it is grounded in a collective sense of right and wrong. One of the law’s imperfections is that those who flout the law, who think they are too powerful ever to get caught or prosecuted for violating it, are far too often right. That’s about to change with the small but important step taken by the Manhattan DA on Wednesday. Respect for the law, and enforcement of the law, are crucial to maintaining the rule of law. And that goes for everyone — even a business empire run by a man who once was president of the United States. Richard W. Painter was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 under President George W. Bush. He is the S. Walter Richey Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Minnesota and is a graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School.",1,Questionable,0.0517908678622964,0.4630846277905101,1740,2,MSNBC

But who knows how long they'll be able to have this type of influence. Here's what to knowbefore investing your money. Israel. Yesterday, the country's opposition leaders made a deal to form a coalition government, paving the way for PM Benjamin Netanyahu's exit. Last month, Netanyahu – Israel's longest-serving PM (who'son trial for corruption) – failed to piece together a gov after Israel's March election...the fourth in two years. So centrist Yair Lapid and far-right leader Naftali Bennett teamed up to try to reach 61 seats, the number needed to rule parliament. Just before yesterday's deadline, the duo managed to pull it off. But it's not over yet. Next week, parliament will vote to approve the coalition gov. Historic: If the vote goes through, it would be the most diverse coalition in Israel's history, including an Arab party for the first time ever in addition to left- and right-wing parties. It comes in the aftermath of a deadly11 days of conflictbetween Israelis and Palestinians. And as Lapid promises to unite ""every part of Israeli society.""Trying to keep it together but it (could be) falling apart: The coalition is made up of eight political parties from across Israel's political spectrum that was united in one goal: showing Netanyahu the door. Now that they're on track to do it, it's unclear how long this unity could last. This study. A newanalysisof a Census Bureau survey found that the last two stimulus checks led to more than a 40% drop in food insecurity and financial instability among families.

487,Biden To Restore Protections For America’s Largest National Forest,-7.33,44.0,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-tongass-national-forest-protections_n_60f04c48e4b01f1189572f51,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"The Biden administration moved Thursday to reverse the Trump administration’s dismantling of protections in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, the world’s largest intact temperate rainforest. The U. S Department of Agriculture announced its intent to “repeal or replace” a Trump-era rule thatobliterated protectionsfor Tongass by lifting Clinton-era logging restrictions across 9.3 million forested acres and reclassifying 188,000 acres, including 168,000 acres of old-growth timber, as immediately suitable for harvesting. While the agency’s announcement was limited on details, it said it will end large-scale commercial logging of old-growth timber within the forest and instead “focus management resources to support forest restoration, recreation and resilience, including for climate, wildlife habit and watershed improvement.” Limited harvesting of old-growth trees would be permitted for community and cultural use, including for constructing totem poles and canoes.“This approach will help us chart the path to long-term economic opportunities that are sustainable and reflect Southeast Alaska’s rich cultural heritage and magnificent natural resources,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. The agency also plans to invest $25 million in community and economic development, it said. Many environmentalists see safeguarding the 17-million-acre Tongass National Forest, known as “America’sAmazon,” as critical to fighting against global climate change. It stores about 8% of the total carbon isolated in forests in the Lower 48 states,accordingto the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and an astonishing44% of all carbonstored in national forests across the United States. Thursday’s action stems from an executive order that President Joe Bidensigned his first day in office directing the Department of Agriculture to review Trump’s rollback in Tongass. It came as welcome news for conservationists, some of whom hadgrown frustratedin recent months by the administration’s lack of a strong commitment to halt logging of mature and old temperate forests in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.“Once they are gone, these are trees that have stored [carbon] for hundreds of years, it will take that long to gain it back,” Beverly Law, a professor emeritus at Oregon State and an expert on the forest carbon cycle, told HuffPost in May. “It also means that most of that carbon is going to go back to the atmosphere in the next few decades. And that’s not going to help us get any closer to meeting our climate goals. It’s going to make the situation worse.”The announcement comes one day afterBrazilian researchers found that parts of the Amazon rainforest in South America are now emitting more planet-warming carbon dioxide than they absorb, a signal that the world’s largest rainforest may have reached a tipping point. Biden has sought topressureBrazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, to curb deforestation in the Amazon, only to have the Brazilian government point out the United States’ own history of intensively logging.“With Alaska experiencing climate impacts more acutely than most, we shouldn’t be discussing the continued clearcutting of a natural climate solution that exists right in our own backyard,” Andy Moderow of the Alaska Wilderness League said in a statement Thursday. “Alaskans love their old-growth forests and the timber industry in Southeast is now a relic of the past, and the Biden administration should be commended for looking forward to what kind of world we want to leave to our kids. The Tongass is an unmatched treasure and with smart action now we can properly manage it for future generations.”At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

The news was announced on Monday – International Day of the Girl. The iconic toy companysays new researchfound girls remain held back by society's ingrained gender stereotypes – even though they feel increasingly confident to engage in all types of play and creative activities. Nearly 7,000 parents and children ages six to 14 were surveyed for the study. The research findings show girls feel less restrained by typical gender biases than boys when it comes to creative play. For example, 82% of girls believe it's OK for girls to play football and boys to practice ballet, compared to only 71% of boys. The research also found LEGOs are considered a ""boy"" toy – with 59% of parents saying they encourage their sons to build with LEGO bricks compared to 48% who say they encourage it with their daughters. LEGO says boys are also ""battling prejudice when it comes to creative play and playing with toys that are traditionally seen as being for the opposite sex."" For example, 71% of boys say they worry about being made fun of if they play with a toy typically associated for the other gender, versus 42% of girls. To help combat these gender biases, LEGO is working with the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media and UNICEF ""to ensure LEGO products and marketing are accessible to all and free of gender bias and harmful stereotypes.""The gender stereotypes found in the survey go beyond children. The research also found parents were almost six times more likely to think of scientists and athletes as men than women and more than eight times as likely to think of engineers as men than women. When asked the same questions, girls were much more likely than boys to consider a wider range of professions to be for both women and men.",3,Reliable,0.2098746081504702,0.5579153605015674,393,3,CBS News
489,Road Runner reviews 2020 Tucson road projects and previews what's to come,0.0,48.0,https://tucson.com/news/local/road-runner-reviews-2020-tucson-road-projects-and-previews-whats-to-come/article_50df9789-f977-5835-8a00-1f4ac2c4112d.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/arizona-daily-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,25,"As the Road Runner closes the last chapter of 2020, here are some of the transportation projects motorists are enjoying and others arriving in the new year. This summer Tucsonans saw the years-long Interstate 19 and Ajo Way interchange completed. The improvements include widening Ajo Way and the southbound lanes on I-19 and adding an auxiliary lane for northbound traffic from Irvington Road to Ajo. Two new bridges at Michigan Street and the Santa Cruz River went up in the area. Crews also installed sound walls to protect adjacent neighborhoods from the busy roadway. Crews had been working on the project’s Phase 2 since July 2018. The Arizona Department of Transportation is already helping guide drivers through a dangerous section of Interstate 10 prone to dust storms in 2020. The dust detection warning system between Mileposts 209 and 219 in Eloy and Picacho Peak is supposed to deploy safety measures when measurable dust storms pop up. It lowers speed limits to 35 mph as visibility drops and ADOT engineers program signs to alert motorists in the area. The need for the project was due to data showing 83 dust-related crashes, over 50% within a half-mile of each other, between 2010 and 2015. During a 20-minute monsoon storm, motorists lowered their speeds once the system alerted them, and it will be deployed when more serious storms arrive. Tucson’s “Slow Streets” initiative to prevent motorists from using neighborhoods as cut through paths has shown promise, the Tucson Department of Transportation and Mobility said. Officials have moved forward with Phase 2 of the program, assigning neighborhood “block leaders” who will report back with residents’ input to department officials. The first phase was set in the Feldman’s, Barrio Sin Nombre and Fairgrounds neighborhoods on a two-week rotation. Officials reconfigured the roads to temporarily limit them to local traffic using low-cost materials such as barricades, cones and signs. Access for residents, emergency vehicles, environmental services and delivery vehicles are not blocked. The focus is to make a way for all people to safely spend time outdoors while social distancing. Several projects in Tucson will be completed or see significant progress next year. The Broadway improvement project between Euclid Avenue and Country Club Road will cross the finish line by September 2021. When completed, this section of East Broadway will have six travel lanes, landscaped medians, sidewalks, 16 bus pullouts, signalized pedestrian crossings and buffered bike lanes. The Houghton Road interchange project, which began in August, should see its completion by late 2021. Crews are creating an interchange that will take motorists temporarily to the left side of Houghton while crossing the freeway. It allows for left turns onto I-10 entrance ramps without waiting at an additional traffic signal, ADOT said. It also prevents drivers from turning left and crossing traffic while entering the freeway on-ramp. The site will feature six lanes of traffic as well as improvements for pedestrians and bicyclists. A few miles north, construction on a Regional Transportation Authority project is taking place on Houghton between Mary Ann Cleveland Way and Valencia Road to create a new six-lane divided road. Improvements also include dedicated turn lanes, bus bays, a new traffic signal at Rita Road and an asphalt multi-use path to be used by late 2021. On the northwest side of Tucson, crews are working to complete a new I-10 interchange at Ruthrauff Road. The work includes building a bridge over I-10 and the railroad tracks and widening the interstate to four lanes in each direction as well as widening and rebuilding the streets at the interchange. Work is scheduled to be completed in late 2021, according to ADOT. A large portion of work for North Kolb Road between North Sabino Canyon and East Sunrise Drive will be completed in 2021. Kolb will be widened from a two-lane roadway to a three-lane road with multi-use paved shoulders suitable for bicycle use, sidewalks, drainage and landscaping. The project is scheduled for completion by spring 2022.

490,Aspen-area party businesses warned not to violate health order,-1.0,46.33,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-area-party-businesses-warned-not-to-violate-health-order/,https://adfontesmedia.com/aspen-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-23,15,"Now that indoor private parties and gatherings have been prohibited through the holiday season, area businesses that service said soirees should take note. Pitkin County public health officials signaled a willingness this week to punish party rental outfits, caterers, parking valets and others who make their living off the Aspen area’s traditionally numerous private holiday parties and events.“It’s something we will be looking at,” Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock told county board members Tuesday. “(But) private gatherings, frankly, are hard to catch.”Markey Butler, chair of the Pitkin County’s health board, said Monday that catering companies that serve private parties this holiday season in violation of public health orders need to be told “we will yank their (business) licenses.”“That’s a tough message,” said the former Snowmass Village mayor. “I’m not real excited about having a lot of indoor events.”Aspen City Councilwoman Ann Mullins, an alternate health board member, said at Monday’s board meeting she’s seen party rental trucks in her neighborhood recently.“One truck asked for directions and I refused to give them,” she said. Pitkin County Commissioner Patti Clapper said Tuesday that parking companies need to be notified of the health order rules and possible consequences for violating them.“Without enforcement, we really are not protecting the public health,” she said. Health board members decided Monday that Pitkin County’s status on the state’s COVID-19, color-coded restriction levels would remain at the Orange level. However, theboard voted to voluntarily implement most Red level restrictionsin the county — with two significant exceptions — starting Tuesday and lasting until at least Jan. 4. Board members agonized over the decision for two-and-a-half hours before deciding that remaining in Orange would allow more local control over restrictions. Moving to Red, they determined, would not provide the wiggle room they wanted when they allowed restaurants to continue at 25% capacity and already-permitted indoor events through Jan. 4 to move forward. In addition, once in Red, the county might find it difficult to get out of it. Board members called the new restrictions “Orange-plus-plus.” They do not allow indoor gatherings at all and require visitors and residents alike to socialize only with members of the same household whether in restaurants, hotels or private residences. Still, COVID-19 infection in Aspen and Pitkin County remained rampant Tuesday, and the state could move the county involuntarily into the Red zone if one of two other metrics — hospitalizations and the positivity rate — rise to Red levels. Pitkin County’s incidence rate— which jumped again Tuesday to 1,509 — is the main concern and the metric that prompted the hand-wringing at Monday’s meeting. The highest rate allowed under Red level restrictions is 350. More than a quarter of the county’s 873 positive COVID-19 cases since March 1 have come in the past two weeks. The positivity rate was at 9% Tuesday, which was increasing but still in the Yellow level. One person with COVID symptoms was admitted to Aspen Valley Hospital on Monday, according to local epidemiology data. That remained in the comfortable level, though if three local residents are hospitalized in a day the state would move the county to Red. The concern over what to do about the county’s growing infection rate — termed both “astronomical” and “exponential” Monday by the interim public health director — triggered a health board discussion about enforcement that spilled over into Tuesday’s Board of County Commissioners meeting. On Monday, Pitkin County Commissioner Greg Poschman, also a board of health member, said he wanted to talk about a letter written by fellow health board member Dr. Tom Kurt on the subject of deputizing local public health order compliance officers. The suggestion prompted a strong reaction from Mullins.“I really do not support the idea of deputizing (compliance officers),” she said, citing the large amount of training police officers and sheriff’s deputies receive. “I have strong reservations about deputizing anybody who wants to come out.”Poschman shot back that he “wasn’t suggesting we just pull people off the street,” and Tuesday at the commissioner meeting groused that his idea had been shut down so quickly.“(Leadership on compliance) will have to come from this board,” he said. Just one business in town has faced serious consequences for defying public health orders during the entire pandemic, and that owner received only “a slap on the wrist,” Poschman said.“I heard he had a party on his rooftop the other night,” he said of the defiant business owner. “We need to make an example of someone before people take this seriously.”Peacock said public health officials have heard similar rumors about a party, though in a subsequent interview said he had no concrete information other than it may have occurred last weekend. Clapper proposed that compliance officers be able to shut down a non-compliant business or restaurant on the spot. Commissioner George Newman, however, said that could put a civilian in a “precarious and possibly harmful situation,” and said police must be called in the case of an immediate shut down. Commissioner Kelly McNicholas Kury asked if rangers working with the county’s Open Space and Trails program could be moved into public health order compliance duties while their ranger jobs are curtailed during winter. Peacock said he’d look into it, though he also pointed out that the county plans to spend $146,000 doubling the number of consumer protection compliance officers in the coming weeks. With the vaccine beginning to be administered, it’s unclear how long those new temporary workers will be needed, Peacock said Tuesday.“But even if we hired 25 new people … we can’t police everyone all the time, and we shouldn’t have to,” he said. Poschman on Monday also proposed a Pitkin County-wide curfew that would apply to everyone, not just businesses. He said he knew such action would be complicated, unfair and unenforceable, but felt it was nonetheless necessary.“I think we have to do this,” he said. Michael Goldberg, owner of Belly Up and Matsuhisa, said the idea had the support of some in the business community. Rather than “dumping people on the streets at 10” with nowhere to go, a full curfew leaves them no alternative but to go home, Goldberg said. Aspen Mayor Torre and Snowmass Village Mayor Bill Madsen wondered how a blanket curfew would be enforced. Madsen said the idea would need “buy-in” from the community because no municipality is going to send police officers chasing people around for curfew violations. Peacock said Tuesday that the county attorney’s office also says a blanket curfew might not be enforceable. Further, in order for one to be implemented, officials must establish direct evidence showing it will bring down the infection risk, he said. One area of voluntary compliance that appears to be catching on is Pitkin County’straveler affidavit program. The effort requires overnight visitors to Aspen and the county to fill out an online form attesting that they have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of traveling here. Residents who have been gone more than 10 days also must fill out the affidavit. Since the program began Dec. 7, more than 9,400 people have submitted the forms as of Tuesday morning, Peacock said.“I’m pleasantly surprised,” he said. “When we were rolling it out, we felt we would achieve a voluntary level of compliance, and I think we are getting that.”Poschman said he’s heard from one traveler who canceled plans here when a member of the traveling group who was asymptomatic tested positive for the virus. He said he expected the person to be angry, and was relieved to find they were grateful. Those canceling reservations because of the affidavit are missing the point that the program is meant to keep everyone healthy, he said.“If that’s the case,” Poschman said, “you’re invited to stay away.”jauslander@aspentimes.comFeb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024",3,Reliable,0.0245674753487253,0.3841701990139489,1779,3,Aspen Times

Kelly’s trial, saying it’s at the nexus of ‘race, gender and sexual violence’",0.0,42.33,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-r-kelly-racketeering-trial-media-access-20210723-x44t55i2gfethayim62inf3csa-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-07-23,25,"A consortium of media outlets has asked a federal judge in New York to allow a pool of reporters into the courtroom for singer R. Kelly’s upcoming racketeering trial, arguing the case is of great importance to the public because it stands “at the nexus of critical issues of race, gender, and sexual violence.” Kelly, 54, is scheduled to go on trial in Brooklyn on Aug. 9 on racketeering charges alleging he ran a criminal enterprise that recruited women and underage girls for illegal sexual contact, the n isolated and threatened them to keep them under control. U. S. District Judge Ann Donnelly, who said at a recent hearing that she likes her courtroom to be “no drama,” had previously ruled that the media and members of the public wishing to attend the hot-button trial must watch via a video feed from two overflow courtrooms. The court clerk said in a news release last month that the judge was following COVID-19 health and safety protocols still in place at the courthouse. But in a four-page letter, outlets such as ABC, CBS, Buzzfeed, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and others asked Donnelly to consider allowing a pool of six reporters each day into the trial courtroom itself, where the reactions of Kelly, jurors and witnesses can be picked up and nuances of testimony better assessed. The letter said access to the trial was particularly important in this case since reporters have been “critiqued for ignoring or making light of the stories of R. Kelly’s alleged victims” because of his stature and that the alleged victims are Black women and girls. “Simply put, this is a trial of unique public importance, one at the nexus of critical issues of race, gender, and sexual violence, where media coverage is imperative,” the letter stated. Forcing all reporters to watch from an overflow room would also put them at the mercy of technological difficulties that invariably arise, according to the letter. In the recent trial of drug lord El Chapo, for example, which took place in the same courthouse, “reporters in the overflow room missed the prosecutor’s opening statement because either the prosecutor’s microphone was turned off or because the technology was simply not functioning,” the letter stated. According to the letter, health concerns over the ongoing pandemic have been alleviated as more people are vaccinated, and having a small pool of reporters would mean measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing could still be enforced. “Indeed, currently, courtroom after courtroom is becoming available to the public,” the letter stated. “There is no reason that such an important and high profile case should not follow this trend.” The trial is expected to last a month or more. Kelly, who is being held at a federal jail in Brooklyn, also faces charges in U. S.

Hackers Leaked It All,0.0,47.33,https://www.wired.com/story/vastaamo-psychotherapy-patients-hack-data-breach/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,25,"Jere woke upon the morning of October 24, 2020, expecting what Finnish college students call, an ordinary day. It was a Saturday, and he’d slept in. The night before, he had gone drinking by the beach with some friends. They’d sipped cheap apple liqueur, listened to Billie Eilish on his boom box. Now Jere (pronounced “yeh-reh”) needed to clear his head. He was supposed to spend this gray fall day on campus, finishing a group physics project about solar energy. The 22-year-old took a walk around the lake near his apartment outside Helsinki. Then, feeling somewhat refreshed, he jumped on the bus. The day went quickly. Jere caught up with his friends, many of whom he hadn’t seen since the pandemic began. They chatted about their Christmas plans, ordered pizzas from a favorite local spot, and knuckled down to work in the cafeteria. This article appears in the June 2021 issue. Subscribe to WIRED. At around 4 pm, Jere checked Snapchat. An email notification popped up on his screen. His hands began to shake. The subject line included his full name, his social security number, and the name of a clinic where he’d gotten mental health treatment as a teenager: Vastaamo. He didn’t recognize the sender, but he knew what the email said before he opened it. A few days earlier, Vastaamo had announced a catastrophic data breach. Asecurity flawin the company’s IT systems had exposed its entire patient database to the open internet—not just email addresses and social security numbers, but the actual written notes that therapists had taken. A group of hackers, or one masquerading as many, had gotten hold of the data. The message in Jere’s inbox wasa ransom demand.“If we receive €200 worth of Bitcoin within 24 hours, your information will be permanently deleted from our servers,” the email said in Finnish. If Jere missed the first deadline, he’d have another 48 hours to fork over €500, or about $600. After that, “your information will be published for all to see.”Jere had first gone to Vastaamo when he was 16. He had dropped out of school and begun to self-harm, he says, and was consuming “extreme amounts” of Jägermeister each week. His girlfriend at the time insisted he get help; she believed it was the only way Jere would see his 18th birthday. During his therapy sessions, Jere spoke about his abusive parents—how they forced him, when he was a young kid, to walk the nearly 4 miles home from school, or made him sleep out in the garden if he “was being a disappointment.” He talked about using marijuana, LSD, DMT. He said he’d organized an illegal rave and was selling drugs. He said he’d thought about killing himself. After each session, Jere’s therapist typed out his notes and uploaded them to Vastaamo’s servers. “I was just being honest,” Jere says. He had “no idea” that they were backing the information up digitally. In the cafeteria, Jere grabbed his bag and told his friends he’d turn in his portion of the physics project the next day. On the bus ride home, he frantically texted his best friend to come over. Then his mother called; as the adult listed on his old account, she’d received the ransom note too. She and Jere were on good terms now, but if she got involved she might learn what he’d said in his sessions. Then, he says, he’d probably lose her from his life completely. He told his mother not to worry. That afternoon, he filed an online police report. Jere poured himself a shot of vodka, then two or three more. He found his vape pen and took a Xanax, prescribed to him years earlier for anxiety. He’d stored a few pills in his bedroom drawer just in case, but he never believed he’d need them again. He passed out shortly after his friend arrived. The next morning, Jere checked Twitter, where he was both horrified and relieved to learn that thousands of others had received the same threat. “Had I been one of the only people to get the mail, I would have been more scared,” he says. Vastaamo ran the largest network of private mental-health providers in Finland. In a country of just 5.5 million—about the same as the state of Minnesota—it was the “McDonald’s of psychotherapy,” one Finnish journalist told me. And because of that, the attack on the company rocked all of Finland. Around 30,000 people are believed to have received the ransom demand; some 25,000 reported it to the police. On October 29, a headline in theread: “Vastaamo Hacking Could Turn Into Largest Criminal Case in Finnish History.” That prediction seems to have come true. If thescale of the attackwas shocking, so was its cruelty. Not just because the records were so sensitive; not just because the attacker, or attackers, singled out patients like wounded animals; but also because, out of all the countries on earth, Finland should have been among the best able to prevent such a breach. Along with neighboring Estonia, it is widely considered a pioneer in digital health. Since the late 1990s, Finnish leaders have pursued the principle of “citizen-centered, seamless” care, backed up by investments in technology infrastructure. Today, every Finnish citizen has access to a highly secure service called Kanta, where they can browse their own treatment records and order prescriptions. Their health providers can use the system to coordinate care. Vastaamo was a private company, but it seemed to operate in the same spirit of tech-enabled ease and accessibility: You booked a therapist with a few clicks, wait times were tolerable, and Finland’s Social Insurance Institution reimbursed a big chunk of the session fee (provided you had a diagnosed mental disorder). The company was run by Ville Tapio, a 39-year-old coder and entrepreneur with sharp eyebrows, slicked-back brown hair, and a heavy jawline. He’d cofounded the company with his parents. They pitched ­Vastaamo as a humble family-run enterprise committed to improving the mental health of all Finns. For nearly a decade, the company went from success to success. Sure, some questioned the purity of Tapio’s motives; Kristian Wahlbeck, director of development at Finland’s oldest mental health nonprofit, says he was “a bit frowned-upon” and “perceived as too business-minded.” And yes, there were occasional stories about Vastaamo doing shady-seeming things, such as using Google ads to try to poach prospective patients from a university clinic, as the newspaperreported. But people kept signing up. Tapio was so confident in what he’d created that he spoke about taking his model overseas. Before “the incident,” Tapio says, “Vastaamo produced a lot of social good.” Now he is an ex-CEO, and the company he founded is being sold for parts. “I’m so sad to see all the work done and the future opportunities suddenly go to waste,” he says. “The way it ended feels terrible, unnecessary, and unjustified.”Tapio grew upin a “peaceful and green” neighborhood in northern Helsinki during a bad recession. His mother, Nina, was a trauma psychotherapist, and his father, Perttu, a priest. His grandparents gave him a used Commodore 64 when he was 10, which led him to an interest in coding. Something in his brain resonated with the logical challenge of it, he says. He also saw it as a “tool to build something real.”The obsession endured: In middle school Tapio coded a statistics system for his basketball team, and in high school he worked for the Helsinki Education Department, showing teachers how to use their computers. Rather than going to college, he set up an online shop selling computer parts—his first business, funded with “a few tens of euros,” he says. A couple of years later, at age 20, he joined a small management consultancy. The idea for Vastaamo came to Tapio when he was working with the Finnish Innovation Fund, a public foundation that invests in solutions to social and environmental problems. The fund sent him on a survey of health care systems in Western Europe. Being his mother’s son, he noticed that the Netherlands and other countries seemed to do a better job of providing mental health services than Finland did; the public system at home was known for patchy coverage and long wait times. Ever the coder, he wondered whether a web-based counseling service would help. It could sell vouchers to cities and towns, which could distribute the vouchers for free to residents. People could use the service anonymously. They wouldn’t have to worry about the stigma of seeking care, and they’d have access anytime, anyplace. In 2009, the Finnish Innovation Fund backed Tapio’s idea with an initial grant of about $12,000. He and his parents used the money—along with more than $13,000 of their own savings—to start Vastaamo, Finnish for “a place where you get answers from.” Tapio registered the company as a social enterprise, meaning that the bulk of its profits would be poured back into its mission to improve mental health services. He would own around 60 percent, and most of the remainder would belong to his parents. Perttu would serve as CEO. Clients could send a message to Vastaamo, and within 24 hours they’d get a personal response from a qualified therapist. (Wahlbeck, of the mental health nonprofit, notes that such services aren’t regulated by the government.) But counseling by internet “was not enough for customers,” Tapio says. Many of them needed access to in-person therapy. One way to meet that need was to grow Vastaamo into a network of brick-and-mortar clinics. Tapio planned to digitize whatever he could, from bookings to invoices to medical records—everything but the appointment itself. The idea was that independent therapists would join Vastaamo to avoid dealing with their own administrative headaches. Freed by automation, they’d have more time to spend with clients (and rack up billable hours). To deliver on this vision, Vastaamo needed an electronic medical record system, but Tapio didn’t like the options he found. Either the systems bristled with irrelevant features or they were too tightly tailored to a different area of medicine. The lack of good software, Tapio says, was one of the “main reasons” nobody had done what Vastaamo was about to attempt. A Vastaamo clinic location in Espoo, near where Jere lives. Rather than use an existing system, the company designed its own. It launched in late 2012, around the same time Vastaamo’s first in-­­person clinic opened, in the Malmi district of Helsinki. Tapio wouldn’t go into technical detail about the system, but in court documents he suggests it was browser-based and stored patients’ records on a MySQL server. More important for Vastaamo’s­ purposes, the interface was easy to use. When therapists applied for a job at the company, they heard all about how much it would quicken their work. But the slick exterior concealed deep vulnerabilities. Mikael Koivukangas, head of R&D at a Finnish medtech firm called Onesys Medical, points out that Vastaamo’s system violated one of the “first principles of cybersecurity”: It didn’t anonymize the records. It didn’t even encrypt them. The only thing protecting patients’ confessions and confidences were a couple of firewalls and a server login screen. Anyone with experience in the field, Koivukangas says, could’ve helped Vastaamo design a safer system. At the time, though, fears of a breach were far from Tapio’s mind. The summer after Vastaamo’s first clinic opened its doors, he took over as CEO and set the company on a path toward expansion. In 2014 there was a change in the regulations around Vastaamo’s business. The Finnish Parliament decided to split medical information systems into two categories. Class A systems would connect with Kanta, the national health data repository, so they’d need to meet strict security and interoperability standards. Anyone who planned to keep their patients’ records in long-term electronic storage would have to use a Class A system. Smaller organizations, the kind that kept vital records in manila envelopes and filing cabinets, would be allowed to use Class B systems. These weren’t as tightly regulated, in part because they wouldn’t make very interesting targets for a hacker. Class B operators would simply self-certify to the government that their setup met certain requirements. “The government” being, in this case, a single man—Antti Härkönen—whose purview includes all 280 Class B systems in Finland. The new law gave Vastaamo several years to adopt a Class A system. The problem, Tapio says, is that the Finnish government hadn’t specified how psychotherapy practices should format their data. Vastaamo could build a Class A system and plug into Kanta, but there was “no way to stop, for example, general practitioners at health care centers or occupational health physicians from accessing” therapy records, he says. Outi Lehtokari, Kanta’s head of services, pushes back against this claim. “Tapio might have misunderstood how Kanta works,” she says. Patients can choose to restrict access to their information. In any event, on June 29, 2017, Vastaamo registered a Class B system. As Tapio tells it, the company was eager to upgrade to Class A as soon as the government released formatting specs for psychotherapy. But that didn’t happen. Instead, when the specs came out, Vastaamo kept on going with its Class B. Tapio says that Finland’s “supervisory authorities” then signed off on the system “numerous times” in the years ahead. Härkönen, who is one of those authorities, says that to monitor all the Class B systems carefully would be “mission impossible” for him. He adds, however, that there should be more “proactive inspections.”By 2018, Vastaamo was operating nearly 20 clinics and employing around 200 therapists and staff. By the end of 2019, annual revenue had risen to more than $18 million. The company drew the interest of Intera Partners, a Finnish private equity firm, which bought out the majority of Tapio’s and his parents’ stakes. Tapio took home nearly $4 million from the deal. With each new clinic that opened, the original process repeated: Härkönen reviewed Vastaamo’s self-certification and gave the thumbs-up. More patient data flowed into the MySQL server. And the reservoir behind the dam rose a little higher. Tapio first heardfrom the hacker on September 28, 2020. The demand was 40 bitcoin, around half a million dollars at the time. The message came to him and a pair of developers he’d hired in 2015, Ilari Lind and Sami Keskinen. Lind was responsible for maintaining the company’s IT systems, including its servers and firewalls; Keskinen was the data protection officer. According to a statement Tapio made to Helsinki District Court, he immediately notified various government authorities, including the police. Lind sifted through Vastaamo’s network traffic logs but reported finding no evidence of a hack. Tapio hired a security company called Nixu to investigate further. Two days later, Tuomas Kahri, COO of Intera Partners and chairman of the board of Vastaamo, sent an email to Tapio to thank him for his diligence in handling the breach. Kahri would later say that some of his own loved ones had been targeted in the attack. In early October, Tapio got another shock. Keskinen and Lind called with a confession: Just before they’d joined Vastaamo, they had been arrested as part of a security breach at Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. Lind had discovered that he could download Tekes’ entire database, containing information on as many as 20,000 companies, by changing the URL on a funding application. He informed Tekes, which fixed the vulnerability—but he also notified Keskinen, who downloaded the database. There was a pretrial investigation for aggravated fraud, breach of confidentiality, and burglary, but the prosecution could not establish that Lind and Keskinen had used the database for financial gain. Tapio says that if he had known about the two men’s histories, he would never have hired them. (Keskinen and Lind declined to comment.) As it was, though, he had more pressing problems to worry about. On the morning of Wednesday, October 21, the hacker posted a message on Ylilauta, an anonymous public discussion board. “We have attempted to negotiate with the Ville Tapio, the CEO of vastaamo, but he has stopped responding to our emails,” they wrote in English. Until they got their 40 bitcoin ransom, they were going to leak 100 patient records each day. The first batch was already up on a Tor server. Anyone who wanted to could go read them. The hacker started emailing with Henrik Kärkkäinen, a reporter at the newspaper. To prove they were the real McCoy, they uploaded a file to the Tor server called “henrik.txt”—a snippet of their exchange. In emails to Kärkkäinen, the hacker scorned Vastaamo: A company with security practices that weak was the real criminal, he recalls them writing. They claimed to have been sitting on the stolen database for 18 months, unaware of its value. When Ylilauta’s moderators removed the posts, the conversation migrated to Torilauta, a popular discussion forum on the dark web. The hacker took on a name: ransom_man. At least one desperate person offered to pay the full 40 bitcoin. Another wrote, in English, “I have discussed about very private things with my therapist and will literally kys myself if they are released.” They had their bitcoin ready: “I can send it in minutes, I’m constantly refreshing this page.” About 30 payments ended up going to the hacker’s Bitcoin wallet, according to Mikko Hyppönen, the chief research officer at F-Secure, a global cybersecurity company. It is unclear whether ransom_man actually deleted anyone’s information. The hacker did follow through on another promise, however. On October 22, they leaked 100 more patient records. Some belonged to politicians and other public figures. They contained details about adulterous relationships, suicide attempts, pedophilic thoughts. The next batch came around 2 am the following morning. The hacker also put all the records they’d leaked so far into a single file called “Vastaamo.tar.”And then something strange happened. Ransom_man replaced the first “Vastaamo.tar” with a much bigger one. It was 10.9 gigabytes—the entire leaked database. This file also contained a Python script that the hacker had used to organize the therapy records. The 10.9 GB upload seems to have been a mistake, because it disappeared in a matter of hours, along with the entire Tor server. Some speculated that Vastaamo had paid the 40 bitcoin, though company officials denied it. One victim had their bitcoin ransom at the ready. “I can send it in minutes,” they wrote. “I’m constantly refreshing this page.”Either way, ransom_man soon changed tactics and started extorting individual patients. This was unusual. Most of the time, cybercriminals go after institutions, according to Hyppönen. He knew of only one earlier instance of patients being singled out—in late 2019, after a breach at the Center for Facial Restoration in Miramar, Florida. (Since the Vastaamo attack, he adds, two other hacks have also targeted patients of plastic surgery clinics.) “Most attackers want money, and health care data is not directly monetizable,” Hyppönen says. But with real-world examples of the crime paying off, he adds, “it could become more common.”Vastaamo reacted by offering patients a free counseling session. Therapy continued as normal. One patient says her therapist advised her to consider that not everything being said in the news was true. Some patients picked up a physical copy of their records, to learn what had been stolen, and others joined Facebook groups dedicated to victim support. Jere, however, opted not to; he wanted to minimize his online presence. He changed his phone number and purchased credit protection. He never seriously considered paying the hacker, he says, because “there was absolutely no guarantee they would obey” their own terms. A Vastaamo clinic location in Turku. On the Mondayafter the breach became public, Tapio went to Vastaamo headquarters in Helsinki. He’d been summoned there by Tuomas Kahri, the Intera COO who a month earlier had thanked him. Instead of speaking to Tapio face to face, Kahri had a consultant hand him a letter. It said that Tapio’s contract as CEO was terminated. Hours later, the company announced Tapio’s dismissal. Shortly after that, in response to a legal motion filed by Intera, the Helsinki District Court ordered the temporary seizure of $11.7 million worth of the Tapio family’s assets—exactly what Intera had paid for its share of Vastaamo. Kahri declined several requests to comment on Intera’s claims, but they’re described in public (albeit redacted) court documents. In its filings, Intera says it became aware of two previously unreported breaches at Vastaamo, in late 2018 and the spring of 2019. The second date fell shortly before the buyout went through. “Based on the information received so far, it is reasonable to assume that Ville Tapio was aware of the breach,” Intera argues. Not only that, but he “sought to conceal” it. Intera wanted to dissolve the transaction and reclaim the purchase price. Tapio, as the defendant, submitted written testimony in rebuttal. He claims to have been blindsided by the news of the 2019 breach. The reason he didn’t find out about it at the time, he writes, is that Keskinen and Lind—the “system architects”—never told him about it. On the morning of March 15, Vastaamo’s servers crashed and the patient database was replaced with a blackmail message. Tapio notified staff of the crash at 11:18 am, but no one appears to have discussed the possibility of a breach in either of the reports submitted to the government. According to Tapio’s testimony, ­Keskinen and Lind—who shared an administrator account—told him that the crash might have been caused by some minor adjustments they’d made shortly beforehand. But he says that Nixu, the cybersecurity company he hired in September, found something else: The shared account read the ransom message and deleted it. In Tapio’s version of events, then, whoever was using that account covered up the March breach. And the reason they did it, he contends, was to conceal a vulnerability they’d created themselves—one that had left Vastaamo’s patient database “without firewall protection” for more than a year. There were supposed to be three levels of security surrounding the database, Tapio tells me: one firewall at the network level, which blocked connections from the public internet; another around the individual server that stored the patient database; and the server configuration itself, which prevented connections from outside accounts. In November 2017, Lind spent a few hours configuring the server to allow remote access. Tapio believes that Lind and Keskinen wanted to be able to manage the server from offsite, and that instead of going to the trouble of setting up a VPN, they simply peeled back the firewalls.“Those are two professionals that know much more about the network and firewall and server management than I,” Tapio says. “I was not responsible.”Keskinen and Lind have not testified in the Intera case. They declined to comment on Tapio’s numerous allegations. Until the dispute is resolved, the $11.7 million that Intera wants back—the fortune that Vastaamo built—will remain frozen. In early Januaryof this year, the Vastaamo patient database reappeared on at least 11 anonymous file-sharing services across the public internet. The file contained all the same records as before but was a fraction as big, so it spread easily. Without an accompanying message, the motivations for the upload are hard to discern—but it did appear fewer than 48 hours before Vastaamo’s board was due to discuss the company’s future. Was this a spiteful push to bring the company down?If so, then it was a success. On January 28, Vastaamo was put into liquidation, and it filed for bankruptcy two weeks later. In early March, its staff and services were transferred to Verve, a provider of occupational welfare services. The acquisition did not include Vastaamo’s customer data, and Verve will use a Class A system. Almost immediately after the hack happened, Parliament fast-tracked legislation that would allow victims like Jere to change their social security numbers in case of a serious breach. But patients were spooked, one counselor told the newspaper. “Not everyone who needed help may have sought treatment,” he said. Some argue that therapists should never be able to enter session notes into Kanta; now more than ever, patients will not risk having their data travel beyond the consultation room. In wider medicine, Koivukangas says, the Vastaamo scandal has highlighted the “unmet demand” for electronic medical record systems that are scalable, easy to use, and—crucially—secure. This is an area ripe for disruption, he says, and “prior to this breach, many thought with good reason that Vastaamo would’ve been one of those disruptors.” Until the market­place improves, he says, expect more bespoke solutions, and more breaches. Unless ransom_man is caught and the Finnish authorities sort out everything that happened at Vastaamo, it will be impossible to know exactly how “the incident” began. Would it have happened, for example, if Finland had been more proactive in policing electronic medical systems? Or if Tapio had implemented a more secure system? What’s clear is how it ended—in the most painful way possible for tens of thousands of patients. As more health care systems across the world go digital, the risk of that outcome rises.“Being honest about my mental health turned out to be a bad idea,” Jere says. He worries about identity theft, about some debt collection company calling him out of the blue and demanding tens of thousands of euros. He worries that his history of teenage alcoholism, so well documented on the web, will make it hard for him to find meaningful work as an adult. And he still worries that his mother may read his file one day. It’s somewhere in the ether, accessible to anyone.

495,Private schools are the real college admissions scandal.,-6.33,41.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/06/private-schools-competitive-college-advantage-problems.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-14,25,"The Supreme Court kicked the can down the road today on the case of Students for Fair Admissions’ case against Harvard University, with an invitation to the solicitor general to write a brief expressing the view of the United States. The invitation is a delay, but the case will be considered again. SFFA attempts to argue that the nation’s most famous college discriminates against Asian Americans in the admissions process, and even thoughit’s lost twice in court, it’s expected that this current court, packed with conservative justices, would rule in favor of the astroturf organization dedicated to killing affirmative action should it decide to hear the case. SSFA’s leader, Ed Blum, has been trying for decades toeliminate affirmative actionin college admissions. After he failed with Abigail Fisher’s suit against the University of Texas (that one argued Fisher had been discriminated against for being white but failed to provide compelling evidence), Blum started courting Asian American students who were rejected by Ivy League institutions. It is unclear how many he found, since not one student testified on SFFA’s behalf during the trial, but the organization’s legal strategy relied on statistical arguments to claim that Harvard’s admissions policies gave advantages to legacies, donors, athletes, and underrepresented minorities, which hurt Asian American applicants. In trying to claim an equivalence between providing unfair advantages to the already advantaged (legacies, donors, athletes) and taking race and racism into account during the admissions process, SFFA has cannily yoked its attack on race-conscious admissions to a critique of actually illegitimate advantages given to the white and wealthy. But there’s a clear tell in this strategy that reveals SFFA does not really care about unearned advantages: It said nothing about graduating from a private high school. Graduating from private high school is a far larger advantage at many top ranked colleges than playing sports or being a legacy or even having a connection to a donor are. (Viewed a certain way, a private school is almost a more reliable income source for an elite college than a donor.) While 10 percent of students admitted toHarvard’s Class of 2018were recruited athletes and 12 percent were legacies,almost 40 percent of the class went to a private school. If we really wanted to get rid of the most glaring case of bias at prestigious private universities, we would target private high school students. Legacy, donor, and athletic preferences should be stripped out of college admissions too, but when it comes to tipping the scales away from fairness and equity, private schools outweigh everything else. Only 7 percent of high school students attended private high schools in the United States in 2019,according to Census Bureau data, but at many of the most selective colleges in the nation private school grads make up a third to half of freshman classes. This is the real scandal in college admissions: Wealthy families pay for their children to attend high schools that receive preferential treatment in the admissions process athighly rejective colleges. Defenders of private high schools’ overrepresentation at many highly ranked universities might claim the students have reaped the benefit of a more rigorous education in order to earn their spot. When you control for wealth, however, private school’s academic and social-emotional benefits arebasically wiped out. Historically, students from the nation’s elite boarding schools “perform[ed] worse in the classroom [at Harvard] than other students over the entire 1924-1990 period” but went on to make more money than their peers by taking advantage of the connections they made in groups like final clubs, which largely exclude anyone who is not wealthy or white. St. Grottlesexstudents and their peers at old nondenominational private schools might be a little less white and little less wealthy than they were a century ago, but have no doubt: These schools still do not look like America. This year’s graduating class of public high school students is the firstprojected to be majority-nonwhite, but almost70 percentof private school students are white. That’s a product, in part, of along historyof white people pulling their children out of public schools after desegregation, and private schools continuing to make an outsize contribution to school segregation in the United States. Most independent schools do provide some financial aid, but it often goes to a small share of students. At Marlborough, an independent school in Los Angeles where the cost of attendance is about $45,000, only 20 percent of families receive financial aid, and almost half of those who do still make more than $200,000 per year. About 6 percent of all the school’s students come from families making less than $100,000,even though almost two-thirds of American households make less than that. Some independent schools enroll a number of low-income students on scholarship, and these “privileged poor,” to use Anthony Jack’s term,account for half the low-income students at some highly selective universities, further evidence of the advantage granted to these schools in the admissions process. Private high schools can cost as much as$70,000per year. For those prices, students get not onlysingle-digit student-to-teacher ratios,teachers with Ph. D.s,better sports facilities than those at many colleges, andart museums, but also college counselors who work with a fraction of the number of students public school counselors work with. At Horace Mann, in the Bronx,180 seniors are served by eight college counselors. Fewer than 2 miles away,12 guidance counselors work with 750 seniors at Bronx Science. Both high schools are full of very talented students, but onlyone of them pays its director of college counseling $350,000 per year. That salary is an index of just how much emphasis the parents who pay for independent schools place on getting their kids into certain universities, which may be why the median salary for a college counselor at independent schools is $94,000 but the median salary for a teacher is $60,000, according to the National Association of Independent Schools. Many independent school counselors started in college admissions, often at highly selective colleges;one of the newest members of this rank was a dean of admissions at an Ivy League university just last fall. These high schools are paying not just for experts who know the rules of the game; they are paying for experts who know the referees. It’s a cozy world, where private school counselors meet up with admissions officers at small invitation-only annual meetings, likethe Fitzwilliam Conferenceheld in the woods of New Hampshire every May for three days, including a six-hour block for “golf, hiking, antiquing.” And then there’s the annual Clambake Institute, where private school counselors and admissions officers get together every summer atSt. George’s Schooljust outside Newport, Rhode Island—the perfect setting for cementing and perpetuating the special bond between rich high schools, rich students, and rich universities. That special bond is cashed in through one of the least-well-known rituals of college admissions:the counselor call. It’s a decades-old tradition, in which school counselors and admissions officers review a list of students who have applied to a college, and counselors get a chance to make a case for their students. Swarthmore College put an end to the practice this past year after it discovered that more than 90 percent of their requests for counselor calls came from private high schools. This spring, USC began telling counselors requesting a call that any conversation would be informational, and asked counselors to “refrain from advocating for candidates.”But simply attending certain high schools can provide enough of an advantage that no advocacy is needed. Harvard’s dean of admissions said as much under oath in 2018during the SFFA trial: “[Sometimes] we take somebody … lower in the class … and we’ve got some other very attractive people at the upper end of the class. Sometimes you can make an argument to take them both because they’re both terrific.” The dean continued, “It’s also a very good message to that school that you may be trying to develop that you’re looking for all kinds of different people.”In other words, someone thought that a good way for Harvard to defend itself against charges that it unfairly advantaged underrepresented minorities was to say, no, no, don’t worry, the unfair advantage goes to overrepresented wealthy students. The wordgives away the game. Any head of admissions knows that he needs to build a reliable pipeline of customers from certain institutions. As Harvard’s dean testified, “We’re trying to create relationships with schools. … We’re trying to create 100-year relationships with them.”Even as it feels counter to the endeavor of competitive admissions based on merit, it’s perfectly logical for colleges and private high schools to pursue cozy relationships. To quote Willie Sutton, that’s where the money is. A full-paying student at an Ivy League school is worth well more than a quarter-million dollars in revenue over four years, plus future donations. Some schools will send five or six students a year, which adds up to a million-plus in revenue, year over year for ideally a century or more, apparently. In return, the high schools gain a level of access that lets them charge more thanwhat many Americans make per year. To be fair, superselective universities also cultivate these relationships with organizations likeQuestbridgeand some public school counselors to create a pipeline for high-achieving, low-income students, but the numbers suggest there’s a lot more pipe being laid on the Upper East Side of Manhattan than in the South Bronx or rural New York. There islittle point in criticizingany of the individuals involved in this corrupt relationship between private schools and highly selective colleges. The parents who send their kids to independent schools and the counselors and teachers working in them are, in my experience, conscientious and caring individuals keenly aware of their students’ privilege and their own, and many of them work hard to increase equity and diversity at their school and in college admissions. Some of themran into oppositionthis past year, as a few white parents bristled at schools’ efforts to introduce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the wake of the anti-racist protests last summer as well asa string of affecting social media campaigns where Black students revealed the racism they routinely faced at school. If we are going to have an aristocracy, I guess it’s better to have a woke one. But wouldn’t it be better to have no aristocracy at all?Short of eliminating private schools, we cannot eliminate the advantage families purchase by enrolling their children in them. We might, however, reduce some of that advantage by doing four things. First, all universities should end counselor calls. Second, universities should be required to report annually what type of high schools their first-time students attended, disaggregated by race. More than half of the top 75 institutions in the U. S. News & World Report rankings do not publish this information, suggesting they either do not think the overrepresentation of private high school students matters or that they want to keep that fact out of sight. I’m not sure which is worse. Third, universities should stop asking school counselors for letters of recommendation. How can a counselor responsible for 200 seniors possibly write each one a letter as effectively as one with only 30 students can?Fourth, admissions offices should redact the name of the school during the admissions process and stop assigning applications by region, as most highly selective colleges do. Context is essential for admissions officers to consider applicants’ merits rather than their accomplishments. A file could still contain relevant information about a high school, such as the number of students on free lunch programs, or its student-to-counselor ratio. Going school-blind would not erase context, but it would hide the brand names. Highly selective colleges might not be ready to break their hundred-year relationships with private high schools. But they could certainly become less toxic for everyoneelse.",3,Reliable,0.117542985409652,0.4374855539522207,2548,2,Slate
496,San Diego Unified floats requests to Biden administration in State of District address,-3.33,47.33,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2020-11-18/san-diego-unified-floats-requests-to-biden-administration-in-state-of-district-address,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,20,"San Diego Unified Superintendent Cindy Marten released a proposed education plan for president-elect Joe Biden Tuesday during her annual State of the District address. Marten called for increased federal funding for schools and for a national teacher corps program to train more teachers to work in low-income schools. Shesuggested the incoming Biden Administration provide $350 billion in COVID-19 aid to schools, fully fund special education— something the federal government has never done — triple Title I funding for schools that serve low-income students, and provide more funding for military students. The new administration also should ensure that all 3- and 4-year-olds have access to quality preschool, Marten said. She also called for reinstating the National Teacher Corps, a 1965 program that trained teachers to work in disadvantaged schools.“Now before anyone discards these ideas as unrealistic given the current economic climate, let me remind you that every one of the San Diego strategies for school reform came out of the 2008 financial crisis,” Marten said during a pre-recorded speech, which wasdelivered onlineand received about 2,200 views.“Hard times breed clarity of purpose. We can create an educational recovery plan that meets the needs of all of our students by focusing on equity.”Marten warned that the pandemic is causing severe learning losses because of school shutdowns. A national recovery plan with funding for schools is needed to reverse those losses, she said. California public schools were spared from state budget cuts this school year, but there is no such guarantee for next year.“We now risk losing the progress we have made if we must contend with State budget cuts in January,” Marten said. Marten also described what the district has done so far during the eight-month long pandemic. Officials said the district has distributed more than 80,000 Chromebooks and 8 million free meals to children. Marten said San Diego is providing more daily, “live” instruction time than other California districts. San Diego Unified schools are providing three hours of live instruction each day during distance learning. Marten and School Board President John Lee Evans said students are suffering losses due to school closures, but they didn’t say how much learning loss is happening among San Diego students. The district has not yet released data about students’ academic progress during this school year. Evans said the plan is still for San Diego Unified to reopen on Jan. 4 for elementary students and on Jan. 25 for middle and high school students. But the reopening could be postponed if San Diego County does not improve its COVID-19 rates quickly enough to get out and stay out of the purple tier.“We all know that our students are suffering. We know that damage is being done by this pandemic,” Evans said. “Every person — the superintendent, the board, and all our staff — are working diligently to make sure our schools can open as soon as possible in the safest possible manner.”",3,Reliable,0.1083696205755029,0.4577410661234191,620,3,San Diego Union-Tribune
497,Biden frames spending push as 'choice' between benefiting wealthy versus working families,-1.0,45.33,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/may/6/biden-frames-spending-push-choice-between-benefiti/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,23,"PresidentBidenon Thursday framed his push for a $4 trillion economic agenda and higher taxes on corporations and wealthier Americans as a “choice” between who in the country should benefit.“This is all about making a choice — a choice between giving tax breaks to [the] super-wealthy and to corporations and investing in working families,” Mr. Biden said from Lake Charles, Louisiana. “In my view, it’s an easy choice — invest in workers wearing hard hats and doing the hard work of rebuilding the country.”The president said he’s sick and tired of corporate America not paying their “fair share” in taxes. Mr. Biden said his plans to hike taxes on corporations and upper-income individuals won’t affect wealthy Americans’ standard of living.“This is not punishing anybody,” he said. “All those folks are still going to have two homes or three homes and their jets - it won’t matter. Not going to change their standard of living one little bit.”The president wants to fund his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan and $1.8 trillion “families” proposal by increasing the U. S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and increasing the top individual income tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, among other changes. Mr. Bidendelivered the speech near the I-10 Calcasieu River Bridge, a 70-year-old bridge in “poor” condition that is 20 years older than its designed lifespan.“It’s a perfect example how we’ve neglected, as a nation, to invest in the future of our economy,” the president said. “It shouldn’t be this hard or take so long to fix a bridge that’s this important.”The White House says Mr. Biden‘s infrastructure plan, which allocates $115 billion nationally for roads and bridges, could help the state cut down on bridge tolls to fund a replacement project. Former President Trump had vowed to get things moving on a new bridge — if he was reelected — during a swing through Louisiana in 2019.“If we win this election, we’re giving you a brand-new I-10 bridge,” Mr. Trump had said. “We’re gonna have it all set, ready to go day one, right after the election.”Mr. Biden said the previous administration’s perpetual flirtation with a major infrastructure package never panned out.“We have failed to properly invest in infrastructure for half a century,” he said. “The last four years, how many times did [they] say this is going to be infrastructure week? Well, I got so tired of hearing infrastructure week — nothing happened. Nothing has happened.”Mr. Biden said he’s willing to compromise with Republicans on his proposal but that inaction isn’t an option in his mind.“I’m not ready to have another period where America has another infrastructure month and doesn’t change a damn thing,” he said. “America is more competitive, better, and more capable than any nation in the world. There’s not a damn thing we cannot do when we do it together.”Mr. Biden was also set to tour the Carrollton Water Plant in New Orleans — a facility the White House says would benefit from the roughly $111 billion for water infrastructure in his plan. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Louisiana Republican, said his home state isn’t buying what Mr. Bidenis selling.“Republicans stand ready to work on a bipartisan package that focuses on actual infrastructure, like rebuilding our roads, bridges and waterways — but America does not need trillions in unrelated socialist spending schemes disguised as infrastructure,” Mr. Scalise said. Republicans have balked at the combined $4.1 trillion price tag of Mr. Biden‘s infrastructure and “families” plans, saying they won’t support the proposed tax hikes the president wants to use to fund some of the spending. Senate Republicans’ $568 billion infrastructure counter-proposal allocates $299 billion for roads and bridges, $35 billion for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, and $17 billion for ports and inland waterways, among other items",3,Reliable,0.0825049436160547,0.4093982149537705,882,1,Washington Times
498,Americans From Both Parties Want Weed To Be Legal. Why Doesn’t The Federal Government Agree?,-0.33,48.67,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marijuana-legalization-is-super-popular-why-hasnt-it-happened-nationally/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-23,25,"Tuesday markedthe international holiday for marijuana— and consumers of the plant had lots to celebrate this year. New York,VirginiaandNew Mexicoall passed legislation in 2021 legalizing marijuana,1bringing the total number of states whererecreational consumption is legalup to 17, along with Washington, D. C. At the federal level, the House of Representativespassed a billthis week which allows banks toconduct business with cannabis-related companies in states where marijuana has been legalized,with the support of about half of the chamber’s Republicans and almost all of its Democrats; the bill now awaits its fate in the Senate.passed the House in 2019but wasn’t brought to a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. But even if Biden may not be ready to pivot on marijuana legalization just yet (decriminalization, not legalization for recreational use, was part of his campaign platform), the polling on the issue has been loud and clear: People want weed to be legal. Gallup has asked Americans about whether they support legalizing marijuana since 1969, when only 12 percent of Americans supported the idea. As of their most recent poll last November, that number has ticked up to 68 percent, thehighest level of supporton record. And perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of states where recreational marijuana is now legal has also steadily increased since the Obama administration announced in 2013 thatit wouldn’t block state lawsthat legalized the drug, provided that marijuana was strongly regulated. And if recent polling in states where marijuana is not yet legal for recreational use is any indication, it is possible that even more states will change course. Although, as the chart above shows, legislators have often been slow to legalize marijuana for recreational use: Thirteen of the 18 states where marijuana is legal have done it via voter-driven ballot initiatives rather than legislation. That said, legalization is broadly popular even in more Republican-leaning states like Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas. Polls of support for legalizing marijuana in states where recreational use is not yet legalIncludes both polls that ask specifically about recreational use as well as polls that ask about legalizing marijuana for any purpose. Does not include polls that only asked about legalizing marijuana for medical use. Source: PollsMarijuana legalization may appeal to voters in both very blue and red states, in part, because it’s an issue with bipartisan support. According to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans supported marijuana legalization for medical and recreational use. Further, Pew found that exceedingly few adults of any age were “opposed to the legalization of marijuana,” though it did find that older Americans were less likely than younger Americans to be in favor of legalization. Only 27 percent of Republicans 65 and older supported legalization, the lowest level of support among any group Pew surveyed. But just because legalization is broadly popular doesn’t mean we should expect federal legislation on the issue soon. For starters,not all Senate Democratsback Schumer’s plan, and Senate Republicanshave yet to show any supportfor legalization. Additionally, while legalizing marijuana is popular, itisn’t a top priorityfor many voters. That may be, in part, due to the success of legalization efforts at the state level. More than one in three Americanslive in stateswhere marijuana is already legal for recreational use, and asizable majoritylive in states where marijuana is legal for medical use. For those who already have access to the drug, it may not matter whether it’s their state government or the federal government making that allowance. Finally, as my colleague Perry Bacon Jr. pointed out earlier this year,electoral politics are increasingly disconnected from policy, meaning that despite the popularity of marijuana legalization, there may simply not be a ton of electoral benefit for Biden for taking up the issue. Still, if the polling is any indication, legalizing marijuana is hugely popular, and Biden may yet change his mind, depending on how the politics of the bill play out. And if he does, he may even get some brownie points from Republican voters who support legalization. But if things start to get politically messy, Biden may not have a lot to lose by passing on championing this particular issue. According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker,453.3 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 40.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +13 points). At this time last week, 52.8 percent of Americans approved of Biden, while 40.8 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +12 points). One month ago, 55.1 percent of Americans approved of Biden, compared to 39.1 percent who disapproved.",3,Reliable,0.1180598356445813,0.4014834177122311,1028,3,FiveThirtyEight

The events are ​presented as the coalition’s last-ditch effort to keep President Donald Trump in power with rallygoers calling on the U. S. Congress to not certify the election results​, a process scheduled for Wednesday. ​In truth, there is virtually no chance for any objections to certification to keep Biden, who received 7 million more votes than Trump, from taking office on Jan. 20.

After two years of silence, he still thinks his party is the future. Senator Bob Corker had just gotten out of a hot-yoga session with his wife on a Sunday morning in 2017 when his phone started blowing up. President Donald Trump was tweeting about him, falsely claiming that the Tennessee Republican supported the Iran deal (he did not) and that he had begged Trump for a reelection endorsement (Corker says he never did such a thing). “I got to my house, and I was dripping wet, standing in my closet, getting undressed to go jump in the shower,” Corker told me recently from his office in Chattanooga. He typed out a response: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” Corker sent it to a couple members of his staff—“No public officials should ever send their own tweets,” he says—whom he expected to talk him down. “No, it’s too good,” they told him. “We’re going to let it go.” Thecommenthas now been retweeted nearly 148,000 times. Corker’s tweet seemed to resonate because it stated plainly something that few Republicans were willing to say out loud at the time: The country was being run by someone who regularly broadcasted false information, seemingly without forethought or input from his staff. But Corker, who left office in 2019, gets frustrated by the focus on this kind of dramatic episode. “I spend not one second of my day thinking about any of those things. Okay? Not one second,” he said. “It’s such an irrelevant part of our life.”Still, he is also starting to recognize that his legacy as a United States senator—and as mayor of Chattanooga, where he got his start in elective office—was defined not just by the legislation he passed or his work as the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee but by his willingness to call out racism and moral failings in his own party. Corker still believes in what he sees as the core mission of the Republican Party: to promote free enterprise, fight for equal opportunity for everyone, and protect citizens’ safety. But it’s not clear where a person like him fits in today’s version of the GOP. In 2020, Corker didn’t vote for Trump, but he also couldn’t bring himself to support Joe Biden. He cast his ballot for a Republican senator who, Corker believes, has no desire to be president. (He wouldn’t say which one—even his wife doesn’t know.) That ethos is hard to find in Washington, but Corker still believes it’s worth pursuing. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Let’s start with some ancient history. In 2006, you were running for Senate, and the Republican National Committee financed aninfamous adaboutyour opponent,Harold Ford Jr.(The ad showed fake “man on the street”–style interviews, including one with a scantily dressed white woman who declares, “I met Harold at the Playboy party!”) At the time, you said, “We don’t want this. We want it pulled,” and it was gone in a few days. The ad seems to be an early sign of where the Republican Party might have been headed. Were there elements at that time in the national leadership of the party who might have been thinking,You’re maybe overthinking what actually happened. Probably the type of person who thought up that ad was some political operative or some pollster. Matter of fact, I had very tough conversations with the entity that ran that ad. What were those conversations like?Oh, it just cratered us. We were at plus-six in the race, and it took us to minus-four over seven days. The ad came out on a Friday night, and it ran throughout the weekend, but you can’t pull it down. And we couldn’t talk directly with the RNC, because it was illegal. The ad was constantly on the air—Wolf Blitzer and Chris Matthews. Every outlet in the country was talking about it. And it painted me. I mean, how did I evolve to the public arena? I saw that we had poverty in our inner city and people who weren’t able to live in decent housing. I led thecreation of a nonprofitthat helped 10,000 people here in our community have decent, fit, and affordable housing. Predominantly, they were African Americans. That was my history. So I come to this race. People didn’t differentiate between me and the RNC. They did so much damage to us and hurt me personally. People who didn’t know me thought I was a part of that. Was your criticism that the ad was strategically unwise? Or was there a bigger-picture conversation about, “Who are we as a party, and what kind of message are we trying to send?”When you’re 30 days or three weeks away from a nationalized election, you’re not thinking at that moment about what this says about us as a party. You’re livid over what people have done to you in the election in the name of helping you. I’ll fast-forward to an event that, to me, is more indicative. When I ran for Senate in 2006, we had a Democratic governor, and the election was very close. We were a mixed state. West Tennessee was Democratic. Look at what happened when President Obama was elected. Lookat west Tennessee today. To me, that’s a little more indicative of how race possibly affected the state of Tennessee. Say a little bit more about that. You felt, even at the time when President Obama was running in 2008, that there might be political changes happening?We were in the height of a financial-system breakdown. I was highly involved, as a young senator, inshaping the futureof the automobile industry. So, no, I’m not thinking about that at the time. What I’m reflecting upon is that by 2010, Tennessee had become a solidly red state. Obviously, people in our state railed against President Obama’s policies and health-care bill. But there was certainly a turn in our state to bright red from being purple just a few years earlier. Can I say that race had nothing to do with that? I don’t think that I can. In the period you’re pointing to—2008, 2010, the Tea Party surge—there was a turn within the Republican base. At the time, did you look around and say,?I mean, obviously, I was very aware. During the Tea Party period of time, I did 66 town-hall meetings across our state. I remember walking into the Loudon High School auditorium. Town-hall meetings typically are not particularly interesting. But there were over a thousand people there with placards. They were angry—at Republicans, too. I was very concerned about where we were going fiscally as a nation, but I was unaligned with them because I was from Washington, and I didn’t say the red-meat things because I don’t believe them. I’ve never been able to say those kinds of things. I cannot bash the other side of the aisle. I’ve just never been able to bash a Democrat because they’re a Democrat. The Tea Party—they liked me. They didn’t love me. Read: The evangelical politician who doesn’t recognize his faith—or his partyWhen you first saw candidate Trump coming onto the scene a few years later, it seems like you thought,You’re shaking your head. There were other candidates I preferred who washed out. I was just amazed at it. But I’ve always attempted to be constructive. I remember watching a foreign-policy speech that Trump gave. It was okay. What I tried to do, especially being chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was to take a few sentences of what he said and applaud those and try to build on those—almost leave a trail to a better place. Not to flatter him or get in his good graces. But, hopefully, I would be one of the few people saying something positive at that time, and he would read that and think,Sure enough, he called right after that, thanking me for saying something positive. You talk about the rally in Charlottesville as a defining moment. What were you thinking as you were watching that on television and the press conference that happened afterwards?I took a few days to take in everything that happened. I think the rally was on a Saturday. Tuesday at Trump Tower, the president made the comments that he made. I knew I was going to be here in Chattanooga on Thursday, in my hometown. I got a call early one morning from someone at the White House. I was a recipient of calls from a number of people—almost like they were standing in a coat closet in the White House: “Corker. You cannot believe what has happened.” I received a call from someone well known, probably about 6 a.m. Everybody knows I get up early. I knew what I was going to do. I thought throughthe words I was going to usevery carefully. I used the words: “The president hasnot yetdemonstrated …” That gives this person the ability to become something different than they were at that time. In retrospect, we can all recognize that Charlottesville was a turning point in the Trump presidency. But what was it about that moment that made you think,?I was mayor of a city. I spent my time dealing with issues in our inner city. These were my friends, my fellow citizens, my constituents, the people that I worked with on a daily basis. To have a person who was blatantly dog-whistling to white supremacists was totally unacceptable. Something needed to be said. Not in a way that was a personal attack but to focus on the fact that this person was not rising to the occasion as a president. In the days leading up to January 6, the two senators from Tennessee were part of the effort to challenge the certification of the Electoral College results. One of those people was your replacement. Did you call them up and say, “This is not how we do this”?I made astatement. I go out of my way to not ever name people. I just don’t think that’s constructive. But we know from other quarters that it stung. I served for 12 years in the Senate, a year and a half as commissioner of finance, and four years as mayor. I know how receiving calls like that is. I’ve tried to not be one of those people. They’re the senators now, and I am not. What do you imagine your work ahead will be? Where will your labors be most valuable?I’ve got a lot of energizing, fun things going in business. But I know, down in here [], that while I will always continue to love the world of business, there will be some missional thing that will evolve as a part of my life. I don’t know what that is yet, but I just know what my DNA is. It’s been that way since I was in my late 20s. I’ve had the greatest privilege of my life serving publicly. The most rewarding period of time was being mayor of a city, where you touch people in a real way. I’ve earned the right for a period of time to be in this state that I’m at. I’ve got the freedom to be uncluttered, mind-wise, with all these things that you’re talking about. Read: Eric Metaxas believes America is creeping toward Nazi GermanyI want to ask you about something that’s actually more local, and perhaps more symbolic. The once-defunct Walnut Street Bridge, which isnow a vibrant pedestrian pathway, is a beautiful symbol of Chattanooga’s future. It’s also where theEd Johnson lynching memorialhas been built. To me, this really captures the challenge ahead for the city: to thrive and grow and attract people to live here, but also to talk more openly about the history of this place, where lynchings occurred. This is a really big struggle in the country right now—figuring out how to work optimistically toward the future, but also to be more open and honest about our past. I think people in your party have struggled with this. What I want to know from you is: What’s the right way forward in this hard moment?Just as it relates to the memorial, my wife and I contributed to it. I read about it in the paper, and I signed a check the next day. That’s something that we, as a family, support. Neither party is addressing the race issue in a manner that represents the greatness of our nation. I think the Democratic Party is doing as much damage—or more—on the issue of race today than even some of these subtle but real undertones in the Republican Party that you’re speaking of. We should be doing everything we can to give every student of every race and every young person every opportunity possible. But then to say, “We’re not going to do everything we can to have equal opportunity. We’re going to have equal outcomes”—all that does is exacerbate it, and then you’ve got white people who feel disenfranchised. I can’t believe what’s happening in Atlanta right now. I cannot believe the total lack of concern for allowing the crime issue to be what it is. I don’t understand what’s happening with these big-city mayors, how they would disrespect their citizenry so much that they would let crime be rampant. Generally speaking, Black people in our country somehow have had lesser opportunity. That’s what we ought to be focusing on, because that’s the future. That’s solving a problem. That’s taking us someplace. Should we be aware of our past? Yes, we should be aware of our past. But some of the things that are happening right now today are not benefiting racial equality. They’re actually taking us down a hole that leads to a place that is not constructive.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0750490539876014,0.406869151952951,3024,2,The Atlantic
505,Delusions Of Progressive ‘Resistance’ In PA’s Heartland,16.33,30.67,https://www.dailywire.com/news/delusions-of-progressive-resistance-in-pas-heartland,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-wire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-04,25,"Drive 30 minutes east from Pittsburgh, and you’ll enter Westmoreland County – one of Pennsylvania’s most conservative areas. Over the course of two decades, Westmoreland has become ground zero for the Rust Belt’s GOP shift. For perspective, in 1998 the county’s 136,700 registered Democratic voters dwarfed the 70,600 registered Republicans, propelling their candidates to wins in nearly every local, state, and national election. But in 2020, Donald Trump took 64% of the vote. In May’s state primary, the Republican trend continued when Westmorelandvoted by similar marginsin support of a constitutional amendment curtailing Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s emergency powers – a clear rebuke of his excessive pandemic restrictions. Then, in a special election, county voters favoredLeslie Rossi, aGOP state House candidatewho had painted her home like an American flag and erected a 14-foot Trump cutout. Since the Obama era, Westmoreland’s former Democrats have switched parties over issues related to economic populism and social conservatism. But last year’s social unrest and urban violence, including in Pittsburgh, led even more county Democrats to change their affiliation. In a paraphrase of Ronald Reagan’s classic remark, Westmoreland Sheriff James Albertput itthis way when joining the GOP: “As a lifelong public servant and member of law enforcement, I have not left the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party has left me.”Though Trump’s presidency fueled intraparty tensions, including in Pennsylvania, Westmorelanders feel their own political compass has remained fixed amid the GOP’s evolving platforms. As one resident in Greensburg, the county seat, told me, “Time has pretty much stood still around here for the last 30 years. And that’s how we like it.”But while Westmoreland’s silent majority stands still, its progressive activists have increasingly mobilized. Last year, for example, along that half-hour drive from Pittsburgh, incendiary anti-Trump billboards displayedmisrepresentedquotesfrom the former president. Today, billboards feature left-leaning messages such as “Ban Assault Weapons” and “Teach your children about systemic racism.” Meanwhile, art displays that promote the central tenets of Critical Race Theory find their way to local museums and outdoor areas. Who is behind this progressive “resistance” in Pennsylvania’s heartland? According to the New York Times, Westmoreland’s radical campaigners operate like a secret society, complete with hand signals, invite-only gatherings, and leftist Facebook groups. Overall, they’re united in purpose and strategic in approach – but this hardly suggests a grassroots effort. As is so often the case, Westmoreland’s Left is less a coalition of local dissenters than a team of professional activists funded by out-of-town millions – and occasionally, even public tax dollars. Anti-gun billboards, for example, are paid for by aPACinvolving prominent liberals, such as former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. Meanwhile, critical race theorydisplaysandmessagingare funded by groups such as PA Start and the Westmoreland Diversity Coalition, bothrecipientsoftaxpayer-fundedgrantsand gifts from corporations likeHeinz. The progressive campaign, though, isn’t limited to leftist messaging on major thoroughfares. In fact, Westmoreland’s liberal wing has clear-eyed electoral ambitions. In 2019, for example, the county commissioner elections turned into a bitter struggle between Democratic incumbents – termed the “Westmoreland County Squad” after the congressional coalition led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes – and their Republican challengers. The local fight concerned the lobbying power of public-sector unions, whom Democrats had empowered to influence county spending. The unions’ left-leaning positions on social issues, such as acounty diversity plan, became part of Democratic candidates’ platforms, too. This, in turn, unified Republican opposition. Since then, the most prominent Westmoreland Squad member has signaled her support for replacing Westmoreland’s Flag Day observance with Juneteenth – but onlyif the unions agree. Westmoreland’s progressives are also keen on dominating local school boards. The county chapter ofPA United, a subsidiary of the George Soros-fundedDemocracy Alliance, has put forward several candidates seeking to make local school districts’ curriculum and practices more progressive. The candidates present a neutral, pragmatic face tolocal mediabut elsewhere tout theirprogressive credentials. Westmorelanders, though, likely wish to avoid theparent-led battlesoverideological school boardsandidentity-driven curriculumcurrently afflicting Loudoun County, Va., and suburban Philadelphia. This November, such issues are at stake in Westmoreland’s elections. On guns, law and order, family values, and education, the county isn’t a great fit for progressive activists or the elite millionaires who fund them. But post-Trump, such a conservative area remains a target for culture war assaults waged by “resistance” activists with deep pockets. For some reason, western Pennsylvania’s towns, with their thriving small business economies, neighborhood safety, solidarity, and educational opportunity, have become a bugbear for the Left. But most Westmorelanders still consider these community features to be proud of – and defend.

At least 97 people were killed when the 12-storey Champlain Towers South fell in the early hours of 24 June. But the remains of 54-year-old Estelle Hedaya are yet to be identified. Her family say the official end of the search has left them feeling helpless and worried she will be forgotten. Nobody has been pulled alive from the rubble since the first hours after the disaster, and officials formally switched from a search-and-rescue mission to a recovery effort on 7 July. Battling tropical storms and the risk of unstable debris, rescuers worked through more than 13,000 tonnes of broken concrete. The Surfside site has mostly been cleared, with the rubble moved to a state warehouse for further inspection. After the search ended, officials thanked firefighters who worked 12-hour shifts while camping out at the site.""It's obviously devastating. It's obviously a difficult situation across the board,"" Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said at a ceremony on Friday.""I couldn't be prouder of the men and women that represent Miami-Dade Fire Rescue.""The mission had to be been halted several times, due to instability in the mound of rubble as well as Tropical Storm Elsa. Officials had to order the part of the building that remained standing be demolished on 4 July. Officials say there are no more bodies to be found at the site, but the conclusion has come as devastating news to friends and relatives of Estelle Hedaya, believed to be the disaster's 98th victim. Her younger brother Ikey has given DNA samples and visited the site twice to see the search efforts for himself.""As we enter month two alone, without any other families, we feel helpless,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. Another friend Leah Sutton, who had known Ms Hedaya since birth, told the agency: ""They seem to be packing up and congratulating everyone on a job well done. And yes, they deserve all the accolades, but after they find Estelle. dMiami-Dade Fire Rescue shared a video to show how they're working to clear the rubbleOther victims of the disaster include the seven-year-old daughter of a Miami firefighter, a 92-year-old grandmother and the sister of Paraguay's first lady. The site - which is being treated as a crime scene - is now under the control of police. What caused the 40-year-old building to fall to the ground while its residents slept remains unknown. But a 2018 report that found structural problemshas prompted several inquiries, including a grand jury investigation.

507,"Vatican Indicts 10 People, Including a Cardinal, in UK Deal",0.0,47.67,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/vatican-scandal/2021/07/03/id/1027352/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-03,25,"A Vatican judge on Saturday indicted 10 people, including a once-powerful cardinal, on charges including embezzlement, abuse of office, extortion and fraud in connection with the Secretariat of State’s 350 million-euro investment in a London real estate venture. The president of the Vatican's criminal tribunal, Giuseppe Pignatone, set July 27 as the trial date, but lawyers for the defendants immediately questioned how they could prepare for trial so soon given they hadn't yet formally received the indictment or any of the documentation in the case. The 487-page indictment was handed down following a sprawling, two-year investigation into how the Secretariat of State managed its vast asset portfolio, much of which is funded by the Peter’s Pence donations from the faithful. The scandal over multimillion-dollar losses has resulted in a sharp reduction in donations and prompted Pope Francis to strip the office of its ability to manage the money. Five former Vatican officials, including Cardinal Angelo Becciu and two officials from the Secretariat of State, were indicted, as well as Italian businessmen who handled the London investment. Also indicted on alleged embezzlement charges was an Italian intelligence expert accused of buying luxury goods with Holy See money intended to help free Catholic priests and nuns held hostage by rebels in Africa. Vatican prosecutors accuse the main suspects of bilking millions of euros from the Holy See in fees and other losses related to financial investments that were funded in large part by donations to the pope for works of charity. The suspects have denied wrongdoing. One of the main suspects in the case, Italian broker Gianluigi Torzi, is accused of having extorted the Vatican out of 15 million euros to turn over ownership of the London building in late 2018. Torzi had been retained by the Vatican to help it acquire full ownership of the building from another indicted money manager who had handled the initial investment in 2013, but lost millions on what the Vatican said were speculative, imprudent deals. Vatican prosecutors allege Torzi inserted a last-minute clause into the contract giving him full voting rights in the deal. The Vatican hierarchy, however, signed off on the contract, with both the pope's No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his deputy approving it. Neither was indicted. In addition, Francis himself was aware of the deal and Torzi's involvement in it. Vatican prosecutors say the Vatican hierarchs were hoodwinked by Torzi and aided in part by an Italian lawyer — who was also indicted Saturday — into agreeing to the deal. The Secretariat of State intends to declare itself an injured party in the case. Torzi has denied the charges and said the accusations were the fruit of a misunderstanding. He is currently in London pending an extradition request by Italian authorities, who are seeking to prosecute him on other financial charges. His representatives said they had no immediate comment Saturday since they hadn't yet seen the indictment. Also indicted was a onetime papal contender and Holy See official, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, who helped engineer the initial London investment when he was the chief of staff in the Secretariat of State. Francis fired him as the Vatican’s saint-making chief last year, apparently in connection with a separate issue: his 100,000-euro donation of Holy See funds to a diocesan charity run by Becciu’s brother. Vatican News, the in-house media portal, said Becciu had originally not been part of the London investigation but was included after it appeared that he was behind the proposal to buy the building. Prosecutors also accuse him of interfering in the investigation. In a statement Saturday issued by his lawyers, Becciu insisted on the “absolute falsity"" of the accusations against him and denounced what he said was “unparalleled media pillory"" against him in the Italian press.""I am the victim of a plot hatched against me and I have been waiting for a long time to know any accusations against me, to allow myself to promptly deny them and prove to the world my absolute innocence,"" he said. Becciu has denied wrongdoing in the London investment; he has admitted he made the donation but insisted the money was for the charity, not his brother. One of Becciu’s proteges, Cecilia Marogna, was indicted on embezzlement charges. Becciu had hired Marogna as an external consultant after she reached out to him in 2015 with concerns about security at Vatican embassies in global hotspots. Becciu authorized hundreds of thousands of euros of Holy See funds to her to free Catholic hostages, according to WhatsApp messages reprinted by Italian media. Her Slovenian-based holding company, which received the funds, was among the four companies also ordered to stand trial. Marogna has said the money was compensation for legitimate security and intelligence work and reimbursements for her expenses. Vatican News, citing the indictment, said she spent the money on purchases that were incompatible with the humanitarian scope of her company. In a statement Saturday, her legal team said Marogna had been prepared for months to “provide a full accounting of her work and fears nothing about the accusations made against her.""Also indicted were the former top two officials in the Vatican’s financial watchdog agency, for alleged abuse of office. Prosecutors say that by failing to stop the Torzi deal, they performed a “decisive function"" in letting it play out, Vatican News said. The lawyer for the former office director, Tommaso di Ruzza, said he had only seen the Vatican press statement about the allegations but insisted that his client “has always acted in the most scrupulous respect of the law and his office duties, in the exclusive interest of the Holy See.""The former head of the office, Rene Bruelhart, defended his work and said his indictment was a “procedural blunder that will be immediately clarified by the organs of Vatican justice as soon as the defense will be able to exercise its rights.""",3,Reliable,0.051834447229184,0.3065928710665552,1250,1,Newsmax

Settlement of the lawsuit was announced by the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information. The EEOC had originally filed the lawsuit in 2017. The company was charged with failing to consider African American employees for promotions to vacant route sales positions. One example is Ronnie Johnson, a Black employee who applied for a route sales position.“Despite six years of exemplary job performance with the company and previous route sales experience, Birmingham Beverage denied him an interview and instead promoted a white delivery driver with only nine months’ experience on the job, whom Johnson was supervising at the time,” apress releasefrom the EEOC says. Despite Black employees frequently expressing interest in promotions, none were hired in the four years prior to the lawsuit, according to the EEOC. At least 11 white applicants or employees were hired or promoted to these route sales positions.“At the time of the lawsuit, Birmingham Beverage’s only two Black route salesmen were assigned to routes in predominantly African American neighborhoods,” the release says. The suit alleged that Birmingham Beverage violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on multiple occasions. As a result of the suit, Johnson and 34 other Black employees, former and current, will receive a monetary settlement. Birmingham Beverage also agreed to review its policies on the hiring and promotion processes to ensure Black employees and applicants have equal opportunities, provide anti-discrimination training to all employees and hire a Title VII coordinator.“This case illustrates the destructive and demoralizing impact race discrimination can have on employees when they are denied employment opportunities based on their race,” EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows said in the release. “For many years, African American workers at Birmingham Beverage demonstrated their fitness and desire for promotion but were denied employment opportunities because of the color of their skin.”Lehr Middlebrooks Vreeland & Thompson, P. C. represents Birmingham Beverage in the litigation. According to their response on the company’s behalf, Birmingham Beverage “stands behind its hiring and promotion decisions to hire and promote the best qualified applicants.”They also claim they have employed “many African American Route Salesmen” over the last five years.“The high costs of litigation of class claims made the continued vigorous defense of the suit economically infeasible and presented a distraction to our core business operations,” the response states. “We look forward to continuing to hire and promote applicants and employees of all backgrounds into positions for which they are qualified.”",3,Reliable,0.0075,0.3063157894736842,593,3,AL.com

The lawsuit,filed Monday in U. S. District Court in Minnesota, argues that even though U. S. citizens who are 18 years old are considered adults ""for almost all purposes,"" the state unconstitutionally bans them from carrying handguns outside their homes or automobiles for self-defense.""There is simply no legal or constitutional justification that an entire class of adult citizens in Minnesota should be completely denied their fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms,"" said Bryan Strawser, chairman of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, which is also part of the lawsuit. Strawser's nonprofit, in a statement late Monday, billed the suit as ""the latest legal effort in the Caucus' planned litigation in Minnesota to secure the right to keep and bear arms throughout the state.""The three plaintiffs — Kristin Worth, Austin Dye and Axel Anderson — filed the complaint alongside the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, Second Amendment Foundation and the Firearms Policy Coalition. According to the lawsuit, they are also members of the respective groups. They are suing Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, Mille Lacs County Sheriff Don Lorge, Douglas County Sheriff Troy Wolbersen and Washington County Sheriff Dan Starry. The three sheriffs are being sued because they represent counties where each of the three plaintiffs live. Harrington's department manages permit-to-carry applications in the state, and applicants must file with their sheriffs. A spokesman for the DPS said Tuesday that the department does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy. Reached by the Star Tribune, Lorge said in an e-mail that ""I will be inquiring with our attorney on the matter.""Messages were also left seeking comment from Wolbersen and Starry. The lawsuit describes the three Minnesotans' desire to legally carry handguns for protection — even detailing the make and model of the guns they would like to carry. Worth, an 18-year-old Mille Lacs resident who works part time managing a local grocery store, described wanting to carry a gun for self-defense because her work closing down the store at night often finds her traversing the store's dark parking lot alone. Anderson, who is 18, works overnight shifts as a front-desk attendant at a Douglas County hotel. According to the complaint, his girlfriend was once accosted and chased through the hotel lot by a ""group of unknown aggressors.""Blair Nelson, a Bemidji attorney who signed the civil complaint, argued in the filing that ""arms carrying was a right available to all peaceable citizens"" throughout American history. Nelson wrote that ""hundreds of statutes from the colonial and founding eras"" required people between 18 and 20 to keep and bear arms in cases of fieldwork and road and bridge construction. The lawsuit claimed that such laws also required arms carrying by members of the public to travel and attend church or court. Nelson wrote that the three Minnesotans who filed the suit fear running afoul of state law that could lead to penalties ranging from $3,000 fines and a year of incarceration on first offense or up to $10,000 and five years incarceration on subsequent violations.

But the ramifications of this latest round of Israeli-Palestinian confrontation—Israeli military strikes in Gaza, Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli cities, and rising intercommunal violence between Arabs and Jews—will be long-lasting and profound. Above all, it will reinforce the sense among Israelis, Palestinians, and most of the international community that the search for a peaceful resolution to the conflict has come to an end for the foreseeable future. The conflict that began in early May was not planned. It was the culmination of various small but important steps that, while linked, did not make violence inevitable. Yet a combination of domestic Israeli and Palestinian political dynamics, international failures, and worsening relations between the two sides created the right conditions for bloodshed. Yet whatever its accidental quality, the latest round of violence will have enduring consequences. Hamas will emerge from the conflict stronger and the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its president weaker. Violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews will eventually abate, but Arab perceptions of systemic discrimination will grow—as will a belief that a search for equality within Israel is inherently futile. Jerusalem’s symbolic role will also expand, deepening the conflict’s religious dimensions. Among many Israelis and Palestinians, these developments mark the return to an older phase of the conflict. The last two weeks have reinforced a belief that their relationship is again existential and zero-sum, that diplomacy to resolve the conflict is futile and violence inevitable. The current confrontation is unfolding across four theaters. The Gaza-Israeli military bombardment has destroyed civilian infrastructure andkilledmore than 200 Palestinians, 30 percent of them children, and ten Israelis. Ethnonational tensions within Israel have sparked unprecedented intercommunal riots and violence between Arabs and Jews. Palestinians and Israeli police, extreme Jewish nationalist-religious groups, and settlers are in a standoff in East Jerusalem over access to Muslim holy places and the planned evictions of Arab families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. And in the West Bank, tensions are high after Israeli forceskilled fourPalestinian demonstrators and injured dozens more on May 18, a day of protest that engulfed major Palestinian cities. Nonetheless, tensions there remain contained by joint PA and Israeli efforts. These dynamics have been building since Israel invaded Gaza in 2014. That war marked the end of any real hope of striking a deal to end the conflict, as then U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry had been working to do. After 2014, relations between both sides worsened and the prospect of a two-state solution gradually diminished. With the realization that a peaceful outcome was impossible in the short to medium term, the Israeli right began to assert itself—especially after the election of Donald Trump as U. S. president in 2016. Trump’s policies emboldened many Israeli conservatives and cleared the way for extreme anti-Palestinian policies. Israeli settlers began expanding into new areas of the West Bank, and Israel began routinely confiscating Palestinian land and demolishing homes along the way. By 2019–20, many Israelis had begun to demand the annexation of wide swaths of new territory without granting equal rights to Palestinian citizens. Adding insult to injury, several Arab states also began to normalize relations with Israel, eventually concluding the so-called Abraham Accords in 2020. As Arab states’ solidarity with the Palestinian cause receded, Palestinians themselves felt increasingly abandoned. These pressures were particularly apparent in Jerusalem. After Washington’s 2017 recognition of the city as Israel’s capital, Israel increased the pace of illegal annexation and stepped up its efforts to change the status quo in the Old City’s holy places. Israeli police restricted Palestinian access to the al Aqsa compound, attempted to silence the call for prayer, and began granting access to larger numbers of Jewish Israelis. Authorities also moved to evict Arab East Jerusalemites from their homes and began to assert a more dominant Jewish nationalist-religious agenda throughout the city. Inside Israel itself, the emboldened right wing also took steps to marginalize Israeli Arab citizens. Many among this latter group saw the 2018 so-called nation-state bill—which declares Israel the historic homeland of the Jewish people, establishes Hebrew as the only official language, and asserts that Jewish settlements are a “national value”—as yet another means of discriminating against Israeli Arabs to the benefit of Israeli Jews. Two years later, an amendment that would have added equality for minorities to the law, reducing the chance that it might be used to legitimize legal discrimination against Israeli Arabs, was voted down in the Knesset—Israel’s parliament. Right-wing politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also routinely incite hatred and fear against Israeli Arabs and their representatives in the Knesset. A dramatic rise in crime rates in Arab communities, moreover, compounds already existing socioeconomic problems. Palestinian politics has been plagued by its own series of setbacks. Over the past several years, the PA has severely undermined the public’s faith in its ability to govern. Having held no general elections since 2006, the Palestinian Authority has damaged the rule of law, weakened the judiciary, curtailed media freedoms, and shrunk the space for civil society as organizations lost much of their independence from the government. The result is increasing public discontent and overwhelming demands for PA President Mahmoud Abbas to resign. Hamas’s behavior in the Gaza Strip has been no better. Unbothered by constitutional principles, norms, and rule of law, it has grown increasingly ruthless. Two weeks ago, these conflicting Israeli-Palestinian and intra-Palestinian dynamics finally collided. The earliest and most obvious trigger was Israel’s policies toward Muslim holy places in Jerusalem’s Old City and its demographic battle against Palestinians in the rest of occupied East Jerusalem. This set the stage for small confrontations during Ramadan between Palestinians, Israeli police, and right-wing extremists in the Old City over the changes at Haram al-Sharif (the Temple Mount) and access to the Damascus Gate. Another flash point was the Shaikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem. In a pattern repeated throughout the occupied city, many Palestinian residents faced imminent eviction from their own homes by Jewish settlers. East Jerusalemites, other Palestinians, and many Israeli Arabs mobilized in response—launching a series of limited and essentially nonviolent protests. A separate trigger was the Israeli decision to prevent Palestinian elections, planned for May 22, from taking place in East Jerusalem—despite its obligation to facilitate them under the terms of the Oslo accords struck in 1993. The Israeli decision was apparently unrelated to the elections themselves (Israel declared it had no intention of interfering in the process as a whole). Instead, the move was seen as an attempt to deny Palestinian claims to occupied East Jerusalem, even though Israel had already acknowledged such claims in three previous elections. It was this Israeli move that proved most relevant to the timing of the current confrontation. Ostensibly in response to Israel’s decision, Abbas decided to cancel the May PA elections entirely‚ promising to hold them only once Israel agreed to walk back its original plan. This only multiplied internal Palestinian tensions, however. Almost all other Palestinian electoral lists and candidates rejected the decision, including Hamas. Most parties suspected that the real motive was Abbas’s realization that he would lose the race and be forced to share control of parliament with three prominent Fatah defectors: Muhammad Dahlan, Marwan Barghouti, and Nasser al-Qudwa. Abbas’s opponents argued that Palestinians should not grant Israel veto power over their elections. They instead favored forcing Israel to accept a vote in East Jerusalem through nonviolent electoral campaigns and voting drives in al Aqsa and other mosques, churches, and UN and diplomatic missions. The final trigger for the current round of violence was Hamas’s inability to forge a joint alliance against Abbas’s election cancellation, despite widespread opposition to it. Although the group reached out to other electoral lists seeking their support, none wanted to be seen as Hamas’s allies. This dealt a heavy blow to Hamas’s long-term strategy. By reintegrating itself into the PA political process through elections, the group had sought to restore its legitimacy and free itself from the burden of governing the Gaza Strip. With that strategy in tatters, a more militant Hamas leadership took the lead. The Israeli police escalation at al Aqsa and imminent evictions in Shaikh Jarrah provided the opportunity to achieve two goals: The first was to punish Abbas and make him politically irrelevant. The second was to punish Israel for its anti-Palestinian policies in East Jerusalem and its decision to halt elections in the city. In achieving those two goals, Hamas sought to demonstrate to Palestinians and others that while Abbas ran away from a battle over Jerusalem, Hamas would stand with its residents. Indeed, the group was willing to risk war in Gaza to defend the city and the al Aqsa mosque. Eventually, on May 10, Hamas issued an ultimatum: if Israel did not withdraw its police and military personnel from the mosque and Shaikh Jarrah, the group would attack. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas began targeting Israeli towns with rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, triggering retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Hamas did not unleash the current confrontation. It merely capitalized on rising tensions to make the case for replacing Abbas. Israel’s decision to cancel the election in East Jerusalem and Abbas’s subsequent move to cancel the entire process set off a chain reaction that neither side anticipated. If elections had gone ahead as planned, confrontations in East Jerusalem would have intensified but likely remained nonviolent. Hamas, Fatah, and other electoral lists would have been too busy mobilizing their electoral constituencies against the Israeli police and extremist settlers; Hamas would not have risked a war in Gaza that might have halted electoral preparations, thereby destroying its opportunity to reintegrate itself into the formal political process. Without elections, however, the stage was set for violence. How will the current confrontation affect the prospects for a long-term peace? On the Israeli-Palestinian front, the two-state solution might have received a mortal blow. Given Israeli efforts to marginalize Abbas and the PA, it will not be easy to keep the West Bank out of the next conflict or even the current one. Security coordination between Israel and the PA will not be enough to contain the rising flames. And given the rhetoric around annexation, no right-wing Israeli government will be willing or able to renew a political process that would require negotiations with the PA leadership, even for small incremental steps. Domestically, Abbas will manage to stay in office only as long as he can prevent elections from taking place. Yet with rising popular discontent, the PA security services’ ability to maintain control and quell discontent is diminishing. The PA might find itself the target of an angry public. Abbas, the PA, and the Palestinian national movement will lose what little public trust they still hold. Elections and political reforms are the only means of making the system legitimate and accountable again. Those who reject elections because Abbas will lose or because the process might legitimize Hamas should consider the consequences. Ignoring the problem and keeping Hamas cornered in the Gaza Strip is no solution. There should be no illusion about the role of the international community here. At best, Arab states and others, including Washington, can help manage the conflict only by making the status quo sustainable. They do not, however, have the capacity or political will to force Israel to respect international law or Abbas and the PA to respect the norms of good governance. As hard as it may be, Israelis and Palestinians must do that themselves.",3,Reliable,0.0831545714464969,0.4436624004015307,2429,3,Foreign Affairs

To date, Boulder County has had 14,515 positive or probable coronavirus cases and 180 deaths. The two people who died were residents of long-term care facilities and were in their 60s and 80s, said public health spokesperson Chana Goussetis. She said Boulder County has lost more residents to the virus — 56 — in December than any other month since the start of the pandemic. A smaller proportion of deaths now also are occurring among residents of long-term care facilities compared to earlier in the pandemic. In April and May, about 80% of deaths were among those associated with long-term care facilities, she said, compared to 63% of deaths in December. There were 67 people hospitalized as of Tuesday, and there have been a total of 410 hospitalizations. Goussetis said hospitalizations are lower this week than a week ago, when 77 people were hospitalized. Hospitalizations also are down this week statewide, with 1,091 people hospitalized with COVID-19 now compared to 1,253 people a week ago. The county reported that new cases of COVID-19 among Boulder County residents in the past two weeks is 356.7 per 100,000. Although that’s down from November when the state and county tightened restrictions, Boulder County remains at Level Red, which indicates severe risk. The state will consider moving the county to the less restrictive Orange Level when the 14-day average of new cases are at or below 350 for 14 consecutive days. The positivity rate and hospitalizations also must not rise. Goussetis said long-term care facilities should be receiving COVID-19 vaccine doses this week through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’sPharmacy Partnership for Long-term Care Program. In the past two weeks, there have been 176 COVID-19 cases associated with long-term care facilities in Boulder County, she said. Julian Hazlett, executive director of The Peaks Care Center in Longmont, said The Peaks conducted a vaccine clinic in partnership with Walgreens pharmacy on Tuesday morning for residents and staff members. Through the clinic, 99% of the 63 residents and about 60% of the staff received the first of two Pfizer vaccine doses.“It’s just a huge relief,” he said, noting the long-term care facility had an outbreak in the spring. “We’re just super excited to be able to put this behind us. We are really looking forward to the protection the residents and staff will have.”After the last vaccination clinic scheduled in February, when residents and staff members will have received a second dose, it should be possible to start easing restrictions on visitors so residents can again see family, he said. Also included in this first phase of vaccine distribution are firefighters, emergency services and law enforcement officers. Boulder County Public Health is partnering with the Boulder County and Longmont offices of emergency management to coordinate vaccine clinics for first responders, according to a news release. Tuesday, Boulder Fire-Rescue tweeted that several of their first responders received the first dose of the vaccine.

512,Report: Biden Policies Would Make Tax System ‘More Progressive’ While Cutting Economic Growth,12.33,32.67,https://www.dailywire.com/news/report-biden-policies-would-make-tax-system-more-progressive-while-cutting-economic-growth,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-wire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-11,25,"A new report indicates that President Biden’s tax policies would decrease employment, wages, productivity, and long-term economic growth in the United States. According tofindingsfrom the Tax Foundation, the President’sbudgetfor 2022 — which incorporates the American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan — would lead to 60.7% of Americans paying higher taxes while only 29% benefit from tax cuts and credits. Driven primarily by tax hikes on wealthy Americans, the average annual tax burden in the United States would rise by $1,190. On the campaign trail, Bidenpromisedthat Americans earning below $400,000 would not see their taxes rise as highearners“finally pay their fair share.” However, for those earning between $200,000 and $400,000, the average tax burden would rise by $1,570. For Americans making between $500,000 and $1,000,000, the average burden would rise by $8,980. Meanwhile, the Biden administration’s proposals would lighten the net tax burden for other Americans. The data reveal, for example, that 39% of those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 per year would see a tax decrease of $2,270, which outweighs a $110 tax hike experienced by 47% of the same income bracket. The President’s policies would lead to a more progressive tax regime — a system that demands differing tax rates based on one’s income. For instance, according to the Tax Foundation’sanalysisof the American Families Plan:The tax system would become more progressive than under current law through higher marginal tax rates on high earners and expanded refundable tax credits for lower-income taxpayers. The funding choices in the American Families Plan come at the cost of reduced economic output, fewer jobs, and lower wages. By drawing more capital from the tax base, long-term economic growth would suffer in a manner that affects all Americans:The tax provisions in the American Families Plan would reduce the economy’s size by 0.4 percent in the long run, primarily by increasing marginal tax rates on labor and investment in the pass-through business sector. The capital stock would fall by 0.7 percent, wages by 0.4 percent, and employment by about 64,000 full-time equivalent jobs. GNP, which measures American incomes, would fall by 0.6 percent. Analysis from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School reveals similar results for the American Jobs Plan. Despite the President proclaiming that the legislation would represent a “once-in-a-generation” investment into the American economy, the American Jobs Plan focuses on expansive social programs in addition to roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1071717171717172,0.3686940836940837,579,2,Daily Wire

Don Jr., who is one ofdozens of peoplein President Trump’s inner circle who have caught COVID-19, apparently tested positive earlier this week, and a spokesperson told Bloomberg that he is asymptomatic and now self-isolating. His girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, tested positive for the virus over the summer. It’s not clear how or where Trump Jr. was infected or if his case is linked to theearlier White House outbreaks. Also on Friday, White House aide Andrew Giuliani, who is Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s son, revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19 as well. The younger Giuliani had attended thebizarre conspiracy theory-saturated press conferencein a packed room at the Republican National Committee headquarters where his father and other members of Trump’s legal team held to make a case for overturning the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who took part in the press conference, said Friday that both she and Rudy Giuliani had tested negative. Bloomberg News also reports that Hannah McInnis, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, also tested positive earlier this month, which may be another case linked to the earlier outbreakthat struck Pence’s teamthe week before the election, infecting several staffers including his top aides. That was one of at least three serious outbreaks linked to the White House in the last two months. Two weeks ago, numerous people who attended an indoor Election Night party at the White Houselater tested positive for COVID-19, including President Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, White House political director Brian Jack, Trump campaign adviser David Bossie, and many others, including a large number of Secret Service agents.

Some leftists are repeating their old trope that they're merely anti-Zionist, not full-blown Jew-haters no different from the Klan or other low-class dirtbags. For appearances' sake, most are paying some kind of lip service to condemning this apparently organized Hamas thuggery appearing suddenly on our shores, even as they continue to claim with forked tongues that Israel is the problem. Joe Biden, though, is the exception. He hasn't said a damn thing. He still remains AWOL as Jews are hunted down and assaulted inhate crimes, raising questions, at least in my mind, as to whether Hamas has something on him. He's said nothing. His Twitter feed is a wasteland and his White House site is silent. 'Silent Joe' is his way with this one, and it's not a compliment. Biden can reliably be counted upon to condemn other hate crimes and perceived transgressions -- he condemned anti-Asian hate crimes, for one, and of course, calls any incident involving a black suspect and a white cop 'systemic racism,' which makes his silence in the case of this shocking wave of attacks all the more remarkable. It's certainly been noticed in any case. According to Ben Samuels, writing inHa'aretz:The Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, Hadassah: The Women's Zionist Organization of America, Jewish Federations of North America, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America wrote Biden on Friday highlighting a spike in reported violent incidents targeting Jews in the U.

J. Kaufman, writing atThe Lid:While many wonder whetherIran-backed Hamaswill oblige [on a ceasefire with Israel after it started its rocket attacks], we also wonder why President Joe Biden has not been more outspoken, not only in supporting our chief ally in the Middle East, Israel but in condemning violence against Jews in America.

And these numbers continue in May,ironically Jewish American Heritage Month. Joe may be AWOL on the border, but he's even more AWOL on this. As with the border meltdown, his silence suggests consent. Biden's silence is most likely due to his innate cowardice and his consummate political considerations. According to New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin, as president, he shifts like a weather vane to the political winds. He hides, he appears, he calls a lid, but the bottom line is, he's concerned only about one thing politically: Keeping the far left wing of his party ever loyal to him as his political foot soldiers. That's where the biggest Jew-haters roost. Start with the far-left Squad side of things. Writing in the New York Post, Goodwin believes there was a weird turning point in Joe's behavior around this priority of his:A defining moment came last Tuesday when Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman elected to Congress, confronted Biden at the Detroit airport and argued American aid to Israel was funding atrocities against Palestinians. The tarmac face-off lasted eight minutes, and Biden later lavished praise on Tlaib’s “passion and concern for so many people.” Presumably, her concern doesn’t include the Jews Hamas vows to eliminate. The irony here is that while even full-blown Jew-haters such as Tlaib and Reps. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pay lip service to condemning anti-Semitic attacks, as I wrote abouthereyesterday, Joe won't condemn even those. There's more than the Squad, though, in the mind of Joe -- there's also the Democratic Party's black congressional leaders and activists, who have embraced the likes of Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton, two notorious anti-Semites, as if they represent all black voters, and are ineffably tied to the mast of the Democrat party. After a spate of anti-Semitic attacks by black extremists in 2019, I noted thishere. Why is that? [Why are these attacks happening?] Because Democrats have been coddling black anti-Semites for years. Where's the Democratic condemnation for race huckster Rev. Al Sharpton, who's also a notorious anti-Semite with a long record of incitement of violence against Jews? Right there in the berth of the Democratic Party, still supposedly representing the black ""middle class.""Where's the Democrats' condemnation for Louis Farrakhan, whose animating breath is all about anti-Semitism? Hobnobbing with Democrats in photos, appearing with Bill Clinton at Aretha Franklin's funeral, and tweeting ""sweetheart"" dreck with fellow anti-Semite, Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. Where, for that matter, is the Democratic condemnation of Rep. Ilhan Omar's anti-Semitism? They couldn't pass a simple resolution against her in the House after her string of whoppers. They were too afraid to lay a hand on her, despite her long record of anti-Semitic statements. It's coddling all right, and you can bet the more aggressive street predator class of black cultists, such as ""Black Hebrew Israelites"" a known anti-Semitic black group, and Jew-haters in the boroughs noticed the pattern, took note, and launched their reign of terror. Still no recognition of the problem from Democrats, though. They prefer to call it the bad deeds of individuals and then let them off lightly. That's a recipe of worse to come. In Joe's mind, though, it's best to keep these moral zeros happy so they'll deliver the black vote for Joe. This, despite, or maybe because of, President Trump's heavy inroads on winning over the black vote to Republicans in 2020. Elections are going to be tough for Democrats going forward, so Joe's going all in on following the Sharpton way and keeping Calypso Louie content, both creeps laughing up their sleeves at him, in the interest of using their political muscle to perpetuate his own political power. This is more than just speculation. Sharpton, for one, visited the Obama White House with Joe Biden the sitting vice president72 times, according to leftist PolitiFact, and according to Wisconsin GOP Congressman Glenn Grothman, and former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, it was probably a higher figure. Whatever the number of times, it was a big number with a bottom at 72, obviously underlining to Old Joe that political power for Democrats depends on the love of Jew-hating Al Sharpton. Obama taught Biden everything he knows and probably continues to serve as a shadow president. This is a vile dynamic, no two ways about it. Biden is keeping silent for a reason and the multiplying nests of anti-Semitism within his own party amount to a vehicle for him. He therefore stays silent as raw anti-Semitism rears its ugly head and pogrom-like violence spirals across the U. S., expecting reliably Democrat-voting Jews to let it go, and expecting the whole thing to go away. It won't. Image:Gage Skidmore, via Flickr//CC BY-SA 2.0.

Obama taught Biden everything he knows and probably continues to serve as a shadow president. This is a vile dynamic, no two ways about it. Biden is keeping silent for a reason and the multiplying nests of anti-Semitism within his own party amount to a vehicle for him. He therefore stays silent as raw anti-Semitism rears its ugly head and pogrom-like violence spirals across the U. S., expecting reliably Democrat-voting Jews to let it go, and expecting the whole thing to go away. It won't. .",0,Problematic,0.0145039468210199,0.4527627747139942,3549,0,American Thinker

Collectively, they’ll get $791 million from the richest man on Earth, although Bezos did not specify how much would go to each group.“I’ve spent the past several months learning from a group of incredibly smart people who’ve made it their life’s work to fight climate change and its impact on communities around the world,” Bezos said on Instagram. “I’m inspired by what they’re doing, and excited to help them scale.” The Amazon CEOannounced the creationof his personal $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund in February. Support for mainstream environmental groupsHis fund is equivalent to more than 7 percent of his net worth. It’s also10 times as muchas philanthropic foundations gave globally in 2018 to efforts to slow climate change. For his first round of funding, Bezos chose to back a handful of legacy organizations with an established history of advocacy on behalf of the planet. His choice in recipients so far signals support formainstream environmental groupsrallying for new policies and research on climate change. It’s also somewhat of a departure from contributions that Amazon and other giants have made recently to climate tech startups. Amazon,Microsoft, andStripe, in contrast to Bezos, have all pledged to funnel money toward developing brand-new technologies to reduce and capture their industries’ greenhouse gas emissions. Much ofthe first round of fundingfrom Amazon’s $2 billion climate fund will go toward getting more electric vehicles on the road and capturing carbon dioxide emissions, the company announced in September. Microsoftsaid in Januarythat it would spend $1 billion over four years on technologies that remove planet-heating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies is still in its infancyBut the carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies is still in its infancy. In contrast, some of the advocacy groups Bezos pledged to fund today have been fighting for environmental protections since close to the birth of the modern environmental movement in in the US in the 1960s. That includes the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which is led byGina McCarthy, an Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency administrator and vocal critic of Trump’s environmental rollbacks. “This generous gift from the Bezos Earth Fund enables NRDC to move even faster on achieving the climate solutions we need at the federal, state and local levels to protect people’s health, strengthen nature’s ability to help fight climate change and grow the clean energy sector and all the jobs that come with it,” McCarthy said in astatement. Bezos also named the Environmental Defense Fund, which tends to take a more corporate-friendly approach to its advocacy. It’s worked with companies like Walmart and McDonald’s on their sustainability goals. “The needs are enormous,” Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp toldafter the Bezos fund was announced in February. “No matter what organization receives this funding, what’s important is that the money be put to work.” Krupp and McCarthy’s organizations will each receive $100 million, according to statements from each group. Some of the big green groups Bezos chose, however, have been beset by scandal lately. Human rights abuses came to light in a 2019investigationinto the nearly 60-year-old conservation charity World Wildlife Fund. The organization’s anti-poaching efforts supported paramilitary groups that captured, tortured, and killed villagers and indigenous peoples in Asia and Africa,BuzzFeedreported. Two more groups Bezos will fund have had recent shifts in leadership as part of a broader reckoning with systemic racism and sexism withinscience fieldsandenvironmentalism. The CEO of conservation group Nature Conservancy decided toleave his post in June 2019following allegations of gender discrimination within the organization. The president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, Ken Kimmell,said that he would step downat the end of the year. Kimmell’s decision follows the high-profile resignation of the organization’s former coalitions coordinator, Ruth Tyson,who penned a public lettersaying, “It was really stressful and traumatic for me working [at the Union of Concerned Scientists] and I hope no other Black people ever have to share this pain.” World Wildlife Fund and Nature Conservancy said they would each get $100 million from Bezos’ fund, while the Union of Concerned Scientists said it’s been given $15 million. Among the established organizations, Bezos also decided to fund a recently formed group that centers racial equity in its work, the NDN Collective. It was founded by a diverse group of Native American activists in 2018 to fund and support indigenous-led movements and sustainability initiatives. Bezos will also fund the new Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, which was launched in 2019 with a focus on supporting women in the Southeast US. Bezos is funding research groups, too, like the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute and World Resources Institute. Bezos has so far avoided key activist groups that have been critical of him and AmazonBezos has so far avoided key activist groups that have been critical of him and Amazon, like the Sunrise Movement, which has spearheaded campaigns for a Green New Deal. “A reminder that Jeff Bezos has made over $48 Billion during the pandemic while over 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment. Imagine if he actually had to pay taxes and what that money could help fund,” Sunrise Movementtweeted in September. Still, Sunrise Movement hasn’t necessarily ruled out accepting funding from Bezos to promote its campaigns. “It’s better his extreme wealth sits with organizations like the Climate Justice Alliance and Sunrise than in some offshore tax haven,” Stephen O’Hanlon, Sunrise Movement communications director,said toin an email after the Bezos fund was announced in February.",3,Reliable,0.1106593003770423,0.4315563468789276,1270,3,The Verge
516,Conservatives Issue a Clarion Call on Trump’s Mental Health,-22.0,26.5,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/19/conservatives-issue-a-clarion-call-on-trumps-mental-health/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"Given what we know about Donald Trump and the presidency, I have been suggesting for a long time that his mental status will not get any better and can only get worse. As that prediction materializes, the president’s behavior has triggered several conservatives to issue warnings about his deteriorating mental health. The most comprehensive comes from Peter Wehner, who served under three Republican presidents and is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Reacting to some of Trump’s more inflammatory tweets over the weekend, Wehnerrefers to the presidentas “a damaged soul with a disordered personality.”It doesn’t take a person with an advanced degree in psychology to see Trump’s narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or his shamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better—and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses…Whether the worst scenarios come to pass or not is right now unknowable. But what weknow is that the president is a person who seems to draw energy and purpose from maliciousness and transgressive acts, from creating enmity among people of different races, religions, and backgrounds, and from attacking the weak, the honorable, and even the dead. Donald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is not safe. Leading the charge of conservatives commenting on the president’s mental health is George Conway. Right now he is best known as the husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump. But he also made a name for himself by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton. Conway has been expressing his concerns about the president recently on Twitter. This was the end of a stream where he reacted to some of Trump’s lies. Whether or not impeachment is in order, a serious inquiry needs to be made about this man’s condition of mind.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 14, 2019Conwaytweetedthe diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and asked, “Tell us,@realDonaldTrump—which of these diagnostic criteria do you not satisfy?” To explain, hetweeted a linkto an article in Rolling Stone titled, “Trump’s Mental Health: Is Pathological Narcissism the Key to Trump’s Behavior?”At one point, Conway teamed up with Bill Kristol to express his concern. Agree with this, but would add that *all* Americans should be thinking seriously *now* about Trump’s mental condition and psychological state, including and especially the media, Congress—and the Vice President and Cabinet.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 18, 2019Jennifer Rubinjoinedthe bandwagon. Whether meant seriously or not, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein’s alleged consideration of the 25th Amendment seems, in retrospect, not to have been irrational at all. Since President Trump’s firing of James B. Comey as FBI director and the appointment of a special counsel, Trump’s mental and emotional health has seemed to fray. The pace of lies and nonsensical accusations, the resort to conspiracy theories and refusal to conduct himself like an adult (let alone the president) often pick up in the wake of bad news from the special counsel and widespread criticism of the president’s unhinged behavior. So it was this weekend following his refusal to directly condemn white nationalism in the wake of the New Zealand massacre and the defection of 12 Senate Republicans last week on the resolution repealing the emergency declaration. These are not warnings coming from partisans seeking to undermine the opposition. Instead, they are clarion calls from conservatives to Republicans currently in office and those serving in Trump’s cabinet to take the situation seriously, before it’s too late.",1,Questionable,-0.0257251082251082,0.4597099567099568,876,1,Washington Monthly
517,"Amid attacks on abortion rights, more look to manage care without medical help",-8.33,44.0,https://americanindependent.com/abortion-rights-bans-medication-clinics/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-independent-bias-reliability/,2021-06-04,25,"People are turning increasingly to self-managed medication abortions. People are turning increasingly to self-managed medication abortions. The year 2021 is awash in anti-abortion bills, with over 500 abortion restrictions and over 150 outright bansintroducedso far this year. Additionally, the U. S. Supreme Courtrecently agreedto hear a case about Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. It’s a grim time for abortion rights and access, which may be why people are seeking information on self-managed medication abortion. Self-managed medication abortions are when an individual takes the drugs that induce an abortion outside of a clinic setting, without the direct assistance of an abortion provider. Medication abortion is avery safeprocedure, and research from other countrieshas shownthat patients can safely and effectively manage medication abortion without direct assistance. Anew studypublished in “Obstetrics and Gynecology” in May examined how many U. S. residents reached out toAid Access, a nonprofit that provides online consultations for medication abortions, in the period from March 2018 to March 2020. In those two years, over 57,000 people from all 50 states requested information and assistance from the group. For people in a dozen states with relatively liberal abortion laws, including California and New York, Aid Accessconnectspatients with U. S. doctors who can prescribe the two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, used in a medication abortion. For people in other states, Aid Accessworks withEuropean doctors to prescribe the drugs. Prescriptions are then sent to a pharmacy in India, which then mails the medications to the patient. Thehighest ratesof requests to Aid Access came from Louisiana and Mississippi, both states that restrict abortion access. Louisiana has enactedfar moreabortion restrictions than any other state. Mississippi has marginally fewer restrictions, but 99% of the counties in the state have no abortion clinics, and 91% of Mississippi women live inthose counties. Mississippi’s current 15-week ban stands in direct opposition to existing Supreme Court precedent concerning abortion laws, as it bans abortions beforeviability. As the 5th Circuit Court of Appealsnotedwhen it struck down Mississippi’s ban, there is “an unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade” that holds that states can regulate abortion procedures prior to fetal viability but cannot ban abortions before that point. If Mississippi’s ban is upheld by the Supreme Court, abortion access in that state will be radically diminished. The study didn’t just look at who sought information about self-managed abortion. It also examined the reasons people gave for going that route. Nearly 75% of the people who sought medication abortions through Aid Access stated they wereunable to affordan in-clinic abortion. Medication abortions in the clinic setting costan average of$535. Going through Aid Accesscosts $105. Nearly 50% of the people who sought assistance through Aid Access stated they were afraid of a partner or family member finding out about their abortion if they had to go to a clinic for the procedure; 40%indicatedthat distance was a factor and that the nearest clinic was too far away, and nearly the same amount stated that they would have to take too much time off from work or school to get to a clinic. These myriad difficulties are the direct result of abortion restrictions. As clinics shutter, as bans pass, as obstacles like waiting periods and mandatory ultrasounds increase, more people will become unable to get an abortion. Self-managed medication abortion is a solution to this problem. But because it requires people to enter into an arrangement that lacksformal legal protections, it’s an imperfect one. A previous version of this story misidentified the researchers behind the May study published in “Obstetrics and Gynecology.”The first day was a breeze. Sean Shannon and Danny Foster walked into several marijuana dispensaries around Missouri with their matching “Union For Cannabis Workers” shirts and talked to employees about the possibility of unionizing. “The first day, there were 57 stops amongst the teams,” said Shannon, lead organizer with UFCW Local 655, which actually […]'To me, this country is craving people that are problem solvers who will work and put the partisan politics aside,' Hertel said.

The latest target of woke progressive lunacy is apparently the term “mistress.”According to AP Stylebook,“Don’t use the term mistress for a woman who is in a long-term sexual relationship with, and is financially supported by, a man who is married to someone else. Instead, use an alternative like companion, friend or lover on first reference and provide additional details later.”Don’t use the term mistress for a woman who is in a long-term sexual relationship with, and is financially supported by, a man who is married to someone else.

Additionally, I can’t help but wonder which powerful “mistress” was sufficiently offended by the term that they persuaded the AP to make a statement (which they say was originally issued in previous years), but that’s also not the point. Or maybe it was a powerful man who was caught with a “friend” and they wanted to get ahead of the narrative, but that’s not the point either. The point is, we apparently need to manipulate language so as to avoid potentially offending mistresses by calling them mistresses. Here’s the woke progressive argument.“Mistress” is biased language that carries negative connotations typically directed at a woman involved in a non-traditional relationship. It carries with it a host of feelings and stereotypes that are then prescribed primarily to the woman in the relationship. Conversely, the adulterous man in the relationship is often referred to with less biased language that carries fewer negative connotations, like “companion,” “friend,” or “lover,” which inadvertently absolves him of responsibility and negative social implications. Therefore, woke progressives want to abolish the term “mistress” altogether, in order to avoid negatively biased labels for such women. Y’all, I don’t discriminate against extramarital affair participants, so I’m willing to call the man a scuzball adulterous cheater just like I’d call the woman a scuzball home-wrecking mistress. If it’s a man in a long-term sexual relationship with, or being financially supported by a married woman, I’d call the woman a scuzball adulterous cheater and the man a scuzball home-wrecking mistress. Works either way for me. But manipulating language to abolish particular terms or change the definition of certain words or phrases that might offend the guilty party is a woke progressive effort to normalize and condone that kind of behavior. It makes it appear that society is OK with that particular behavior and that any negative connotation is undeserved. It’s part of the woke progressive effort to fundamentally shift society’s morals and values. According to woke progressives, “mistress” is “archaic and sexist,” and extramarital affair participants don’t deserve negatively biased terms because they’re really just non-traditional relationships or relationships between consenting adults, and that’s all part of their “be yourself and do whatever makes you happy” ideology. And to woke progressives, none of that is negative in any way. In fact, if a particular individual morally disagrees with extramarital relationships or other types of so-called “non-traditional relationships,” they are also considered by woke progressives to be archaic, sexist, and bigoted for not condoning that behavior. And what’s more, when “silence is violence,” you aren’t even allowed to privately object to values and behaviors that the woke progressives condone. Rather, you must be actively and vocally involved in fightingthose values and behaviors. Otherwise, you’re no better (in the eye of the woke progressives) than those who openly oppose them. But like all woke progressive lunacy, where does it end?“Abuser” is negatively biased language as well, is presumably sexist because it is almost exclusively indicative of a man, and it might offend an abuser. So should we abolish use of the word and instead call them “extra-physical companions?”“Murderer” has a negative bias as well, and it’s presumably offensive to all the murderers who are serving lengthy sentences for their actions. So should we abolish use of the word and instead call them “friends who were present you when you were alive?”“Pedophile” has a negative connotation as well, and pedophiles might be offended by the negative bias that is attached to the term when they consider themselves to simply be in “non-traditional relationships.” So should we abolish use of the word and instead call them “minor companions?”Woke progressives are incredibly adept at language manipulation, and they wield it as a deadly weapon in the culture war. They are careful to package their language manipulation as “equality,” “empowerment,” or “progress,” hoping you’ll be distracted by the apparent potential of positive change, and won’t notice what it really is. Then they hold the public hostage by accusing you of “bigotry,” “racism,” or various “phobias” in order to strong-arm you into complying with their newly manipulated language rules. But the first defense against their weapon of language manipulation is recognizing it for exactly what it is. An effort to fundamentally shift the morals and values that shape our society.",1,Questionable,0.0835169294990723,0.4455286281179137,1439,1,Chicks on the Right

Leaked reports have shown Priti Patel's Home Office considered plans to process migrants off the UK mainland and also looked at floating walls to block asylum seekers crossing the Channel from Calais. Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, told MPs on Thursday that “all options were on the table”. But the plans were branded ""inhumane"" by Labour leader Keir Starmer, who said: ""This isn't creative thinking, this is lurching from one ridiculous proposition to the next.""Ex-civil servants and prominent lawyers toldThe Independentthe proposals were “unrealistic” and rooted in an attempt to “look tough” on the issue of immigration, when in fact they would do nothing to solve any problem – instead generating higher costs and more legal and moral issues for ministers. Dave Wood, who was head of immigration enforcement under Theresa May, said the idea of processing asylum seekers on a disused ferry or remote islands would be “illegal, impractical, expensive and illogical” – and born only out of ministers “trying to sound like they’ve got a very tough response” to the rise in Channel crossings. He said: “Once it’s been thought through I’m sure they wont implement it because as they think it through they’ll see it’s mad. More importantly, it doesn’t solve any of the problems they’re trying to solve. At the end of the day, what would it solve? Absolutely nothing.“It’s party politics and trying to sound tough to the public, but they can’t answer the important questions.""The former civil servant also said it was unlikely to deter people from coming to the UK to seek asylum: “Whether they think immigrants wont come here because they know they will be put on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, I don’t think that will wash. People will still come. Ultimately, many won’t be returned home.”Tony Gray, a former Border Force employee who left five years ago, said he believed the ideas indicated the “mindset of the government and the home secretary at the moment”.""They’ve made lots of promises and lots of tough statements about sending people back, but it’s very difficult for them to actually achieve that, and they knew that from the start.”Mr Gray added that some of the asylum seekers he saw arriving in Kent during his time with Border Force were “extremely vulnerable” and would not cope well in a far-flung centre: “Many of them have gone through incredibly a lot, from those who have been bombed out of their homes, to those forced out by armed groups.”According toThe Times, Number 10 is considering buying retired ferries and converting the vessels into processing centres to house asylum seekers off the UK coast, and also discussed moving migrants to decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea for processing, but the idea was rejected. TheGuardianreported that the government was considering sending asylum seekers could to detention centres in Papua New Guinea, Moldova, or Morocco, in a version of the Australian “offshore” model. It claimed leaked documents had revealed Downing Street had asked officials to look into the matter, but was met with “pushback” from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The ideas echo those floated by the Labour government in 2003, which included establishing a “protection zone” in a country such as Russia or Albania, and a potential processing centre in Tanzania, but were quickly concluded to be unfeasible. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and former senior civil servant of more than 20 years, was chief economist at the Cabinet Office when those ideas were floated.“The motivation for this now is the same as it was then,"" he said. ""The idea that we can somehow convince people that if they get here they’ll be shipped offshore and they’ll be in camps and their claims will probably be denied and they’ll be shipped back home.“And the objections then were the same as what you’ve seen now – which is on the humane side, the legal side and the practical and cost side. It’ll cost a lot, they’ll end up with a lot of legal challenges and many of the people will end up staying here anyway.""He said that in order to resolve the issue of large numbers of people in the asylum system, the government must invest more resources in processing asylum claims “quickly and humanely”, referring to the growing backlog in the waiting times for asylum decisions. Official figures show the number of asylum seekers waiting longer than half a year for their claim to be decided hit a record high this year after surging by 76 per cent in 12 months. Meanwhile, the number of people granted asylum reached its highest level in 16 years, with more than half of claimants granted protection at the initial decision stage, compared with only a third the previous year. Mr Portes added: “What’s the humanity in shipping people more than likely to be genuine asylum seekers off to some offshore processing centre where they may languish for years? This government has done some bizarre things so it’s not impossible. But would it actually achieve very much, probably not.""Immigration barrister Colin Yeo said the proposals were “very unrealistic” and were an attempt to confront a problem that was not really there.“There are huge practical obstacles to it, not just around the cost and logistics but the moral consequences on what happens when you detain people in that way in foreign countries,” he said.“The one idea that does seem potentially doable and is probably lawful is putting people on a ferry. But why would you do that? There aren’t that many of them. If you’re going to detain them, why not have them on-land?“Most of these people are genuine refugees, the numbers reaching the UK are much smaller than other EU countries, and the numbers are actually falling on previous years. The idea that you need extreme measures to deal with a problem that is not really a problem at all seems unreal.”Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, wrote a letter to the home secretary on Thursday saying the proposals seemed to be “both extremely inappropriate” in terms of the UK’s commitments to human rights and to asylum, and an “incredibly impractical and expensive” way of doing so. Adam Holloway, the Tory MP for Gravesham, said it was “completely right” for the Home Office to look at ways of deterring asylum seekers from coming to the UK, but called for any solution to be “civilised”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, he said: “Talk of oil rigs and Moldova and Papua New Guinea, to me, is somewhat bizarre. You're determined for me to say it is a great idea to put people on islands - I'm not saying that.”The Home Office is completely right to look at other options so there is some sort of deterrent, but not the Australian model where you have poor welfare standards and everything else. We've got to find a civilised version of that.”Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said the timing of the proposals was “remarkable” given that it came a day after the response to the Lessons Learned report was published, in which the Home Secretary spoke of building a better Home Office.“Australia’s offshore processing policies are absolutely not a system to be admired or emulated, they have received international condemnation because of the levels of human cruelty involved,” she added. Kate Allen, Amnesty international UK director, described the proposals as “entirely immoral and inhumane”, adding: “It is a dismal reflection upon Home Office Ministers that this idea to effectively exile people seeking asylum to far-flung and isolated places has been given any consideration at all.“For too long the Home Office has done its worst business behind closed doors, with little consideration of the needs, rights and welfare of women, men and children affected by it.”Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said the government’s speculative plans were “inhumane and morally bankrupt” and “steeped in racism”, adding that they would expose vulnerable people to “horrendous human rights abuse and trauma”The Home Office has been approached for comment.

Biden said July 2. ""As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today’s job news brought us something else to celebrate: This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs.""Biden went on to say, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.""Presidents’ claims about job creation on their watch can be troublesome. So how did Biden do?Biden was right on the numbers, we found, but he glossed over some important context. Theofficial government datashows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and June, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 145.8 million, or a gain of just over 3 million. In numerical terms, that’s a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.)The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs. Biden’s claim leaves out at least four important bits of context. A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by the starting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Biden scores well, but he’s not No. 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 2.2%, compared with Biden’s 2.1%. Put another way, if the gains from June can be replicated each month, it would take until February 2022 for all pre-pandemic jobs to be recovered (setting aside subsequent increases in population). Given the severity of the pandemic recession, that would be a significant bounceback — but it hasn’t happened yet. Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during a spiraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy. But the precise timing of their inauguration can play a big role in how a president’s first few months go, so Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples. That said, experts say that Biden does deserve some credit for the job gains on his watch, given the gains in coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief.

521,San Diego home price gains stall,0.0,44.67,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/real-estate/story/2020-11-18/san-diego-home-price-gains-stall,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,20,"San Diego County home prices in October did not increase from the previous month for the first time since May. The median home price for all homes — single-family, condos, townhouses — was $650,000, unchangedfrom last month, said CoreLogic data provided by DQNews on Wednesday. The price is still up a substantial 13 percent in a year, but marked a rare slowdown in price appreciation that has defied expectations throughout the pandemic. Many of the circumstances that experts say have driven up prices across the nation are still present: Record low mortgage rates, lack of home inventory and desire to own a home as many people are stuck working outside offices. Mark Goldman, a real estate analyst with C2 Financial Corp., said one month’s worth of data is probably nothing to write home about yet. He said the fundamentals of the housing market haven’t changed and are unlikely to stop the upward pressure on prices.“Most indicators of housing demand continue to remain strong,” he said, “so this one data point, which is something to be aware of and something to watch, is not necessarily a harbinger of the market turning.”Goldman said there are things that could push the home price up in the coming months, such as optimism about the future because of a COVID-19 vaccine or (depending on your political persuasion) a new president. However, he said fear from potential buyers that the economy may take a turn for the worse, or concern the housing market is at its high point, could lower prices. One factor that didn’t change in October was the lack of homes for sale in San Diego County — which experts point to as the primary reason for rising prices. There were 5,058 homes listed for sale in San Diego County from Sept. 28 to Oct. 25, said theRedfin data center. That is down from 7,651 around the same time last year and 9,312 in 2018. Real estate agent Gary Kent said news of a vaccine, and its potential widespread distribution could mean sellers who are on the fence could put homes on the market and increase inventory. He said he has spoken with potential clients over the past few months who were waiting because of the virus. Kent said increased supply could mean there is less upward pressure on prices, but he — similar to many housing experts — was hesitant to say that prices could actually decrease. But, it might make the process of buying a little easier.“I don’t at all see some massive price drop,” he said, “but people might say, ‘I don’t have to make an offer the first day over list price and maybe I could negotiate a bit.’”Despite the overall median price stalling, the main part of the San Diego market hit a new high. The resale single-family home median hit $730,000 in October, its highest ever and up from $715,000 in September and August. The resale condo price fell $10,000 from its peak in September to $475,000. The newly built home median was $726,000, down from the record $812,500 in October 2018 when there was an increase in luxury, single-family homes for sale. There were 4,292 home sales in October, roughly the same level it has been for four months. It is a stark contrast to April when there 2,327 sales, its lowest in years, and was the result of homes being pulled off the market as the pandemic began. Interest rates have never been lower, but it doesn’t necessarily mean homes are cheaper. In October, the interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 2.83 percent, saidFreddie Mac, down from 3.69 percent the year before. That means the monthly cost of a median-priced home now would be around $2,430 a month, assuming 20 percent down on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan and including property taxes and home insurance. That is up slightly from roughly $2,390 a month for a median home at last year’s prices and interest rates. However, that scenario would require a roughly $130,000 down payment, compared to $114,600 a year earlier. Across the six-county Southern California region, the median home price was down 0.8 percent. Orange County had the biggest monthly increase, 1.3 percent, to a median of $795,000. It was followed by San Bernardino County up 1 percent for a median of $400,000, and Los Angeles County up 0.7 percent to a median of $715,000. Ventura County was down 1.5 percent for a median of $655,000, and Riverside County was down 0.6 percent for a median of $445,500.",3,Reliable,0.0202932308156188,0.3921728478818028,1011,3,San Diego Union-Tribune
522,"Pilots, maintainers are worn out and under-trained, aviation safety commission says",3.67,41.33,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/12/03/pilots-maintainers-are-worn-out-and-under-trained-aviation-safety-commission-says/,https://adfontesmedia.com/military-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-03,18,"A group of aviation experts tasked with getting to the bottom of a surge in deadly military aviation accidents during the last decade came back with its report on Thursday, and there’s a lot that needs fixing. A confluence of cultural issues, budget shortfalls and a lack of oversight have contributed to a general malaise, according to the report, as well as a rash of deadly and costly mishaps from 2013 to 2018: 198 deaths, 157 aircraft destroyed and $9.41 billion lost. Despite finding passionate professionals on flight lines around the world, the heads of the National Commission on Military Aviation Safety told reporters, a lack of flight hours, a stressed supply chain, high operational tempo and administrative distractions have left the community in a bit of disrepair.“What we found was that morale was generally degraded,” Dick Healing, a retired Coast Guard pilot and vice chairman of NCMAS, told reporters in the morning, before he was due to brief theresults of the commission’s investigationto members of the House Armed Services Committee. That period dovetails seamlessly with congressionally-imposed budget sequestration that began in 2013 and was carried on by delayed proper budgets in the following years, but the commission did not blame it entirely on money. Mandated by the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, NCMAS stood up afterMilitary Times investigationfound that deadly mishaps rose 40 percent from 2013 to 2018What’s going wrong?Despite recovering that funding, the commission found that aviation units are still not getting enough flight hours, maintenance time and proper parts to keep everything running safely and smoothly, which is a likely contributor to accidents. About 43 percent of mishaps are caused by human error, he explained, generally because someone didn’t follow procedure to the letter, or properly coordinate with the other aircrew or those on the ground. Another 38 percent were due to environmental factors, like weather and visibility. The remaining 19 percent were split among organization issues ― among those, worn out parts or lack of proper manning ― and supervision issues, which include superiors making bad judgment calls or not enforcing policies. Generally, human error is prevented by proficiency ― for example, pilots and aircrew with so much recent experience that they are operating on instinct and able to troubleshoot problems with ease. But troops told the NCMAS members they, in many cases, they weren’t getting enough flight hours. In the past, the issue had been budget cuts slashing the amount of time they could afford to be in the air. Now, according to retired Army Gen. Dick Cody, NCMAS chairman it’s more an issue of prioritizing. Some young pilots are coming out of schoolhouses that lean heavily on hours in a simulator. That’s great for practicing emergency procedures, he said, but not for gaining proficiency in the aircraft. So in order to get them up to speed, their first units of assignment are spending flight hours closing that gap, rather than spreading them more evenly up through more experienced pilots. And that, in turn, is resulting in more waivers, or units making exceptions for pilots assigned to missions who are about to fall out of balance with the required number of flight hours they need every 60 days.“We shouldn’t have pilots being tasked to do missions that have been waivered,” Cody said, adding that there have been “way too many accidents right on the 60-day current limit, and they’re out there flying a mission.”While mishaps in general were down in 2019, the Navy and Marine Corps saw individual increases, including a 30-percent increase in the Corps. The commission isn’t sure what caused that spike, Cody said, adding that the service is, anecdotally, “about as a stressed as any of the services that we saw” during their visits to 200 units across 80 installations over the past year and a half.“We didn’t seen any new [types of] accidents,”he added, explaining that the most common causes of mishaps have largely remained the same. But he did call out the physical conditions of the Marine Corps aviation community, which has been seen astaking a backseatto its other organizations.“And some of their facilities were not facilities that we would want young Americans maintaining multi-million dollar aircraft [in],” Cody said. How to fix the problemWhile the report calls for cultural change and budget predictability, two factors that can’t be remedied with the snap of a finger, it does lay out several institutional changes that can happen right away. Cody’s top recommendation is to start tracking those flight waivers, so that the services know just how common it is for borderline-current pilots to get in the cockpit and those trends can be traced. Along those same lines, Healing made a plug to create a joint safety council within the defense secretary’s office, reporting directly to the deputy defense secretary, as an authority to centrally track aviation trends, factors and data that can be fed directly to high-level policy and funding decisions. Such a council “basically gives them the information they need in order to make decisions that can seriously impact aviation safety,” Healing said. Other remedies will require institutional motivation. The report focuses heavily on the grinding combination of being overworked, untrained and under-incentivized. The commission recommends increasing the ceiling on pilot retention bonuses to $100,000 per year. It also recommends boosting manning levels of administrative personnel in aviation units, so that pilots and maintainers don’t get sucked into doing paperwork rather than focusing on their intricate skill sets, which they have reported as a problem. OPTEMPO a lingering issueBut the last part of the equation might be more difficult to tackle, as combatant commanders continue to request forces. The relentless demand for aviation units to support operations around the world, as they’re becoming more and more strained, is a recipe for disaster, both in safety but also retention of pilots and maintainers. For example, carrier air wing deployments have stretched from the long-standing six-month underway to nine months or beyond ― and in the case of the aircraft carriers Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, having only a few months at home before heading out again. In the Army, downsized aviation brigades are doing back-to-back rotations in Korea and Europe. Doing the same amount, or more with less ― fewer aircraft, fewer personnel, fewer parts ― has become part of the culture.“And they always say, ‘Will do,’ "" Healing said. “People need to understand that there may be a time when they need to say ‘no.’ ""Meghann Myers is the Pentagon bureau chief at Military Times.

523,Pensions for local public safety employees are skyrocketing,5.0,37.67,https://capitolweekly.net/pensions-for-local-public-safety-employees-are-skyrocketing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-11,15,"Growing public pension deficits have plagued our nation for years, but in the midst of some of the harshest fiscal blows from the pandemic, this problem is something we can no longer ignore. While California champions itself as a leader of positive change in the United States, we also happen to be the leader in skyrocketing pension obligations. And there are no signs of this unsustainable pattern slowing down. In 2018, Transparent California found that the average pension for city or county public safety employees was $108,000 a year. According to CalPERS, that retirement benefit of $108,000 at age 50 is worth $1,673,000 invested in a private single-life annuity, and somewhat higher with survivor benefits (which most safety workers choose). With this exorbitant retirement pay, it’s no wonder that eachCalifornia household is on the hook for $81,634. Although many tax measures for fire funding are successful, voters in some of the most liberal parts of the state have started to push back and vote against them. To add to the enormity of this problem, consider that there are more retired firefighters than active firefighters in this state. Even slashing beneficial community programs is not enough to meet the union promises made to these workers. As a result, many unions have turned to tax increases as a potential solution. Although many tax measures for fire funding are successful, voters in some of the most liberal parts of the state have started to push back and vote against them. In fact, a½ sales tax pushed by the fire unions, despite threats of extended response times, was recently voted down in Sonoma County. In the face of this opposition, union leaders are finding other ways to drum up a steady cashflow, whether it’s through afirst responder feeor taking over ambulance services from private industry veterans. For years, California localities have relied on private emergency ambulance companies to provide quality, efficient emergency services. And to combat inequity in access to ambulance services, the state moved primarily to countywide-run ambulance systems overseen by the County EMS Agency. This mix of public and private collaboration has been conducted successfully for over 50 years, until now. Arecent studyby Reason Foundation identified fire departments in California that have recently been pursuing, and in some regions established, what is called an “Alliance Model,” in which the fire department is given, “the decision-making power of a full EMS agency, but without the oversight of an EMS agency.” This means they are getting all of the responsibility without any accountability—and while the fire departments may reap a short-term windfall from collecting ambulance fees, they are only adding to their long-term pension obligation. The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations. A proposed state law –Assembly Bill 389– would codify the Alliance model and make all of its anti-competitive antics legal. Ultimately, the Alliance model puts the fire department’s interests before the taxpayer or patient. This backwards model came to fruition in Contra Costa County in 2016, and even after rejection from the Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA), the county still moved forward with implementation. Not only does this model result in reduced industry competition, but it also diminishes quality of care and response times for patients. Despite these concerning outcomes, the cities of Chula Vista and Oxnard are now in the process of reviewing possible implementation in their own localities. Models like these are designed to cut corners to benefit the bottom line, not to prioritize the individual relying on emergency services for help. This is also reflected in fire departments that seek to take over ambulance services in what is called an “Ambulance Operator Programs.”Because public agencies must provide the same expensive pension benefits and early retirements to their EMTs as they offer to other workers, in fire department run Ambulance Operator Program, EMT positions have to be filled with inexperienced workers at lower wages. Governments will have a monopoly, residents and their insurance companies will likely pay more for ambulance services, and our communities will be served by less senior EMTs and paramedics. All so that the public employees may continue padding their retirement funds. The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations, and the only solution their unions can seem to come up with is attacking the private ambulance providers who have loyally served Californians for generations. Contracting these services back to the government to clean up their own mess is just wrong. Taxpayers want the best services for the lowest cost, and it’s clear that private ambulance providers are the only option that satisfies that need. Californians deserve better.

Democrats went into the election targeting half a dozen or more Republican incumbents, needing only to pick up three seats. Former astronautMark Kellyin Arizona and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooperin Colorado took big early leads on election night, when it looked like that script might play out. But then key Republican incumbents held off their Democratic challengers—Sens. Joni Ernstin Iowa,Lindsey Grahamin South Carolina,Susan Collinsin Maine, and most likelyThom Tillisin North Carolina andDan Sullivanin Alaska. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. While there were still technically pathways for Democrats to pick up a couple of seats, they appeared late Wednesday to be long shots at best, leaving some climate activists distraught.“I have a really dreadful feeling about this election,” said Khadija Khokhar, an organizer for Zero Hour, a youth-led climate and justice organization. “There is so much work to do.”There was a lot at stake for the climate and the economy in an election year that produced record-setting hurricane and wildfire seasons. Across the West, energy and climate change was a leading issue for many voters. They lived through drought, heat waves and forest fires this summer. Some of them fretted over declines in the energy industry and the potential cost of clean energy. Democrats will still control the House of Representatives, where they are likely to continue to press for action on climate change. Expertshave said that in a Republican-controlled Senate, there still could be some less ambitious climate legislation. But Republicans have not so far put forward any comprehensive climate plans.“None of the Republican programs we have seen would get you anywhere near the emissions reductions required, given the science around climate change,” said David Konisky, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. Scientistshave said that to keep global temperatures from rising beyond acceptable limits, there’s a global need to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Perhaps the most telling upset that never happened was in Kentucky, where Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnellkept his job, despite a fossil fuels agenda, his defense of Trump’s anti-science and deregulatory policies and no plan for climate change. McConnell, 78, was rewarded with a seventh term by soundly defeating Democrat Amy McGrath, despite her $80 million warchest.“I am glad they decided our arguments were better than hers,” he said Wednesday. Anticipating the Senate race outcomes would go Republicans’ way, he said, “If my math is correct, I will still be the offensive coordinator.”The current Republican majority is 53. For Democrats to secure a 51-vote majority, they would have needed a net gain of three Republican seats plus a tie-breaking vote by a Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris, assuming a win by former Vice President Joe Biden in the presidential race. If President Trump wins, the Democrats would need to net four seats previously held by Republicans. But, by Wednesday evening, Democrats watched nearly all their hopes slip away. Sen. David Perdue’s continued to comfortably lead DemocraticchallengerJon Ossoff with 50.3 percent of the vote as the final ballots were being counted in Georgia, thus potentially avoiding a Jan. 5 runoff election. In the race for Georgia’s other Senate seat, Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock led a crowded field in a special election and will face incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a Jan. 5 runoff, since neither collected more than 50 percent of the vote. Loeffler was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to fill the seat vacated late last year by Johnny Isakson. Warnock, a vocal environmental and climate justice advocate, received considerably fewer votes than Loeffler and her main challenger, Republican Rep. Doug Collins, illustrating the challenge Warnock will face in January. The widely respected Cook Political Report said Democrats’ “razor-thin hopes” of regaining control of the Senate would hinge on Georgia runoffs in January if the Perdue-Ossoff race also requires a runoff—and then Democrats would have to defeat both GOP incumbents, Perdue and Loeffler. Going into Tuesday’s election, climate voters revelled in the likelihood that a national climate policy might finally be on the near horizon as pollsters projected that Democrats had a good chance of winning the Senate majority and positioning Congress to reduce carbon emissions and advance clean energy. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website had given Democrats a 78 percent chance of flipping the Senate. And the Cook Report had concluded that Democrats were the clear favorites to take back the Senate with just days to go until Election Day. But on Wednesday, the Cook report had a new analysis. It called the outlook for Warnock “ominous” in the runoff, while noting the Democrats’ failures in “multiple avenues of flipping the Senate” and that, “in all likelihood,” Republicans would hold on. “In races that Democrats were bullish on and even Republicans sounded very wary about holding in the final days, everything came up red.”Republicans went on a roll. In Iowa, Ernst, who hashada significant relationship with Big Oil, survived an embarrassing moment during a debate with Democrat Theresa Greenfield, where Ernst failed to know the break-even price of soybeans. In Maine, Collins, who has the strongest voting record on climate among Senate Republicans, won a fifth term by defeating Democrat Sara Gideon in what the Portland Press Heralddescribedas “an intensely negative contest.”Big environmental groups like the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters that hadabandonedCollins for Gideon now find themselves in the position of having to rebuild their bridges with her. Republicans also took back the Senate seat in Alabama held by Doug Jones, with a victory by a former football coach, Tommy Tuberville, whoarguedthat only God can control the climate. And one of most closely watched and expensive Senate races was inSouth Carolina, where Graham, a self-styled climate champion with little to show for his rhetoric, defeated a well-funded Jaime Harrison, a Democrat who had set fundraising records.“To those who have been following this race, I hope you got the message,” Graham said during his victory speech. “If you don’t get this message, it’s hopeless. The message I got: people like what I am doing and I am going to keep doing it. I am going back to the Senate with a purpose.”Part of that purpose, he said, was to “do everything I can to stop the radical agenda coming from Nancy Pelosi’s House.”Coming into the race, most scenarios for Democrats taking back the Senate started with Hickenlooper beating Sen. Cory Gardner and Kelly, a retired astronaut married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, defeating Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. They were able to do that. During his campaign this year, Hickenlooper—who some progressives had dubbed “Frackenlooper”—managed to transform his reputation as a fossil fuel-industry supporter into a candidate pledging to fight climate change. Gardner had sought to dodge the anti-climate label applied to the GOP.“From start to finish, the race for the Senate in Colorado has been about public lands and addressing climate change,” said Gene Karpinski, president of the national environment-focused political action committee, the League of Conservation Voters. Hickenlooper was also endorsed by the Protect Our Winters Action Fund, a climate action group led by outdoor athletes, which noted that “Colorado’s winter sports tourism economy is in harm’s way due to climate change.” The fund also backed Kelly, noting that he “has spoken favorably of a carbon tax.”In Arizona, Kelly told voters during the campaign how his views on climate and the environment were shaped by his experiences in space. He pledged to use science and data as tools to help tackle climate change and facilitate Arizona’s transition to renewable energy. In Montana, a tight race went to incumbent Republican U. S. Sen. Steve Daines, who fought off a challenge by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock in an intense battle that left many Montanans eager for the campaign season to end. In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves said national political pundits and pollsters that had forecast a good night for Democrats got it wrong once again in the race between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, a charismatic Black candidate and former Agriculture Secretary.“We are going to elect someone who is going back to Washington and still be in the majority,” Reeves said at a victory celebration for Hyde-Smith, who easily defeated Espy by 13 percentage points.“It was the Second Amendment that was on the ballot tonight,” said Hyde-Smith, who had tied her fortunes to Trump’s agenda and supported production of Mississippi’s and the nation’s energy resources, including biofuels. “It was socialism that was on the ballot.”James Bruggers covers the U.

Opening the hearing was the chairman of the committee, Representative Jerry Nadler (D-NY) who immediately used his opening statement as a slam down to establish the reasons the House felt the need to call the attorney general in for a reckoning over the abuses of his office that Barr has presided over. And in the opposing corner on behalf of Barr’s Trump-supporting Republican contingent, was the lightweight from Ohio, Congressman Jim Jordan, the man who gave up his career as a sexual-abuse-ignoring college wrestling coach to tackle the libs in Washington DC, eschewing a suit jacket at every opportunity for a tussle. Nadler’s opening statement immediately let the participants know that this was going to be a serious match. He began with a searing indictment of the Barr Justice Department that took no prisoners.“Congress established the Department of Justice to enforce the nation’s first civil rights laws after the Civil War,” Nadler began. “From that moment on, it became the department’s responsibility to ensure the right to vote and to stem the tide of systemic racism. Now, not every attorney general in the intervening 150 years has given full expression to these two goals. I am certain that every administration has fallen short of those promises in some way overtime.”“But today, under your leadership, sir, these two objectives are more at risk than at any time in modern history,” Nadler continued. “Your tenure has been marked by a persistent war against the department’s professional core in an apparent attempt to secure favors for the president. Others have lost sight of the importance of civil rights laws, but now we see the full force of the federal government brought to bear against citizens demonstrating for the advancement of their own civil rights. There is no precedent for the Department of Justice to actively seek out conflict with American citizens under such flimsy pretext or for such petty purposes.”“We are as a nation witnessing the federal government turn violently on its own people, and although responsibility for the government’s failure to protect the health, safety and constitutional rights of the American people belongs squarely to President Trump, he could not have done this alone,” Nadler pointedly said. “He needed help. After he finished utterly humiliating his first attorney general, he found you. In your time at the department, you have aided and abetted the worst failing of the president.”“This administration has twisted the Department of Justice into a shadow of its former self, capable of serving most Americans only after it has first served those in power,” Nadler concluded his opening statement. “This committee has responsibility to protect Americans from that kind of corruption, Mr. Barr.”The glove was thrown, but before Barr could respond to Nadler’s stinging assessment of his tenure, an opening statement from the ranking GOP member of the committee, Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH) was on the agenda. It’s difficult to describe Jordan’s speaking style — which resembles the tone and volume of a Marine drill sergeant intimidating a new recruit for a major infraction of military rules — as anything other than deranged and angry. Rather than focus on Nadler’s stated purpose for the Barr testimony, Jordan immediately attempted to change the focus of the hearings to one of his favorite topics as a self-appointed attack dog for the Trump administration — the same disproved conspiratorial notion that Trump was a victim of Democratic “spying” rather than an active collaborator with Russia and other foreign powers to help him with the 2016 election. You can watch Jordan’s bravura performance as an outraged congressman railing against perceived injustices in the video clip below, but be aware that the supposed “obliteration” that the GOP Rapid Response Director who posted the clip refers to only takes place in the minds of those who have imbibed of the Trump Kool-Aid to displace the unthinkable reality of the president’s treason in their consciousnesses.

But Farhadian Weinstein says the concerns are moot.“We’re quite constrained, as prosecutors, not to go in and prejudge anything and to casually talk about legal arguments,” Farhadian Weinstein, 45, told the Forward following a campaign event on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. “It just wouldn’t be right for me to spitball anything about it. This is part of what it means to be a good, well-trained and ethical prosecutor.”Farhadian Weinstein, who is Jewish, is a former federal prosecutor and one of eight candidates running in the June 22 Democratic primary to succeed Cyrus Vance, Jr., who is retiring at the end of year. She has the backing of Democratic Reps. Ritchie Torres, Nydia Velázquez and Adriano Espaillat, among other local politicians. Jennifer Blatus, a spokeswoman for Farhadian Weinstein, suggested that her willingness to be considered for a judgeship during Trump’s years in office should be seen in a positive light. “I think that it would have been good to see a pro-immigrant, pro-choice judge at a time of a chaotic state of affairs at the begining on the Trump administraiton,” she said. Blatus added that if selected as judge, Farhadian Weinstein would be guided by the U. S. Constitution and “not serve at the pleasure of the president.”On Wednesday, Farhadian Weinstein held a rally to condemn the recent rise in violent anti-Asian and antisemitic attacks across the city. She was four years old when she and her parents fled Iranout of fear of persecution during the 1979 revolution. Tali Farhadian Weinstein, candidate for Manhattan district attorney, stands with faith leaders, community leaders and advocates to rally against Antisemitism and Anti-Asian hate on the Lower East Side. Image by Courtesy“I’m an immigrant. I’m a parent. I’m a prosecutor, I’m a professor. I’m a proven criminal justice reformer, and I’m a candidate for district attorney, and I’m here today for all of those reasons,“ said Farhadian Weinstein, flanked by faith leaders and community activists, including her father Nasser Dan Farhadian,“What has occurred over this past year is horrific and unacceptable,” she continued, “and I am here to state unequivocally that antisemitism and hate have no place in New York.”Last year, Farhadian Weinstein, as a member of the New York State Bar Association’s task force on hate crimes and domestic terrorism,released a number of legislative and other reform proposals to address acts of hate. Farhadian Weinstein said in an interview that it’s important to “cut through the confusion” around the recent violent attacks against Jews in New York, Los Angeles and other American cities last month in the wake of the conflict in the Middle East. “We have to say that when you attack somebody because of who they are, that is a hate crime,” she explained. “Even just cutting out all that noise, clarifying those underlying prejudices and standing up against it, is really important because then the call to action follows through.”Jacob Kornbluh is the Forward’s senior political reporter.

Reagan Stevens, 45, a deputy director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice busted in April 2018 on charges of possessing a handgun, had all the charges against her dismissed and won a $100,000 settlement last month in a lawsuit over her arrest, the Daily News has learned. Stevens — a single mother of an adult daughter — said she’s happy to leave the humiliating episode in her past.“I just feel fortunate that it’s behind me, and that my daughter and I are both working and well, and can look forward,” Stevens told The News on Friday.“I don’t [have any resentment] because I do really think everything happens for a reason and I just want to move on with my life. I really believe that holding resentments would hurt me ultimately.”Stevens wasarrested after cops said they found a gun in a car in which she was riding with two men in Queens. Her arrest was prominently played in the news media. Stevens went from deputy director of the Office of Criminal Justice — where she worked onimplementing a law to raise the age at which juvenile suspects are treated as adultsin courtrooms — to jobless and without insurance. Her troubles began in Queens, as she rode in the back seat of a 2002 Infiniti that also carried two men on her way to play basketball. When the men, Ceasar Forbes and Montel Hughes, stopped for cigarettes on 106th Ave. near 177th St. in Jamaica, cops approached the car and began searching it. Shortly before the stop — at about 10:20 p.m. — a nearby NYPD ShotSpotter microphone system had picked up the sound of five gunshots, cops said at the time. During their search of the car, officers found a 9mm handgun in a green velvet bag in the glove compartment, as well as a spent shell casing by Stevens’ feet. Cops arrested Forbes, Hughes and Stevens when none of them admitted the gun was theirs, according to a criminal complaint. But Stevens denied the two officers asked her any questions about the weapon and said she didn’t know of the gun’s presence until the charges in the case were read to her in Queens Criminal Court.“I did not know about the gun being in the car,” Stevens said Friday. By that time, the news media had caught wind of the arrest, and Stevens found out from news stories that she was suspended without pay or benefits from her city job, she told The News. A month after her arrest, Stevens gave a DNA sample, which didn’t match DNA on the gun, according to her lawsuit.“There wasn’t any evidence tying her to the gun so the charges were all dismissed,” a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case told The News. Finally, in November 2018 — after Stevens had spent seven months trying to pick up the pieces of her life — the case was dismissed and sealed, according to a certificate of disposition viewed by The News. In December 2018, Stevens sued the NYPD officers on the case in Brooklyn Supreme Court for false arrest and illegal stop and frisk. One of the arresting officers in Stevens’ case, Justin Ellis — a defendant in Stevens’ lawsuit — subsequently lost hisgun and shield after getting arrested in 2020 for shooting his wife’s physical traineroutside the cop’s Seaford home during a fight. Ellis’ criminal case is still pending and his lawyer confirmed he is still a member of the NYPD. Stevens is now working as a temp in a group home for young mothers.“My client is thrilled she was vindicated of all charges and can finally put this event behind her,” said Cary London, Stevens’ lawyer.",3,Reliable,-0.0346689895470383,0.4030197444831591,806,3,New York Daily News
530,Joe Biden increases vaccine target to 1.5m a day even though it was achieved on inauguration day,-0.67,45.67,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9186141/Joe-Biden-increases-vaccine-target-1-5m-day-achieved-inauguration-day.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-25,25,"Joe Biden said he believed that the U. S. will be able to offer vaccines to every American who wants one 'in spring,' Monday, amid questions over how ambitious his rollout for the shots is. He also increased his goal of 1 million vaccines a day to 1.5 million Monday, predicting his administration would reach that point 'soon' - even though it had been surpassed already on the day he was inaugurated. And the president also predicted that the U. S. would be 'well on our way' to herd immunity by the summer, but warned that Americans will be dealing with the coronavirus pandemic into the fall. Setting a target of meeting demand for the vaccine would suggest offering enough doses for 200 million people, 60% of the population this spring - which officially ends on June 20. That would be a pace of at least 1.2 million doses a day between now and June 20 on the basis of one dose per person, while if those 200 million were to be fully immunized, it would take an average of 2.4 million doses a day. So far the US has administered 22.4 million vaccine doses, which is 54 percent of the 41.4 million shots distributed to states by the federal government. Currently 6.8 percent of the US population has been vaccinated. The seven-day rolling average for daily vaccinations nationwide is currently at 1.2 million and a record 1.6 million doses were distributed on Biden's inauguration. Despite the sluggish start, the number of shots being handed out nationwide has only been increasing since the rollout began in mid-December under Trump's administration. Since January 1, the rolling average of vaccine doses per day has quadrupled. Biden identified spring as the season when everyone who wants a vaccine would get one – after his press secretary dodged the question hours earlier.'I think it will be this spring. I think we'll be able to do that this spring,' he continued. 'But it's going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in this country. But I think we can do that.'Spring official begins on March 20 and ends June 20. Polling which suggests between 55% and 60% of people want vaccinated would mean that Asked if his initial target of 100 million doses in 100 days was not ambitious enough Biden said: 'So I'm quite confident that we will be in a position within the next three weeks or so to be vaccinating people at the range of a million a day or in excess of that.'I promised we would get at least 100 million vaccinations. That's not people. sometimes you need more than one shot, the vaccination.'I think with the grace of God, the good will of the neighbor and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day rather than 1 million a day,' Biden said. Vaccine promise: Joe Biden upped the target for vaccines to 1.5 million a day 'soon' amid questions over whether his incoming administration was lacking ambition, given 1.6m were distributed on the day of his inauguration The seven-day rolling average for daily vaccinations nationwide is currently at 1.2 million. More than 1 million COVID-19 vaccine shots have been handed out daily in US since Biden's inaugurationCOVID-19 hospitalizations have now fallen to the lowest levels since mid-December and states have reported a sharp drop in new cases and deaths So far the US has administered 22.4 million vaccine doses. Pictured is a vaccine clinic in Seattle, Washington on Sunday at the Amazon Meeting Center So far the US has administered 22.4 million vaccine doses, which is 54 percent of the 41.4 million shots distributed to states by the federal government. Currently 6.8 percent of the population has been vaccinated The White House on Monday admitted that it has no idea how many COVID vaccines there are in the country. Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked at the daily briefing if the new team at least had a ball park idea of how many doses there were in the country that have not yet been given out. She responded: 'We’ve been here for five days to evaluate the supply so that we can release the maximum amount while also ensuring that everyone can get the second dose on the FDA recommended schedule.'So the confusion around this issue, which we acknowledge, there is some confusion, it speaks to a larger problem, which is what we’re inheriting from the prior administration, which is much worse than we could have imagined.'America has only given 6 percent of its population their first COVID-19 vaccine and 0.9 percent have had both shots. The woefully slow roll-out has been labored with problems since the start with states left to handle their own distribution amid staff shortages, and while other countries storm ahead in dishing it out. President Biden has given the ambitious target of giving 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days in office. So far, he's on track with more than 1 million a day going out. But with more than 328 million in the US - including an unknown number who may not sign up to get it even when it becomes available - there are a number of issues that need to be addressed,One huge problem is that the states say they are running out of doses, while the CDC's data suggests they still have millions. Another is that in certain states, some people can get access to it before others; New Jersey and Pennsylvania, for example, are allowing smokers of any age to get the vaccine without having to put up any proof that they actually smoke. Another problem is that people are not showing up for appointments which puts the supply of dose at risk. The vaccines have a short window to be used in - once defrosted and opened, they have to go in someone's arm within six hours. Anecdotes have started emerging of young, healthy people being randomly offered extra doses in pharmacies because the person who was meant to receive it didn't show up. There are also stories of people in the eligible categories being unable to nail down an appointment for their first dose.'I feel confident that by summer we're going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity and increasing the access for people who aren't on the list, all the way going down to children and how we deal with that. But I feel good about where we're going.'But he tempered his increased expectations with words of warning, noting it's still 'gonna take a long time to beat it.''We're in this for a while,' Biden said, repeating his prediction deaths would go up to between 600,000 and 660,000. They are currently over 410,000. His words come after his CDC director warned that the administration's goal of 100 million shots in 100 days may be hindered by the supplies of vaccine doses, and the White House press secretary suggested that officials are unclear on exactly how much vaccine supply there is.'I think that the supply is probably going to be the most limiting constraint early on, and we're really hoping that after that first 100 days, we'll have much more production,' Rochelle Walensky, the the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on 'Fox News Sunday.''We're really hoping we'll have more vaccine and that will increase the pace at which we can do the vaccinations,' she said. Biden said as more people got vaccines the death rate would go down.'It's beginning to move. But I'm confident we will beat this. We will beat this but we're still going to be talking about this in the summer. We're still going to be dealing with this issue in the early fall,' he said. On Saturday, the United States reported more than 1.3 million newly administered doses of the COVID vaccine, and the tally was more than 1.1 million by late Sunday afternoon, marking the sixth day in a row the country has topped 1 million daily doses. Biden also repeated his mantra that people should wear face masks.'If we wear masks between now and the end of April, the experts tell us we can save 50,000 lives - 50,000 people who otherwise would die,' he noted. It comes as COVID-19 hospitalizations fell to the lowest levels since mid-December and states reported a sharp drop in new cases and deaths. On Sunday, there were 1,769 deaths and 130,485 new cases recorded. Just over 110,000 people were hospitalized with the virus. Even as he repeated his call to 'shut down' the virus, Biden talked about boosting testing to reopen schools with kindergarten through eighth grade safely.'I believe we should make school classrooms safe and secure for the students, for the teachers and for the help that's in those schools maintaining those facilities,' Biden said. His COVID relief plan is calling for new resources to disinfect schools and get them back open, in addition to demanding much more widespread testing.'We need new ventilation systems in those schools. We need testing for people coming in and out of the classes. We need testing for teachers as well as students and we need the capacity, the capacity to know that in fact, the circumstance in the school is safe and secure for everyone,' he said. He has ordered cabinet agencies to develop guidance for reopening schools. 'There's no reason why the clear guidance will be that every school should be thoroughly sanitized – from the lavatories to the hallways,' he said. He also pushed back on the idea that teachers or teachers' unions don't want to reopen, although some school systems have featured tensions between parents and teachers concerned about risk of exposure.'It's not so much about the idea teachers aren't going to work. The teachers I know, they want to work,' said Biden. 'They just want to work at a safe environment and as safe as we can rationally make it,' he said.'And we can do that. We should be able to open up every school kindergarten through eighth grade if, in fact, we administer these tests.'Biden's acknowledgment of the need to ramp up the vaccine target comes after Dr Anthony Fauci, who is Biden's top COVID-19 adviser, has also said it was 'floor not ceiling' goal. To assist with the rollout, Google has just announced that it will offer up some of its US offices, car parks and open spaces as vaccination centers. Google will also add COVID-19 vaccine location information to both Maps and Search to help people find more information on where and when they can get a jab. The tech giant's four main offices in the US - in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Kirkland, Washington and New York City - will be turned into vaccine hubs in collaboration with healthcare provider One Medical. The office spaces are currently empty given Google's employees are working remotely until at least July.'Today we're announcing that we're providing more than $150 million to promote vaccine education and equitable distribution and making it easier to find locally relevant information, including when and where to get the vaccine,' Google CEO Sundar Pichai said.'We'll also be opening up Google spaces to serve as vaccination sites as needed.'He said searches for 'vaccines near me' has increased five-fold since the start of the year. As a result the tech giant is adding COVID-19 vaccine locations to both its traditional Search feature and Maps.'We'll include details like whether an appointment or referral is required, if access is limited to specific groups, or if it has a drive-through,' Pichai said.

His warning comes just days after he went against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and said it wasn't more deadly. Johnson said at a press briefing in London on Friday that the new strain was between 30 and 40 percent more deadly but he offered no data to back-up the frightening statistic. Afterwards, the global science community - including Dr. Fauci - rushed to urge caution against what he'd said and insist that while the variant was more infectious, it was not necessarily more deadly. Many have accused politicians of scaremongering and point to the fact that cases and deaths are going down in both the UK and the US. There are also more than 160 cases of the UK variant in the US across more than 20 states. Dr. Fauci said on Monday it was causing more serious infection in people - which means it is more deadly - but he did not say how much more deadlyFauci's remarks on Monday are a marked shift away from that. There are more than 160 known cases of the UK variant in 21 states across the US including 40 in California, 46 in Florida and 16 in the state of New York. The South African variant has not yet been detected in the US, nor has another variant from Brazil. All three are thought to be more infectious. While the British strain is also feared to be more deadly, the South African and Brazilian strains are feared to make vaccines less effective. The Brazilian strain is also feared to be causing re-infection but that has not yet been proven. It comes amid an agonizingly slow roll-out of vaccines across the world. The UK and US - which were among the first to approve the vaccines - are behind Israel, the UAE and Bahrain in vaccinating their populations. President Joe Biden is imposing a travel ban from South Africa to try to stunt the flow of that variant and British officials are considering a 14-week, mandatory hotel quarantine for anyone who enters the country. Fauci on Monday also said the US might need to 'upgrade' its vaccines to work against the South African variant - but then insisted the vaccines are still effective against it and that it only makes them less effective by a 'very slight' amount. Fauci did not reveal what data he had seen that proved the British variant was more deadly, but that he was 'pretty convinced' by the numbers. Google will start immediately showing vaccine hub locations in Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas and will gradually expand to include more states and countries.'We'll begin showing state and regional distribution information on Search so people can easily find when they are eligible to receive a vaccine,' he said. It comes after Biden signed a series of executive orders last week, including some that target vaccine distribution. He plans to partner with state and local governments to establish vaccination spots in conference centers, stadiums and gymnasiums. The new administration will also deploy thousands of clinical staff from federal agencies, military medical personnel and pharmacy chains to increase vaccinations, and make teachers and grocery clerks eligible.

It's not going to be easy to do that,' he said.'We've got to vaccinate as many people as we possibly can as quickly as we possibly can.'The data shows that no state has over 600 people per million hospitalized with COVID-19 - the first time this has happened since November 3rdMeanwhile, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the 100 day goal was just the first step in Biden's vaccine rollout plan.'One-hundred million shots is a bold, ambitious goal, but we need to keep going after that. That is our first goal, it's not our final goal, it's not the endpoint, it's just a metric the American people can watch and measure how we are doing,' Klain said. He also claimed there was no vaccine distribution plan set up by the Trump administration in his final months of office.'The process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not really exist when we came into the White House,' Klain said. Dr Rochelle Walensky, the new CDC director, admitted on Sunday that the US doesn't have enough COVID-19 vaccines to meet states' needs, even as New York and Georgia desperately plead for more doses to inoculate their populations.'We don't have as many doses as we would like now for states like New York, for other states claiming to have run out of the vaccine,' Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Fox News Sunday.'Right now, that is the pressure point that I am feeling and by the end of March or so I really do hope our production scale has scaled up dramatically and that we actually have way more than we have right now.'It came after Gov. Andrew Cuomo said over the weekend that New York was running out of vaccines and Georgia's Gov. Brian Kemp asked for more shots to keep up with the demand.

From California, where distribution has varied from county to county, to New York where the largest city in the nation is running low on supply, states and healthcare providers have struggled to acquire, store and distribute vaccines. In Florida, thousands of elderly residents have lined for hours given it is a first-come-first served basis in the state. Shirley Green, 69, reported waiting for 19 hours in her car overnight in order to receive her first dose back on January 4.'(It) would have been my brother's birthday. And he died of COVID in October,' she told WFTV.'And to me, it was my - I don't know tribute is the right word, or honor to him, (to) try and keep myself safe from all of this ugliness that's going on.'Meanwhile in California, Jerry Shapiro, a 78-year-old pharmacist from Los Angeles, has yet to receive his first shot despite being at the top of the list of people now eligible in the state. Shapiro told Reuters he has spent hours calling multiple health agencies and making fruitless computer searches, an experience familiar to many people across the US.

Set up an appointment, get your shot and be done.'A key problem is organizing the distribution of vaccines to smaller clinics and pharmacies - rather than just to large medical centers and retail pharmaceutical chains. In California, only a handful of independent pharmacies have been able to acquire vaccines for their customers - generally only in rural areas where the big chain stores are not present, said Sonya Frausto, a pharmacist in the state capital of Sacramento. Shapiro, who owns an independent pharmacy in downtown Los Angeles, said customers have been calling daily seeking vaccines, but he has to tell them he has no supply. He and his wife finally made appointments to receive a vaccine on Saturday, after repeated phone calls and hours on hold led them to healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente. The Shapiros are not Kaiser members, but the nonprofit is offering them shots nonetheless, Jerry Shapiro said. In Sacramento, 65-year-old restaurateur Jami Goldstene would feel a lot safer at her public-facing job if she could get a vaccine. She is technically eligible because of her age, but has yet to be offered an appointment - or even find a way to make one - despite hours on the phone and the internet.'It's very frustrating,' she said.

Vice President Mike Pence (left), who outranks Fauci in authority, made $235,100 salary in 2019, meanwhile Dr. Deborah Birx (right) earned $305,972 in 2019In the 10-year period from 2010 to 2019 Fauci made $3.6million in salary. In 2014 Fauci’s pay increased from $335,000 to its current $417,608. If Fauci remains as Director of the National Institute for Health’s (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and current Chief Medical Advisor to the President he’ll make a whopping $2.5million from 2019 through 2024 - that is, if he doesn’t get a raise. In an August 13 interview with actor Matthew McConaughey Fauci was asked if he had millions of dollars invested in COVID vaccines. Fauci said with a laugh: 'Matthew, no, I got zero! I am a government worker. I have a government salary.'Meanwhile CDC scientist Dr. Stephen Lindstrom, who was in charge of overseeing the CDC COVID-19 testing system, made just $108,747 in basic pay, an additional $23,533 in adjusted pay, and an 'award'of $750 in 2019. The Executive Branch includes 2.1million federal agency employees, 1.4million members of the military and 500,000 postal employees. Federal employee salaries are typically called at a certain level, under IV of the Executive Schedule, which was $172,500 in 2019, which will rise by 2.6 percent in 2020. However, there are exceptions to the rule – as with Fauci. This is likely because the federal government has to compete with private sector medicine when it comes to doctor and scientist salaries. Fauci has a medical degree from Cornell University. He started his 53-year career at the NIG in 1968 and has advised every president since President Ronald Reagan. In 2008, President George W. Bush honored him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor.

531,The Chicago Teachers Strike Proves We Can’t Rely on Democrats,-12.0,38.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/strike-democrats-chicago-teachers/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2019-10-21,25,"Unlike last year’s red-state teacher uprisings, Chicago’s education workers walked out Thursday morning against a Democrat: newly elected mayor Lori Lightfoot. The walkout reveals a key problem facing Democrats and their crowded field of 2020 presidential candidates: It’s not easy to square the circle between promises on the campaign trail and policy once in office. In some ways, this is a novel dilemma for a party that only a few years ago was openly championing a billionaire-funded school privatization agenda. But the political tides have turned since the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) struck against Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel in September 2012. Though President Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, is partly responsible for peeling off education reform’s formerly progressive veneer, the strikers themselves deserve most of the credit for turning the tide. Ever since West Virginia educators walked out in February 2018, Democratic politicians have increasingly shied away from their previous advocacy of charter schools, austerity, and punitive teacher-accountability schemes. Even Cory Booker, one of education privatization’s most fervent backers, has recently rebranded himself as a friend of public schools and labor unions. It’s a sign of the times that Lightfoot was elected earlier this year on a progressive education platform and a pledge to break the school-to-prison pipeline through increased funding. Yet, within months of taking office, Lightfoot immediately began to backtrack. “The candidate that people in this city voted for said that she agreed with them that our schools were a priority and we had to resource the m,” observes CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates in reference to Lightfoot. “The mayor is saying something completely different.” Despite an influx of over a billion dollars in increased yearly school funding for Chicago since 2016, Lightfoot and her negotiators are now pleading poverty in response to demands for smaller classes, a nurse and counselor in every school, and affordable housing support for both teachers and homeless students. After months of failed negotiations, 32,500 teachers and support staff walked out on Thursday morning over these issues. Faced with entrenched political machines and the power of big business, it’s not surprising that progressive campaign promises don’t translate into policy for many Democratic officials. To buck such powerful interests means taking a considerable personal risk and leaning on disruptive collective action in the streets. Without such a movement, even elected politicians with the best of intentions can only do so much. There’s a simple lesson here for all educators and voters eyeing the Democratic presidential contenders: Electoral promises are not enough. Without mass action, and the election of more class struggle candidates, the CTU’s vision of the “schools our students deserve” will likely remain a mirage in Chicago and across the United States. But if Lightfoot’s evolution foreshadows what we might expect from a President Biden or Buttigieg, Chicago also offers a glimpse of what a Sanders presidency could look like. The city’s six recently elected socialist City Council members have not only championed the city’s educators against the mayor; they have also used their political platform and infrastructure to promote the educators’ struggles. Socialist aldermen Carlos Ramirez-Rosa and Rossana Rodriguez have co-organized community town halls with the CTU, and were on the picket lines at Avondale-Logandale Elementary Thursday morning. “This is what being a democratic socialist in office is all about,” Rosa says. “It means supporting organizers to win their demands, it means helping working people take their destinies into their own hands.” Chicago is a microcosm of the deepening nationwide battle between the Democratic Party’s corporate-funded mainstream and an insurgent Left. Battle lines have crystallized around health care, student debt, and climate justice, but conflicts on the ground have been particularly acute in public education. An unprecedented upsurge in teacher strikes has made business as usual increasingly difficult for establishment politicians all across the political spectrum. It’s a positive development that the educators’ revolt initiated by CTU in 2012 has made Democrats change their tune on public schools. But it will take many more strikes, and the election of many more socialists, to fundamentally transform our country’s educational priorities. The Democratic Party establishment won’t save public education. Chicago shows that we can only rely on ourselves.",2,Generally Reliable,0.125906607054148,0.4432864949258391,904,2,The Nation

Maloneypointed outvia Twitter that at no point during that interview did he even mention her.“Um, I’ve never said your name in public, @RepBoebert. Never. Not once.

He offered to post the transcript of the interview but warned her that it “might be like ‘a fact,'” so the transcript “might not help you.”In the interview, Maloney discussed a fellow Democrat’s account of seeing one lawmaker give a “tour” of the Capitol with the insurrectionists the day before the siege. Then Maloney expressed alarm over “some of our new colleagues” who “believe in conspiracy theories and who want to carry guns into the House chamber.”“This conduct is beyond the pale and it extends to some of this interaction with the very people who attacked the Capitol,” he said. Right before a House vote on Tuesday night, Boebert refused to hand over her bag to the Capitol police after she set off the newly installed metal detectors at the entrance of the House chamber.

Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs says Ethiopian military warplanes crossed into Sudanese airspace this week in a ""dangerous and unjustified escalation"" of tensions over the disputed al-Fashaga area. Sudan also says armed Ethiopian gangs, backed by the government, killed at least eight civilians in Wad A’arood and al-Liya villages along the border. The head of the Sudanese military, Lieutenant General Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, visited the area and talked to the Sudanese troops guarding the borders. Al-Burhan says Sudan has been patient about this land for so long, for 25 years of offenses and threats and accusations, but everything has a limit. He says Sudan didn’t start the conflict, Ethiopia did, and now its eye for an eye. He says they killed Sudanese women and killed our farmers and burnt the lands before, and they claimed that it’s not Sudanese land and accused Sudan of entering their lands. Authorities in Sudan’s al-Qadarif state say residents of at least 34 villages near the border have been displaced. Sudan and Ethiopia formed a joint committee in December to resolve the long-standing dispute over al-Fashaga, located where northwestern Ethiopia meets southeastern Sudan. However, the Ethiopian ambassador in Khartoum has accused the Sudanese military of taking advantage of the war in the Tigray region to seize disputed land. Yibeltal Aemero called on Sudan’s military to withdraw from the border region and stop its military operations.“Very recently, in the first week of November 2020, we witnessed unprecedented military incursion by the Sudan while the joint special committee was still in progress and when the Ethiopian National Defense forces moved to Tigray region on November, 4, 2020 for the law enforcement majors, the Sudanese army took the advantage and entered deep inside Ethiopian territory, looted properties, burned camps, detained, attacked and killed the Ethiopians while displacing thousands,"" said Aemero. Many Sudanese condemned the ambassador’s accusations and called on the military to take wider actions. Security observers think the conflict could have severe ramifications in the region. Military expert Sawarmi Kahlid says the recent escalation has very risky security impacts on the residents in the border area and the troops in both sides. Also the call of war is threatening large groups of people and tribes, especially in Ethiopia, where these tribes are already witnessing a famine. More than 50,000 Ethiopians recently fled the war in the Tigray region for refugee camps in eastern Sudan. The Sudanese government has moved many of them away from the border, citing the security situation.",3,Reliable,0.0234243697478991,0.3303921568627451,585,3,Voice of America

One shot of the vaccine was partially effective, offering 58% protection against infection, 76% against hospitalisation, and 77% against death. The authors of the observational studyin the Lancet medical journalsay this shows the importance of having the second shot. Their study demonstrates the power of vaccines to end the toll of coronavirus, they say. “These findings suggest that high vaccine uptake can meaningfully stem the pandemic and offers hope for eventual control of the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak as vaccination programmes ramp up across the rest of the world,” they wrote. Lead author, Dr Sharon Alroy-Preis, of the Israel ministry of health, said: “Until this point, no country in the world had described the national public health impact of a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign. These insights are hugely important because, while there are still some considerable challenges to overcome, they offer real hope that Covid-19 vaccination will eventually enable us to control the pandemic.”But many other countries will not be able to imitate Israel, commentators in the journal say.“Regrettably, rapid population-level coverage cannot be easily replicated in many other countries. The global use of the [Pfizer/BioNTech] vaccine is limited by supply issues, high costs, and ultra-cold chain storage requirements,” wrote Prof Eyal Leshem of the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre in Israel, and Prof Annelies Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who were not involved in the study. Israel has used only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which the company supplied on the understanding that data from the vaccination programme would be published to demonstrate its real-world efficacy. The country had a national lockdown from 27 December 2020 until 7 March 2021 because of a big surge in infections, which peaked in January. By 3 April, 72% of adults over 16 and 90% of the over-65s had received two doses of the vaccine. As in the UK, the dominant strain of the virus has been the “Kent” variant, B117. Some cases of the “South African” variant, B1351, have been found latterly, but too few to be taken into account. By seven days after the second dose, the vaccine was giving people 95.3% protection against infection and 96∙7% protection against death. Protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection was 97.0% and 91.5%, respectively. Protection against hospital admission was 97.2% overall. By 14 days after the second dose, the protection had risen slightly further. The authors, some of whom declared shares in Pfizer, wrote that “relying on protection against Covid-19 from a single dose might not be prudent”. The vaccine was developed to be given as two shots and substantially higher levels of antibodies have been observed after the second dose.“Additionally, little is known about the duration of protection of one dose and how it compares with the durability after two doses. It is possible that one dose will provide a shorter duration of protection than two doses, particularly in an environment where new Sars-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge,” they wrote. In a separate studypublished in the BMJon Thursday, researchers from Denmark and Norway revealed their investigations into the blood clots that have been linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. They looked at 280,000 people aged 18-65 who received a first dose of the vaccine in the two countries in February and March. They found more clots in the veins than would be expected, although the events were still rare – 11 per 100,000 vaccinations. There were 2.5 clots in the veins of the brain per 100,000 jabs. Ina linked opinion, Prof Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia, said the study did not change the conclusions of the UK and European medicine regulators that the benefits of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh its risks for most age groups.“Those countries that delayed their own vaccination programmes at a time of high transmission rates by declining to use available Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines should know that their decision will have contributed to an increase in the number of avoidable deaths from Covid-19,” he writes.",3,Reliable,0.1516864018334607,0.3906540191834309,989,3,The Guardian

Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician who served as Tennessee’s medical director of vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization, was fired Monday. In the week prior to her termination, she received a package containing a dog muzzle, she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday. Tennessee vaccine official's story reveals an ugly truth about GOP and children's rightsFiscus has been at the center of a political battle in Tennessee over the vaccination of adolescents againstCovid-19. Before she was terminated, Fiscus released a memo citing Tennessee state law about whether minors may get medical care without their parents’ permission. Backlash to the memo from state lawmakers was swift and comes amid political polarization of vaccines as experts urge Americans to get their doses and disinformation continues to drive large portions of the population away. Fiscus said prior to her termination, a large Amazon package was delivered to her state office addressed to her. Inside she found a dog muzzle. There was no note and Fiscus said she contacted Amazon to try and determine who sent the muzzle. Amazon refused to reveal the sender, Fiscus said. CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment.“At first, I thought that was a joke and contacted a few friends, and then, when no one claimed it, I realized that that was something that was sent to me as some kind of a message,” Fiscus said. At the advice of others, she said reported the incident to the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which confirmed to CNN it is investigating the dog muzzle package. Fiscus said she told her husband, “They obviously didn’t know me because they sent me a size three which is for beagles and I’m obviously a pit bull, which requires a size six.” Fiscus said she is keeping the muzzle as a souvenir. Fiscus told CNN she sent the memo at the center of the controversy because physicians who were administering Covid-19 vaccines asked her what to do when minors showed up to be inoculated without a parent. Politics is causing needless deaths in the fight against Covid-19In response, and in consultation with legal counsel at theTennessee Department of Health, Fiscus said she sent a memo to the doctors citing the “mature minor doctrine,” which allows health care providers to decide if any child has the capacity to consent to vaccination themselves. The policy has been in place for 34 years, was public facing on the Tennessee Department of Health website and was blessed by the governor’s office, she said. But legislators quickly began contacting the health department asking questions about the memo that some said undermined parental authority. On Monday, Fiscus was fired. Tennessee’s health department told CNN by email Tuesday it could not comment on personnel matters. Fiscus said her firing was a symptom of a trend in many public health departments across the country. In her state, she sees a “bowing of the department of health to some saber-rattling of some of our legislators who felt that it was inappropriate to share the mature minor doctrine that has been Tennessee Supreme Court case law since 1987.”Legislative leaders are now seeking answers from Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee regarding his decision to fire the state’s top vaccination expert in the middle of a pandemic. During a virtual meeting with state legislative members Wednesday, Tennessee’s Senate Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Raumesh Akbari said the decision to fire Fiscus has put the state in a more dangerous position.“We have all the tools we need to get out of this pandemic but the failure of leadership at the top is making this hard,” Akbari said. Leading up to her firing, Fiscus said the department had halted all adolescent vaccine outreach, from Covid-19 communications to HPV reminders and acknowledgment of National Immunization Awareness Month. The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed Wednesday it is temporarily halting all adolescent vaccine outreach, even for vaccines not related to Covid-19, telling CNN the issue is “polarized.”Tennessee is halting outreach on all vaccines for adolescents, including for Covid-19“We recognize where we are around the national conversation around vaccinations and it is a polarized conversation, and that is true in our state. And so we’re just taking this opportunity to evaluate our messaging and to ensure that we’re not hurting our efforts,” spokeswoman Sarah Tanksley told CNN in a phone call. Tanksley said Covid-19 and other childhood vaccines would still be available while the department of health re-evaluates the vaccination notification process. She said the goal was to ensure that vaccination reminders are sent to the parents of the adolescent. In a few cases, immunization reminders were sent directly to minors who had contact information listed in the department’s electronic health records, according to a statement given to CNN by the Tennessee Department of Health. Tanksley said she is confident the department of health will continue to successfully communicate with parents and providers.“This is not a monthlong evaluation period or anything like that,” she said. But Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the Davidson County Board of Health in Tennessee, said Wednesday he worries the halt could result in preventable outbreaks. Jahangir said the robust immunization program for children in the US has prevented outbreaks of diseases for decades.“The best way to save millions of Tennesseans is to encourage vaccinations, to make them easy and not buy into any rhetoric that vaccinations are problematic,” he said. “I think the politicization of vaccinations can truly have a really negative impact on Tennesseans and people around the US.”CNN’s Martin Savidge, Angela Barajas, Rebekah Riess,Tina Burnside Keri Enriquez and Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report.",3,Reliable,0.1023809523809523,0.3916413373860182,1299,3,CNN

The order issued Tuesday requires the UnitedHealth Group subsidiary to use better guidelines for making coverage decisions and train company employees on their use. The company also must reprocess an estimated 67,000 claims for coverage that previously were denied. There's no guarantee that UBH will now cover the claims, but ""we're confident that a lot of people are going to end up getting a different decision this time around,"" said Caroline Reynolds, a plaintiffs attorney with the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. The court will appoint a special master to oversee the reprocessing of claims, which should take about one year to complete, Reynolds said. In his 2019 ruling, Spero found that UBH's guidelines made it harder for patients to get coverage. The company placed excessive emphasis on addressing acute symptoms, he found, rather than treating underlying conditions. The judge also faulted the guidelines for not addressing effective treatment of co-occurring conditions and breaking with standards of care in pushing patients to lower levels of care. The unique needs of children and adolescents also weren't properly addressed, Spero ruled.""The emphasis on cost-cutting that was embedded in UBH's guideline development process actually tainted the process, causing UBH to make decisions about guidelines based as much or more on its own bottom line as on the interests of the plan members, to whom it owes a fiduciary duty,"" the judge wrote in 2019.",3,Reliable,0.161085761085761,0.4711974961974962,890,3,Star Tribune-Minneapolis
539,How the LAPD and Palantir Use Data to Justify Racist Policing,-8.33,42.0,https://theintercept.com/2021/01/30/lapd-palantir-data-driven-policing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-30,25,"The killing ofGeorge Floyd last May sparked renewed scrutiny of data-driven policing. As protests raged around the world,1,400 researcherssigned an openlettercalling on their colleagues to stop collaborating with police on algorithms, and cities likeSanta Cruz,New Orleans, andOaklandvariously banned predictive policing, facial recognition, and voice recognition. But elsewhere, police chiefs worked to deepen partnerships with tech companies, claiming that the answer to systemic bias and racism was simply more data. In her new book, “Predict and Surveil: Data, Discretion, and the Future of Policing,” sociologist Sarah Brayne slays that assumption with granular detail. An assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Brayne did months of fieldwork at the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in the area, tagging along as cops used software from Palantir, PredPol, and other companies. She learned that software vendors routinely show up at the department to peddle their wares, like pharmaceutical representatives visiting doctors’ offices. She noted how police used an automated license plate reader mounted outside an emergency room to build out networks of victims’ associates. A sergeant explained that family or friends would often drop off an injured person and then speed away. With the automated license plate reader, he said, police could use plate numbers to determine who else was connected to the victim, even if there was no other evidence linking them to a crime. Riding along in department helicopters, Brayne saw how data was used to justify extreme measures. In order to get a reduction in crime in one division, police concluded that they had to fly helicopters overhead 51 times per week. They often increased that to 80 to 90 flyovers for good measure, meaning that many residents’ days were regularly interrupted by the noise of buzzing choppers. The cops seemed to register the intrusion. They dubbed the copters “ghetto birds.”Image: Courtesy Oxford University PressFor years, scholars and activists have critiqued the algorithms used in data-driven policing, arguing that they merely techwash bias by making sloppy investigative work seem objective. Leading the charge in Los Angeles is theStop LAPD Spying Coalition. Through public records requests, the group’s activists have obtaineddocumentson police use of data analytics, and in 2018, they successfullypushedthe city’s Office of the Inspector General toauditthe department’s use of technology. “Surveillance is basically the tip of the policing knife,” said Hamid Khan, a co-leader of the coalition. “When you look at policing and the history of policing, from our vantage point, it’s not about public safety when it comes to nonwhite folks. It’s about the content to cause harm.” Big data, he added, simply gives police more ways to do that. Brayne’s contribution is showing exactly how data is distorted in the hands of police. “Most sociological research on criminal justice has focused on those who are being policed,” she told The Intercept. “I very deliberately wanted to flip the lens to focus on those doing the surveilling — on the police themselves.”Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at American University and author of “The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement,” said that Brayne’s work is an unflinching look at what happens when people in power use emerging technologies. “Her book is a completely original inside look at the development of big data surveillance at the height of the first generation of its adoption,” he said. “Sarah has been given access to the reality of big data policing in a way that no one else has — and probably, because of her success, no one else ever will.”LAPD Captain Elizabeth Morales shows a printed map of predicted crime hot spots in the Foothill Division of Los Angeles, Calif., on Monday, October 24, 2016. Brayne first embedded with the department in 2013 as a 27-year-old graduate student. It was a critical moment for policing tech, and the LAPD and other departments were ramping up their use of technology. The LAPD had signed on with Palantir Gotham, whichmerges datafrom crime and arrest reports, automated license plate readers, rap sheets, and other sources. The department also had a contract with PredPol, which generates “boxes,” or hot spots, where property crimes like burglaries and auto theft are predicted to occur. A third program, Operation LASER, which stands for Los Angeles’ Strategic Extraction and Restoration program, used a points-based system, called a LASER score, to evaluate the risk that individuals posed. In Brayne’s first interview, a captain boasted that the LAPD was at the forefront of technology adoption, detailing how software that had been developed for counterterrorism work was helping the department ward off future crimes. Afterward, Brayne asked to go on a ride-along with an officer. That trip revealed a more complicated picture. Instead of pulling up PredPol’s software on the laptop mounted to his dashboard, the cop worked with a printout of PredPol’s hot spots. He explained that the department’s in-car laptops had trouble loading even standard internet browsers. So much for technological wizardry. Brayne and the officer took a break to eat In-N-Out burgers under a highway overpass, where they watched his colleagues bust up a grow operation and drag marijuana plants onto a flatbed truck. Then when they drove to a new location, Brayne noticed that the officer typed in his address manually, rather than let the car’s automatic vehicle tracker register his location. The union opposed officers being tracked, he explained. While predictive policing systems had caught average citizens in an opaque dragnet, police grew squeamish when the technology was turned back on them. The notion that better technology can fix policing dates to at least the early 20th century. Back then, police departments were closely tied to city government political machines. Arguing that a data-driven approach would make policing more professional, reformers introduced tactics drawn from military operations, including signal boxes, telephone kiosks, and pin mapping. The militarization of police accelerated during the 1960s and has continued to the present day, to the point where even departments in placid American suburbs now havearmored vehicles, night vision viewers, and bayonets.“That’s a very visible manifestation of the militarization of policing,” said Brayne. “But something that’s more invisible is this creep of surveillance software into the daily operations of policing.”A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s patrol car, outfitted with a computer system developed for the battlefield by a military contractor, is seen in Los Angeles on Nov. 16, 2011. After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security gave state and local police $35 billion in grants, a portion of which was spent on developing data infrastructure. The infusion of cash created needs where there had been none. Police chiefs realized that the data they collected for Homeland Security could also be used for regular policing. In Los Angeles, some officials came to believe that predictive analytics and big data might also solve the department’s many problems. The LAPD had been racked by a stream of high-profile scandals, most infamously the 1991 beating of Rodney King. In 2001, the Department of Justice imposed a consent decree, a court order mandating that the department conduct regular audits and capture more data on officers and crimes. (A spokesperson for the LAPD declined to comment for this article.)A key figure behind the shift toward predictive policing was William Bratton, who brought the data management system COMPSTAT to New York City before becoming the chief of the LAPD in 2002. Bratton oversaw the LAPD’s effort to merge various streams of data. One result was Operation LASER, which was funded with nearly a million dollars from the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance. When they came into contact with someone who seemed suspicious, officers filled out a card with the person’s name, address, physical characteristics, vehicle information, gang affiliation, and criminal history. Each new point of contact with police earned a person one additional point. “There are a lot of chickenshit violations you can stop someone for,” a sergeant explained to Brayne during a ride-along. “Yesterday, this individual might have got stopped because he jaywalked. Today, he might have got stopped because he didn’t use his turn signal or whatever the case might be. So that’s two points.” The sergeant went on to argue that even such minor violations could help police predict the next crime because, taken together, they show “who is out on the streets.”Such a system means, of course, that individuals in overpoliced neighborhoods can easily get caught up in a vicious cycle where they are, as Brayne writes, “more likely to be stopped, thus increasing their point value, justifying their increased surveillance, and making it more likely that they will be stopped again in the future.” But some of the administrators whom Brayne encountered were apparently less interested in accuracy than they were in amassing more records. The goal, one captain told her, was simply to get people “in the system”: to capture larger and larger amounts of data on seemingly harmless individuals in the hope that the data would help solve a crime later on. Once an officer had a person in the system, they could set an alert to automatically track changes in that person’s profile. Brayne watched Los Angeles police fill out cards for Operation LASER and noted that they often listed the people who were with a person when they were stopped. She calls this a “secondary surveillance network.” You don’t actually need to have contact with police to be caught up in the system; you just need to have had contact with someone who did. Similarly, Brayne learned that images captured by automated license plate readers sometimes showed the faces of people who were stopped with a person of interest. Those people too became data. When Brayne raised the issue of possible legal constraints around the rampant collection and sharing of information, an employee in the Los Angeles County Chief Information Office declared bluntly, “Consent is anachronistic.”In some cases, even being the subject of a query can boost someone’s suspiciousness. Brayne watched one detective search a national database for a juvenile. He remarked that he could see how many times other users had queried the same name. He claimed that the feature had helped police catch criminals because it told them other officers had suspected the same individual. When Brayne asked why that was useful, he replied, “Just because you haven’t been arrested doesn’t mean you haven’t been caught.”Decades of research and years of cellphone videos have shown, of course, that police regularly target people who haven’t committed crimes. On ride-alongs, Brayne watched cops run the plates of law-abiding drivers stopped at traffic lights, just in case the numbers turned up a record. But the anecdote underscores how thoroughly big data reinforces existing police biases. One captain claimed, “It’s just math.”A banner displays Palantir signage during the company’s initial public offering in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 30, 2020, in New York. In Brayne’s fieldwork, Palantir’s technology came in for special praise. “They catch bad guys during every training class,” one sergeant told her. A captain rhapsodized about the platform’s constant addition of new data sets, marveling at the addition of foreclosure information: “I’m so happy with how big Palantir got.” Another said of Palantir, “We’ve dumped hundreds of thousands [of dollars] into that. They are so responsive and flexible about what we want. They’re great. They’re going to take over the world. I promise you, they’re going to take over the world.”But up close, the software was only as good as the people maintaining and using it. To make sense of Palantir Gotham’s data, police often need input from engineers, some of whom are provided by Palantir. At one point in her research, Brayne watched a Palantir engineer search 140 million records for a hypothetical man of average build driving a black four-door sedan. The engineer narrowed those results to 2 million records, then to 160,000, and finally to 13 people, before checking which of those people had arrests on their records. At various points in the search, he made assumptions that could easily throw off the result — that the car was likely made between 2002 and 2005, that the man was heavy-set. Brayne asked what happened if the system served up a false positive. “I don’t know,” the engineer replied. There were dissenters. Some of the people tasked with implementing data-driven policing at the LAPD complained to Brayne that the software didn’t work as advertised. One person working in information technology said, “Our command staff is easily distracted by the latest and greatest shiny object.” Data integration was uneven. Some divisions had certain software, while others didn’t. Another employee told Brayne that the detective case management system was “sort of like a pimple,” adding, “they just, like, stuck it on top.”When management was out of the room, police were honest about their doubts. “Looks bitching, but it’s worthless,” one sergeant told Brayne of the LAPD’s data analysis infrastructure, which is housed at the department’s Real-Time Analysis and Critical Response Division. One group of officers bought their captain a Ouija board to mock his faith in algorithms. A captain told Brayne that person-based predictive policing was “a civil liberties nightmare” and that he would never adopt it. (His division adopted it after he left.)Activists who have fought for years against department use of technology told The Intercept that Brayne’s work is useful — but only to a point. “It was very helpful to uncover and learn about the extensive amounts of stuff that LAPD was doing,” said Jamie Garcia, an organizer with Stop LAPD Spying. “But then what?” In general, she added, she is tired of academics treating surveillance like a problem to observe and evaluate. “The information goes back to the ivory tower, and the ivory tower has this conversation with themselves about what they think about it instead of that information being brought directly to the community.”Brayne said that she hopes her work can be useful to a broad variety of people. “Transparency is the first step towards accountability,” she said. “It is impossible to hold an individual or organization accountable if you don’t know what they’re doing.”Forrest Stuart, a sociologist at Stanford who studies policing, said that her book is essential at a moment when anti-racism protests have prompted some law enforcement officials to further embrace technology as a means for reducing bias. “Some of the most popular proposed solutions to the over-policing and over-incarceration of black and brown communities have involved new technologies,” he wrote in an email. “There is a sense that if we could just design a good enough computer program, we could deploy police more fairly and reduce, or perhaps even eliminate, unwarranted disparities in criminal justice. Brayne’s book makes us take real pause and recognize the faults in this techno-optimist dream.”The LAPD ended its contract with PredPol last April,citing financial constraintsbrought on by the pandemic. Operation LASER ended in 2019. But a range of othercompanies, including heavyweights likeAmazonandMicrosoft, have moved into the space nationally, and aguidebookpublished by the LAPD last year makes clear that big data will continue to prominently figure in policing in Los Angeles. Palantir, meanwhile, has lately expanded its access to data by moving into coronavirus tracking and vaccine safety analysis. Last year, the company brokered lucrative contracts with the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. It went public in September. Since then, its stock prices have more than tripled.",3,Reliable,0.0796262071262071,0.4086427888350965,3472,3,The Intercept

Unions and most Democrats — about 62% — opposed the cancelation. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in against the move. Canada is now said to be considering some type ofsanction against the United States. Biden’s move affects workers in both countries; it kills about 12,000 jobs in the United States and another 2,000 in Canada as both countries are still reeling from the COVID pandemic’s destruction of jobs.

Canceling the Keystone XL also hurts the environment. The pipeline would have moved between 800,000 and 830,000 barrels of oil per day safely, off our roads and rails, from where it’s produced to where it can be refined. That was to be Texas, which leads the world in the clean and safe refining of oil into products the modern economy depends on every single day. So some of the jobs lost were in Texas, about which Biden will not care, as Texas did not vote for him. With the pipeline canceled, Canada will find other customers for its oil. That’s likely to be China and India, two of the world’s fastest-growing and most energy-hungry economies. Instead of being transported safely via the Keystone XL pipeline, the oil will be transported by trucks and ships — both of which emit far more gunk into the atmosphere than pipelines, and both of which are far more prone to accidents and spills. It’s likely to be refined outside the United States, where standards do not match U. S. EPA standards.

Owners of such establishments received notice this week of the increased oversight, which started on Friday, accompanied by the threat of fines and citations over complaints from customers as well as bars and restaurants that are obeying the rules that some of their competitors are ignoring. Bars and restaurants were permitted as of June 10 to reopen their indoor service areas at 50% of their fire code capacities as long as they met other requirements such as mask-wearing and keeping tables 6 feet apart. Gov. Tim Walz on Friday said he wanted to thank the majority that are sacrificing and complying, and he added that he owes it to them to confront bars and restaurants that aren't.""If they choose not to follow the best health guidance [they] put all of the businesses at risk, they put all of our health at risk,"" Walz said. ""That's the whole idea. The wearing of the mask is about protecting others. It's about stopping the spread and reducing it.""The guidance comes at a nervy time in the pandemic for state health officials. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 862 lab-confirmed infections on Friday of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — bringing the state's overall total to 73,240 known infections — which represented an increase from the roughly 630 per day that had been reported on average for much of August. The state also reported four COVID-19 deaths on Friday — for a total of 1,810 in the pandemic — and that 301 people were hospitalized with the infectious disease. Hospital and case numbers had leveled off somewhat in August after increasing in July. The latest COVID-19 case growth appears somewhat tied to large group events and outbreaks in bars and restaurants where safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus are being disregarded, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director. The state has confirmed 46 infections involving motorcyclists at the Sturgis rally in South Dakota and has found evidence that they have spread the virus to others within Minnesota. One apparently spread the virus at a wedding, Ehresmann said. The state also has investigated 50 establishments in Minnesota for suspected patron transmission of the virus that resulted in a total of 1,286 infections. Thirty of those bars or restaurants have been publicly identified because at least seven people were likely infected in them.""When establishments and customers don't follow the guidance, we see outbreaks,"" Ehresmann said. Inspections will occur in establishments that have been the subject of complaints, but also in random bars and restaurants as well. Unannounced ""observation-only"" inspections were conducted earlier this summer by the Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement Division of the state Department of Public Safety and various law enforcement agencies. The inspectionsturned up 14 bars and restaurants that committed violations. Most of those violations included employees failing to wear masks (116), followed by failure in social distancing (63) and excess capacity (30). In the advisory to the hospitality industry this week, the state commissioners for Public Safety, Health, and Labor and Industry wrote that ""most establishments are following federal and state guidelines, but it makes it difficult for them to compete or to explain to their customers when other establishments are not in compliance.""Some Republican members of the state House of Representatives challenged the stepped-up enforcement on a business community that has suffered economic hardships in the pandemic.""Threats of fines and closure are a departure from previous statements by the Governor — who has stated that their goal is 'education' — not to be punitive to businesses who are already struggling as a result of the Walz shutdowns,"" read a statement issued Friday morning by the House Republican Caucus. House GOP members said they are hearing about businesses being subjected to unannounced visits, which have led to citations and fines. The House Republicans said they are drafting a written response to Walz and relevant commissioners to his announcement. State Rep. Dave Baker, R-Willmar, a longtime restaurant owner until he sold his last place in January, said he's concerned that further enforcement pressure will doom many establishments.""I am really concerned that the executive branch is switching to the adversary vs. the advocate role,"" the third-term legislator said. ""The tone right now is so alarming. Why would the government go after the industry that has been wounded so badly during this pandemic?""Baker said that with summer coming to a close and outdoor seating certain to slice into overall capacity, some establishments aren't going to survive if they can't go from 50% to 75% capacity indoors. Restaurant staff are ""doing the best they can"" when it comes to wearing masks and following other rules, he said. ""I know there are a few rogue people who are snubbing their nose to everything, but let's deal with them one on one. … to publicly shame restaurants online with minor violations is just not something we need to do.""Hospitality Minnesota, a trade group that represents many restaurants and hotels, said it fears its industry is being targeted without merit.""Previous Department of Public Safety announcements [indicated] that 98.5% of operators they visited were following guidance to keep guests and workers safe,"" Hospitality Minnesota CEO Liz Rammer said. ""Enforcement efforts must be carried out fairly and evenly, and across all types of businesses that serve the public. … We are concerned that this industry is being disproportionately and unfairly targeted, and we have expressed these concerns to the Health Department.""The state's letter to bars and restaurants said that teams of inspectors from the three state departments will fan out during the next several weekends and look for violations. They will be looking for compliance in areas such as employees and customers wearing masks, social distancing, limits on party size per table, proper employee health screenings and staying under capacity maximums. Violations could lead to fines, loss of liquor license or prompt an order to close. Inspection results will be shared with the bar and restaurant operators, the letter read.

Just don’t call it climate change.,1.33,47.67,https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2019/0416/Nebraskans-talk-extreme-weather.-Just-don-t-call-it-climate-change,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"The flood carried away edges of his fields, dumped up to 6 inches of useless sand on his fertile loam, and deposited, incongruously, the elastic band of a pair of Hanes underwear on a bush. But everywhere Chad Christianson looks, all he sees is green. The green rye he planted last fall stands in sharp contrast to the brown soil and cornstalks. More importantly, it held the soil in place in all but the most flooded areas of his fields, lessening the waters’ impact. It’s a first step in Mr. Christianson’s push to become more weather-resilient.“I don’t know about climate change,” Mr. Christianson says. “But I think the weather is going to be more extreme going forward.”The severe flooding that inundated Nebraska last month washed away fields, bridges, and roads. But the extreme weather is also starting to sway residents’ thinking about climate. It’s a sentiment that is percolating here in rural Nebraska. With the state still in recovery mode, many Nebraskans say it’s early for them to start contemplating the long-term implications of last month’s epic flood, the most widespread in memory. But as such extreme weather events pile up, some say they are beginning to change hearts and minds here – not politically but practically.“This [flood] didn’t come out of nowhere but it went beyond almost anyone’s expectations,” says Tyler Williams, an educator with the extension service at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which works with farmers. “So I definitely think people in the agricultural world are thinking: ‘All right. I’ve got to fix something, do something different.’”Part of the change in thought is coming from farmers themselves, especially those involved with the small but growing regenerative farming movement.“Conversations were already happening before the flood,” says Graham Christensen, a fifth-generation farmer and president of GC Resolve, a grassroots community-development business. “But after the flood a lot more folks are like, ‘Yeah, I have never seen that; my dad has never seen that; my grandpa has never seen that. This is a pattern that’s emerging.’”The movement, which focuses on the health of soil, emphasizes techniques like planting cover crops as a way to keep more roots in the soil, beyond the corn and soybean plants that many farmers raise in rotation. These roots keep more nutrients in the soil, make it easier for water to drain (which improves flood resilience), and keep more water stored in the soil (which improves drought-resistance). That’s key for farmers like Mr. Christianson here in Fremont. Just don’t call it climate change.“We are not necessarily going around and saying, ‘Hey, climate change, climate change, climate change!” says Mr. Christensen of GC Resolve, who travels the state preaching regenerative agriculture. “We’re more focused on rallying around the solution, which is better soil-health principles.”The term climate change has become so politicized that it’s not readily accepted in rural America, even with the extreme weather. Most pastors in the state are afraid of addressing the issue for fear of splitting their congregations, according to a 2015 University of Nebraska-Lincoln report. A couple comes out of a Lynch, Nebraska, donation center with six gallon jugs of emergency water because the floods have intermittently made their water unsafe. Does the extreme weather imply climate change? “No,” she answers. “No,” he answers, then gives a short lecture on avoiding preconceived ideas. Skeptics have a point. Last month’s flooding was the result of such a fluky combination of snow, rain, frozen ground, and rapid melt that even warming advocates admit that it alone may not be a harbinger of change to come. But previous events – flooding of the Missouri River in 2011, an increasing number of intense rain events, and one of the 10 coldest Februaries on record – have residents reassessing the future.“It’s getting to the point where it’s hard to ignore,” says Kim Morrow, a behavior change expert at Verdis Group, a sustainability and climate resiliency advisory group based in Omaha. When Yale University social scientists assessedpublic opinion about climate changelast year, they found that 64% of Nebraskans believed climate change was happening. That was up 6 points fromtheir 2014 survey– a rise consistent with the slow change in a swath of red states from Idaho to Kentucky – but still 6 points behind the national average. The Yale research also reveals an urban-rural split. In Lancaster County, home of Lincoln and the university, 72% of people said change was happening. In rural counties farther west, barely half do.“Yes, I think it’s still political and divided, but people are beginning to change,” says the Rev. Richard Randolph, senior pastor at Christ United Methodist Church in Lincoln. He has submitted to this year’s Nebraska-Kansas annual conference of the United Methodist Church a petition calling on churches to become better informed about global warming and to set goals for reducing their carbon footprints. “For the most part, I pastor a church that’s moderate to progressive theologically. But the Rev. Andy Alexander, director of the Collaborative Ministry Office at Creighton, a Catholic university in Omaha, is not seeing much of a shift at all. “People are skeptical about that kind of thinking, which they call projection,” he says.

544,"TikTok banned: 6 ways the app is countering US scrutiny, Trump's ban threat",-5.0,43.67,https://fortune.com/2020/07/22/tiktok-us-ban-counter/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"The Trump administration is considering banning TikTok, the wildly popular short video platform, over national security concerns and TikTok’s alleged vulnerability to Chinese government censorship and data sharing. TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech firm ByteDance Ltd. and has 30 million monthly active users in the U. S., has denied U. S. claims about its susceptibility to Chinese government influence. But President Donald Trump’s targeting of the app has only increased since he mentioned a potential ban earlier this month; new Trump campaignads on Facebookthis week claimed, “TikTok is spying on you.”TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. Growing political scrutiny of TikTok in 2019 had already prompted the app to increase transparency, distance itself from ByteDance, and deny claims that it shares user data with Beijing or complies with its censorship requests. Scrutiny of the app has only accelerated in recent weeks with India’s TikTok ban in late June and the U. S.’s subsequent threat of a ban. TikTok no doubt has become aflashpointfor the West’s disputes with China. In response, the app has taken six actions that seem aimed at underscoring its commitment to the U. S. and proving its operational independence from its Chinese parent—and from China’s government:At the start of 2020, TikTok had 500 full-time staff in the U. S.; that number has since increased to 1,400. On Tuesday, TikToksaidit plans to hire 10,000 employees for “good-paying jobs” in the U. S. over the next three years, a long-term commitment to the market that could foster good will in Washington. TikTok hasofficesin New York City, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles. A sharp increase in staff isn’t the only way TikTok is expanding its U. S. presence. The company has hired more than35 lobbyiststo advocate on its behalf in Washington to persuade lawmakers that it’s committed to U. S. regulations and not beholden to the Chinese government. TikTok had no lobbying presence in Washington a year ago,accordingto theTikTok has made other signals of commitment to the U. S. market. In March, the companysaidit was setting up a “transparency center” in its Los Angeles office to “provide outside experts an opportunity to directly view how our teams at TikTok go about the day-to-day challenging, but critically important, work of moderating content on the platform.”Even before the threat of a U. S. ban, the company came under fire for allegedly censoring content deemed politically sensitive to the Chinese government, a charge TikTok denies. TikTok blockedand then unblockedone U. S. user who posted a video criticizing China’s government for its treatment of Uighur ethnic minority people. The company said a “human moderation error” caused the removal of the video. TikTok has made moves to localize its U. S. business and show the international market that it’s separate from its China-based parent company. In May it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who is American, to run TikTok. (Mayer holds dual roles as TikTok’s CEO and ByteDance’s chief operating officer.) TikTok has pointed to Mayer’s U. S. roots when asked about the Chinese government data-sharing allegations.“TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy in the U. S.,” a company spokespersontoldCNBC in July. TikTok also taken cues from U. S.-based Internet giants in responding to political issues related to Beijing. After the Chinese government enacted a controversial national security law in Hong Kong,Google,Facebook,Twitter, andothers announced they were halting some operations in the regionwhile they reviewed the law, which grants Hong Kong authorities far-reaching power over Internet data. TikTok went further,announcingon July 6 that “in light of recent events,” it was withdrawing from Hong Kong entirely. The company didn’t directly name the national security law, butanalysts saythe decision to pull out of Hong Kong was a direct response to the law and an effort by TikTok to illustrate its distance from Beijing and willingness to take issue with Chinese government data controls. Some U. S.-based ByteDance investors are in talks with ByteDance management to buy a majority stake in TikTok, The Informationreportedon Tuesday. Such a sale would make TikTok majority-owned by U. S. shareholders rather than by Beijing-based ByteDance, and potentially could convince U. S. lawmakers that a ban of TikTok isn’t necessary. Larry Kudlow, a White House economic adviser,said last week that a TikTok spinoff from ByteDance would be better than a ban on the popular app.“I think TikTok is going to pull out of the holding company, which is China-run, and operate as an independent American company,” Kudlowsaid,declining to comment on whether U. S. companies could acquire TikTok. Even before the Trump administration publicly leveled the threat of the TikTok ban, the app was looking beyond the U. S. market and its tens of millions of American users. In November, when U. S. lawmakers escalated their scrutiny of TikTok, ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yimingsaidin an internal staff note that the company needed to “diversify TikTok’s growth,” “increase investment in weaker markets,” and improve its skill in “handling global public affairs,” without specifically mentioning U. S. pressure. The number of countries where TikTok is facing pressure has grown this year. Outside of the U. S., TikTok was banned in India last month, and some politicians have called for bans in Australia and the U. K. TikTok has been mulling a global HQoutside of Chinasince late last year to distance itself from its Chinese owner, and it’s reportedly stillconsideringLondon—its existing hub in Europe—as a base. The ongoing U. K.-China feud, which saw the U. K. recently ban Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei from its 5G rollout, had cast doubt on whether TikTok would continue its U. K. expansion plans.“It’s very clear that ByteDance [is] trying to do as much as [it] can to make TikTok a separate company that operates globally, thinks globally, and does not think and act like a Chinese company,” Dev Lewis, a fellow at Hong Kong–based research think tank Digital Asia Hub, toldearlier this month. Whether its efforts succeed remains to be seen since, as Lewis said, “TikTok will always be caught in the middle” of China’s geopolitical disputes.",3,Reliable,0.0447487065779748,0.3247856614929785,1551,3,Fortune

546,Condo Buildings Are at Risk. So Is All Real Estate.,0.0,40.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/surfside-tower-was-just-another-condo-building/619348/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"The disaster in Surfside, Florida, focuses attention on condominiums’ flaws, but all forms of property ownership carry the potential for ugly surprises. After most ofa condominium tower in Surfside, Florida, collapsed last week, the second-guessing began almost immediately. Some residents accused the building’s condominium association of acting too slowly to address known structural flaws identified in a 2018 engineering report. Recent news stories have emphasized dissension among the owners. As someone who studies condos—their history, architecture, politics, and social dynamics, in Florida and all over the United States—I, too, have been wondering whether the building’s divided ownership contributed to the June 24 catastrophe, which killed at least 18 people and left more than 140 missing. Could a single landlord have responded better to engineers’ and occupants’ concerns than an association of 136 homeowners?Condos have long been big business and a way of life in southeast Florida, which by the 1970s had become America’s center of condo living. Today roughly one in five homeowners in U. S. cities and suburbs lives in a multifamily complex rather than a single-family house, according to U. S. census figures; in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, that share rises to one in three. Surfside residents described Champlain Towers South as a genuine community: “There was a beautiful mixture of cultures and people in that building,”one local toldl. “People from South America, Cuban Jews, American Jews, American nationals.”In most ways, the tower in Surfside was no different from Florida’s thousands of other high-rise condo buildings. Those, meanwhile, face many of the same risks—most notably their proximity to the ocean during a time of sea-level rise—as single-owner apartment buildings and other concrete-and-steel properties along the Florida coast. A number of reports suggest that the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association functioned properly and had moved methodically,albeit amid considerable resistance, to figure out how to fix the problems that an engineer had identified. Investigators still have much to learn about the causes of the disaster. Thevagaries of the condo format, including the need to raise $15 million for repairs through a “special assessment” on the owners, might conceivably have slowed the building’s response to structural problems. Absentee ownership, common in many condo buildings, especially in resorts and cosmopolitan business centers, might have hindered repairs further. Derek Thompson: Why Manhattan’s skyscrapers are emptyAnd yet the collapse might also have been caused by other, yet-to-be-identified factors that didn’t turn up in the 2018 engineer’s report. “From what I see, [that report] didn’t look like something that I would say, ‘Get the people out,’” Norma Jean Mattei, a University of New Orleans engineering professor,told. “The deterioration played a part, but it wasn’t what caused this failure. Something else had to push this building over the top.” In other words, Champlain Towers South might have suffered not from bad ownership or bad governance but from bad circumstances and bad luck. Because of the disasterin Surfside, long-standing questions about condo-mania in Florida and elsewhere are resurfacing. The condo, like other forms of co-owned housing such as the co-op, occupies an ambiguous place in American life. Most American homebuyers have historically preferred single-family houses and understood other kinds of dwellings to be second-best. Geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists have argued for decades that the condo system is fundamentally unworkable, little more than a scheme cooked up by developers to seduce property buyers with good locations, luxury amenities, and hollow promises of community. Others saw condominium arrangements as an inevitable fiasco, worrying that an amateur group of owners couldn’t possibly run a building competently. Still, the individually owned apartment emerged in the 19th century in cities such as New York and Washington, D. C., for those who could afford a house but didn’t need or want one—with careful efforts in design and marketing to distinguish them from working-class tenements. The originator of the for-sale apartment in the U. S. in the 1880s opted for a simple system: the corporate-title “cooperative,” in which the association holds title to the entire complex and individual ownership is conveyed by perpetual, in many cases $1-a-year, “proprietary” leases. In some respects, this is a superior model. The single title enables associations to more easily take out commercial loans for repairs, while the leases allow them to evict owners who become a liability. Yet the power of the association, especially to screen resales, made mortgage lenders wary. And in a nation deeply committed to unfettered property ownership, it also limited the appeal of owning an apartment. Starting in the late 1950s, the mortgage industry, anticipating untapped demand, began to promote condominium arrangements in Florida, then nationally. As early as 1921, Congress questioned the entire premise of for-sale apartments, grilling homeowners about its viability. By 1974, an aggrieved owner, also testifying before Congress, asked, “Can a condominium actually work?” More recently, dysfunctional condo politics have been the stuff of TV comedy on shows such as. Since 2009, disputes between owners and homeowner associations have aired on Sunday mornings in South Florida on an AM radio show called “Condo Craze & HOAs,” hosted by the attorney Eric M. Glazer—a Judge Judy for the Condominium Coast. Behind much of the skepticism of the condo system were tensions between private rights in property and community obligations. Between the 1880s and World War I, co-owned buildings in the United States were mostly sponsored directly by future tenants (foreshadowing therecent wave ofin Berlin). By the 1920s, though, speculative developers came to dominate. To sell apartments, they learned to emphasize lifestyle, including ease of physical maintenance (“no lawn to mow,” read many an ad), while downplaying responsibilities. But owning an apartment, like any other property, comes with its own burdens—just ones less tangible than a lawn. No matter the system, ownership turns tenants, ready or not, into landlords: Members of a condominium automatically become co-owners of a corporate entity responsible for common elements. As nearly everyone who has ever owned an apartment in a large building knows, however, rare is the condo owner who’s attuned to this duty, and rarer still is the one who attends association meetings, let alone serves on the board of directors. Read: The hot new Millennial housing trend is a repeat of the Middle AgesAnd yet developers and sales agents recognized this gap early on. While honing their marketing strategies, they began to encourage buildings to hire “professional” management, leaving associations with few direct responsibilities. Governance could still be challenging. In co-ops in New York and D. C., where associations typically screen new buyers (ostensibly for reasons of financial security), battles erupted over whether to allow resales to Jewish people and, later, single women, Black people, and gay men. In more recent decades, residents of condo buildings have feuded over everything from cosmetic upgrades (redecorating lobbies) to the installation of EV charging stations. These disputes hint at why some early critics believed that condos would inevitably result in huge problems, including premature physical decay. These predictionsoccasionally proved true—but almost never in the U. S. In America, our faith in a stable and transparent real-estate system supersedes our deep-seated aversion to public oversight of private transactions. As a result, regulation of condominium-like arrangements in this country, even in freewheeling Florida, has been among the most robust in the world, making American condo ownersthe envy of their counterpartsin places as diverse as Australia, China, and Israel. People around the world following the news from Surfside are now aware of Miami-Dade County’s requirement that buildings undergo recertification by engineers or architects after 40 years. But since the 1970s, Florida has also introduced an array of other regulations to ensure safe, equitable, and relatively efficient governance of co-owned apartments, and other states have followed its lead in many ways. When developers experimented with locking associations into management contracts at uncompetitive rates (as detailed in John D. MacDonald’s 1977 disaster novel,), kept down sales prices by retaining ownership of common areas and renting them back to associations (also at inflated rates), or made monthly charges unsustainably low by retaining control over associations until an overwhelming majority of units were sold, the state outlawed these practices. To allow for a more timely and cost-effective resolution of disputes among owners, and between owners and associations, it set up provisions for resolving disputes outside the courts. None of this guarantees that, when major repairs become necessary, owners will be able to make decisions or raise money quickly. And even if states push associations harder to take the unique pitfalls of condo arrangements into account, owners are still exposed to other risks, including, in some cases, the uncertainties inherent to waterfront living amid climate change. Ultimately, the condo format could turn out to be a factor in the Surfside disaster, but any presumption of guilt now may provide false reassurance to people who have a stake in other forms of real estate—and face the ugly, rare, and sometimes catastrophic surprises that are a possibility in property ownership of every kind.​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

The news outlet -- which haschronicled the deeply divisive fight in Southlakeover how to teach race and racism in schools -- obtained an audio recording from a district meeting that included discussions about how to comply with a new Texas law, which lawmakers say was intended to bar “critical race theory” from classrooms. From the start, educators vehemently opposed the bill, saying it was vague andwould have a chilling effecton their ability to have honest conversations about America’s past and present. The new law -- similar to ones passed in other conservative states -- lists several broad topics that can’t be discussed and sets guidelines for talking about “controversial” subjects. It comes as conservative pundits and politicians have conflated critical race theory with schools’ diversity and inclusion efforts and anti-racism training, among other ideas. Receive our in-depth coverage of education issues and stories that affect North Texans. “Just try to remember the concepts of [House Bill] 3979,” Gina Peddy, a Carroll administrator, said in the recording obtained by NBC News. “And make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust, that you have one that has an opposing, that has other perspectives.”A teacher responded: “How do you oppose the Holocaust?”The author of a similar Senate bill, Sen. Bryan Hughes, denied that this was a proper interpretation of the new law. State Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills, wrote on Twitter that “Southlake just got it wrong.”“School administrators should know the difference between factual historical events and fiction,” Hancock wrote. “No legislation is suggesting the action this administrator is promoting.”Carroll ISD Superintendent Lane Ledbetter issued an apology to Southlake families late Thursday. He said the district recognizes that “there are not two sides of the Holocaust.”“As we continue to work through implementation of HB3979, we also understand this bill does not require an opposing viewpoint on historical facts,” he wrote. “As a district we will work to add clarity to our expectations for teachers and once again apologize for any hurt or confusion this has caused.”The comments stirred outrage. Texas Democratic Party Co-Executive Director Hannah Roe Beck condemned actions she called “terrifying.”“We’re seeing books banned, educators reprimanded for teaching authentic history, and kids deprived of their right to learn about the world they’re growing up in,” she said in a statement. “Texas Republicans are censoring education to pander to rightwing extremists -- and putting Texas families and kids in danger while they do.”The DMN Education Lab deepens the coverage and conversation about urgent education issues critical to the future of North Texas.

548,"As Herschel Walker eyes Senate run, a turbulent past emerges",-2.67,43.33,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"ATLANTA (AP) — At first glance, Herschel Walker has a coveted political profile for a potential Senate candidate in Georgia. He was a football hero at the University of Georgia before his long NFL career. He’s a business owner whose chicken products are distributed across the U. S. And he’s a Black conservative with backing from former President Donald Trump, a longtime friend. But an Associated Press review of hundreds of pages of public records tied to Walker’s business ventures and his divorce, including many not previously reported, sheds new light on a turbulent personal history that could dog his Senate bid. The documents detail accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife’s life, exaggerated claims of financial success and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior. Walker, now 59, has at times been open about his long struggle with mental illness, writing at length in a 2008 book about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, once known as multiple personality disorder. But it’s unclear how he would discuss these events as a candidate. Walker did not respond to requests for comment. Multiple emails went unanswered, although his executive assistant confirmed they were received. AP also sent emails and left a message with his long-time attorney, who did not respond. The Georgia seat is a top target for Republicans as they try to take control of the U. S. Senate in next year’s midterm elections. Walker’s potential bid is a wildcard. He might easily win the GOP primary with Trump’s help, setting up a general election fight against Democrat Raphael Warnock, who became Georgia’s first Black senator after a special election in January. But Republican leaders in Washington and Georgia are concerned that Walker’s history might haunt his campaign. Walker “certainly could bring a lot of things to the table,” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview. “But as others have mentioned, there’s also a lot of questions out there.”Walker has yet to announce his intentions, but he has been consulting with political advisers in Georgia. A native of tiny Wrightsville, between Atlanta and Savannah, the former Dallas Cowboys star retired after the 1997 season and now resides in Texas. In a video posted to Twitter last month, he revs the engine of a sports car and says, “I’m getting ready, and we can run with the big dogs,” before revealing a Georgia license plate. The Twitter tease intensified buzz about the potential for a celebrity candidate. But it also helped surface details about Walker’s troubled past, many first disclosed by Walker himself in his 2008 book, “Breaking Free.”His account details years of struggles and an eventual diagnosis in 2001. Walker describes himself dealing with as many as a dozen personalities — or “alters” — that he had constructed as a defense against bullying he suffered as a stuttering, overweight child. In an AP interview at the time, Walker emphasized his purpose was to help others with similar disorders. “People say, ‘Herschel is just trying to write something to make money,’” he said. “I say, ‘Guys, why would I write something like this to make money?’”The National Alliance on Mental Illness describes dissociative identity disorder as “alternating between multiple identities,” leaving a person with “gaps in memory of everyday events.” It notes men with the disorder “exhibit more violent behavior rather than amnesia.”In his book, Walker acknowledges violent urges. He writes that he played Russian roulette and recounts sitting at his kitchen table in 1991 pointing a gun, loaded with a single bullet, at his head. “I wasn’t suicidal,” Walker explained, but “just looked at mortality as the ultimate challenge.”The book is framed as a turnaround story. He describes it as cathartic and casts himself as someone on the path to “integration” because of therapy and his Christian faith. A watershed moment, he writes, came in February 2001, when he drove around suburban Dallas, hunting for a man who he said was avoiding his calls after being days late delivering a car Walker had purchased.“The logical side of me knew that what I was thinking of doing to this man — murdering him for messing up my schedule — wasn’t a viable alternative,” Walker wrote. “But another side of me was so angry that all I could think was how satisfying it would feel to step out of the car, pull out the gun, slip off the safety, and squeeze the trigger.”Ultimately, Walker wrote, he had a change of heart after seeing a “SMILE. JESUS LOVES YOU” bumper sticker on the man’s car-hauling truck. He decided to seek professional help.“I’d been running for most of life, from what only I really knew but seldom talked about. It was time to stop running and face some harsh realities,” he wrote. Walker’s threatening behavior continued well after the 2001 revelation, according to court records obtained by AP that have not previously been reported. Four years later, in December 2005, Cindy Grossman, Walker’s ex-wife, secured a protective order against him, alleging violent and controlling behavior. Grossman has said she was long a victim of Walker’s impulses. When his book was released, she told ABC News that at one point during their marriage, her husband pointed a pistol at her head and said, “I’m going to blow your f’ing brains out.” She filed for divorce in 2001, citing “physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior.”In seeking protection from a judge in Dallas County, Grossman filed an affidavit from her sister, which described Walker as unwilling to accept that his former wife had begun dating another man. Grossman told the court she got calls during that period from her sister and father, both of whom had been contacted by Walker. He told family members that he would kill her and her new boyfriend, according to Maria Tsettos, Cindy Grossman’s sister. In an affidavit, Tsettos claimed Walker once called looking for his ex-wife while she was out with her boyfriend. Tsettos took the call and said Walker became “very threatening” when told of Grossman’s whereabouts. In Tsettos’ recollection, Walker “stated unequivocally that he was going to shoot my sister Cindy and her boyfriend in the head.”On another occasion, Tsettos said she talked to Walker “at length” after he’d reached out to her online. He “expressed to me that he was frustrated with (Cindy) and that he felt like he had ‘had enough’ and that he wanted to ‘blow their f------ heads off,’” she recalled of the Dec. 9, 2005, exchange. Two days later he called again and told Tsettos that he possessed a gun and planned that day to act on his threats, which he repeated in graphic language, she said. Later that day, Walker confronted his ex-wife outside a mall when she was picking up their son from a party, according to her petition for a protective order. In her account, she said Walker “slowly drove by in his vehicle, pointed his finger at (her) and traced (her) with his finger as he drove.”When officers in Irving, Texas, contacted Walker, he denied that he’d made the threats, according to a police report the AP obtained through a public records request. But the sister’s account was concerning enough to police that they took for “safe keeping” a gun Walker had on the floor of his car, the report states. A judge agreed, finding “good cause” to issue a protective order. He also barred Walker from possessing guns for a period of time. Grossman, her divorce lawyer and Tsettos did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP. Walker’s unpredictable behavior has carried into his chicken business, now known as Renaissance Man Food Services, according to court filings. His book itself was a shock. The primary distributor of his products considered severing their relationship after Walker’s book came out. Kristin Caffey, then a poultry manager for the food distributor Sysco, said the revelations in the book, as well as Walker’s effort to publicize it, created “havoc” for the company.“We weren’t aware that it was coming out, and we were blindsided,” Caffey, who worked directly with Walker, said in a 2019 deposition. “We had all kinds of people calling in about it, and we didn’t have answers to it,” she added, saying, “it was problematic for us being engaged with him at the time.”Ultimately, the company chose to stick with Walker after the negative publicity died down, Caffey said. More recently, Walker has made outsize claims about his business record. In repeated media interviews, Walker claimed his company employed hundreds of people, included a chicken processing division in Arkansas and grossed $70 million to $80 million annually in sales. However, when the company applied for a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan last year, it reported just eight employees. (It received about $182,000 in COVID-19 aid.)In a recent court case, Walker gave far more modest revenue figures, indicating that the company averaged about $1.5 million a year in profit from 2008 to 2017. Meanwhile, Walker’s business associates testified in the same case that he doesn’t own chicken processing plants, as he claims. Instead, they described him as a licensing partner who lends his name to the enterprise — not unlike the kind of deals his friend Donald Trump has used to expand his brand for decades. A wrongful termination lawsuit filed in 2018 by a friend and former manager of Walker’s company created an extensive record of Walker’s leadership. Although a judge ruled against the employee, John Staples, emails, documents and depositions in the case present Walker as a temperamental and unreliable business partner. Walker persistently complained that his business partners were trying to cheat him out of money, the documents say. And they indicate he repeatedly fought with his associates over his focus on branching into frozen waffles, which he believed would be a future moneymaker for the company. In 2017, an executive for the company that supplied chicken to Walker sent a concerned email, inquiring about $7,200 in expenses he said Walker had incorrectly tried to bill the company from his efforts to secure the waffle deal. The executive, now Simmons Foods Chief Operating Officer and President David Jackson, also cited “concerning comments” he’d heard that “raise questions about how the business is being operated.” The email does not detail the comments that raised alarms. Staples did not respond to requests for comment. Jackson’s office did not make him available for comment, and a message left with a spokesperson for Simmons Foods was not returned. In a deposition, Walker dismissed Staples as a “puppy.”“I’m a big dog. I don’t play with puppies,” Walker said. Since then, another business venture tied to Walker could also face trouble. Last month, a Texas bank sued Walker and another business partner over an unpaid $200,000 debt secured to help finance a pizza restaurant. According to court filings, Walker personally guaranteed the loan. Walker has not yet filed his response to the suit.

State claims declined by another 12,312 from 51,747, the U. S. Department of Labor reported Thursday. The numbers are the lowest since the coronavirus pandemic gripped the economy and caused unemployment to surge to unprecedented numbers in March. Nationally, the claims figure dipped below 1 million for the first time in months to 881,000, a decrease of 130,000 from the previous week of 1,011,000.“We’ll take good news when we can get it,” said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate. “Jobless claims came in better than expected and are on the decline.”But in some ways, he said, “the economy is now engaged in a tug of war,”“On one side, the housing market, auto sales, ascendant stock market and resurging manufacturing are flexing strength,” he said. “On the other, the leisure and hospitality, aspects of retailing, travel-related, energy, agricultural and commercial real estate and construction sectors are struggling.”As of Tuesday, the most recent day for which data is available, the state Department of Economic Opportunity had paid 1,937,633 people nearly $14.7 billion instate and federal unemployment benefits. Most of the money includes weekly payments of $600 under a federal program that expired at the end of July. More than 3.6 million jobless claims have been processed since mid-March, representing 99.1% of those submitted, the agency said. But there was still no word from the state as to when temporary $300 weekly payments from the federal government would start flowing to eligible unemployed workers in Florida. Last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Florida had applied to Washington to participate in a “Lost Wage Assistance Program” authorized by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. The application was approved by FEMA, which is providing the funding from a $44 billion pool of emergency disaster money. Last Friday, DeSantis said he expected thepayments would be retroactive to Aug. 1. To be eligible, jobless workers must be collecting at least $100 per week in unemployment insurance compensation through state or federal programs. Labor market in a “modest” upswing, Atlanta Fed saysIn the meantime, the labor market recovery continued its modest improvement “as firms slowly recalled workers,” according to the most recent periodic “Beige Book” summary of the Southeast’s economy by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The bank’s conclusions are based on interviews with business contacts in the region, which includes Florida.“Although labor conditions improved modestly since the previous report, payrolls remain below pre-COVID levels and the outlook for further improvements was less certain,” said the report, which was released Wednesday. “Firms continued to slowly recall workers as demand returned. However, many [businesses] noted that some prior staff cutbacks were permanent, and others had used attrition to reduce headcount.”Tourism and hospitality, one of the worst sectors of the COVID-19 job market, remained soft. Retail job opportunities were mixed as consumers who own homes kept the home improvement and renovation segment strong, but clothing sales stayed soft. Auto dealers said sales increased. Homebuyers kept real estate sales agents busy as residential sales strengthened. Manufacturing “accelerated somewhat,” while banks said that loan growth had slowed and underwriting standards got tighter. Two weeks ago, the state reported that private sector businesses in Florida added 74,100 between June and July. Hospitality job losses in South Florida outpaced nationTotal nonfarm employment for South Florida stood at 2,476,400 in July, down 202,500 from the same month of 2019, the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a monthly report issued Wednesday. Regional Commissioner Janet S. Rankin noted that the region’s year-over-year employment loss in July was greater than the 191,000 jobs lost in June. Employment in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach region’s leisure and hospitality sector fell sharply by 85,200 for the 12 months ending in July, the largest loss of jobs among local major industry sectors. The sector declined 26.1% in South Florida. Nationwide, the job loss rate was 24.2%,Florida’s tourism industry has been leveled by the pandemic.

553,Engaging North Korea Anew,-4.0,47.0,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2020-11-17/engaging-north-korea-anew,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-17,17,"In 2016, U. S. President Barack Obama met then President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office for the customary handover. The outgoing president told his successor that he would need to deal with North Korea as the country’s most proximate security threat. Four years later, President-elect Joe Biden will find that diplomacy on North Korea has at best floundered under Trump. Made-for-TV summits have accomplished little beyond allowing North Korea to expand and deepen its nuclear weapons arsenal. As it did during the last two U. S. presidencies, North Korea will likely provoke the new administration by carrying out missile or nuclear tests. These will in turn drive administration policy in a tough direction. Yet more UN and U. S. sanctions are unlikely to prove any more effective than the many previous ones. Meanwhile, North Korea is inching toward—or perhaps already possesses—the capacity to hit U. S. cities with multiple nuclear warheads on long-range strategic weapons. President Biden must learn what has worked, and what has not, from past approaches to halt the world’s only runaway nuclear weapons program. He will require a strategy that draws on both diplomacy and coercion to prevent the North from acquiring a nuclear force that the United States cannot neutralize without possible retaliation. Washington and its allies will need to bolster their deterrence and defense capabilities while halting threatening elements of North Korea’s program (for example, testing, production of fissile material, and nuclear transfer to rogue actors). Biden’s least bad option will combine elements of past policies with a political approach that is boldly new. The United States has had a hard time devising a denuclearization policy toward North Korea that doesn’t backfire and lead on a circular path to more nuclear weapons. Pyongyang now has amassed roughly 20 to 30 nuclear warheads and fissile material for scores more, according to experts. It has carried out more than100ballistic missile tests in the last three decades. Denuclearization is not a near-term possibility, and insisting on it has proved not to work. In fact, it has resulted in more nuclear tests. Obama tried a policy of “strategic patience,” waiting out the North Koreans and pressuring them with sanctions, but that didn’t work: the North carried out 61 missile tests during Obama’s two terms. Trump tried summit diplomacy and a “bromance” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un—another approach that didn’t deliver. Despite all the glad-handing in Singapore and Hanoi, North Korea has conducted 30 ballistic missile tests since the Trump-Kim Hanoi summit in February 2019 and proudly paraded two massive new sea- and ground-based long-range ballistic missiles last month, while continuing to churn out untold amounts of fissile material. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry once said that the United States must deal with North Korea as it is rather than as it would wish it to be. In practice, this means adopting a denuclearization strategy that contends with North Korea as a de facto nuclear weapons state. The first priority in that case should be to rein in a runaway program. The United States must deal with North Korea as it is rather than as it would wish it to be. Washington has done this before. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made agreements, in 1994 and 2005–7, respectively, that outlined the incremental steps each side would take to freeze nuclear operations at the main nuclear complex, Yongbyon, in return for some sanctions relief. The Biden administration will want a more comprehensive plan, one that adds new measures to curtail the program’s growth. Experts on the two sides would need to work closely with one another, and given the high level of mutual distrust, the two countries would need to agree on detailed mechanisms for verifying each other’s compliance. The Biden administration should first negotiate an initial verifiable freeze of all plutonium and uranium nuclear operations in and around the Yongbyon nuclear complex. Additionally, it should seek a stop to North Korea’s fissile material production. Such a mini-deal—unlike the all-the-weapons-for-all-the-sanctions deal that Trump failed to achieve in Hanoi—will be criticized by Republicans, but it is the most pragmatic way forward. Moreover, while negotiations are ongoing, North Korea will likely pause its provocations—whichpolicymakers in the United States and South Korea can sell to domestic audiences. China, South Korea, and Japan would likely support such a freeze on operations and production. In the past, this approach has often led to an impasse: the freeze attained, North Korea then refuses to provide a verifiable declaration of its nuclear and missile inventory. The Biden administration will need to shift the terms of negotiation if it is to avoid this dead end. Agreements under both Bush and Trump referenced a “new relationship” but failed to play one out. Without a fundamental transformation of the political relations between the two countries, nuclear negotiations will continue to be tit for tat and eventually collapse. After negotiating the freeze agreement, the Biden administration’s approach should shift the focus of the negotiations from simply stopping all North Korean nuclear operations to laying a pathway for that “new relationship.” The two countries could seek to normalize ties with a peace declaration, a dialogue on human rights, security assurances, and the North’s pledge not to transfer weapons, material, or technology. The United States and North Korea would then negotiate new denuclearization steps, including a verifiable declaration, in an atmosphere of greatly reduced distrust. Such a political approach will appeal to Biden if officials with a humanitarian focus, such as Susan Rice or Samantha Power, are steering U. S. diplomacy. The human rights element would align with U. S. values and could provide a credible signal of North Korean intentions, so long as Kim is willing to make concessions—releasing South Korean detainees, for example, or allowing aid and visits to orphanages. The South Korean and Chinese governments would support pursuing a peace declaration as part of a political settlement but would balk at pushing North Korea too hard on human rights. If the United States presents this as a comprehensive approach, where the basket of peace declaration and sanctions relief (things that Kim wants) can be discussed only with the human rights basket, then Kim might be inclined to talks. If the bid fails, it will give a good indication of whether the isolated regime truly seeks to end purported U. S. “hostile policy” and wants to join the community of nations. After political relations, negotiations might then shift to establishing a framework for North Korea’s long-term abandonment of all nuclear weapons and programs. The talks should focus on threat reduction and arms control in the short term. Such an approach has no precedent in U. S. negotiations with North Korea, but it does have antecedents in arms control talks during the Cold War. The parties would seek to cap and contain the most dangerous elements of North Korea’s weapons programs in order to stop their growth and minimize chances of inadvertent use, proliferation, and leakage. The countries would open a nuclear deterrence dialogue to avoid nuclear miscalculation, cooperate on nuclear safety (avoiding meltdowns and loose nukes), and limit the range and payload of missiles. In order to avert criticism that the United States is resigned to accepting North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, Biden would have to frame these agreements as interim steps on the path to a verifiable declaration and ultimate denuclearization. China and South Korea would accept such an approach, as long as it did not supplant the ultimate pursuit of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. Japan would be ambivalent if the strategy suggested a de facto acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear weapons state. An engagement strategy is most effective and credible when backed by strength. Biden will need to work with U. S. allies, not over their heads as Trump has done, in dealing with the North and with China. He must maintain and improve the deterrence and defense capabilities of U. S. partners in the region, including by negotiating early defense cost-sharing agreements with Korea and Japan, reinstating military readiness exercises, and expanding missile defense and intelligence cooperation, and even consider joint offensive strike capabilities. The Biden administration should retain tough sanctions unless or until the NorthKoreansstart to take the nuclear and political steps forward on the roadto denuclearization. And it shouldconsult with Seoul and Tokyo regarding any steps in negotiations that might render bilateral alliance interests vulnerable. Republicans are sure to become super-hard-liners on North Korea as soon as Trump leaves office. Critics will suggest that the United States demand unconditional denuclearization, but that stance is unrealistic given the size of North Korea’s program; it lacks regional support, and it has repeatedly proved counterproductive. Biden can consider holding summit meetings, and he should pocket Kim’s denuclearization commitment to Trump in Singapore, but summits will avail little without spadework on the matters outlined above. A political strategy, accompanied by incremental steps to contain North Korea’s nuclear program, may sound unpalatable, but previous approaches have not worked. Moreover, the longer Washington goes without a strategy, the likelier that North Korea will perfect its ability to hit the United States with multiple nuclear missiles. Integrating the policies that have worked in the past with some new elements may be the least worst choice in a land of lousy options.",3,Reliable,0.0435573353522071,0.4475780012959499,2033,3,Foreign Affairs

But when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Clegg, who is Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, about Haugen’s claims, specifically about how the company’s algorithms boosted content ahead of January 6, he gave a roundabout non-answer. He said that if the company removed Facebook’s current algorithm, which amplifies posts with more “meaningful social interactions,” that would perpetuate “more, not less, hate speech, more, not less, misinformation.”Bash then put him on the spot: “My question is specifically about January 6. Did the algorithms that are in place amplify pro-insurrection voices ahead of January 6th? Yes or no.” “I can’t give you a yes or no answer,” he finally conceded, before pivoting to argue that the responsibility for the insurrection was on “the people who broke the law.”Haugen, who has already testified before Congress, is set to go this Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection.

Watchara Phomicinda/ZumaCenter for Public Integrity. He was a poultry worker and a Mexican immigrant. But those details weren’t documented when Rodolfo Tinoco became one of more than203,000who’ve died so far from COVID-19 in the United States. Tinoco died May 12 at 63, after a month-long struggle in Gainesville, Georgia, a rural northeastern community in Hall County that calls itself the “Poultry Capital of the World.”Georgia health officials argue it’s hard to know how Tinoco contracted the coronavirus. Tinoco’s family in Mexico says that the Hall County doctor who cared for Rodolfo said he probably was exposed at the Pilgrim’s Pride chicken-processing plant in Gainesville, where Tinoco worked for many years.“The doctor said other workers had the virus, too,” said Rodolfo’s brother, Gerardo, reached in Zitácuaro, Mexico. From public records, though, it’s hard to know that Rodolfo even worked in a poultry plant or that he died of COVID-19. His brief localobituarylists no job, place of birth or cause of death. Pilgrim’s Pride declined to confirm or deny he was an employee. And Georgia’s officialCOVID-19 websiteestimates only total cases and virus deaths suffered by Latinos statewide. The ethnicity of individuals who’ve died in each county isn’t disclosed—only victims’ ages, if they had a pre-existing condition and whether their race was white, African-American, Asian, unknown or other. If a victim was Latino, as Tinoco was, it’s not noted. And that omission of ethnicity is significant. Immigrants, especially Latinos, are risking their health in Hall County and across the country as essential workers who grow, harvest and process food for Americans—while many of their families are blocked from the most basic COVID-19 financial support, including federal stimulus checks, other taxpayers were eligible to receive. Nationwide, research shows Latinos are among thehardest hitby COVID-19. ACenter for Public Integritycounty-by-county analysis drives home how crucial Latino immigrants are to US farm and food-processing industries nationwide. The analysis was drawn from Census Bureau survey data collected byIPUMS USAat the University of Minnesota. Focusing on 10 industries, Public Integrity found 1.87 million workers in front-line farm and food processing jobs, 790,000 of whom are immigrants. That’s about 43 percent, a share that’s two-and-a-half times the percent of immigrants in the total US workforce. Nearly nine in 10 of the immigrant farm and food-processing workers are Latino. In Georgia’s Hall County, the estimated share of immigrants is even more pronounced. Public Integrity found that 78 percent of nearly 6,280 front-line food-production workers are immigrants. About 72 percent of these workers are Latino immigrants, and about 67 percent are Latino non-US citizens. Some non-citizens could be undocumented. Some could have green cards, which gives them legal permanent resident status. Most are employees of poultry-processing factories that help make Georgia the number one statein the country for production of chicken. The Pew Research Center estimates that 65 percent of the immigrant population in the Gainesville metropolitan area is undocumented. That’s the highest proportion in any metro area in the United States. Gainesville and Hall County’s reliance on immigrant workers stands in contrast to its political preferences. The town has a population of 43,232 and is 42 percent Latino. Hall County’s population of 204,441 is 29 percent Latino. But 73 percent of Hall County voters in 2016 supported President Donald Trump, who has called for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and the curtailing of legal immigration that the US food industry relies on. Gainesville Mayor Danny Dunagan, who owns a dry cleaning business, is among those who supported Trump. “I’m not a socialist, and that’s what Democrats are going toward,” he said. He claimed that Trump’s not against immigrants: “He just wants them to come legally.”Arturo Adame, a 29-year-old Latino, grew up in Hall County and many of his older family members were poultry workers. He’s concerned about workers’ safety and has volunteered to pass out masks to employees as they come and go from plants that run round the clock. He’s disturbed at what he perceives is hypocritical support for Trump while the community profits from immigrant labor.“We have chicken festivals, and chicken statues in town,” Adame said. “But when it comes to immigration, they just put their heads under the covers.”Hall County resident Maria Del Rosario Palacios, 30, believes Trump played on racism—and Americans’ unfamiliarity with the immigration system—to win support in 2016, even in communities that depend heavily on immigrant labor. Once undocumented herself, Palacios told Public Integrity about Tinoco’s death. She said she feels that he died in obscurity and unfairly, after laboring in an industry now operating under anexecutive orderTrump issued April 29 that forced it to stay open to keep the meat supply coming. Tinoco was her mother’s co-worker. For much of the summer, Palacio said, her mother has been sick with COVID-19. She’s been living on disability payments that are 60 percent of her salary. Tinoco was also undocumented until he received amnesty through a law President Ronald Reagan signed in 1986, his brother Gerardo said. Unlike the majority of Hall County immigrants, Rodolfo died an American, he said, because the amnesty enabled him to apply for US citizenship. Although Pilgrim’s Pride declined to confirm or deny Tinoco’s employment, the company sent a statement: “While we cannot know for certain how, where or when a team member has been infected given the widespread nature of the virus, each case is heartbreaking. Our sympathies go out to everyone who has been impacted by this common enemy we all face.”The Northeast Georgia Health System, in which Tinoco was treated, also sent a statement in response to what Gerardo Tinoco said about how his brother contracted the virus. “Unfortunately, our physicians cannot prove whether Mr. Tinoco was exposed to the virus during a trip to the grocery store, while pumping gas, when working or elsewhere,” wrote infections specialist Sandy Bozarth. Since Tinoco’s death, Hall County has steadily remained a virus hot spot in Georgia, with Latinos disproportionately affected, according to local tracking the county submits to the state. Latinos who are mostly of Mexican origin represent 29 percentof county residents but have often accounted for half of COVID-19 cases. By Sept. 25, with cases still spiking, Latinos accounted for at least 34 percent of at least 9,147 virus cases. The ethnicity of 23 percent of the people known to have COVID-19 in the county is “unknown,” records at that time show. Pressed for information on the ethnicity of Hall County residents who’ve died, county officials provided Public Integrity with internal lists of unnamed individuals. As of Sept. 25, at least 30 of 151 residents who’d died were Latino, according to the county. But the internal list omits individuals’ occupations and ages, making it impossible—just like state records—to track how many Latino victims were working-age people, and who possibly could have been workers in poultry plants. On May 8, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) warned that workers at meatpacking plants had died and that plants are vectors for the coronavirus. The agency urged plants to take “prompt action” to reduce risk by requiring protective gear for workers and instituting distancing measures. Mike Giles, president of the Gainesville-based Georgia Poultry Federation, an industry group, declined an interview. But in an email he said that poultry plants have instituted CDC-recommended safety measures, including taking workers’ temperatures, disinfecting work surfaces, requiring masks and face shields, installing partitions between workers and implementing stay-at-home policies for those who are sick. He provided a link to another industry group,the National Chicken Council, for details.“I do not have access to each company’s policy,” Giles wrote, “but paid sick leave and relaxing of sick leave policies have been common practices in the industry during the response.”Theessential workersidentified in Public Integrity’s analysis of the food industry produce, process and transport crops and meat, dairy products and baked goods, and keep equipment working. Their work increases risk of virus exposure because they’re in close contact with one another at worksites and in transit. With some exceptions—such as farms that plowed under spring crops because restaurants shut down—many worksites remained open or reopened early in the pandemic while other businesses were shutting down to stop the spread of COVID-19. About 37 percent of the 790,000 workers identified as immigrants nationwide are in California, the nation’s biggest supplier of fruits, vegetables and dairy products. Florida, Washington state and Arizona also have large shares. Latino immigrants are also the backbone of food-production businesses throughout the United States—including many counties that, like Hall County, voted heavily in 2016 for Trump. In the chicken-processing center of Marshall County, Alabama, for example, out of an estimated 2,060 food-production workers, the biggest concentration in Alabama, 51 percent are immigrants—with 75 percent of 614 poultry butchers who are non-US citizens mostly of Latino descent. Trump vowed not only to deport undocumented Mexican workers during his campaign, he also vowed to slashimmigration, attacking mostlyLatino and Asiannewcomers as“low-skilled”and a fiscal burden on Americans. Many legal immigrants eligible for sponsorship byrelativeshave historically been willing to go into these grueling farm and processing jobs or other lower-wage jobs as they begin a new life. The US Department of Agriculture estimates roughly half of farmworkers nationally areundocumentedresidents of US communities.“If you’re so against undocumented immigrants, then just stop eating 50 percent of what’s on your plate, right now,” said Erik Nicholson, who was a national vice president of the California-based United Farm Workers union (UFW) until he resigned last month to become a consultant. Giles of the Georgia Poultry Federation said that in the past, the federation had supported immigration reform proposals that would have legalized longtime undocumented workers. Labor unions also support legalization. But for 20 years, Congress failed to reform immigration laws, and employers continued to hire undocumented workers. During the Trump presidency, the poultry federation has gone largely silent on the topic, as Trump solidified a fervent “no amnesty” GOP position.“We need them for the economy,” said Dunagan, Gainesville’s mayor. But outside of a few temporary visas for seasonal specialty work only—to shell crabs, for example—the United States doesn’t grantvisasto work in meatpacking, or to milk cows on dairies or perform year-round farm work, even if businesses prove domestic labor shortages. There’s also no line for undocumented people in Hall County or anywhere else to legalize their status unless they have a family sponsor, who, in most cases, would have to be an American spouse or sibling. And even if they do have such a sponsor, if they dare come forward to try to petition to legalize, they’re at risk of mandatoryexile from the United Statesfor a minimum of 10 years as punishment for being undocumented. Dunagan, like many Americans, said he was unaware of visa limits, or that Trump wants to slash family-sponsored immigration, eliminating that opportunity for parents and siblings of naturalized citizens. Dunagan said he’s not opposed to “idiots” in Washington figuring out how to legalize people whom industries need.“But I don’t get into it that much, because there’s not much I can do about it,” he said. Because of mostly Republican resistance in Congress, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES)Act passed in March excluded millions of undocumented workers in all industries, including food production, from COVID-19 stimulus checks. To cut out undocumented workers, the legislation excluded workers who file taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), as undocumented workers often do. If an undocumented worker files taxes jointly with US citizen or legal resident spouse, whole“mixed-status” families, including US citizen children, are alsoexcluded. Local emergency cash programs to prevent evictions or utilities from being shut off—which have received COVID-19 federal relief money—are almost always off-limits to the undocumented, who don’t qualify for unemployment, either. Advocates for immigrant workers urge extending COVID-19 cash relief to essential workers, regardless of immigration status and workers’ use of ITINs to file taxes. In May, Democrats in the US House of Representatives addressed this exclusion of undocumented workers and “mixed-status” families in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act. The proposal would widen eligibility to workers using ITINs to file taxes and would also shield essential workers from deportation during the pandemic. But the bill went nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. Nicholson, who served 18 years with the UFW, pointed out that Congress and Trump gave specific bailouts for agribusiness employers who suffered virus-related crop losses, but didn’t obligate them to share funds with farmworkers. “Out of$9.5 billion in bailouts, to our dismay, not a single line item was there to protect farmworkers,” Nicholson said, referring to a provision to aid crop producers in the CARES Act. Public Integrity spoke with two undocumented poultry workers in Hall County who both have spouses and children, and who were sick with COVID-19 for weeks in late spring. At times they were so ill they sought medical treatment, even though they don’t have health insurance. Once they recovered, neither were fully reimbursed for the workdays they lost. Another undocumented poultry worker in Gainesville was sick in a local hospital while the worker’s spouse and children were left to rely on donations and support from others in the Latino community, the worker’s family told Public Integrity. Latino-led civic groups in Hall County and other communities around the country are organizing food drives so immigrant families suffering income loss at least have food. For Palacios, the virus has exposed systemic inequality in Hall County that predates the pandemic. She was a poultry worker as a younger woman and recalled a time when immigrant workers objected to conditions at a plant where she worked, only to be rebuffed by managers.“Y’all got cousins out there who will take your jobs,” she said a manager told them. A Georgia state law requires businesses with 10 or more workers to screen applicants withE-Verify, a computer system designed to flag fraudulent work authorization documents. But workers and businesses find ways around the system, immigrants say. In April, when Trump ordered meat-packing companies to stay open, hisexecutive orderalso authorized Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue to require crop and food producers to continue operating should the administration decide it necessary. Non-citizen immigrants dominate crop production even more than in meatpacking, Public Integrity’s data analysis shows. Monterey County, California, known as the “Salad Bowl of the World,” produces more than $4 billion worth of crops a year, including 28 percent of the nation’s strawberries and more than half of US lettuce. Public Integrity found that 88 percent of nearly 26,240 Monterey County crop and food-processing workers, including some who process seafood, are immigrants, 83 percent of them non-US citizens. A Monterey County immigrant farmworker—whose identity Public Integrity is not disclosing to protect her family—shares struggles similar to those of meatpackers in Hall County, Georgia. Originally from Mexico, the woman and her three children didn’t receive a stimulus check, even though she pays taxes and has been a farmworker here for 20 years.“I’m in a mixed-status family, so I didn’t qualify, which is unjust,” she said. Now 37, she obtained legal status through a visa program forcrime victimswho cooperate with law enforcement. But her tax-paying husband remains undocumented. This summer, she’s harvesting strawberries from 6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., five days a week. Her husband lost work for some weeks when the pandemic hit, enough to force the couple to have to borrow money to pay bills. “It’s all so much that I began to feel dizzy,” the farmworker said. “A doctor told me it’s vertigo from stress.”Compared to other regions, Monterey’s local Latino-led health services are more supportive of workers, and the county stands out for its tracking of virus infections byoccupation. At times, farmworkers have accounted for almost 40 percent of virus cases, although they’re 18 percent of the county’s labor force. Since April, Monterey has promoted safetyguidelinesand limits on how many farmworkers can travel together on buses to reach work sites. It’s also set up shelters so infected workers can quarantine alone and avoid exposing families. On June 11, theCDC and the US. Department of Laborpublished similar infection-control guidance for farm employers nationwide. Advocates warned offarmworkers’ vulnerabilityand appealed to administration officials to mandatesafety measures. The Department of Labor rejected the appeals. Since spring, virus outbreaks have erupted at farm worksites inNew Jersey,North CarolinaandCalifornia. Workers in Yakima County, Washington, went on strike in May to demand safer conditions in sheds where they pack the nation’s biggest supply ofapples and sweet cherries. David Cruz, one of the workers striking, fell ill and was intubated for 18 days before he died. The virus is stillaffecting Latinosin Yakima at a far higher rate than white non-Latinos. In New York state, anundocumented dairy workerbecame Cayuga County’s first virus-related fatality in April. Volunteers had to raise money to send his ashes home to Guatemala. Nationwide, infections and deaths of farmworkers could be underreported because of language barriers and workers fear they’ll lose income if they have to quarantine, according to COVID-19health researchersand the National Center for Farmworker Health. In Santa Barbara County, California, health officials discovered in late July they’d been accidentallyundercounting COVID-19 deaths; out of 28 deaths that hadn’t been acknowledged, 10 victims were agricultural workers. And in Michigan in August, employers sued to block an Aug. 3 state public health order requiring employers of 20 or more farmworkers to test them for the virus. Officials had already identified 21 outbreaks at worksites. Employers argued the order targeted Latino workers and thus violated their civil rights. Afederal judgeon Aug. 14 declined to block the order. Public Integrity found that more than a quarter of front-line food-production workers in Michigan are immigrants. Among Florida’s much bigger population of food-production workers, 61 percent of about 67,830 workers are immigrants. An undocumented farmworker from Mexico, who’s labored in Florida for 14 years and asked for anonymity, cares for orange groves in Highlands County for $10 an hour. Her husband’s hours in the field were slashed this spring when the pandemic shut down Florida tourism and demand for vegetables shrank. The family depends on donations that affluent Latinos have provided to increasingly destitute immigrant workers.“This sickness is going to last,” the farmworker said. For coronavirus testing; many Latino poultry processors and family have turned to the Murray Medical and Wellness Centers clinic in Oakwood; Hall County; Georgia; where Latinos have been disproportionately infected. Courtesy Patty Delgado; Murray Medical and Wellness CentersTwo days after Trump issued his executive order forcing food plants to re-open, the CDC issued its first report onCOVID-19 among meat and poultry workers, with data submitted by fewer than half of the states. At least 20 workers had died by the end of April, and at least 4,913 had been infected in those states. Four workers had perished in Delaware’s rural Sussex County, where Public Integrity found that immigrants comprise 88 percent of nearly 420 jobs as poultry butchers and 67 percent of 740 meat packagers. Delaware health officials declined to say if or how many of the dead were immigrants, arguing that disclosing that information could violate families’ privacy.reported on the death of one worker who was a Mexican immigrant. ACDC updateissued July 7 painted an ever darker picture. Data from 28 states indicated at least 16,233 processing workers had COVID-19 and 86 had died by May 31. According to the July CDC report, Georgia reported 509 poultry workers had been infected at 14 plants and one had died as of May 31. In fact, by early April,four workers had succumbed to the virusat a Tyson’s Foods plant in Camilla, in southern Georgia. Three were Black women who wereunion workers.reported in May that two Latino men in their 60s had also died. The Latino men worked at a Fieldale Farms poultry plant in Habersham County, adjacent to Hall County. Counting Rodolfo Tinoco’s unrecognized death in Hall County, at least seven poultry workers had died of the coronavirus in Georgia by the end of May. Nancy Nydam, a Georgia Department of Health spokeswoman, said data reported to the CDC was accurate based on information the state had at the time. She also said Georgia health officials believe community spread—not workplace exposure—is the root of most virus cases.“A death or infection in a poultry plant worker,” Nydam wrote, “is not likely attributed to an exposure in plant setting.”A federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration spokesperson told Public Integrity that as of Sept. 2, only four Georgia poultry worker COVID-9 deaths had been reported to OSHA, none from Hall County. Because government officials are failing to track cases systematically, the nonprofitFood & Environment Reporting Networkis mapping accounts of COVID-19 infections and deaths of food-processing laborers and farmworkers. Based on news accounts and what data it can find, as of Sept. 15 the group has found at least 252 deaths and 59,079 virus cases nationwide. In Mexico, Rodolfo Tinoco’s family is still mourning his passing. Rodolfo had remained close to family in Mexico, his brother Gerardo said. And as he lay weak in the hospital, Rodolfo would react when family would speak to him via Zoom. “Doctors said his heartbeat would change,” Gerardo said. The family is now coping with more anguish. A cousin of the Tinocos—who is also a poultry worker—fell ill in Gainesville in August with COVID-19, Gerardo said. He died Sept. 10 in the same hospital where Rodolfo passed away in May.",3,Reliable,0.0176233422661994,0.3952209166494882,5193,2,Mother Jones

At least 66 percent of voters “think Congress should investigate last year’s violent protests, in which more than 2,000 police officers suffered injuries in the line of duty,” compared to only 49 percent of voters who support House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s select committee investigation of the January 6 Capitol riot. After more than six months, House Democratsestablisheda committee to investigate the January 6 riot in which one person died after beingshotby a Capitol police officer. The committee has beencriticizedfor being a “purely partisan exercise.”In contrast, no committee has been established to investigate at least 574 Black Lives Matter protests that involved acts of violence, including assaults on police officers, looting, and arson. Majorities of every racial group and political affiliation support a congressional investigation of last year’s violent protests, according to the poll. Only 21 percent of voters do not think Congress should investigate last year’s protests, and 13 percent are not sure. Sixty-seven percent (67 percent) of whites, 64 percent of black voters, 66 percent of Hispanics and 62 percent of other minorities support a congressional investigation. Seventy-five percent (75 percent) of Republicans, 60 percent of Democrats, and 63 percent of voters not affiliated with either major party agree.“In analyzing the survey results, the National Police Association (NPA) blamed reaction of elected officials to last year’s protests, which began after the death of George Floyd during a May arrest in Minneapolis, for a subsequent rise in violent crime,” according to the report. The NPA said in astatement:When the mayors of cities in which violent riots took place in 2020 refused to let police immediately stop the crimes taking place, it sent a message to violent criminals across the nation that crimes will be allowed and criminals won’t be touched. For the last year violent crimes have increased nationally and the lack of support from politicians has resulted in the number of police officers declining into a short staffing recruitment and retention crisis. When voters were asked “should politicians who failed to acknowledge the violent riots from 2020 be criticized,” 62 percent said yes. In comparison, 51 percent of voters believe politicians deserve criticism fordownplayingthe January 6 Capitol riot. Furthermore, 63 percentof voters think Black Lives Matter riot participants should be criminallychargedin the same way January 6 rioters have been.

558,Pete Buttigieg among Joe Biden's new picks for key cabinet roles - find out who his choices are and why they matter,-5.67,45.33,https://news.sky.com/story/pete-buttigieg-among-joe-bidens-new-picks-for-key-cabinet-roles-find-out-who-his-choices-are-and-why-they-matter-12140564,https://adfontesmedia.com/sky-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,25,"Joe Biden has largely finalised the cabinet he wants to work with after entering the White House. Almost all have connections to theadministration, with some having relationships with Mr Biden that date back many years. If all are confirmed, his picks will mark several firsts for America - including the first woman to lead national intelligence, the first Latino and immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security, the first black defence secretary, the first native American to serve in the cabinet and the first ever climate change envoy. But it may take time before they are all in place, as many have to be approved by the Senate, which is busy with other matters for the near future. In the meantime, Mr Biden has said he intends to appoint interim agency heads to lead cabinet agencies and departments while his nominees await confirmation. Here's who Mr Biden plans to bring on board - and more importantly, why they matter. John Kerry, the former secretary of state, will be climate envoy for national security issues. A statement released by the transition office said Mr Kerry ""will fight climate change full-time as special presidential envoy for climate and will sit on the National Security Council"". Mr Kerry is perhaps the most well-known of Mr Biden's appointments, with a lot of experience in global crises. On Twitter, he said he looked forward to working with ""young leaders of the climate movement"". Unlike others, this role doesn't need Senate confirmation. Janet Yellen is seen as a safe pair of hands at the tiller of the country's economy after one of the sharpest contractions in US GDP in history. She served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, when she placed a greater emphasis than previous Fed chairs on maximising employment and less focus on price inflation. Ms Yellen, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first woman to serve as treasury secretary, after breaking ground as the first woman to chair the Fed. Mr Biden has also selected Wally Adeyemo to be Ms Yellen's deputy, which would make him the first Black deputy treasury secretary. California's attorney general has been nominated at a time when the US is grappling with one of the worst stages of the pandemic since it began. The 62-year-old Latino has been picked to lead the health agency as the daily number of dead in the US passes 4,000 and the country is aiming to vaccinate tens of millions. The former congressman will, if confirmed, will head up a team that will include Dr Rochelle Walensky to run the US Centers for Disease Control, Dr Vivek Murthy as surgeon general and Dr Anthony Fauci, as chief medical officer, in a signal of approval for an official who has faced criticism from Donald Trump. Gen Austin oversaw US forces in the Middle East under Mr Obama and would be the first black leader of the Pentagon if the Senate confirms him. He also served in 2012 as the first black vice chief of staff of the army, the service's number two ranking position. Having retired in 2016, he has been out of the military less than the required seven years, so would need a waiver from Congress to take the post. Mr Blinken has previously said Brexit was like a dog being run over by a car - a ""total mess"". He compared it to the rise of far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France. So,may have some persuading to do and some delicate conversations ahead. Like Mr Biden, expect Mr Blinken to be pushing hard on the sanctity of the Northern Irish peace deal in the aftermath of. He is widely viewed as a pragmatic centrist on foreign policy who has supported past American interventions and is well respected by some. Served as deputy homeland security secretary from 2013 to 2016. He'd be the first Latino to run the department if confirmed and will be tasked with implementing and managing the nation's immigration policies. He's a Cuban-born immigrant whose family fled the Castro revolution. He also worked as an attorney in. He'll need to work on rebuilding faith in the department after President Trump, some critics say, turned it into a passive recipient of his most controversial policies. If confirmed, the former presidential nomination candidate would be the first openly gay person approved by the Senate to a cabinet position. At 38, Mr Buttigieg was one of the youngest in the large group of Democratic wannabes who sought the chance to run for the White House in the early primaries. He had undergone a meteoric rise having only been the mayor of a small Indiana city before his presidential run. But the success he scored in some of the first contests to choose a contender to Mr Trump in January marked him out as unexpectedly popular. Likely to be working extensively with Mr Buttigieg and John Kerry will be Ms Granholm, who if confirmed will have the task of moving the country towards achieving the requirements of the Paris Accord, which Mr Biden has said he will rejoin as soon as he is inaugurated. The 61-year-old was Michigan's first female governor between 2003 and 2010 and was a strong supporter of Mr Biden's presidential bid, having worked with him in 2009 during the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler. Democratic governor of Rhode Island and a lawyer with a background in venture capital. Ms Raimondo has launched successful workforce training programs in her state. Ms Fudge has served in the House of Representatives since 2008, for Ohio's 11th congressional districtIf confirmed, she would be the second black woman to lead the department. Mr Walsh was elected mayor of Boston in 2013. He has backed both a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave and said he wants to expand union membership. After working as a federal appeals court judge since 1997, Mr Garland was nominated by Barack Obama to be a US Supreme Court judge in 2016. His nomination was blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Mr Cardona is currently the education commissioner for Connecticut. As a former teacher, his appointment would fulfil Mr Biden's pledge to choose a professional educator to lead the education department. Mr Vilsack led the US Department of Agriculture under Barack Obama, for both terms of his presidency. He was also Iowa's governor from 1999 until 2007. Mr Burns spent more than three decades as a US diplomat honing his specialities in Russia and the Middle East, including a period as ambassador to Russia. Under President Obama, he was deputy secretary of state. Mr McDonough was the White House chief of staff throughout the whole of Barack Obama's second term and also served as the president's deputy national security adviser. While he has a long history of working in national security roles, he would be the second non-veteran to head up the department. The US ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama has been chosen to run the agency overseeing American foreign humanitarian and development aid. If confirmed by the Senate, UK-born Ms Power will head a US agency which has an annual budget of about $20 billion. Mr Biden called the 50-year-old, who was born to Irish parents and grew up in Ireland before becoming a US citizen in 1993, ""a world-renowned voice of conscience and moral clarity.""The graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School worked as a journalist during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s and served as UN ambassador from 2013 to 2017. The former assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency will run Mr Biden's ambitious climate plans across federal government. She had previously worked for the Obama administration in the Office of Air and Radiation, and brought into action a plan to set national standards to reduce power plant carbon emissions. The plan was later discarded by Donald Trump. Mr Biden's nominee to become the next US ambassador to the United Nations served as Barack Obama's top diplomat on Africa from 2013 to 2017. In the role, she led US policy in Africa south of the Sahara during the West African Ebola outbreak, during which thousands of people died but many lives were saved by international intervention. She will take on a job that Mr Biden plans to restore to a cabinet level. The first black woman to occupy the role was Susan Rice, under Mr Obama. She'd be the first woman appointed to this position. Ms Haines served as deputy director of the CIA in the Obama administration before succeeding Tony Blinken as Mr Obama's deputy national security adviser. She, too, is a former aide to Mr Biden. Deb Haaland, a Democratic congresswoman from New Mexico since 2019, would be the first Native American Cabinet secretary. The member of the Pueblo of Laguna, would also be the Native American first to oversee the department, whose jurisdiction includes tribal lands. Kate Bedingfield, who Mr Biden has chosen as White House communications director, was his campaign spokeswoman. She will be part of a team that includes veteran Democratic spokeswoman Jen Psaki as press secretary. The economist at Princeton University has been nominated as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. She would be the first black woman to lead the council, which advises the president on economic policy. She was a member of the council under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011. Mr Biden has proposed the current chief executive of the liberal Center for American Progress think tank as head of the Office of Management and Budget. As a daughter of Indian immigrants, she would be the first Asian heritage woman to run the OMB. She is expected to face a tough confirmation hearing process when it reaches the Senate.",3,Reliable,0.1038958443634702,0.3452022797346538,1986,3,Sky News

The bulk of the cut is to the UH-Manoa, the institution’s flagship campus, which saw a reduction of $35.6 million to its fiscal year 2022 general funds operation budget and a $30 million cut in 2023. In a post on the university’s website, UH Chief Financial Officer Kalbert Young wrote the Legislature’s “end product ... does not reflect a balanced or thoughtful approach to the overall UH budget.”“As is clearly evident, the budget passed by the Legislature demonstrates an approach that disproportionately reduces funding to the university,” Young wrote.“UH Manoa, by far, is the most severely impacted in the budget since it will have the largest amount of general funding reduction as well as the largest percentage reduction than any other campus.”Young said the Board of Regents had submitted a budget request seeking an additional $4.7 million. The additional funding was to go to athletics and the Hawaii Promise Program. The UH fared a bit better in its capital fund improvement requests. Oddly, Young said the Legislature set aside $42.5 million for a “research and education center” affiliated with UH community colleges ― even though that wasn’t requested by the Board of Regents.“It is unclear what that project entails,” Young said",3,Reliable,0.1407894736842105,0.3802631578947368,337,3,Hawaii News Now

Cameron agreed to release the recordings on Monday, hours after the grand juror requested all recordings and transcripts from the proceedings be released so “the truth may prevail,” asreportedby The Louisville Courier Journal.“The full story and absolute truth of how this matter was handled from beginning to end is now an issue of great public interest and has become a large part of the discussion of public trust throughout the country,” wrote Kevin Glogower, a lawyer representing the juror, wrote in court documents. The juror, who wishes to remain anonymous, also wants jurors to be allowed to give up their confidentiality so they can speak freely about the proceedings. The request includes any talk about “any potential charges and defendants presented or not presented.”Cameron, likely anticipating that the grand jury proceedings would reveal which charges were not recommended, said in a statement about the grand jury recordings emailed to news outlets on Monday that homicide charges against the three LMPD officers were never on the table.“Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidence supported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker,” Cameronstated, referring to Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, two other officers who participated in the shooting. Neither of them were charged.“For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.”In last week’s news conference announcing the outcome of the grand jury proceeding, Cameron never mentioned whether that body was presented with homicide charges to consider. In Kentucky, like in many other states, a prosecutor does not have to wait for a grand jury indictment to bring charges against a defendant, nor is a prosecutor precluded from presenting charges to a second or subsequent grand juries if the initial one fails to indict on charges presented. The grand juror’s motion accused Cameron of using the grand jury “as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility for those decisions” which planted “more seeds of doubt in the process.”The motion added that Cameron has tried to lay the grand jury’s decision solely “at the feet of the grand jury while failing to answer specific questions regarding the charges presented.”The “Attorney General Cameron attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge based solely on the evidence presented to them.“The only exception to the responsibility he foisted upon the grand jurors was in his statement that they ‘agreed’ with his team’s investigation that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their actions.”Last week, outrage spread across the nation afterthe grand jury indictedformer Louisville Metro Police Detective Brett Hankison on one count of wanton endangerment for shots that hit an apartment next door to Taylor’s home. Taylor died on March 13 after Hankison and two other officers fired shots into her apartment while executing a narcotics warrant related to her ex-boyfriend. Cameron previously had refused to release details related to the grand jury session due to supposed concerns about confidentiality and tainting of a potential jury pool.“We stand by our belief that such a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequences such as poisoning the jury pool,” Cameronsaid in Monday’s statement. Despite his misgivings, he agreed to release the recordings on Wednesday to comply with an order issued by Jefferson County Circuit Judge Ann Bailey Smith, who ordered Monday: “The recording of the grand jury proceedings shall be filed in the court file by noon of Wednesday this week.”Cameron, faced with the judge’s order, complied. “The Grand Jury is meant to be a secretive body,” his statement said. “It’s apparent that the public interest in this case isn’t going to allow that to happen. As the special prosecutor, our team has an ethical obligation not to release the recording from the Grand Jury proceedings, and we stand by our belief that such a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequences such as poisoning the jury pool.”In a statement provided to Atlanta Black Star, Taylor family attorneys Ben Crump, Sam Aguiar and Lonita Baker called for the release of all transcripts for the proceedings.“Since the grand jury decision was announced, we’ve been saying that Daniel Cameron clearly failed to present a comprehensive case that supported justice for Breonna. That conclusion is supported by the grand juror who came forward to say that the attorney general misrepresented the grand jury’s deliberations,” the statement read.“We fully support the call to release the entire proceeding transcript as the only way to know what evidence was presented and how the grand jury instructions led to this outcome. In America, law-abiding citizens — including Black citizens — have the right to live peacefully in their homes, without police breaking down their doors in the middle of the night, and they have a right to protect themselves and their property from intruders,” the statement continued.“The police cannot claim their use of force was justified when they wrongly broke into Breonna’s apartment in the first place. We urge the Attorney General to release a COMPLETE and UNEDITED copy of the recording, along with any and all evidence in Bre’s case.”",3,Reliable,0.1833754623409796,0.606517058930852,1196,3,Atlanta Black Star

President Joe Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House on July 15, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. President Joe Biden’s pandemic relief bill included Democratic lawmakers’ language designed to prevent states from using the federal aid to subsidize tax cuts. But afterRepublicans protested, Biden’s Treasury Department said it will not aggressively enforce the provision — and now, some GOP legislatures may be using the stimulus cash to finance tax cuts for the rich. While some states, like Hawaii, Texas, and Nevada, that are reliant on tourism and the energy industries took blows to their revenue as a result of the pandemic, others have exceeded dire revenue projections from spring 2020 and now face budget surpluses in part thanks to the COVID-19 relief legislation signed by Biden in March. Butrather than investingin underfunded schools and public services, some Republican-run states are instead funneling the cash to high-income households — and the Biden administration’s refusal to enforce the anti-tax-cut language in the federal legislation is providing a green light for Republicans to try to do even more. The Arizona legislature recently passed a$1.9 billionincome tax cut designed to benefit the wealthy, with93 percentof the benefit going to the top 20 percent of earners, and over half going to the top 1 percent. Ohio passed $1.7 billion in tax cuts, over half of whichwill flow tothe top 5 percent of earners and over a third of which will flow to the top 1 percent. And Wisconsin passed more than $2 billion in tax cuts, aboutthree-quarters of whichwill go to individuals who make $100,000 or more.“We saw that many states are using better-than-expected revenue outlooks as an excuse to cut personal and corporate income taxes,” Marco Guzman, state policy analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy told us. “Unfortunately, the people that will be benefiting most from these cuts are not the people who were most heavily impacted by job losses or cuts to public services.”The American Rescue Plan (ARP), passed in March, delivered nearly $200 billion in aid to states, with a number of stipulations about how the funds could be used, including a provision designed to prevent states from using the money to cut taxes. Now, though, it remains unclear whether the Treasury Department, which has issued aninterim ruleexplaining how that provision will be enforced, will take action against states such as Arizona, Wisconsin, and Ohio. But tax policy experts say that even these historic tax cuts may not violate the Treasury rule, because it was written so broadly that it would only be triggered in the most extreme circumstances. The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment. States faced with budget surpluses and Republican-held legislatures are proposing aggressive tax cuts, which will most benefit the wealthy, arguing that they will stimulate a post-pandemic economy. In addition to multiple billions of dollars’ worth of regressive tax cuts in Arizona, Ohio, and Wisconsin, ahandful of other statesare considering income tax cuts. Most statesalready have regressive tax codes, meaning low-income households pay a larger portion of their income in taxes than wealthy households, in part because states rely on property and sales taxes, both of which are regressive. Income taxes tend to be one of the only progressive revenue sources that states have, so naturally there has been a movement in conservative states to lower or eliminate income taxes altogether. In February, the Mississippi House of Representativespassed a billto eliminate the state’s personal income tax, before it was killed in committee in the state senate. In March, West Virginia governor Jim Justice submitted aproposal to the legislatureto eliminate the state’s income tax. Iowa governor Kim Reynolds said in June that she wasconsidering a proposalto eliminate the state’s income tax, adding, “That’s where (other states are) going. And if you listen to governors, that’s kind of their goal in several states.”A last-minute provision added to the ARP by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer wasintended to prevent statesfrom using the influx of federal aid to subsidize these types of tax cuts. But the interim rule published by the Treasury Department to enforce this provision seems to have been written broadly enough that even billions of dollars of regressive tax cuts fall within the rules. The ARP’s ban on using aid to subsidize tax cuts was a welcome, last-minute surprise for progressives. Schumer’s inclusion of the provision suggested that the Democrats had learned a lesson from two mistakes that plagued the years following the Great Recession: inadequate federal aid to state and local governments, whichemploy about16 million people, and Republican state legislatures aggressively cutting taxes in the hopes of sparking a recovery under the logic of trickle-down economics, but instead bankrupting their own public services. But when the legislation passed, experts warned that the devil would be in the details of implementation. In particular, the fact that money is fungible makes it difficult to discern whether the aid is being used to fund a tax cut if a state passes tax cuts. The Treasury’s solution was a rule preventing states from going below their revenue for the 2019 fiscal year — before the pandemic — with a little bit of wiggle room. If a state’s new tax cuts drive its revenues below those 2019 levels before it has spent federal pandemic aid, that state must return all of the aid to the federal government. By accepting the ARP money, which every single state did, states consented to these strings attached to the rules. States that cut taxes, under the rules, will have to prove to the Treasury that they didn’t go below 2019 revenue levels in any fiscal year in which they spent ARP money, depending on how aggressively the department enforces the rule. That means that any possible enforcement wouldn’t take place until at least the end of this fiscal year. But Richard Auxier, a senior policy associate in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who studies state tax policy, said that the rules aren’t really targeted at states like Arizona, Ohio, and Wisconsin.“They weren’t looking to go through the budget documents of states that are economically performing well. It was that they didn’t want a state that is in a real fiscal bind, that was in danger of cutting budgets and therefore cutting jobs, keeping those budget cuts instead of passing tax cuts.”Instead, he said, the states that have been outspoken about the rule are the ones facing better-than-expected revenue projections, in addition to the federal aid.“Of course, there are going to be states out there that are performing well that want to cut taxes, and then we are just going to go into all of this math and these rules,” Auxier said. “But what the rules are really trying to stop are states that are in the roughest condition, who the ARP is helping and keeping afloat, and preventing spending cuts.”Ohio is one of those states that has responded to a good revenue year with a tax giveaway to the wealthy — and whose attorney general has led a battle among Republican states to fight the principle of the Treasury rule, even though the state will likely not violate it with billions of dollars of tax cuts. Republicans have been fighting the tax cut provision of the ARP since the moment it passed. Senator Mike Braun (R-IN)introducedtheLet States Cut Taxes Actto repeal the provision.“Not only did this blue state bailout bill penalize states for reopening by calculating state funds based on unemployment, now they are trying to use it as a back door to ban states from cutting taxes. My bill would make sure they don’t get away with it,” Braun said in a statement. The ARP does not, as Braun said, ban states from cutting taxes — just from using ARP money to fund tax cuts. Meanwhile, a coalition of Republican attorneys generalsent a letterto Treasury secretary Janet Yellen asking her to clarify the provision.“Absent a more sensible interpretation from your department, this provision would amount to an unprecedented and unconstitutional intrusion on the separate sovereignty of the States through federal usurpation of essentially one half of the State’s fiscal ledgers (i.e., the revenue half),” the letter said. The rule that Yellen ultimately published did not prevent states from cutting taxes, but a number of states have still filed lawsuits protesting the rule. Recently, a federal judge in Ohio gave the state a victory ingranting a permanent injunctionagainst the implementation of the rule there. The case,brought byOhio attorney general Dave Yost andbacked bythe US Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business, argued that the federal government was unconstitutionally coercing Ohio into accepting its tax policies. But there’s a long precedent of the federal government attaching conditions to money it sends to states. Moreover, says Darien Shanske, professor of law at UC Davis and expert in state taxation, Ohio had already accepted the terms.“The Ohio case was poorly decided, because Ohio had already certified that it could live by the regulations by accepting the ARP money,” Shanske told us. “The judge ruled that Treasury cannot enforce this mandate, but Ohio has already told the Treasury that it can live by the mandate.”The Treasury Department hadsimilarly arguedthat Ohio lacked standing because it hadn’t yet passed any tax cuts that could jeopardize its federal aid. Not only was the judge ruling on a moot point but a number of anti-tax groups had also come to the conclusion that the Treasury rules wouldn’t be a problem for a state like Ohio, Shanske pointed out. The law firm Eversheds Sutherlandconcluded about the rule: “When all is said and done, the ARPA clawback, following the interim rule, seems to be a bit of a nothingburger.”You can subscribe to David Sirota’s investigative journalism project, the,here.

563,No Evidence? Nevada DMV Data Reveals Thousands of Non-citizens Voted in 2020 Election,22.33,14.67,https://thenewamerican.com/no-evidence-nevada-dmv-data-reveals-thousands-of-non-citizens-voted-in-2020-election/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-16,16,"Information obtained via subpoena by the Nevada Republican Party from the state’s Department of Motor Vehiclesrevealed that thousandsof non-citizens not only were registered to vote, but actually cast ballots in the 2020 election. The fraudulent votes were cast thanks to the DMV’s registering of all those who applied for driver’s licenses. Since legal and illegal “non-citizens” can hold driver’s licenses in the state, it’s easy for them to get registered to vote if the DMV employees “do their due diligence.”The information obtained under a subpoena displayed green-card holders and non citizens who had obtained driver’s licenses. Based on the official data set, the Nevada GOP “compared this detailed information against the county voter records in Nevada” and “discovered that 6,260 non citizens were registered to vote and 3,987 non-citizens had voted.”In a signed statement “under the penalty of perjury,” the group’s data analyst Jesse Kamzol outlined his findings, which he emphasized “merit further investigation.”Kamzol explained hisfindings:6,360 positive matches were made from within the DMV file to the Voter File6,136 (96.5%) of those matched voter registration records have voter registration records that are “active”3,987 (62.7%) of those matched voter registration records voted/cast ballots that appear to have been counted — meaning, they are not shown as being provisional or rejected mail ballots per data collected from the SoS and/or County Elections Divisions4,546 (71.5%) of those matched voter registration records appear to have attempted to vote, including provisional votes and rejected mail ballots per data collected from the SoS and/or County Elections Divisions. The Nevada GOP argued that the apparent loophole allowing non-citizens to register to vote is “by design.”“The first question is ‘Are you registered to vote?,’ while the second question, ‘Are you a US Citizen?. Seems like the order should be reversed,” the party wrote, going on to declare, “One of our most basic checks in the electoral process, that this sacred right is limited to those with the privilege and responsibilities of citizenship, was subverted by the DMV.”Furthermore, the GOP took aim at the state’s executive branch:And where are our law enforcement officers? We found this evidence without the help of our Top Cop in Nevada. Attorney General Ford: why are you not investigating voter fraud? You’ve made your position very public saying that you will investigate and prosecute voter fraud. Yet, we have blatant vote buying, non-citizens receiving and casting ballots, deceased voters, people voting twice, etc. and you choose partisan politics to ignore the hundreds of pages of evidence while continuing the narrative that there was NO fraud. DO YOUR JOB!Ahearing in Nevadafrom earlier this month outlined much evidence of voter fraud. For example, the United States Postal Service (USPS) is “preventing witnesses and whistleblowers from testifying” concerning orders for workers to deliver ballots to nearly 8,000 “undeliverable” addresses. Some other notable facts unearthed by a data scientist who testified to over 100,000 unique cases of illegal ballots: Almost 20,000 Nevada voters had a non-Nevada mailing address; approximately 8,000 voters had registered addresses that are physically non-existent; approximately 15,000 voters are registered to vote at either a commercial address or a vacant property; and 42,000 voters voted twice and have multiple voter registration numbers associated with substantially the same name, birthdate, and address. Subpoenas are being issued in other states, shedding light on abundant evidence of voter fraud, counteracting the repeated talking point from the mainstream media that such evidence doesn’t exist. In Michigan, thelegislature grantedthe state’s Senate and House Oversight Committees subpoena powers, which will allow them a broader range to investigate allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 election. Under the subpoena powers, counties are being asked to provide all information used by the Absentee Voter Counting Board, along with scanners, voting machines, and the list of workers hired to be adjudicators. One of the potential paths to victory for President Trump is playing out in Congress, where Representative Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) is leading an effort to object to the Electoral College votes where widespread fraud occurred, an effort set to occur when the votes are counted on Capitol Hill on January 6. It is thus important that evidence of voter fraud continue to be found and released to the public so that lawmakers can be pressured to make the right decision, and so that American constitutionalists are sufficiently informed to withstand backlash from the Left, who inevitably will brand an attempt to save the election as an attempt to “steal” it.",0,Problematic,0.066897233201581,0.4401651609260304,1036,0,The New American

But of course it wasn’t. A string ofrecently released documentshave confirmed that the entire Russia-Trump investigation, which eventually entrapped Flynn and forced then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself, was an unprecedented abuse of power that amounted to an organized effort by the Obama administration to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election. It was in effect an attempted coup. If you haven’t picked that up from the news media, it’s not your fault. Instead of grappling with the implications ofnewly released detailsabout what Obama officials were doing to undermine the incoming Trump administration during the transition, the mainstream media havefixatedon Trump’s use of the term “Obamagate,” dismissing it asa conspiracy theory. This is to be expected. For years now the media have done everything they can to push the Trump-Russia collusion hoax—even after a years-long special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller turned up nothing—using the complexity of the scheme to hide the greatest political scandal of our time in plain sight. A key aspect of that scheme was—and is—to make the case against Flynn appear legitimate. Flynn faced trumped-up charges that he misled FBI agents about conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the weeks before Trump’s inauguration. (As the incoming national security adviser, Flynn was doubtless having conversations with numerous heads of state and ambassadors during this time, so there was nothing unusual about him talking to the Russian ambassador.)The Obama administration already knew about the conversations with Kislyak because it had recordings of them thanks to a series of investigations it spun out of the Crossfire Hurricane counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign. Crossfire Hurricane, launched in the summer of 2016, was itself a bogus investigation based on the Steele dossier—an entirely fraudulent document riddled with Russian disinformation and paid for by the Democratic Party. So why did the FBI want to interview Flynn ahead of Trump’s inauguration in January 2017? Top brass at the FBI weren’t exactly sure about their approach, but they knew they needed to get Flynn out of the way. As the bureau’s former head of counterintelligence, Bill Priestap,recorded in his notes, “What is our goal? Truth/Admission, or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?”Apparently the Obama administration settled on trying to entrap him in a lie. Therecent disclosureof an early January 2017 Oval Office meeting attended by Obama, vice president Joe Biden, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and FBI Director James Comey, confirms the administration’s plan to hide the Russia probe from the incoming Trump team—including Flynn. The idea was to use the Kislyak calls as a pretext to keep the Flynn investigation open, even though there was no reason to do so. After months of spying on him, the FBI had found nothing to indicate Flynn was conspiring with the Russians. As Rice wrote in an email to herself after the meeting, “President Obama said he wants to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia.”The point was to keep the Flynn investigation open as a way for Obama holdovers like Comey, Yates, and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to continue the Russia-Trump collusion probe even after Trump took office—and keep Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, out of the loop. Since there was no reason to keep investigating Flynn, the Obama administration invented one: the preposterous notion that he intentionally misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak and then lied about it to the FBI. There’s no evidence this happened, but even if there were it wouldn’t matter. As the Justice Department explained in its decision to drop the Flynn case, the investigation of Flynn was “untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation.”Later, top FBI and Justice Department officials gave the House Intelligence Committee different answers about why they were pursuing Flynn. Comey, McCabe, Yates, and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord all gave conflicting testimony about the “primary purpose” of the FBI’s interview with Flynn, ranging from the outlandish notion that he violated the Logan Act—a constitutionally dubious 1799 law forbidding unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments—to the concocted charge that he lied to the FBI, which even the agents that conducted the interview with himdidn’t believe. The Flynn case is just one piece of a much larger story about how the Obama administration—with thefull knowledgeand support of both Obama and Biden—targeted incoming Trump officials in a failed attempt to cripple the new administration with allegations it had colluded with Moscow. The complexity of their scheme, and the efforts to hide it and mislead the American people, are frustrating. The cast of characters—from high-ranking Obama administration officials to relative nobodies loosely associated with Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign—is long, as isthe timeline of events. Details have come out slowly, in fits and starts, over the course of years. Following all the leaks and declassified transcripts and congressional hearings requires constant vigilance, and if you don’t keep up with it you can easily lose the thread. That all works to the advantage of those who perpetrated this hoax, because it’s easy to get overwhelmed and tune it all out, or simply accept the corporate media’s deceptive reporting. But the ongoing revelations about the FBI’s targeting of Flynn can’t be ignored. They demand a full accounting. If ever there was a threat to the rule of law, it was the Obama administration’s abuse of power and its weaponization of intelligence agencies in an attempt to take down Trump. However convoluted it might seem, pay attention to it. It’s the biggest political scandal of our time.",1,Questionable,0.0883931370773476,0.4052834592308276,1388,1,The Federalist

So when 17-year-old employee Ellie Roy started aGoFundMeto help the year-round ice cream shop weather the COVID-19 pandemic, she had no doubt the response would be positive. But the outpouring of support — with nearly $7,000 raised in just two weeks — surprised both her and owner Brian Wallers, who initially was reluctant to give his consent for the online fundraiser. Besides the impressive monetary donation, the initiative also prompted a flood of customers, they said.“They were buying ice cream for the whole family, stocking up, giving big tips, just being very generous,” said Ellie, a senior at Palatine High School. “It was unbelievable.”Wallers said he was shocked and grateful. “It made us feel like everything we've been doing is worthwhile, if people care that much about it.”Wallers opened Daisy's Malt Shoppe in 2015 at 807 N. Quentin Road, a space previously occupied by Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream. The 40-year-old said he'd worked at bars and restaurants, rising up from bouncer and server to manager, and wanted to open a business that would appeal to the widest audience.“Ice cream is something that kind of crosses all boundaries,” he said. Wallers named his shop after his childhood beagle Daisy, of whom a portrait hangs above the 1950s-style glossy white tables with chrome trim, red chairs and black-and-white checkered floors. The shop sells “super-premium ice cream” from Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Co. of Madison, Wisconsin.“It has the lowest air content that you're going to find in an ice cream before it becomes a custard. It's very rich, very dense, all organic,” Wallers said. Other offerings include handmade cones, cookie bowls, vintage sodas and, the latest addition, ice cream cakes. Wallers said his business philosophy derives from everything he learned during his years in hospitality.“Generally, it's profit first, customer second and staff third,” he said. “The way I am looking at it is, customer first, staff second and profit third. If you do it that way, you do it the right way, the genuine way, and people feel appreciated and respected.“I gotta make money, too,” he added, “but for me it's more than starting a business. I wanted to start something that becomes part of people's lives, part of the community, and something generational that perhaps will be there after I'm gone.”Resident Meghan Haddad, who has four teenage children, said what's made a real difference is that Wallers employs local youths and partners with charitable causes such as local PTAs to raise money with a portion of ice cream sales. Daisy's has become a community hangout for families, and especially teenagers, many of whom have contributed to the GoFundMe, Haddad said.“The energy inside is always vibrant and hopping. There is always music playing. It's just a fun place,” she said. Working at Daisy's, where normally there is a line out the door in summer, also is really fun — and Wallers is an “amazing” boss, Ellie said. “Me and my friends joke about it all the time. We don't know how we're going to have another boss in the future because he's so great.”While the pandemic has been rough on all small businesses, it's been particularly difficult for Daisy's. Wallers has been dealing with health issues since last year, so he hasn't been able to work at the shop every day like he did for the first four years. A few of his employees came down with COVID-19 this summer, so he closed for a month — even longer than advised by health authorities, he said — during what normally would be peak sales time. He obtained a $10,000 forgivable loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program early on, but other funding opportunities didn't come through, he said. Wallers said he's optimistic that Daisy's can make it through March, when he expects sales to pick up after the winter lull. The GoFundMe has made it likely he can stay in business through January, and it's a short jaunt after that, he said.“That girl just melted my heart,” he said of Ellie's initiative. “What she did was not just for me, but for us as a staff ... but more importantly, for the community.”Visit the online fundraising page atwww.gofundme.com/f/help-keep-daisys-malt-shoppe-afloat.",3,Reliable,0.1437912771608424,0.4193486626095321,1048,3,Daily Herald-Chicago
567,State Attorneys General Push Federal Government to Follow the Law and Finally Create Side-Impact Tests for Kids’ Car Seats,-1.33,45.67,https://www.propublica.org/article/state-attorneys-general-push-federal-government-to-follow-the-law-and-finally-create-side-impact-tests-for-kids-car-seats,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,24,"A group of 18 attorneys general is criticizing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for failing to mandate tests for children’s car seats that mimic the forces in side-impact crashes, despite a law more than two decades ago requiring the agency to protect kids in such collisions.“The failure to promulgate side-impact testing standards unnecessarily endangers children on the road and does a huge disservice to families,” the attorneys general representing 17 states and the District of Columbia wrote in aletteron Tuesday to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose office oversees NHTSA. The letter adds to the pressure Congress has applied to NHTSA sincea ProPublica investigation last yearexposed how Evenflo, one of the largest child seat manufacturers, marketed its bestselling Big Kid booster as “Side Impact Tested” even though the company’s own tests demonstrated that children in those seats could be paralyzed or killed in such crashes. In an interview, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, the co-leader of the group, described ProPublica’s story as “thorough, extensive and horrifying” and signaled that the letter may not be the last step for the group. The 18 attorneys general who signed the letter, Tong said, are taking a “very hard look” at local consumer protection laws. Such laws prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices. A NHTSA spokesperson, in an emailed response to questions, said the agency planned to issue its final side-impact performance requirements for children’s car seats by January 2022. But the agency made it clear it planned to exclude booster seats like the Big Kid from those tests when it proposed the new rules in November. A NHTSA spokesperson did not respond when asked if that was still the plan. Absent a federal testing standard, children’s car seat makers are allowed to continue to design their own tests and decide what constitutes a passing grade. Evenflo’s side-impact tests on its booster seats were so lax, ProPublica found, that the only way to fail was if the child-sized test dummy wound up on the floor or the seat broke into pieces. In response to ProPublica’s findings, a U. S. House subcommittee last year launched its own investigation, which found widespread evidence that the nation’s largest manufacturers of car seatsendangered the livesof millions of children and misled consumers about the safety of booster seats. Indeed, the congressional investigators described the side-impact tests that manufacturers currently perform as “meaningless.”As a result, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform’s Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy last December asked the National Association of Attorneys General to encourage its members to open investigations into “dangerous practices and unfair and deceptive marketing regarding children’s car seats and booster seats,” pointing to evidence in the congressional investigators’report. That prompted the consumer protection chiefs of the 18 attorneys general’s offices to take a closer look. Tong said he was “horrified” to read in ProPublica’s story how Evenflo decided whether its seat passed the side-impact test the company itself had created. After each of the tests, an Evenflo technician would check a “yes” or “no” box on a form that asked whether that test showed “dummy retention.”In its story, ProPublica included excerpts from a sworn deposition of the Evenflo test technician who filled out those forms as well as photos of the actual tests he reviewed. The deposition was part of a case brought by the family of a Texas girl who was paralyzed in a side-impact crash while seated in a Big Kid booster. The family of that child, who requires a ventilator to breathe, later settled the case with Evenflo. The test photos showed the body of the child-sized dummy careening grotesquely outside the protection of the seat belt. Had the dummy been a real child, the head could have hit a door or something else in the car. Yet the technician always checked the “yes” in the “dummy retention” box and forwarded the forms to an engineer who decided if the seats got a passing grade. They all passed.“It’s deeply and personally affecting for those of us who are parents,” said Tong, who is a father of three. “The willful denial of facts and science in pursuit of profits and the idea that they would approve these tests and that they never rejected a test despite this clear evidence that the dummy was not retained in any meaningful way is really scary and puts people at risk.”Tong added that “the suggestion that they exceed federal standards for side impact — I understand that’s sleight of hand with language. But that kind of thing is unconscionable frankly.”Tong’s coalition of attorneys general on Tuesday urged Buttigieg and NHTSA’s acting administrator to “save children from avoidable injury,” noting that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death in kids ages 1 to 13. A federal law passed in 2000 directed NHTSA to enact standards that would protect children in side-impact crashes, but two decades later, those rules still don’t exist. Children’s car seats and boosters only have to pass tests that mimic the forces a child’s body would experience in head-on crashes. Yet side-impact crashes are more likely to result in serious injuries because there’s only a door between the child and an intruding vehicle. On Twitter this week Tong wrote that “families cannot wait another 20 years for NHTSA to finally act.”His coalition also urged NHTSA to require labels on children’s car seats that warn parents that their children should remain in their current car seat until they reach the height or weight limits. Children move from rear-facing seats to forward-facing seats with harnesses and then on to booster seats, which rely on the vehicle’s seat belts rather than built-in harnesses. Parents often think of children graduating from one stage to the next, like a milestone to be celebrated. But in fact,each transition reducesthe amount of protection a child receives in a crash.“Encouraged by marketing from child car seat manufacturers, parents and children are understandably excited about moving up to the next seat in the progression,” Tong’s coalition wrote in its letter. “But experts all agree that to best protect child passengers from injury, they should wait and not rush the transition.”Given this well-established fact, the coalition wrote, “we are concerned by NHTSA’s failure to require this important principle on car seat labels and boxes.”Evenflo and other manufacturers had long marketed their booster seats for children weighing as little as 30 pounds even though experts agree that children of that weight are best protected in traditional car seats with built-in harnesses. ProPublica’s investigation last year revealed that one of Evenflo’s top car seat engineers in 2012 recommended the company stop marketing its boosters to children less than 40 pounds, arguing they’d be safer in harnessed seats. But a marketing executive vetoed him, an internal Evenflo record shows. ProPublica also detailed examples of children weighing less than 40 pounds who were gravely injured in side-impact crashes while seated in Big Kid boosters. Jillian Brown, a 10-year-old New York girl, suffered an injury medical journals sometimes call “internal decapitation.” Like the girl in Texas, Jillian is paralyzed from the neck down and must rely on a ventilator to breathe. She steers her motorized wheelchair with her tongue. Jillian, who has always had an independent spirit, cannot clear secretions from her lungs on her own and requires round-the-clock care in the family’s home, which has been transformed to meet her needs. Her family settled the suit it had brought against Evenflo. Tong said he was struck by the Brown family’s ongoing struggles. “Somewhere in the story, you talk about the older sister who survived the crash and how her younger sister’s care consumes the family, how the parents worry about the older sister and her needs and attention — how profoundly hard that is for their family and for her,” he said. “That was a huge driver for what’s happening now.”An Evenflo attorney did not answer questions sent by email this week, but last year a different Evenflo attorney told ProPublica that the company kept the weight limit at 30 pounds at that time to accommodate tall, thin children who had outgrown their harnessed seats. The company also told ProPublica that its seats are safe and effective and that it has been a pioneer in side-impact testing. It blamed driver error for the children’s injuries. Read MoreEvenflo and its largest competitor, Graco, subsequently raised the minimum weight for their boosters to 40 pounds last year after ProPublica’s story was published and after the congressional subcommittee launched its investigation. NHTSA last November proposed banning the sale of boosters for children under 40 pounds. In its written statement this week, a NHTSA spokesperson said the agency is working on another rule that “would reduce early transitions to forward-facing car seats and boosters,” but she did not provide any details. That rule, too, would not be done until early 2022, she said.“We appreciate the interest of the attorneys general in this critical issue and look forward to finalizing these critical child passenger safety regulations,” the NHTSA spokesperson wrote.",3,Reliable,0.0494544501619973,0.4601617591004383,2010,3,ProPublica
568,"EXCLUSIVE: Congress, White House Unlikely To Deliver Phase 4 Stimulus Before Recess, Sources Say",17.33,37.33,https://dailycaller.com/2020/07/21/trump-administration-officials-hill-staffers-doubt-phase-4-stimulus-will-be-completed/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-caller-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-21,25,"Hopes are low that Congress will put a Phase 4 stimulus package on President Donald Trump’s desk before the upcoming August recess, people familiar with the negotiations tell the Daily Caller. WASHINGTON, DC – JULY 20: U. S. President Donald Trump listens to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Photo by Doug Mills/Getty Images)Two senior White House officials and several Hill officials with intimate knowledge of the negotiations fear that Republicans and Democrats are too far apart on wish-list items to realistically move the bill forward. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the ongoing talks, cast a stark sentiment on both sides of the negotiation table. The White House and members ofCongresshave floated potential items for a Phase 4 coronavirus stimulus package for months — including a payroll tax cut, a second tranche of direct payments to taxpayers and increased budgeting for schools to reopen in the fall — but formal negotiations between the administration and Congressional leadership didn’t kick off until this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy met with Trump at the White House on Monday. The first round of bipartisan negotiations — featuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — followed on Tuesday at the Capitol. Heading into Tuesday’s meeting,Meadowssaid that the group was eyeing a tentative July 31 deadline for the package, which happens to be the last day the House is currently scheduled to be in session, butMcConnelltold reporters later in the day that it’s unrealistic to expect legislation to be passed within that timeline.“Of course politically it should pass before August recess. Everyone wants to have something they can point to back at home,” one GOP Senate aide told Daily Caller. “But if the last CARES negotiation was any indication of what’s to come, I don’t see how that timeline is feasible. Let’s remember Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer derailed the process and critical relief for days back in March because they were clinging to pipe dream proposals that have nothing to do with defeating this virus or helping hardworking Americans overcome this economic crisis.”“I wouldn’t hold my breath,” a second Senate staffer said in a statement to Daily Caller. “Given how far apart both sides are right now, I’d be shocked if Congress is able to pass a comprehensive coronavirus response bill by the end of the month. Hopefully, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats will put away their liberal wish list and come to the table.”WASHINGTON, DC – MARCH 27: (L-R) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) U. S. President Donald Trump listen (Photo by Erin Schaff-Pool/Getty Images)McConnell’s concerns about the bill’s timeline don’t just involve wooing House Democrats. More than a dozen Senate Republicansreportedlyvoiced serious displeasure with signing off on another $1 trillion package at Tuesday’s Conference lunch. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a notorious budget hawk, stormed out of the lunch and compared it to a “Bernie Bros” meeting.“Everything they ever said about President Obama they are,” he toldreporters. “This is insane, they are ruining the country.”Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee also expressed concern to Daily Caller about the cost of McConnell’s package, considering the massive unemployment spike caused by the pandemic seems to have reversed.“With states reopening, it’s not clear that we need to borrow another trillion dollars now,” he stated. “If there is a Phase 4, I would like any additional spending delivered directly to families, rather than to politicians or government bureaucracies.”Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scottadditionally said Tuesday he would “do everything we can to make sure we’re not bailing out states,” including delaying the bill. WASHINGTON, DC – JULY 20: U. S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters (Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)Two senior Trump administration officials offered similar sentiments to the Daily Caller to those expressed by their Senate counterparts. One official suggested Mnuchin and Meadows’ timeline is indeed too ambitious, and that “if anything happens” it won’t be until the first week of August.“We’re supposed to be here for two weeks but it looks like it’ll bleed over into August,” the official offered flatly. “Who knows?”A second administration official even questioned whether or not the president should sign another stimulus package without waiting to see if states currently dealing with a spike in cases opt to re-shutter businesses. The official alluded to Paul’s Tuesday statements leaving the Conference lunch and predicted that additional Republican Senators might soon take up that position. Multiple House staffers offered slightly more optimistic projections to the Daily Caller but still questioned whether or not both chambers would vote to pass the bill before recess.“We don’t know the state of play just yet for the next relief package. We expect legislative text within the next 24-48 hours, but how that plays within a divided Congress remains to be seen. If Pelosi puts in extraneous measures, you can expect it to delay the process significantly,” one senior GOP aide explained. “The hope is she will put the needs of 51 million unemployed Americans and millions of others hanging by a thread above her own wish to create a progressive utopia and remake America in her image and likeness.”WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 11: U.

Pelosi said during an interview onJuly 14she would “absolutely” work through August to deliver a stimulus package, but a third senior House official told Daily Caller Tuesday that House leadership “will do everything not to have that happen.”The House is currently scheduled to break for district work on July 31, while the Senate has plans to head home on August 10.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0298144257703081,0.3785072362278243,1505,1,Daily Caller
