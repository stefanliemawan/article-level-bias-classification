"COVID Delta variant puts men, people of color at risk, Biden official warns",-1.0,48.0,https://19thnews.org/2021/07/the-covid-delta-variant-puts-men-and-people-of-color-at-risk-biden-official-warns/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,19thnews.org,"\nThe highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 \u2014 on track to become the dominant strain in the United States \u2014&nbsp;could exacerbate stark race and gender-based coronavirus disparities, undercutting the possibility of a nationwide return to normal, a top adviser to the president told The 19th.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about Delta, and I\u2019m worried about Delta especially for people who aren\u2019t vaccinated, and for communities where the uptake of vaccination has been low,\u201d said Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who chairs the White House\u2019s COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force.\n\n\n\nThe Delta variant, which was first seen in India and is already the dominant coronavirus strain in many other countries, is more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and can potentially result in more serious infections. It has already been detected in every state, and government officials believe it will become the main source of American infections within weeks.\n\n\n\nAlthough cases have been trending downward, the Delta variant creates a coronavirus outbreaks in communities where a significant number of people remain unvaccinated, which can put specific, hard-to-reach populations at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe impact could be particularly severe for men, Nunez-Smith acknowledged, since they have generally been more likely to develop complications, sometimes fatal, from COVID-19. Nunez-Smith said that adds to the imperative of getting more men vaccinated. Currently, 53 percent of people who are fully vaccinated are women, and only 47 percent are men, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data does not disaggregate sex and gender or account for nonbinary people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe only age group in which men are more likely to be vaccinated is for adults older than 75, per a separate CDC analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite people are more likely to have been vaccinated than Black or Latinx people, the CDC data shows. That has been a concern for months, especially since Black and Latinx people have been more likely to work jobs that expose them to the virus and have been more likely to end up in the hospital.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the more contagious variant, coupled with that vaccine disparity, could create greater risk of localized, unequally distributed COVID-19 outbreaks, Nunez-Smith said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more work to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dynamics of COVID-19 are local. And so it really comes down to the dynamics of one\u2019s community. How many people in one\u2019s community have been vaccinated? The risk is there for these localized surges.\u201d\n\n\n\nEfforts to vaccinate more Americans have lagged since spring. Though President Joe Biden initially set a target of getting 70 percent of adults vaccinated by the July 4 holiday, the administration acknowledged last week it was unlikely to meet that goal. So far, 66.5 percent of adults have gotten at least one shot. The Biden administration has vowed to distribute vaccines equitably \u2014 touting targeted outreach for Black and Latinx people in particular, given their disproportionate harm experienced \u2014 but those efforts have not been enough to close vaccine disparities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNunez-Smith would not say whether federal guidance might change around indoor mask mandates, but she did suggest that more local areas &nbsp;\u2014 especially places with low vaccination rates or new surges of COVID-19 \u2014&nbsp;could reintroduce indoor mask mandates even for people who are vaccinated. That\u2019s in line with guidance from other officials, notably Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the CDC does not recommend requiring indoor masks for people who are fully vaccinated. The World Health Organization does recommend indoor masks, though, citing the risk of the Delta variant. This past week, Los Angeles County\u2019s health department put out a strong recommendation that people wear masks indoors even if fully vaccinated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really up to locals and states around mask requirements,\u201d Nunez-Smith said. \u201cBut I particularly encourage people to pay attention to the local dynamics.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll evidence suggests that people with two shots of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine will not develop severe illness from the Delta variant, and are unlikely to transmit the virus to others. On Thursday, Johnson &amp; Johnson said its vaccine also protects against the Delta variant.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut if large pockets of people remain unvaccinated \u2014 in the United States or abroad \u2014 the virus could further mutate and develop even more potent variants that eventually undercut the power of those vaccines. At the current pace of vaccination, it could take another year for enough of the world to have coronavirus immunity, according to data analyzed by Bloomberg News.\n"
"Study finds spike in suicidal thoughts, self-harm during and after pregnancy",-7.0,44.0,https://19thnews.org/2020/11/new-research-finds-dramatic-growth-in-suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm-during-and-after-pregnancy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,19thnews.org,"\nSuicide is a leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States, and new research shows that people with suicidal thoughts after giving birth dramatically increased between 2006 and 2017, with the biggest spikes amongst people who are Black, lower income, or younger.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at just under 600,000 privately-insured people. Researchers analyzed the data to track cases of suicidality \u2014 suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm \u2014 within a year either before or after giving birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2017, suicidality diagnoses increased from .2 percent per 100 people to .6 percent per 100. In the same period, cases of deliberate self-harm went up from .1 percent per 100 in 2006 to .2 percent per 100 in 2017. When applied to the approximately 4 million births that take place each year, that means an increase in tens of thousands of suicidal cases and intentional self-harm.\n\n\n\n\u201cSuicidality is something we don't think about or talk about as much, and it\u2019s a lot more common than I had realized,\u201d said Kara Zivin, a professor at the University of Michigan and the paper\u2019s senior author.\n\n\n\nZivin pursued the research based on her own experience \u2014 10 years ago, after giving birth to her son, her postpartum depression made her suicidal. Now, she said, she wants to shine light on an under-discussed topic in public health that has profound consequences.\n\n\n\nAlready, the United States\u2019 rate of pregnancy-related deaths is higher than any other wealthy nation. And suicide is a major concern. According to a 2017 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it accounted for about 6.5 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was certainly aware of the risks of things like postpartum depression. I never expected the level of illness I had,\u201d Zivin said. \u201cI don\u2019t fully understand it, still.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what is behind the trend, though the researchers argued that it\u2019s likely a combination of doctors more often catching cases of suicidality \u2014 which is typically under-diagnosed \u2014 and the problem itself growing more common. But it\u2019s hard to know what is driving the increase.\n\n\n\nZivin said the study makes a strong case for policy interventions that ensure people can access mental health care during and after pregnancy. For instance, people who have Medicaid as their insurance when pregnant will lose that eligibility after 60 days post-birth in most states \u2014 even though suicide a year after giving birth is still considered pregnancy-related. That\u2019s something states or the federal government could address, she said, by extending Medicaid to guarantee insurance for a year postpartum, and making sure people can see mental health specialists.\n\n\n\nThe study found that Black people experienced the largest increase in perinatal suicidality of any single racial group \u2014 increasing from .2 percent per 100 in 2006 to .9 percent in 2017. In some ways, that reflects a bigger reality: The nation\u2019s pregnancy-related death rate is far higher for Black people than for White people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s still likely an undercount of the gap, said Katy Kozhimannil, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and director of its rural health research center. Black women are disproportionately covered through Medicaid, not private insurance. (Kozhimannil was not involved in the study.)\n\n\n\nThe study authors said it\u2019s not clear why Black people experienced such a dramatic increase in diagnoses. But experiences of racism have been linked to physical stress and mental illness symptoms, Kozhimannil noted. And big picture, she added, the data emphasizes why health policy-makers need to emphasize the impact of systemic racism when crafting pregnancy-related health interventions.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about race, it\u2019s about racism,\u201d she said. \u201cThinking about it in that way would point to the common root, and might get us in policy discussions further toward valuing the health of Black people in pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe authors believe that the paper is even more pressing now. If pregnancy-related suicide was already a problem, experts say it\u2019s one that is likely to only grow, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has added new strains to perinatal mental health.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the pandemic worsens this winter, experts are sounding the alarm about a potential spike in suicides. That\u2019s especially a concern for people who have access to firearms, Kozhimannil said; the vast majority of gun deaths each year are suicides, and people who attempt suicide with a gun are more likely to suicide. And right now, more women are buying firearms for the first time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is more important than ever in the COVID-19 era,\u201d said Lindsay Admon, an OB-GYN at the University of Michigan and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cThe postpartum isolation people feel will have been compounded by this epidemic.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the study data underestimates the extent of the problem.\n\n\n\nThe study looks only at people with private insurance, who tend to be wealthier. It does not include the almost half of all American births that are insured through Medicaid, which covers lower-income people. People on Medicaid are already more likely to experience the kinds of external stressors that can trigger symptoms of depression and anxiety, and more likely not to have a doctor diagnose or help them access treatment.\n\n\n\nThe study also only tracked official diagnoses, even though self-harm and suicidal thought are typically underreported and under-diagnosed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cIt shows a big problem and probably undercounts the magnitude of the problem, and the magnitude of the potential disparity,\u201d Kozhimannil said.\n\n\n\nIf you or a loved one are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 74174.\n"
"Pregnant people excluded from Moderna, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine trials",-3.33,43.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/11/pregnant-people-excluded-covid-vaccine-trials/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-17,19thnews.org,"\nWe're the only newsroom dedicated to writing about gender, politics and policy. Subscribe to our newsletter today.\n\n\n\nEarly results from two major COVID-19 vaccine trials have sparked hope that the worst of the pandemic may soon be over. But it\u2019s still unclear if or when that relief would extend to pregnant people, who have been excluded from those vaccine trials.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPfizer and Moderna, which are developing two high-profile vaccine candidates,&nbsp;have posted initial data from their large late-stage trials that suggests their products could be close to 90 or 95 percent effective in reducing risk of COVID-19 infection. Moderna\u2019s data also suggests its vaccine would reduce the risk of severe illness caused by the coronavirus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth companies have indicated they will seek a federal emergency-use authorization, in which the government makes the drug available before having approved it, based on the strength of early results. That means vaccines could be available to the general public by next spring.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut since the vaccine trials have thus far excluded people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, it\u2019s unclear when the immunizations would be safely available for them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe exclusion has sparked concern from health experts, especially since research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made it clear that pregnancy significantly increases COVID-19\u2019s mortality risk. Pregnant people are also more likely to develop complications and require intensive medical care, including requiring a ventilator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPregnant women are now squarely in the higher risk population, which makes thinking about a vax for them \u2014 it was already a pressing concern, but it\u2019s even more pressing,\u201d said Anne Lyerly, obstetrician and bioethicist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill\u2019s department of social medicine.\n\n\n\nPfizer spokesperson Jerica Pitts said the company is working on a \u201cpotential pathway\u201d to a pregnancy-related indication for the vaccine program, which would mean getting the vaccine approved for use during pregnancy. It is also currently doing early research \u2014 not yet conducting trials in humans \u2014 to see how the vaccine works in pregnancy, Pitts said.\n\n\n\nModerna has not specified its plans to research the vaccine in pregnant people. The company did not respond to The 19th\u2019s requests for comment.\n\n\n\nThe federal Food &amp; Drug Administration, which will determine whether either vaccine candidate gets an emergency authorization, could approve the vaccine for all healthy adults \u2014 which would then allow health authorities like the CDC to determine whether pregnant people should be eligible to get the immunization or if they will have to wait until one is specifically tested for them. The FDA could also approve a vaccine for healthy adults but specifically advise against giving it to pregnant people, at least temporarily.\n\n\n\nExperts are still debating when vaccines should in general be tested on those who are pregnant. Historically, major vaccines have not been tested during pregnancy, because of concerns that both the pregnant person and fetus would be at risk for complications. But that thinking has shifted in recent years \u2014 particularly in light of the Ebola crisis, when, similarly to COVID-19, vaccines were not initially tested for pregnant people even though they were at severely heightened risk of mortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome researchers, following conventional wisdom, say later is better, when vaccines have been proven to be safe in pregnancy. But many others note that delaying when to include pregnant people in trials, as Moderna and Pfizer have done, will put them at risk.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need data collected in a systematic way to guide pregnant women and their health care providers regarding whether they should get a COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d said Sonja Rasmussen, a 20-year CDC veteran and professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Florida.\n\n\n\nExcluding those who are pregnant, she added, means much of the vaccines\u2019 risks and benefits are still a question mark.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cMany questions need to be answered,\u201d she said. \u201cIs the vaccine effective during pregnancy? Is a different dose needed during pregnancy? Is the vaccine safe for the pregnant woman and her fetus? Will the vaccine provide some degree of protection to the newborn infant?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe FDA typically recommends pregnant people be included in late-stage trials. In its COVID-19 recommendations, the FDA advised companies to at least consider including those who are pregnant in vaccine trials, and in July, National Institutes of Health Director Frances Collins said inclusion of pregnant people in vaccine trials was \u201ca top priority.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have also called on major vaccine companies to include pregnant people in their trials or otherwise ensure immunizations are available to them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Lauren Underwood introduced legislation to this effect in August.\n\n\n\nWomen of childbearing age are also disproportionately represented amongst frontline worker groups, including health care professionals and teachers \u2014 the very people who experts say need to receive the vaccine first.\n\n\n\n\u201cA significant number of health workers are women. Within that there are always, at any given time, a substantial number who are pregnant,\u201d said Ruth Faden, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on immunizations for pregnant people. \u201cWhat\u2019s the right ethics stance towards a pregnant health worker?\u201d\n\n\n\nWithout good data, it\u2019s difficult to know what the implications are for giving pregnant people either vaccine. But the mechanism underlying both vaccines \u2014 a new messenger RNA technology that helps the body develop antibodies to fight the coronavirus \u2014 has not been shown to cause harm during pregnancy, Lyerly said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis gives her \u201creason for optimism\u201d that even without being tested on pregnant people, the vaccine could be used to protect them, she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThe heightened awareness of the needs to protect pregnant women is a relatively recent phenomenon,\u201d she said. \u201cA focus on the needs to protect them through vaccination \u2014 not just from the risks of an intervention like a vaccine \u2014 that\u2019s an important shift.\u201d\n"
‘We’ve worked for it’: Barbara Lee on the future of Black women in leadership,-11.33,40.0,https://19thnews.org/2020/11/barbara-lee-future-of-black-women-in-leadership/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-14,19thnews.org,"\nWe're the only newsroom dedicated to writing about gender, politics and policy. Subscribe to our newsletter today.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee is among the names being considered to replace Sen. Kamala Harris as she heads to the White House to serve as the first woman vice president of the United States.\n\n\n\nLee, currently in her 12th term in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the highest-ranking Black woman in Congress as co-chair of the steering and policy committee \u2014 a position she was appointed to by Speaker Nancy Pelosi after narrowly losing her bid for Democratic Caucus Chair. Lee got her start in politics as a college student who volunteered to work on Shirley Chisholm\u2019s pioneering campaign for president in 1972.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, will fill Harris\u2019 vacancy. The 19th\u2019s editor-at-large, Errin Haines, spoke to Lee on Saturday about her future and what\u2019s next for Black women in political leadership after a year that saw record turnout, organizing and candidacies for public office for the vanguard constituency of the Democratic Party.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\nYou are somebody who is certainly in the conversation right now, so I want to talk to you about that and the future of Black women's political power now, and people coming around to the reality that they should be following Black women's leadership.\n\n\n\nI got involved in politics through the presidential campaign of the first African American woman \u2026 We have thought, we've dreamed about this moment, but we've also worked for it.\n\n\n\nI know this is a year in which we've seen the importance of representation in our politics. Kamala Harris launched her own campaign last year in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm. Talk a little bit about the importance of more women \u2014 and Black women, in particular \u2014&nbsp;running for elected office, something I know Chisholm talked about. What do you think about where we are in this moment and where we should be going from here?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI was there when [Harris] kicked off her campaign, and I was so honored to co-chair her California presidential campaign. So for me personally, this is just a remarkable moment. And what it says, I think, is, finally! Black women have been smart, we've been strategic, we've helped elect so many candidates to public office, and we've always brought other Black women and other women of color with us. And so this is such a historic occasion for Black women and women of color. But it also says that more women will be able to break through and it will be a heck of a lot easier [to do so].&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nSticking with the theme of representation matters: Kamala Harris breaking that barrier in California, to become the state\u2019s first Black senator, first Black woman senator, and now she's the only Black woman currently serving in the U.S. Senate. What has that representation meant?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith Sen. Harris in the Senate \u2014 I've worked with her on a variety of issues such as, for instance, the Hyde Amendment \u2014 it's about racial justice for Black women of color, low-income women as it relates to reproductive justice. She understands why this policy has been so destructive and discriminatory against women of color and low-income women.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[Like] when you look at marijuana justice, when you look at the numbers of Black and brown people who have been incarcerated and have these drug charges, which have just stopped them, and been a barrier to moving forward with their lives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo representation, it really does matter, because the lens by which you look at policies are lenses that others don't have. And that's because of who we are, our experiences and the pathways that we have had to walk and run to get to where we are. And so, you know, there's a void when there are not the perspectives and the input and the leadership of Black women.\n\n\n\nYeah, absolutely. And so obviously, when [Harris] vacates that seat, there will be a void. I know you have a relationship with her. Have you spoken to the vice president-elect about when she might be vacating that seat?\n\n\n\nOh, no, no, no. It's probably still too early. I don't know, I have no idea. And I haven't even seen any press reports. I mean, I've heard from her, but not about that.\n\n\n\nHas she even given you any indication of who she might like to see as her successor?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\nOther people have already told me they want to see you as her successor. So, I have to ask you, is a job that you are interested in?\n\n\n\nWell, there's several African American women who would meet the test and who would be phenomenal in the Senate. I would be honored. Because you know, public service for Black women is not just about being elected; that's another platform and framework for public service. The governor will make his decision. We will respect his decision, because he has to determine who he thinks best will serve California, he has to take into all of his considerations, and come up with his conclusion as to who he thinks would best fill that void and who would be able to work with him as we move forward on our California agenda. So it's up to him, quite frankly, but I know that there are several African American women on the list who are fully prepared and could serve.\n\n\n\nIf it's not you, do you still think that whoever the next senator of California is should be a Black woman? I know, there's been some conversation about making history with say, the first Latino to represent California\u2026\n\n\n\nThe void that Senator Harris would leave as an African American woman is a huge void. Not speaking to any other issue or making this about beating up anyone else. It's about the void and the fact that since the first Senate session, I believe, African American women have had a total of about 10 years with Sen. Carol Moseley Braun. So 10 years out of hundreds of years. And so this void and this gap would be tremendous. I believe that the governor will take that into consideration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI know that you have a relationship with President Elect Biden. And so I'm just wondering what you've also if you've had a chance to speak with him, and what you've told him about the Black women that you'd like to see help him govern.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the House and throughout the country, in the state legislatures, there are some brilliant and phenomenal African American women who could serve as cabinet officials. How many women do we have in the Congressional Black Caucus? All of us could serve in the cabinet. I know one consideration, of course, is making sure that the seats do not go, if they were vacated, to Republicans, but for the most part, most of the seats are strong Democratic seats. And so I think this provides a real opportunity for African American women in the House of Representatives to serve in a variety of positions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMy good friend of many years, [Ohio Democratic] Congresswoman Marcia Fudge for secretary of agriculture. I work with her \u2014 I'm on the appropriations committee, and I'm on the subcommittee on agriculture \u2014 and so I've had the privilege to not only work with Marcia as a colleague, but she's a good friend. There's nobody who knows ag issues like Congresswoman Fudge and I think she would be phenomenal as a secretary of ag, and I'm certain that her district would elect another Democrat to that seat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSticking with the House for a minute: Who are the other Black women that you would like to see in elected House leadership?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI think that it's time. I think that those of us who run in the past, we've shattered some of those glass ceilings. And we've broken some of those barriers, even though we may not have won the election. I think that now, more members see that the capacity, capabilities, the value and the strategic positioning and how Black women really do have the ability to help unite the caucus and bring [it] together. And so, yes, several are running. And, you know, I'm hoping that they win and I\u2019m going to help.\n\n\n\nIf you are not headed to the Senate or headed to the cabinet, you were discussed for Speaker of the House after the historic 2018 midterms. I know how much respect you have, among your colleagues, and especially some of the younger women of color that you have mentored. Are you considering running this time? And is it time for a Black woman to hold that gavel?\n\n\n\nI don't think anyone could do what Speaker Pelosi has done in keeping this caucus together and winning elections. And I fully support her. When you look at Speaker Pelosi\u2019s history and record, she's probably been the greatest speaker ever because she's had the most diverse caucus. And she has had the ability to raise money to make sure we elect more Democrats. She has supported women of color to assume committee chairs and vice chairs of committees. And so I think that, you know, I mean, I know she's gonna be reelected, and I'm working to make sure that she is reelected as our speaker.\n\n\n\nOn her historic speakership: What do you think that has done to help this country's political imagination around women in power?\n\n\n\nIt has shown that women lead and women lead on each and every issue, not only issues perceived as women's issues, but every issue. And I think it's also shown that especially with Speaker Pelosi, that racial equity matters. And that racial inclusion in the House of Representatives is an asset. And that we are able, and she has seen, especially with African American women and women of color in the House, how we work and how our legislative efforts really move forward, because we work with everyone, because we know that what's good for women, and for our communities, as women of color for low-income communities.\n\n\n\nI mean, she appointed me to chair the majority leader\u2019s task force on poverty and opportunity, for example. She always talks about how she came to Congress\u2014because one in five children live below the poverty line. Her keen understanding of those issues, that poverty not only affects women, it affects families, it affects children, it affects everyone across the board. African Americans have the highest percentage, but this is low-income, working families, poor, White families.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpeaker Pelosi has been able to see the issues that I want to champion, such as lifting people out of poverty \u2026 On COVID, I negotiated this in the HEROES bill targeting resources for Black and brown communities to deal with contact tracing and testing and follow up isolation and health care. She understood this, and we worked together to negotiate that. Her impact is broad and deep. And as a Black woman, I've been able to really help, not only my community, but all across the country on so many issues, because she understood it, and she got it.\n\n\n\nAnd now we\u2019re going to have one of us as vice president in the White House. This has taken a lot of blood, sweat and tears, a lot of work. And a lot of hope that we never lost sight of what we were working for and toward and, you know, this is just a major milestone for everybody.\n"

She has also been part of eight postseason appearances and six League Championship Series and three World Series Championship wins.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cMy goal is now to bring championship baseball to Miami,\u201d Ng said. \u201cI am both humbled and eager to continue building the winning culture our fans expect and deserve.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe move also means that two of the most powerful officials for the Marlins are women (Caroline O\u2019Connor became the team\u2019s chief operating officer last year).\n\n\n\nIn 1998, when Ng was an assistant GM with the Yankees, she told the Chicago Tribune that she was treated with \u201ckid gloves.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople used to apologize for swearing in front of me \u2014 until they realized I probably swear more than them,\u201d she said at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseball is a male-dominated industry. This year, MLB earned a C for gender hiring, though the percentage of women hired rose about 3 percent when compared with last year, according to the annual report card issued by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports (TIDES).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFacing gender discrimination, a group of women who work full time in the field started a private group chat last year to build a community, celebrate promotions and provide support.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere does, however, appear to be progress as the MLB works to hire more women and people of color at all levels of the sport.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the MLB hired Ren\u00e9e Tirado to be chief diversity and inclusion officer. Tirado, who left the post in 2019, was the league\u2019s first female chief officer and advocated for women in the industry.\n\n\n\nAt the start of the 2020 season, there were 21 women who had on-field coaching or player development roles, a significant increase from only seven in 2018 and three in 2017, according to the TIDES report card. Alyssa Nakken of the San Francisco Giants was hired early this year as the first on-field female coach with a major league team.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJustine Siegal, the first woman to coach for an MLB team, said it was wonderful to see a woman finally make it to the highest position of a team.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken this long, but sometimes you just have to keep fighting longer for change to come,\u201d Siegal said.\n\n\n\nSiegal said that baseball is a traditional sport and has discriminated against women, but the tide seems to be changing. After being repeatedly told that girls weren\u2019t supposed to play baseball, Siegal founded Baseball for All, a nonprofit organization that works to build gender equity in baseball.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have taken this long, but sometimes you just have to keep fighting longer for change to come.Justine Siegal, the first woman to coach for an MLB team\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the first challenge is that girls are not given opportunities to play baseball,\u201d Siegal said. \u201cThe more girls who play baseball, the more girls will want to work and be qualified to take on these baseball operation jobs.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the MLB central office, women make up more than 40 percent of all professional staff. This is about a 10 percent increase from 2018 and the highest percentage recorded since 2007, according to the institute.\n\n\n\nLeslie Heaphy, an associate history professor at Kent State University and the co-chair of the Women in Baseball Research Committee, said that this recent move shows current and future generations that women can be found in every position within baseball, which has lagged behind other sports when it comes to gender equity, she added.\n\n\n\nBaseball became known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite pastime,\u201d which in the 19th century implied White and male, Heaphy said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cBaseball has a longer history than basketball and football and has been attached to that image of masculinity,\u201d Heaphy said. \u201cI think that long tradition symbolizes what a lot of people\u2019s vision of America has been.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been hard for women to break that streak, but Heaphy said Ng\u2019s rise in the industry gives her hope that MLB will continue to move forward.\n"
Karen Bass addresses the question of filling Kamala Harris’ Senate seat,-6.0,44.83,https://19thnews.org/2020/11/karen-bass-addresses-question-of-filling-kamala-harris-senate-seat/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,19thnews.org,"\nWe\u2019re the only newsroom dedicated to writing about gender, politics and policy.&nbsp;Subscribe to our newsletter today.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Karen Bass has served as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus since 2019, after the 2018 midterm elections swept in the most diverse Congress in U.S. history, including a record 25 Black women.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring the 2020 election cycle, Bass\u2019 profile rose as one of the six Black women on the shortlist to become then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s running mate, a process that required her to navigate racial and gendered narratives, and that ultimately led to the historic selection of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n\n\n\nHarris heading to the White House leaves the Senate with no Black women, and Bass is among those rumored to be a potential successor. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, will fill Harris\u2019 vacancy, but the timing is not clear, as she has not yet stepped down. Bass\u2019 name has also been mentioned for potential cabinet roles, including Housing and Urban Development secretary, Health and Human Services secretary or U.N. Ambassador.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 19th\u2019s editor-at-large, Errin Haines, spoke to Bass on Friday about her future as she prepares to step down as CBC chair, and what\u2019s next for Black women in political leadership in the wake of an election that saw them in prominent roles as voters, candidates, organizers and elected officials.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 19th: We're so focused on what Black women's political leadership has meant in 2020, so looking ahead to 2021, talk about some of the Black women in the House who you think could be elevated as a result of appointments that could be made in a Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\n\nKaren Bass: Oh, sure. [Ohio Democratic Rep.] Marcia Fudge for secretary of Agriculture, [Illinois Democratic Rep.] Robin Kelly has a long history [and could be considered for secretary of] Health and Human Services, she heads up our Health Braintrust. Now, we don't want to deplete too many people, but I would start with those two. [Michigan Democratic Rep.] Brenda Lawrence could be postmaster general; she's got a long history of working for the U.S. Postal Service. [Texas Democratic Rep.] Sheila Jackson Lee for Homeland Security. [Alabama Democratic Rep.] Terri Sewell for Treasury or Commerce.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou have a relationship with President-elect Biden. Are these names that you are passing along to him as he is thinking about the transition?\n\n\n\nOh, that's a very good question. We are in the middle of that right now. As a matter of fact, in 30 minutes, we have a phone call with the transition team. So we're compiling African American appointees, period.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI want to ask you about Black women who could potentially be elevated to the Senate. Vice President-elect Harris is the only Black woman in the Senate and her vacancy is going to create an opening. Are there other potential cabinet appointments that could create vacancies in the Senate that you think could be filled by a Black woman?\n\n\n\n[Delaware Rep.] Lisa Blunt Rochester, I would think she would be number one because of [Delaware Democratic Sen.] Chris Coons, if he becomes secretary of state or national security advisor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Vice President-elect Harris, her vacancy would mean that there would be no Black women in the Senate. Do you think that her vacancy should be filled by a Black woman specifically?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSure, of course. I think that it will leave a vacuum to not have a Black woman there. And there are members of the [California] Legislative Black Caucus and other Black leaders that are calling for that. The main problem we're talking about here is diversifying the Senate, a body that really was only diverse at one time in history for a very short period of time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, obviously, your name has come up for this, so I have to ask you if this is a job that you want, or that you would be interested in?\n\n\n\nYou know, I'll tell you, there's three of us from California, and two of our names have been put forward: Barbara Lee and myself. Barbara Lee and I have a lifelong history of serving, and I know either one of us would be willing and happy to serve in whatever capacity is needed, especially at this point in time.\n\n\n\nYour term as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus ends in January. What are the prospects for Black women in leadership in the House in this next Congress?\n\n\n\nWell, you should know that there are Black women running for leadership right now. Robin Kelly is running to be vice chair of the [Democratic] caucus. Brenda Lawrence is running for a seat that is reserved for someone in Congress who has served five terms or less.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Black woman has never been elected to leadership in the House. Barbara Lee was appointed by Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi to be the co-chair of steering and policy, but there has never been a Black woman elected.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy is it time for that to change now?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI think that the nation has seen the role the Black women play in our country, in our Democratic party, and in our Democratic Caucus. It is surprising that hasn\u2019t happened before, but it hasn\u2019t and it certainly should.\n"
The spread of conspiracies and disinformation by women on social media,-4.83,47.0,https://19thnews.org/2020/10/19th-explains-women-disinformation-election-2020/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-19,19thnews.org,"\nSince the internet\u2019s advent, conspiracy theories have acquired followings online. Now, in the era of social media, people use platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to spread disinformation and misinformation. Instagram, the Facebook-owned image platform where influencers tout luxury, beauty and consumer culture, has also become an online home for conspiracies. And lately, one has been particularly prolific: QAnon.\n\n\n\nResearchers have seen a significant uptick in online discussions related to QAnon \u2014 a far-right conspiracy theory \u2014 across multiple digital platforms this year. In March, membership within QAnon Facebook groups increased by 120 percent; one journalist tracking the impact of QAnon found that between January and August, the biggest Instagram \u201cQ\u201d accounts \u201cgenerated 63 million interactions and 133 million video views.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe platforms are now taking action. Facebook, which acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, cracked down on October 6, saying, \u201cwe will remove any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content.\u201d On October 15, YouTube announced in a blog post that it would \u201cprohibit content that targets an individual or group with conspiracy theories that have been used to justify real-world violence.\u201d TikTok \u2014which has 100 million monthly active American users \u2014 as well as several smaller platforms, including Pinterest, Etsy, Peloton and Triller, have also taken a stance against QAnon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, conspiracies and disinformation have a way of finding new audiences. In recent months, QAnon content has become more prevalent on Instagram, a platform used predominantly by women, who appear to be the new target of this misinformation, according to experts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat is disinformation and how is it different from misinformation?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMisinformation is the inadvertent sharing of false information. Disinformation is the deliberate creation and sharing of information known to be false.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClaire Wardle \u2014 the founder of First Draft, a nonprofit focused on research and practice to address mis- and disinformation \u2014 identified seven distinct types of problematic content in the information ecosystem. Each type sits on a scale that loosely measures the intent to deceive, from satire or parody to intentionally fabricated content.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe deep anxiety and economic insecurity catalyzed by the coronavirus pandemic coupled with the unrest that resulted from the summer\u2019s protests left people especially vulnerable to disinformation. Conspiracy theorists try to exploit vulnerabilities, according to Rich Hanley, an associate journalism professor at Quinnipiac University.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a world that doesn\u2019t make sense, if you can create a narrative that seems to be credible, goes to people\u2019s emotional core and has a kernel of truth within it, then that narrative is going to take off,\u201d said Hanley, who studies fake news dissemination and social media bots.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is QAnon?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nQAnon is a \u201cwide-ranging conspiracy theory that claims that an elite group of child-trafficking pedophiles have been ruling the world for a number of decades and that President Donald Trump has a secret plan in place to bring this group to justice,\u201d according to a 2020 report published by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that tracks online extremism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn infamous conspiracy theory that is considered a predecessor to QAnon was Pizzagate, which falsely claimed a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., secretely harbored a pedophilia ring. In 2016, a man who believed the conspiracy theory was real went to the restaurant with an AR-15.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nQAnon started in October 2017 when someone identified as \u201cQ\u201d began posting a series of cryptic messages on 4chan, an anonymous online forum used by mostly young men. Q claimed to have high-level security clearance and information about Trump\u2019s ongoing battle against \u201cthe deep state,\u201d the Institute for Strategic Dialogue report said. One or more users claiming to be Q have continued to post thousands of times over the next few years on the site, which has been known to be a hotbed of hoaxes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou probably have a neighbor that is QAnon, but not all your neighbors are QAnon. Melissa Ryan, who helps policymakers and institutions combat extremism\n\n\n\nResearchers observed a significant increase in online QAnon discussions in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests and the run-up to the presidential election. The theory now includes anti-vaccine, anti-5G, antisemitic and anti-migrant rhetoric, all in addition to the core belief that a consortium of elites are supposedly trafficking and sacrificing children.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a choose your own adventure,\u201d said Melissa Ryan, who helps policymakers and institutions combat extremism. \u201cWhatever beliefs you\u2019re inclined to believe, someone at QAnon will tell you that\u2019s right.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrom October 2017 to June 2020, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue recorded more than 69 million tweets, 487,000 Facebook posts and 281,000 Instagram posts mentioning QAnon-related hashtags and phrases.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cI would suspect that a lot of right-wing content is over-amplified on how many people believe it,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe radicalization potential is still quite high. I would say you probably have a neighbor that is QAnon, but not all your neighbors are QAnon.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAre conspiracy theories new?\n\n\n\nConspiracy theorists have always existed, but it used to take disinformation much longer to spread, Hanley said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you were a Soviet intelligence officer during the Cold War and you wanted to spread misinformation about AIDS and blame the U.S. for it, you basically had to start a fake newspaper in some out-of-the-way country, publish a story about American scientists working for the Department of Defense, and wait two to three years for that fake story to wind its way to Europe and then the United States,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cNow, you can do it virtually in seconds.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe theory that an elite group of people are plotting to control the world by drinking the blood of children has roots in antisemitic conspiracy theories that date back hundreds of years, Hanley said. An iteration of that narrative was also told during the 19th century, when Native Americans were said to be kidnapping White children.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s version spreads so efficiently and effortlessly,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s believed by more people than was physically possible before.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy is disinformation spreading on Instagram?\n\n\n\nA 2019 report published from the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights predicted that Instagram could be a magnet for disinformation and misinformation in 2020 \u2014 more so than Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInstagram, which is most popular with 18 to 29-year-olds, played \u201ca much bigger role in Russia\u2019s 2016 election manipulation than most people realize,\u201d the report said. There are more than one billion active users currently on the image-based platform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHanley said more and more Instagram users, more than half of which are women, are spreading QAnon conspiracies \u2014 many unintentionally.\n\n\n\nIt appears that several conspiracies migrated from 4chan to Instagram via YouTube beauty and wellness influencers who used to share content about magic formulas, oils and crystals. \n\n\n\nThen, earlier this summer, QAnon gained additional followers after it hijacked #SaveTheChildren, a hashtag related to real anti-human-trafficking causes. This tactic of co-opting the hashtag helped amplify and expose Q messaging to American moms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe QAnon stuff infiltrated Instagram and seeped into the suburban consciousness of American women.Rich Hanley, associate journalism professor at Quinnipiac University\n\n\n\nA lot of the content isn\u2019t explicitly QAnon, but is connected to the conspiracy when traced back to its source, Hanley added.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe QAnon stuff infiltrated Instagram and seeped into the suburban consciousness of American women to a certain extent, and they bought into it,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cThe key is the children.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cHuman trafficking is an issue, and one that needs to be taken seriously,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cWhat QAnon is doing is riding on that reality to create an alternate reality where there\u2019s an elite group of wealthy globalists who are trafficking in the blood of children. There is no evidence, but there\u2019s enough truth in the stories: the vulnerability of the young.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaiyan Jia, an assistant journalism professor at Lehigh University, said visual content \u2014 Instagram's primary method of communication \u2014 tends to have a stronger, more emotional appeal. People who make judgments based on their emotions tend to do so to the detriment of logic and rationality.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt's not just Instagram, though. QAnon theories can be found across many platforms, including more niche ones like Nextdoor and Peloton. If there\u2019s a social media application, there will be disinformation associated with it, Hanley said.\n\n\n\nInformation on social media is transmitted through social circles. It\u2019s not always clear where posts originated from, complicating their credibility, Jia said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWe rely on our friends and family to make the judgment instead of analyzing the actual information,\u201d said Jia, who researches the psychological and social effects of communication technology. \u201cIf you trust the person who shared, you are more likely to trust the information.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean for the 2020 election?\n\n\n\nLess than 50 days before the election, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an announcement warning that \u201cforeign actors and cybercriminals\u201d might attempt to spread disinformation on social media to \u201cdiscredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.\u201d In March, the FBI had characterized conspiracy theory driven extremists as domestic terrorists, specifically citing QAnon followers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHelen Lee Bouygues, a fake news expert and founder of the Reboot Foundation, said the general population gets about 90 percent of their news from social media. The more that people use social media, the worse their news judgment becomes, according to her study published last month. This was true across age, education and political ideology. The majority of those surveyed expressed confidence in their ability to identify fake news, and yet only 1 percent of the 1000 participants used actual fact-checking techniques.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHanley said the opportunity for election manipulation has only increased since the last presidential race.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe 2016 election was like the junior varsity game, but 2020 is the varsity game,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cThe players have taken the field and the number of people who either create or disseminate disinformation is expanding wildly.\u201d\n\n\n\nNearly 90 percent of all Q-related hashtags between October 2017 and October 2019 originated from the United States, according to the ISD report. Dozens of political candidates linked to QAnon were running in 2020 for Congress, state legislatures and local races.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen asked to disavow QAnon in its entirety at a town hall on October 15, Trump refused. The president has never explicitly said he believes in the conspiracy theory, but he has praised QAnon supporters in the past, saying he heard they \u201clove our country\u201d and \u201care very strongly against pedophilia.\u201d&nbsp;He has also amplified QAnon-promoting accounts on Twitter, and QAnon merchandise, symbols and slogans can often be found at his rallies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a convergence between QAnon, the #SaveTheChildren hashtag and the president\u2019s supporters,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cIt is clearly something that the Democrats need to be aware of and figure out how to neutralize, which is very hard to do.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to disinformation on Instagram, it seems like the target increasingly is women, according to Alexandra Middlewood, an assistant professor at Wichita State University.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuburban women are a growing part of the electorate and, in recent presidential elections, their support is critical for electoral success. The Trump and Biden campaigns know that White suburban women are more likely to change their minds about the president than their male counterparts. A shift of several percentage points among them from 2016 to 2020 could decide whether Trump is re-elected.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen most often, particularly since 2016, is the use of dis- and misinformation that follows a narrative certain groups already believe,\u201d Middlewood said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA voter who is presented with information that already matches her political attitudes, for example, will be more convinced that this information is true \u2014 whether it is or not. Middlewood said research has shown that many people share content on their social media accounts \u201cto strengthen their social identity,\u201d not communicating whether something is true or false.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe spread of disinformation isn\u2019t likely to sway undecided voters, but instead used to reinforce beliefs held among members of the same political party. (Partisanship is the strongest predictor of vote choice, Middlewood said.)\n\n\n\n\u201cThe disinformation about voter fraud in particular is seemingly setting the stage for the president to challenge electoral results in November should he lose reelection,\u201d Middlewood said. \u201cAnd he will have a ready and willing base of support behind him should he do so.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat can be done?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn early October, Facebook announced that it would remove any Facebook pages, groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon \u2014 whether or not they contain violent content.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWe began directing people to credible child safety resources when they search for certain child safety hashtags last week \u2014 and we continue to work with external experts to address QAnon supporters using the issue of child safety to recruit and organize,\u201d the company said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the platform\u2019s efforts, 64 percent of Americans believe Facebook is at least somewhat responsible for spreading disinformation and 46 percent think Instagram is at least somewhat responsible for spreading disinformation, according to the NYU study.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBouygues said the responsibility also falls on the government and the people to learn better media literacy, use critical thinking and fact-check information more thoroughly. The government should sponsor this type of education in schools and finance more institutional media sources, she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst Draft provides resources, including checklists and recommended tips, to help journalists and anyone who is interested in verifying information. According to the nonprofit, there are five questions that should be answered when considering online content: Are you looking at the original piece of content, account or article? Who captured it? When was it captured? Where was it captured? Why was it captured?\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to be self-aware that we succumb to fake news,\u201d Bouygues said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBouygues, whose study found that people could become better at identifying fake news by reading an article about how to decipher legitimate versus fake news, was more optimistic people could learn to combat disinformation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe just need constant reminders,\u201d Bouygues said. \u201cIt\u2019s like learning a second language.\u201d&nbsp;\n"
Kamala Harris is a complicated choice for LGBTQ+ people,-10.0,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/08/kamala-harris-complicated-lgbtq-choice/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,19thnews.org,"\nRead the latest story on how LGBTQ+ Americans are greeting the Biden-Harris era with hope and hesitancy here.\n\n\n\nWhen she was San Francisco district attorney, Kamala Harris spent Valentine\u2019s Day of 2004 officiating same-sex marriages. Just two days earlier, Gavin Newsom, then the city\u2019s mayor, had asked city hall clerks to start issuing licenses to same-sex couples. The state\u2019s Supreme Court ordered San Francisco to shut down the weddings and nullified the marriages of 4,000 queer people the following month.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court wouldn\u2019t settle California\u2019s war over marriage equality until 2013. By then, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had already come out in support of equal marriage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany queer voters have historically viewed 2012, when Obama publicly stated his support for marriage equality, as a turning point. Supporting marriage equality has been used to gauge a candidate\u2019s true commitment to LGBTQ+ rights: Candidates who came out in favor of the issue before 2012 largely passed the test; candidates who backed equal marriage after just did it for political points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Kamala Harris, that has left a lot of room for bragging rights. In a field that started with roughly two dozen major contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket, Harris stood out as the candidate who could boast the earliest explicit on-record support for marriage equality (yes, Bernie Sanders backed LGBTQ+ rights in the 1970s; but he did not come out for marriage equality until 2009, favoring civil unions first).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2008, when California\u2019s Supreme Court overturned the state\u2019s LGBTQ+ marriage ban, Harris again officiated queer weddings. She helped create \u201can LGBTQ hate crimes unit\u201d while district attorney of San Francisco.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen she was California\u2019s attorney general, she battled the \u201cpanic defense,\u201d a legal strategy in which a person claims that anti-LGBTQ+ violence or murder is justified because the victim made sexual advances toward the perpetrator. In 2011, she backed marriage equality by petitioning to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to repeal Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut a lot has changed since 2012. A queer electorate that might have held up Harris as its champion eight years ago largely greeted her in 2020 with mixed emotions. At issue is her history as a prosecutor, a string of missteps on trans issues and recent support for bills cracking down on sex work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast February, Chase Strangio, the renowned attorney who fought the watershed Supreme Court employment cases, summed up the feelings up many progressive queer voters in an op-ed for OUT Magazine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a prosecutor, Harris\u2019s work has been as an arm of the state fighting to lock people in cages and defending policies that destroyed lives and communities,\u201d Strangio wrote. \u201cNow attempting to position herself as a criminal legal system reformer and an ally to the LGBTQ+ community, Harris seeks to rewrite her past rather than own it.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHarris has faced harsh criticism because she fought to block gender-affirming medical care for a trans woman in prison in 2015. In 2019, she told the Washington Blade that legal briefs in her office were often written without her consultation and that as attorney general, she was obligated to defend the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the bottom line is the buck stops with me, and I take full responsibility for what my office did,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\n\n\u201cHarris has taken full responsibility for this failing, and reiterated that transitioning inmates are entitled to receive the medical attention they require, need and deserve,\u201d a Human Rights Campaign spokesperson said in a statement to The 19th.\n\n\n\nIf that's how she feels about sex workers\u2019 rights, then she has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be her supporters.\u201dCourtney Trouble\n\n\n\nMychal Concepcion, a 50-year-old transgender man incarcerated at the Central California Women\u2019s Facility and the former board president of Justice Now, a prison abolition group, said he is \u201csuper\u201d excited that Biden chose Harris as his running mate.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has her own views and is not shy on speaking out,\u201d Concepcion wrote in an email to The 19th. \u201cI believe it will push Biden to be more progressive. He is part of an older generation. He is tied to white male privilege that was\/is abusive. She will be the check and balance to that!\u201d\n\n\n\nLGBTQ+ advocates have repeatedly questioned Harris\u2019 grasp of transgender issues. Harris backed FOSTA\/SESTA, a 2018 package of bills that aimed to curb sex trafficking by shutting down sites used by sex workers like Backpage and Craigslist classifieds. But many sex workers, transgender sex workers especially, decried the measures as deadly, wiping out critical screening tools they used to keep themselves safe.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSex work decriminalization has become increasingly popular among LGBTQ+ rights organizations. A disproportionate number of queer and trans people are engaged in sex work, often the result of employment discrimination. According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, transgender people are three times more likely than the general population to be unemployed (at 15 percent).\n\n\n\nHarris now says she supports decriminalizing sex work, but in an interview with The Root says she doesn\u2019t regret supporting FOSTA\/SESTA \u2014 the site Backpage was profiting from ads trafficking children, she claims. Her unwillingness to re-examine the bills has left some uneasy about her as a candidate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCourtney Trouble, a nonbinary trans sex worker, has some of those reservations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel like she's really proud of the work that she's done to get rid of Backpage and create FOSTA,\u201d said Trouble. \u201cAnd that's something that really needs to be discussed with her, because if that's how she feels about sex workers\u2019 rights, then she has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be her supporters.\u201d\n\n\n\nPublicly, LGBTQ+ groups have praised Harris as a longtime champion for equality.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cSenator Kamala Harris is nothing short of an exceptional choice for Vice President,\u201d said Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, in a media statement. \u201cThroughout her groundbreaking career, Senator Harris has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ community, standing with us when many, even sometimes those within her own party, did not.\u201d\n\n\n\nEquality organizations, like many voters, feel they can\u2019t afford to do anything but push Biden to a win; the prospect of another four years under President Trump is too terrifying, they say. LGBTQ+ media organization GLAAD keeps a running tab of the president\u2019s attacks on the community; at last tally the number was 167.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur community has a stark choice this November, four more years of a Trump-Pence administration dedicated to decimating our rights and dehumanizing us, or a new day where we are not only valued and accepted but put on a path to finally achieving the full equality all people deserve,\u201d said a Human Rights Campaign spokesperson in a statement to The 19th.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut behind the scenes, some advocates say they have told the Biden campaign that Harris still has work to do if she wants LGBTQ+ support.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMonica Roberts, author of the blog TransGriot and one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Black trans advocates, questions what more Harris can do to prove herself. Harris fielded tough questions from \u201cPose\u201d star Angelica Ross and singer\/songwriter Shea Diamond. Both said Harris answered those concerns and took accountability for past shortcomings on trans rights.\n\n\n\n\u201cI fail to understand why some of these trans folks act like people can't evolve and grow,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd if you can't, or you have reasons to just ignore that fact, then your problem with Kamala Harris is racial, not policy.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden himself represents a lukewarm option for many young progressive LGBTQ+ voters. Many are no longer captivated by his 2012 support for marriage equality, which has been the law of the land for five years now. This year is expected to be the deadliest on record for transgender people, and trans women interrupted this year\u2019s forums demanding that candidates address the epidemic of violence facing their communities. Biden was the last presidential candidate to release an LGBTQ+ platform in March.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI fail to understand why some of these trans folks act like people can't evolve and grow.\""Monica Roberts\n\n\n\nHe has had his own gaffes on LGBTQ+ issues. At an LGBTQ+ forum last fall, he quipped that being gay no longer came with the same stereotypes \u2014 \u201cgay bathhouses\u201d and \u201dround-the-clock sex.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to comment for this story.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHarris, as a presidential candidate, dropped an LGBTQ+ platform in October 2019. On the menu was the usual fare: a rollback of Trump\u2019s transgender military ban, an end to discrimination under the guise of religion, passage of the Equality Act. It was released on October 10, the morning of the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s LGBTQ+ town hall. That same day, Elizabeth Warren unveiled a much larger 12-page platform, and Pete Buttigieg also dropped a hefty proposal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFew talked about Harris\u2019 LGBTQ+ platform. The Texas Tribune covered Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pitch to queer voters last June, and NBC News reported on Mike Bloomberg\u2019s LGBTQ+ proposals this January. Harris\u2019 platform got little attention outside of queer media.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething that differentiates her platform from those of other candidates is a pledge to create a White House position dedicated to LGBTQ rights,\u201d the Advocate noted.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the year, at a CNN town hall in April, Harris was recounting her history working in the LGBTQ+ community. She drew attention to her work outlawing \u201cpanic defenses.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll remember the tragic cases involving transgender men who were killed,\u201d Harris said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere was just one problem. Transgender murders victims are overwhelmingly transgender women.&nbsp;\n"
Shirley Sherrod holds 'no ill will' against USDA nominee who ousted her,-10.0,46.0,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/shirley-sherrod-holds-no-ill-will-against-usda-nominee-who-ousted-her/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,19thnews.org,"\nA decade after she was forced to resign as Georgia state director of rural development for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Shirley Sherrod says she \u201cholds no ill will\u201d towards Agriculture secretary nominee Tom Vilsack, who played a key role in her resignation. She hopes that if Vilsack is confirmed, he will return to the role \u2014 which he held under the Obama administration \u2014 with a focus on Black farmers.\n\n\n\nA July 2010 incident thrust her into the national spotlight and out of federal government, where she had used her position to continue her life\u2019s work of helping Black farmers. Sherrod was ousted after some of her remarks during a speech were taken out of context and publicized by Andrew Breitbart.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn an interview with The 19th, she reflected on the moment before discussing her ongoing commitment to rural Black Georgians during a consequential election year in one of the areas hit the hardest by the pandemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cI have no ill will towards him, none at all,\u201d Sherrod said of Vilsack, who was introduced Thursday as Biden\u2019s pick. \u201cWhen I say, \u2018I forgive you,\u2019 I mean it. I can't dwell on that because there are things we need to accomplish.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe focus now, Sherrod said, must not be on the past, but on the work Vilsack should do moving forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cVilsack is certainly qualified,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knows the agency. He should be ready to get on the ground to make real change this time around. And we need to hold him to it. Black people need to see some real change.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn many ways, her message remains the same as it has been for her entire life.\n\n\n\nSherrod\u2019s life and livelihood have been shaped by the South, the soil and racism. Born in Baker County in southwest Georgia, her father, a Baptist church deacon, was fatally shot by a White farmer over a livestock dispute when Sherrod was 17.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn all-White jury did not charge his killer. Her father\u2019s murder was a formative moment for Sherrod, who vowed on the night of his death that she would stay in the South and fight for change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs a sociology student at Albany State University, she joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, where she met her husband, Charles Sherrod. The couple founded the Southwest Georgia Project and created New Communities, Inc., a collective farm and the first land trust in the country. Located in Lee County, the 6,000-acre farm was the largest tract of Black-owned land in the country, but a drought and inability to get government loans sank the project within a few years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor the next two decades, Sherrod continued her work to keep Black-owned farms afloat. In 1999, New Communities was among the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit against USDA, Pigford v. Glickman, claiming discriminatory lending by the agency\u2019s Farmers Home Administration. In 2009, USDA agreed to the largest civil rights settlement in history, with nearly $1 billion paid to 16,000 claimants. New Communities was awarded $12 million.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSherrod was hired to work for the Agriculture Department the same year.\n\n\n\nIn March 2010, Sherrod recounted a story about a White farmer seeking her help in the 1980s, telling an audience of NAACP members at her alma mater that the moment began to change her views on race. It was video of the speech that caused the uproar after Breitbart posted a clip of the comments to his site Big Government that July. The remarks, which from the clip sounded as if she was prejudiced against White farmers, drew condemnation from the NAACP, and Sherrod was forced to resign. She pulled over on the side of the road to take the call telling her to step down.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo days later, after the full remarks were reviewed, Vilsack called to apologize and offered her another job in the department, which she ultimately declined. Instead, Sherrod returned to her work with New Communities, helping farmers with what she had learned in her brief time at the agency.\n\n\n\nHouse majority whip and prominent Biden surrogate James Clyburn of South Carolina was among those who lobbied strongly for Ohio Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Black woman, to be nominated for Agriculture secretary. Fudge was announced Friday as the nominee for secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCritics of Vilsack\u2019s nomination point to his treatment of Sherrod and Black farmers during his previous tenure as reason for their objections. Sherrod said that should Vilsack reprise his role, she hopes the department will be a partner that looks to correct its legacy of systemic racism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cHe definitely needs to pay more attention to family farmers, and especially African American farmers,\u201d Sherrod said. \u201cWhen you look at the history of discrimination in that agency, when you look at the amount of land we have lost because of that discrimination through the years ... the things that they did, decisions that these guys made on a local level that made all the difference in where a farmer could keep his land, or keep his home, or not. I didn't say reparations, but maybe that's what I'm talking about \u2014 something that tries to right some of the wrongs that have been done to Black people.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2011, the organization bought a 1,600-acre property in Albany, Georgia \u2014 renamed Resora \u2014 that was the former plantation of the largest slaveholder in the state. The property includes a working farm that produces crops including pecans, satsuma oranges and zucchini squash. It also houses an agricultural research lab.\n\n\n\nAn aerial view of Resora, the 1,600-acre property Sherrod\u2019s organization owns in Albany, Georgia. \n (Courtesy of Resora)\n\n\n\nIt is from here that Sherrod\u2019s work continues, focused on helping Black farmers and rural Georgians. That work that has become increasingly urgent in a pandemic that has disproportionately impacted Black Americans from a public health and economic standpoint. Albany was among the deadliest hotspots in the world this spring as the virus surged across the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe numbers are beginning to creep up again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the ability to even grow food, even with us doing the outreach to them, has suffered.\u201d\n\n\n\nSherrod is also continuing to help register and turn out rural Black voters ahead of Georgia\u2019s Senate runoff elections next month, leveraging resources to empower trusted local influencers. She said the voters she hears from are focused on local issues, like education, but also infrastructure, health care, Internet access and food insecurity.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople listen to people they know,\u201d Sherrod said. \u201cTo have someone you know, someone who lives in the county with you, to remind you to vote and get to the polls is what we try to organize. We are not giving up on the people there, because their needs, in some cases, are even greater than those of people living in the cities.\u201d\n"
Biden under pressure to appoint first Native American to head Interior Department,-6.0,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/biden-under-pressure-to-appoint-first-native-american-to-head-interior-department/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,19thnews.org,"\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is under pressure to make history with his pick to lead the Department of the Interior by nominating the first-ever Native American to lead the federal agency, which oversees federal land and natural resources, and administers most programs related to the more than 550 federally recognized tribes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA leading contender is Deb Haaland, a second-term House of Representatives lawmaker from New Mexico whose potentially history-making nomination has inspired a persuasion campaign by tribal leaders, environmental groups and progressive leaders. They say the congresswoman \u2014 a lawyer, climate activist and enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo \u2014 is uniquely suited to be Interior\u2019s first Indigenous leader.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe it is long past time that a Native American person serve as Secretary of the Interior,\u201d more than 150 elected leaders of tribal nations wrote in a letter last week to Biden\u2019s transition team.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cRep. Haaland has championed the environment, helped lead efforts to address climate change, and worked to improve the nation-to-nation relationship between our Tribes and the United States \u2014 all issues within the Department of the Interior\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe high-profile push to bring Haaland\u2019s Interior candidacy to the fore began just days after television networks declared Biden and Kamala Harris the winners of the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nOn November 13, a dozen environmental organizations said in a letter to Biden that they could \u201cthink of no better person to run the Department of the Interior\u201d than Haaland, who would make the agency a \u201ctrue long-term steward of our nation\u2019s most precious resources.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, three dozen groups affiliated with the Indigenous Environmental Network sent a letter saying Haaland was the ideal pick to \u201chelp facilitate the Biden\/Harris vision for dealing with climate change, addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in Indian Country, ensuring an effective economic just recovery plan for Tribes and communities, overseeing the protection of public lands and fulfilling all treaty and statutory obligations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first Indigenous woman to head the Department of Interior will inspire and provide hope not only to the Indigenous Peoples of this land, but also to all those who have vision for the future,\u201d the network wrote.\n\n\n\nHaaland\u2019s congressional office declined to comment on the selection process for the Interior post. Biden\u2019s transition team declined to comment on its deliberations or when the president-elect will make an announcement.\n\n\n\nHaaland has made history before. When she was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018, she was one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, along with fellow Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids from Kansas. Haaland, a former state party chair, had centered her campaign on combating climate change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring Haaland\u2019s first term, she became vice chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, where she also chaired its subcommittee on national parks and public lands. Haaland, the daughter of two veterans \u2014 her father was in the Marines and her mother in the Navy \u2014 also serves on the chamber\u2019s Armed Services Committee. She handily won her re-election bid in November by more than 15 points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 50 of Haaland\u2019s Democratic House colleagues said in a letter to Biden last month that \u201cshe has distinguished herself as a respected leader within our caucus\u201d during her first two years in office, citing her leadership on climate issues and her committee stewardship of two public lands bills that were signed into law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can make history by giving Native Americans a seat at the Cabinet table for the first time. We strongly recommend that you nominate Rep. Deb Haaland for this important role,\u201d National Resources Committee Chair Raul Grijalva wrote on behalf of the lawmakers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf Haaland has a factor working against her it is the same one that her supporters believe makes her the best pick for the job: her bona fides with the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing and policy positions that are to the left of Biden\u2019s.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHaaland protested the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock in 2016. She backs the Green New Deal to address climate change and economic inequality, which Biden does not support in full but calls a \u201ccrucial framework.\u201d She holds a leadership role in the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Before backing Biden, Haaland co-chaired the presidential campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a fellow progressive.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHaaland then became enthusiastically involved in Biden\u2019s campaign, joining his Climate Engagement Advisory Council and hosting Indigenous Women for Biden events. She helped the campaign mark Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day by appearing with other elected officials and tribal leaders at an October event that highlighted Biden\u2019s plan for tribal nations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, unnamed \u201cBiden advisers\u201d have questioned whether Haaland has the right experience for the Interior role. A Biden representative said the remarks were not coming from members of the transition team. \u201cNo one is trying to discount Deb Haaland \u2014 or her experience,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nNo decision has been made, and other candidates are still under consideration, including Michael Connor, a member of the Taos Pueblo in New Mexico and a former deputy Interior secretary during the Obama administration. Also thought to be a serious contender is New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall, a Democrat who is retiring at the end of the year and, shortly after the election, released a document highlighting his work on behalf of Native communities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Interior Department was created in 1849 and its leader holds a Cabinet-level position that requires Senate confirmation. It employs about 70,000 people across nine divisions, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s Interior pick will likely move early on to reverse a push during the Trump administration to open additional federal lands to oil and gas extraction. Trump\u2019s first Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, left the post after the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General began investigating expensive flights and other expenditures. His replacement, David Bernhardt, was a deputy secretary and oil industry lobbyist. Biden has promised to end all new fossil fuel extraction on public lands.\n"
Pregnant health care workers could get Pfizer vaccine after FDA emergency authorization,-0.67,44.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/pregnant-health-care-workers-could-get-pfizer-vaccine-after-fda-panel-votes-for-emergency-authorization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-10,19thnews.org,"\nA top government panel voted in favor of granting an emergency use authorization for Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine candidate for people 16 and older, including those who are pregnant \u2014 a major step toward administering the first round of COVID-19 immunizations in the United States, and a notable departure from how British regulators addressed the pregnancy question.\n\n\n\nThe Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\u2019s recommendation will now head to the Food and Drug Administration, which is expected to accept that advice. If the FDA grants emergency authorization, some Americans could start receiving vaccines within a matter of days, and the majority will likely be women.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmergency use authorizations (EUAs) are an interim way to make drugs available in crises, but they require less safety and efficacy data than does full government approval. At Thursday\u2019s meeting, government scientists emphasized the need to track the health of people who receive the initial Pfizer vaccines, monitoring both their level of immunity and what kind of adverse reactions they have. Pfizer is planning to seek full government approval next spring, after submitting more vaccine data.\n\n\n\nStill, the authorization has major implications. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines be given to health care workers \u2014&nbsp;particularly those in direct contact with people who have contracted the coronavirus \u2014&nbsp;and residents of nursing homes. State governments will be charged with distributing vaccines to eligible residents. But there won\u2019t immediately be enough vaccines to cover everyone, even in those groups.\n\n\n\nWomen will likely constitute the majority of immediate beneficiaries. About 20 million Americans work in health care, and 75 percent of those workers are women. More than two-thirds of the nation\u2019s 1.3 million long-term nursing home residents are women.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotably, the FDA advisory committee did not explicitly prohibit giving the vaccine to pregnant people otherwise eligible for the vaccine. That leaves open the door for health care workers who are pregnant and breastfeeding during the initial vaccine distribution \u2014 an estimated 330,000 people \u2014 to get the two-shot regimen when&nbsp; their states and hospitals receive the vaccine. Pfizer\u2019s large-scale vaccine trial excluded those who were pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have really no data to speak to risks specific to pregnant women or fetuses, but also no data that would warrant a contra-indication to use in pregnancy at this time,\u201d Doran Fink, an FDA deputy director who specializes in vaccines, said at the meeting. \u201cIn the interest of allowing women of child-bearing potential who would consider vaccination, who are in the population approved for use under an EUA \u2013 they would be free to make their own decision, in conjunction with their health care providers.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring the meeting, government officials acknowledged the particular challenge posed by vaccinating pregnant people, especially those who are more likely to be exposed to the virus through work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThe early indication is there may be a higher risk of preterm delivery for pregnant women infected with COVID-19 compared to women without COVID-19, but there\u2019s ongoing efforts to assess those and other pregnancy-related risks,\u201d Aron Hall, a CDC scientist, told the panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Pfizer said it expected to have data by mid-December about whether animal trials of the vaccine would have negative repercussions on the reproductive system \u2014 something known as \u201creproductive toxicity\u201d \u2014 which is an important question for pregnant people taking the vaccine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd though Pfizer excluded pregnant people from enrolling in the study, 23 participants became pregnant during the trial, according to company data. Twelve received the vaccine, and 11 were in the placebo group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat information isn\u2019t enough to draw larger-scale conclusions. The FDA has required that Pfizer track and submit regular data about how people respond if they get the vaccine while pregnant, including whether they develop any adverse events. The company also intends to launch studies on pregnancy and the vaccine next year.\n\n\n\nImmediately, it\u2019s likely that states and local health care systems will have to decide how to distribute a limited supply of vaccines. They could determine on their own whether to treat pregnant health care workers as part of the immediate priority immunization group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMedical groups, including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have argued that pregnant health care workers should be given the option of taking the vaccine. The technology behind Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, messenger RNA, isn\u2019t known to cause special problems for either pregnant people or their fetuses. (Messenger RNA is also the basis for the Zika vaccine.)\n\n\n\nIn an op-ed published this week at Stat News, three medical ethicists argued that pregnant health care workers should be given the option to take any early vaccine, factoring in their risk of on-the-job COVID exposure.\n\n\n\n\u201cA restrictive policy would not only deny pregnant and lactating individuals the opportunity to work with the same protection afforded their co-workers, but would further strain available human health resources over the next few months, when pandemic cases \u2014 and the need for health care \u2014 are peaking,\u201d the authors wrote.\n"
Inside the Lincoln Project’s ‘toxic’ workplace,-0.33,57.0,https://19thnews.org/2021/02/lincoln-project-toxic-workplace/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-12,19thnews.org,"\nThe Lincoln Project\u2019s launch in late 2019 was designed to make a splash.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are Republicans, and we want Trump defeated,\u201d four of its co-founders wrote in the New York Times of the organization that would go on to raise nearly $90 million for its stated mission of defeating Donald Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box in 2020.\n\n\n\nThey created attention-grabbing ads that provoked responses from the former president. High-profile liberals such as DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen wrote them six-figure checks. Hundreds of small-dollar donations poured in. Leaders and staff decamped to a pre-election headquarters in the ski haven of Park City, Utah, where their effort was chronicled by Hollywood filmmakers. Their post-election plans included leveraging the massive following they gained to build a media empire. They recently launched the platform LPTV.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut, as of this week, just three of the Lincoln Project\u2019s eight co-founders remained \u2014 Rick Wilson, Reed Galen and Steve Schmidt. Schmidt resigned from the organization\u2019s board late Friday, Axios reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe organization is facing a rapidly escalating controversy over allegations that another of its co-founders, John Weaver, sexually harassed more than a dozen young men, including some working for the project, and over what other members of senior management knew about the claims and when they knew it.\n\n\n\nThe accusations have roiled the organization, and as its current and former employees and contractors began coming forward to discuss them, they described a workplace where women in key positions were sidelined and where sexist and homophobic language was used by those in leadership posts.\n\n\n\nIn reporting a story over the past several weeks about the Lincoln Project\u2019s management, culture, finances and handling of the Weaver allegations, The 19th interviewed nearly two dozen individuals currently or formerly associated with the group or familiar with its operations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly all of them said they feared speaking publicly about their experiences with the Lincoln Project and its remaining co-founders. Many cited their tendency to \u201cgo nuclear,\u201d as several put it, when faced with internal dynamics that could undermine the public image they cultivated with their liberal fans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe interviews depict an organization that grew quickly, with little planning at its inception, and then began to spiral out of control as its founders quarreled over the organization\u2019s direction, finances, tactics and even who would own the donor data that the project would eventually amass. Some of the co-founders had an informal management agreement that excluded the others, without their knowledge. Several had private firms to which the Lincoln Project channeled tens of millions of dollars that are then not subject to disclosure, while others were paid relatively modest amounts directly or nothing at all. There were clashes over ego and resentments over podcasts and television contracts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Lincoln Project\u2019s founders were some of the highest-profile players in Republican politics before they rejected Trump and became apostates within their own party. There was George Conway, a high-profile conservative lawyer who is married to Kellyanne Conway, who was a top adviser to Trump. Weaver worked on Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential campaigns, as did Galen and Schmidt. Mike Madrid is a strategist specializing in Latinx voting trends. Jennifer Horn is a former GOP chair in New Hampshire. Wilson worked on Rudy Giuliani\u2019s mayoral and Senate campaigns. Ron Steslow started his own consulting firm after working at the National Republican Senatorial Committee.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConway was the first to leave in August, citing family obligations. Weaver took medical leave around the same time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA three-person board \u2014 Galen, Madrid and Steslow \u2014 was created without input from some of the other co-founders. Eventually, disputes over that board, and its scope, led to bitter infighting that involved individual co-founders lawyering up and threatening one another with \u201coppo\u201d research, Washington speak for the type of negative information amassed by a political campaign or organization to use against a rival.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn late 2020, Conway stepped in to help mediate what was quickly becoming a civil war within the organization. Madrid and Steslow departed in December after signing nondisclosure agreements and receiving separation packages that those familiar with the negotiations describe as lucrative.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn December 21, the Lincoln Project paid Madrid\u2019s firm, Grassroots Lab, two round sum payments of $1.1 million and $300,000. On the same date, it paid Steslow\u2019s firm, TUSK Digital, $900,000. All of the payments were described as for \u201cpolitical strategy consulting\u201d on campaign finance filings.\n\n\n\nThe Lincoln Project was organized as a super PAC, meaning it could raise and spend unlimited sums of money but had to disclose only basic details about where the money was going. The firms that some of the co-founders brought with them to the Lincoln Project\u2019s work became a source of internal frustration, as more than half of the nearly $90 million raised by the project flowed to firms controlled by its various founders. Once it was there, there was usually no way to track how they spent or kept it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs of late January, Galen\u2019s firm, Summit Strategic Communications, had received roughly $27.5 million from the Lincoln Project, with the bulk of that going to \u201cindependent expenditures\u201d such as television or Internet advertisements and nearly $7 million to consulting. Steslow\u2019s firm, TUSK, received $22.4 million, with $7.1 million for consulting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchmidt\u2019s firm, SES Strategies, received $1.5 million for consulting, but he told the Chicago Tribune he returned it. Madrid\u2019s Grassroots Lab received nearly $2.2 million for consulting services. The Lincoln Project paid Horn directly in amounts of $5,000 or $10,000 per month, campaign finance filings show. In the fall, she began receiving additional payments from LPTV, but in all, her annual compensation was approximately $150,000, sources familiar with the situation said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is no way to determine what portion of the consulting fees went directly to the co-founders as their compensation for Lincoln Project work, or whether they paid one another, according to campaign finance experts. Super PACs are structured this way by design.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuper PACs are widely used by both political parties, but the percent of the Lincoln Project\u2019s money that went to vendors and firms connected to its co-founders raised eyebrows given the group\u2019s criticism of Trump-affiliated political groups that similarly directed money to the organizations of allies as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother point of internal financial contention was the donor information that Lincoln Project amassed with ads that spread across social media. The specifics over who or which entity would own the data was not negotiated in advance, sources said, and the data\u2019s market value grew as more and more people gave.\n\n\n\nA frequent quip from Schmidt overheard by multiple people was that the Lincoln Project was his vehicle to achieve \u201cgenerational wealth.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs senior management squabbled over how to divide the pieces of the project\u2019s financial pie, dissatisfaction was growing within the organization\u2019s more junior ranks, which were made up of largely young and liberal staffers who said they had different standards than some of the group\u2019s leaders, citing Schmidt and Wilson specifically. There was language used in both the Lincoln Project\u2019s ads and within its workplace about gender and sexuality that made many of them uncomfortable, the dozens of interviews revealed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYoung men were \u201cwizards\u201d while young women were \u201cgirls.\u201d Political rivals were \u201cpussies\u201d or \u201ccocksuckers\u201d or \u201cfaggots.\u201d By the time the staff convened in Park City, the situation had become so \u201ctoxic,\u201d according to more than a dozen accounts, that at least two co-founders, neither of whom remain at the project, had tried unsuccessfully to intervene to improve working conditions.\n\n\n\nStaff had also complained that some of the project\u2019s ads, specifically some related to Ivanka Trump, were sexist. There was dissatisfaction among the ranks when Ben Howe, billed as the wunderkind behind some of the Lincoln Project\u2019s earliest ads, was brought back by Wilson. Howe had been fired after The 19th reported that in a series of tweets, he had used offensive slang for female anatomy to insult political rivals.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere were few women in Lincoln Project\u2019s leadership, and those who were there were treated differently than the men, multiple people said. Horn was left out of meetings and not consulted about key decisions or public statements. At points, others within the organization had to persuade her not to quit entirely.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Thursday night, the Lincoln Project tweeted out private direct messages on the social media platform between Horn, who left the organization last week, and this reporter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHorn had just provided a lengthy statement to the New York Times on the specifics of her departure, citing the remaining co-founders\u2019 handling of the allegations against Weaver and saying that when she raised her concerns she was \u201cyelled at, demeaned and lied to.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Lincoln Project had the week before released a statement about Horn\u2019s departure \u2014 it had not done so for Madrid or Steslow \u2014 that said they had parted ways with Horn over a compensation dispute after she asked for a \u201csigning bonus\u201d of $250,000 to remain with the group for its post-election work, along with a $40,000-per-month consulting contract.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHorn, who was in the middle of negotiating a post-election employment contract, has not denied the specifics. She said her departure was not about compensation but a request to take on sexual harassment that was \u201crejected outright.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome of Horn\u2019s allies with ties to the Lincoln Project reached out to The 19th at that time, wanting to discuss the group\u2019s treatment of her specifically and women generally.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe screenshots shared Thursday night by the Lincoln Project, one of which was reshared by Wilson from his personal account, were of Horn\u2019s inbox on the social media platform. She said she had neither provided the images to the Lincoln Project nor had she given another individual permission to access her account. The tweets were quickly deleted after Conway said publicly that the move \u201clooks on its face to be a violation of federal law\u201d and urged their removal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Lincoln Project\u2019s sharing of Horn\u2019s private messages came shortly after The 19th had reached out to its spokesperson, Kurt Bardella, as well as Wilson, Schmidt and Galen, with a list of more than 20 specifics about the group\u2019s management, finances and handling of the Weaver allegations, drawn from publicly available government records and the interviews that it intended to publish in a forthcoming story.\n\n\n\nBardella said Friday that he was no longer with the Lincoln Project, effective immediately. Wilson, Schmidt and Galen did not directly respond to any of the points laid out by The 19th.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNew attention has been drawn to issues at the Lincoln Project in the wake of allegations about Weaver.\n\n\n\nSources familiar with internal communications said that in June, multiple members of the Lincoln Project\u2019s senior leadership team were told in conversations and in writing about allegations that Weaver had sexually harassed young men, including some who were doing work for the organization.\n\n\n\nBy August, nearly all of the co-founders still with the project were aware and a media plan was being crafted after the group\u2019s employees and contractors were contacted by a news outlet working on a story about it. By the time staff gathered in Park City for the build-up to the election, it was an open secret even among junior staff, sources said.\n\n\n\nThe first allegations were published in January, first in the American Conservative and later in other publications, including the New York Times. Schmidt told the Times that senior management was not aware until that month. Schmidt\u2019s timeline conflicts with that offered by more than a dozen sources who worked within and as contractors for the group at various points.\n\n\n\nIn the past few days, multiple news outlets have published articles laying out more extensive accusations against Weaver, as well as allegations that they were known earlier than previously reported. Schmidt has run point on responding to the reporting.\n\n\n\nHe told the Associated Press on Wednesday that no Lincoln Project employee, intern or contractor ever made an allegation so serious it would have triggered an investigation by an independent investigator. He provided the same statement to New York Magazine on Thursday. By Thursday night, the Lincoln Project announced it would hire a \u201cbest-in-class outside professional\u201d to investigate the matter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho knew how much and when, and who can say what, is now dominating the back-and-forth between those who remain at the Lincoln Project and those who have left.\n\n\n\nWhen Ryan Girdusky first wrote about the allegations for the American Conservative magazine, he told The 19th it was a \u201cconstant problem of finding someone willing to come out and make allegations, go on the record, and within 48 hours, out of fear for their future, would drop out of the story. It happened for months on end.\u201d\n\n\n\nConway and Horn, who said she was not aware of severity of the allegations against Weaver until the New York Times published its story in January, have called for the Lincoln Project\u2019s current and former staff to be released from their nondisclosure agreements.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe group\u2019s remaining leaders said Thursday night that anyone who wants to be released from their nondisclosure agreements to discuss allegations against Weaver should reach out to them directly. Six individuals told the New York Times that they did not feel comfortable doing so, citing Horn\u2019s treatment and Schmidt\u2019s statements about when he first learned of the allegations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSteslow\u2019s lawyer on Thursday night sent the Lincoln Project a letter asking that he be released from the nondisclosure agreement he signed at the time of his departure, a spokesperson said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cAny time there is an imbalance of power in a relationship, the weaker person becomes vulnerable to abuse. The stronger, more influential person has an obligation to conduct themselves with honor and integrity in order to preserve the dignity and autonomy of all involved,\u201d Horn said in the Thursday night statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cVictims deserve to be&nbsp; \u2014 and must be \u2014 heard,\u201d she added.&nbsp;\n"

Chair of the DNC Tom Perez quickly acknowledged the anniversary and pointed out that Wisconsin was the first to ratify the amendment. And Keely Sage, the president of Tennessee College Democrats, later mentioned the centennial and her state\u2019s role in its passage before casting the state\u2019s 23 votes for Sen. Bernie Sanders and 50 votes for Joe Biden.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cOne hundred years ago tonight, suffragists based here at the Hermitage Hotel in Nashville cheered as Tennessee became the 36th and deciding state to ratify the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote,\u201d Sage said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong the dozens of speakers Tuesday \u2014 the theme of which was \u201cLeadership Matters\u201d \u2014 was Stacey Abrams, who spoke about how the country is currently confronting systematic voter suppression. Abrams, the former minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives and the first Black woman to be on the major-party ticket in a U.S. gubernatorial race, said Joe Biden \u201cwill be a champion for free and fair elections.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates discussed Russian interference in our elections and President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to block U.S. Postal Service funding to limit people\u2019s ability to vote by mail. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest current member of Congress and its youngest woman ever elected, outlined a progressive vision of America in 90 seconds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut no major party leaders or keynote speakers explicitly mentioned the 19th Amendment or the day\u2019s significance, despite the fact that women now make up the majority of the American electorate.\n\n\n\nThe 19th Amendment declared that the right to vote for citizens of the United States should not be denied on account of sex, but this victory came at the expense of the Black women who fought alongside White suffragists. Throughout the South and in parts of the West, there were still policies and often violence that kept Black women from the polls. It wasn\u2019t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they won their right to vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany Latinos, Native Americans and Asian Americans had to wait until 1975 to access the ballot when the Voting Rights Act was expanded, removing English language requirements. And the suffrage movement is still unfinished, particularly for Black, Latino and transgender voters.&nbsp;\n"
Biden’s first 100 days: How diverse is the administration?,-9.67,43.67,https://19thnews.org/2021/04/biden-promised-the-most-diverse-administration-ever-heres-how-hes-doing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-30,19thnews.org,"\nBe the first to read our 100 days coverage.&nbsp;Subscribe to our newsletter today.\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden promised to have a Cabinet that reflected the diversity of the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlongside Kamala Harris, the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to be vice president, Biden said last December before announcing some of his Cabinet nominees: \u201cI promise you, you\u2019ll see the most diverse Cabinet representative of all folks \u2014 Asian Americans, African Americans, Latinos, LGBTQ \u2014 across the board.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Cabinet, which includes the vice president and the heads of 15 executive departments, presidents fill roughly 4,000 politically appointed positions, including more than 1,200 that must be confirmed by the Senate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMultiple groups gather data on diversity in the administration. The 19th spoke to experts at the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that provides consulting services to government agencies; the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP); and Inclusive America, a nonprofit dedicated to government diversity.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Partnership for Public Service, which tracks Biden\u2019s appointees in collaboration with The Washington Post, 41 people had been confirmed by the Senate as of April 29, out of 220 who had been nominated. In comparison, 28 appointees had been confirmed in the Trump administration at the 100-day mark. Former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had 67 and 34, respectively.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s where the Biden administration stands after 100 days in office:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n58 percent of Biden\u2019s agency appointees are women.\n\n\n\nKristine Simmons, the vice president of government affairs at the Partnership for Public Service, said Biden is the first president in modern history to appoint more women than men in his first 100 days.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOf the 1,500 agency appointees thus far, about 58 percent are women, according to the White House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKelly Dittmar, director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics, said&nbsp; about 44 percent of the 25 Cabinet and Cabinet-level senior positions, including the vice presidency, are held by women, the highest level for any president. The first woman to be appointed to a Cabinet or Cabinet-level position was Frances Perkins, named secretary of labor in 1933. Since then, only 64 women have held such positions \u2014 including the 11 in Biden\u2019s administration.\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/7iH0h\/5\/\n\n\n\n\nThe administration has at least 16 high-level \u201cfirsts.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than a dozen of Biden\u2019s chosen leaders are breaking new ground, the first in their community to hold a position.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKamala Harris is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to be vice presidentJanet Yellen is the first woman to be secretary of the treasury&nbsp;Deb Haaland, the secretary of the interior, is the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretaryCecilia Rouse is the first woman of color to chair the Council of Economic AdvisorsKatherine Tai is the first woman of color to serve as U.S. trade representativeAvril Haines is the first woman to lead the U.S. intelligence communityWendy Sherman is the first woman to serve as Deputy Secretary of StateKathleen Hicks is the first woman to serve as Deputy Secretary of DefenseKarine Jean-Pierre is the first openly lesbian person to serve as the vice presidential chief of staffRachel Levine is the first openly transgender person to be confirmed by the SenatePete Buttigieg is the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve in the CabinetLloyd Austin is the first Black secretary of defenseAlejandro Mayorkas is the first Latino and immigrant to serve as secretary of homeland securityXavier Becerra is the first Latino to serve as secretary of health and human services&nbsp;Wally Adeyamo is the first Black man to serve as Deputy Secretary of the TreasuryFor the first time, the communications team is comprised of all women\n\n\n\nPrior to this administration, President Bill Clinton had the most diverse Cabinet when it comes to race and gender, according to Suzanne Chod, a professor of political science at North Central College in Illinois.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has been delegating quite a bit of responsibility to Harris and the Cabinet secretaries \u2014 giving them \u201creal authority,\u201d Chod said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just enough to have someone in the literal room where decisions are made,\u201d Chod said. \u201cIt\u2019s about that person\u2019s voice being equal to everyone else in the room.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHistorically, one of the challenges to increasing diversity has been a reluctance to make commitments along lines of identity, Dittmar said. Presidential candidates feared they would open themselves up for false accusations of choosing people based on demographics instead of merit. In fact, women and people of color tend to have greater qualifications because the bar is often higher, she said.\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/ccmoF\/7\/\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time in two decades, there is no Asian American Cabinet secretary.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMark Hanis, co-founder of Inclusive America, said that for the first time in decades, there is no Asian American or Pacific Islander Cabinet secretary.\n\n\n\nThe statutory Cabinet includes the vice president and the leaders of 15 executive departments. Biden has designated nine other officials as part of the Cabinet. One is Tai, the U.S. trade representative and only Asian American in a Cabinet-level position. Neera Tanden, a South Asian American, was also poised to land a Cabinet-level position until Senate opposition sank her nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbout 15 percent of Biden\u2019s total agency appointees identify as AAPI \u2014 more than double the percentage of Asian Americans in the total U.S. population.\n\n\n\nAbout 15 percent of appointees identify as Latinx.\n\n\n\nAccording to the White House, 15 percent of Biden\u2019s 1,500 hired appointees identify as Latinx, while they account for nearly 19 percent of the total U.S. population.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, there is a gap in Latinx representation in senior positions, Hanis said. Only 3.8 percent of deputy secretaries and no chiefs of staff identify as Latinx.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnly 3 percent of appointees identify as disabled or having a disability.\n\n\n\nHanis said the biggest diversity gap he has seen is the representation of people with disabilities. About 1 in 4 Americans live with a disability, he said, and yet only 3 percent of all appointees identify as disabled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to leadership, the disparity is wider. Hanis said he is not aware of any senior officials that have disabilities.\n\n\n\nAbout 48 percent of Cabinet-level officials attended an Ivy League school.\n\n\n\nNearly half of the current Cabinet-level officials have attended an Ivy League school, according to data compiled by Inclusive America. Twelve of the 25 Cabinet and Cabinet-level officials went to Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania or Princeton.\n\n\n\nDiversity goes beyond demographic identity, Dittmar said. True representation is more directly tied to different lived experiences.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving everybody come from Harvard or come from a wealthier, privileged background is problematic even if it is 50\/50 women and men,\u201d Dittmar said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House says it has set a record on getting people into administration jobs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House says that it has appointed nearly 1,500 people who don\u2019t need to be confirmed by the Senate and that more than half are women and half identify as non-White.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe goal is to get parity at every level of government.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a way to do it if you\u2019re intentional,\u201d Hanis said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big mantra with those of us in the diversity, equity and inclusion space. It doesn\u2019t just happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nToo often, people are chosen based on their networks, Dittmar said. It\u2019s important that there is an access and pipeline to these powerful positions for minority groups.\n\n\n\n\u201cDiversity begets diversity,\u201d Dittmar said.\n\n\n\nChod said this is the largest effort she\u2019s seen to have a diverse administration \u2014 a push that is long overdue and must continue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to go back to the root of the inequity,\u201d Chod said. \u201c...&nbsp; It can\u2019t just be a band-aid fix. We have to get to the root of it and open up that wound.\u201d&nbsp;\n"
Exclusive: Study finds pregnancy-related health care coverage varies widely from state to state,-6.33,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2021/04/exclusive-study-finds-pregnancy-related-health-care-coverage-varies-widely-from-state-to-state/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-30,19thnews.org,"\nA new analysis first shared with The 19th shows that the odds of finding adequate pregnancy-related health care can vary widely from state to state, despite an Affordable Care Act regulation that deems such care essential for many private insurance plans to cover.\n\n\n\nThe review, conducted by the left-leaning Center for American Progress, looks across the country at the so-called \u201cbenchmark plans\u201d that ultimately shape what insurance plans sold on the individual marketplace will cover. For Americans with that coverage, prenatal and postnatal benefits differ dramatically based on where they live, the analysis shows.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe report found that people in Arkansas and North Dakota are only guaranteed one or two prenatal ultrasounds, respectively, if they are enrolled in marketplace coverage. Typical pregnancies only require two ultrasounds, but potential fetal complications could necessitate more screenings, which would not necessarily be covered.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn four states \u2014Alabama, Idaho, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 the benchmark plans don\u2019t cover pregnancy-related services for someone who is claimed as a dependent, which some lawyers argue may violate ACA regulations. In six states, benchmark plans explicitly exclude coverage of home births. No state\u2019s benchmark explicitly covers doulas, and Connecticut\u2019s benchmark actively excludes them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cStates have so much flexibility to define what is included in these services, even if it\u2019s not consistent with what people might need,\u201d said Jamille Fields Allsbrook, an author of the report and CAP\u2019s director of women\u2019s health and rights. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s ever been pregnant \u2014 who ever knows how many [ultrasounds] you might need? That was alarming to us.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe issue boils down to how the ACA is interpreted. The law requires that marketplace insurance cover 10 \u201cessential\u201d health benefits, one of which is pregnancy-related care. But it doesn\u2019t define what that means in practice. Instead, benchmark plans provide a template for other insurance to base their coverage on, giving plans the freedom to add on more benefits, if they choose.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the ACA was first passed, the law\u2019s language \u2014 which gave the Health and Human Services secretary power to clarify what would satisfy the essential health benefit requirement \u2014 led many to believe that the federal government would ultimately create a national benchmark plan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat would have given states a clear, standardized list of benefits that marketplace insurance would have to include. In theory, that benefit list would be continuously updated, to reflect best medical practices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut that never happened. The result is more generous coverage in some states, and much skimpier guarantees in others.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by the gaps,\u201d said Katie Keith, a Georgetown University law professor and health policy expert who was not affiliated with the CAP paper. \u201cThis analysis shows the problem with the benchmark plan approach.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration made an implementation decision to essentially kick the decision making to states,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. \u201cThat certainly led to a lot more variation.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn theory, experts said, the Biden administration has the authority to create a federal benchmark plan. That could give states clearer guidance about what pregnancy-related benefits must be covered and create a more uniform system across the board. But the administration so far has not indicated any plans to do so.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe implications are significant, Allsbrook argued. The United States ranks worse than any other wealthy nation for pregnancy-related health outcomes, and deaths are particularly high for Black people and Native Americans. That makes the widespread exclusion of doulas particularly troubling, she said \u2014 research is limited but scholarship from the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund suggests that Black parents in particular have better birth outcomes when supported by a doula.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrently, individual marketplace enrollees make up a fraction of the American health care system \u2014 in 2019, only 7.7 million women bought private individual coverage, either through the ACA exchange or independently.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut that is likely to change, Keith and Corlette both said, giving the issue of marketplace regulations far more salience. The Biden administration has put the individual market at the center of its health insurance plan, making more Americans eligible for more generous subsidies to help buy individual coverage. Those expanded subsidies were introduced in the recently passed American Rescue Plan, and Biden is calling on Congress to make them permanent as part of his newly unveiled plan to support families.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat will likely help millions more people buy these plans. Already figuring out what specific benefits an individual insurance option covers \u2014 and if they will in turn match what someone might need during pregnancy \u2014 is no small feat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cYou need to go dig through the documents. If you want a home birth or birthing center, you dig through the documents even more because a lot of these plans don\u2019t cover these services,\u201d Allsbrook said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult.\u201d\n"

The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that the number of immigrants denied asylum grew from 9,716 in 2014 to 46,735 in 2019.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""There's a huge backlog,\"" said Perez-Davis about asylum cases. \""What we hope, of course, is that the people with meritorious claims of domestic violence...will be granted asylum.\""\n\n\n\nAs Vice President Kamala Harris heads to the U.S.-Mexico border Friday, we take a look at how Garland's ruling affects this subset of asylum seekers.\n\n\n\nHow exactly did Garland's ruling improve the chances of asylum for domestic violence survivors?\n\n\n\nAsylum seekers must prove that they fear persecution, and United States law asks that they list the reason for persecution, based on five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Trump-era Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned a 2014 decision in a case called Matter of A-R-C-G-, which had classified \""married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship\"" as a particular social group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nSessions' decision in the 2018 Matter of A-B- case stated that the decision in&nbsp; the Matter of A-R-C-G- \u201cis overruled.\"" In other words, Sessions found that the domestic violence survivor in the 2014 case feared harm because of a personal relationship, not because of membership in a particular social group, and that she had to prove that the home country's government condoned the abuse.\n\n\n\nMore recently, Garland vacated Sessions' decision and restored the social group classification. Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta explained the decision in a memo issued on June 16, essentially making it possible once more for domestic violence survivors to check the box for \u201cparticular social group.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow does the government define a 'particular social group'?\n\n\n\n\""A particular social group is defined by an immutable characteristic, which is a characteristic that the [asylum seeker] either can't change or is so fundamental to their identity that they shouldn't be required to change it,\"" said Anne Dutton, a staff attorney at Center for Gender and Refugee Studies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDutton gave examples of family relationships or sexual orientation as immutable characteristics. She also said that \""married Guatemalan women who are in relationships they're unable to leave\"" is also an immutable characteristic.\n\n\n\n\""The 'unable to leave' part is really what makes it immutable,\"" said Dutton. \""Because when you're in an abusive relationship, the decision to end that relationship doesn't really rest with the survivor. It's often at the abuser's control.\""\n\n\n\nDutton explained that asylum seekers claiming to be part of a social group must also prove that their social group is \""distinct and particular.\""&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cSocial distinction requirement asks the applicant to establish that their proposed group is perceived as a group in their society,\u201d said Dutton.\n\n\n\nPeople can show their group is distinct by demonstrating that a government recognizes the group. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, Dutton said that lawyers looked at State Department reports that discussed how women in Guatemala were often caught in relationships because of an abusive dynamic, proving that the U.S. government understood the reality of these women.\n\n\n\nThe particularity requirement, Dutton said, \u201creally requires that the group be defined with concrete terms.\u201d The goal for that requirement, Dutton said, was that with the idea that \u201cyou can tell who's in the group.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDutton said Matter of A-R-C-G- showed how \""married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship\"" fulfilled the particularity requirement by showing that Guatemalan police could identify who was in the group, and sometimes didn't intervene when called because they knew and accepted that these women were abused by their husbands.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nIrena Sullivan, the senior immigration policy counsel at Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit organization for asylum seekers fleeing violence, explained that lawyers and asylum seekers could use a category other than \""particular social group.\u201d She heard a story of a woman, for instance, who could claim religious persecution because her husband harmed her for attending church and asserted religious views different from his.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, Sullivan said, using a category other than \""particular social group\"" excludes many people who cannot prove a reason separate from their prescribed gender role within the relationship, household, and society at large. She also emphasized that the decision to reinstate married Guatemalan women who are in relationships they're unable to leave as a particular social group recognizes the unique systemic problem of domestic and gender-based violence as its own reason for asylum.\n\n\n\nWhy isn't gender a protected ground for asylum seekers? Can this change?\n\n\n\nAsylum laws in the United States are based on the International Refugee Convention, written in 1951, which does not have a gender category, Sullivan said. She explained that in the early 2000s, the United Nations came out with guidance stating that the 1951 convention should include gender within \""social group\"" instead of adding a sixth category.\n\n\n\n\""Without it, we're stuck with decision-makers who still find a way to reject gender-based claims,\"" said Sullivan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Tahirih Justice Center and other advocates have been saying that gender should be a protected ground for asylum because of the prevalence of gender-based violence. An August 2020 report from the California Law Review noted that 2,264 Guatemalan women suffered violent deaths between 2014 and 2016 and that Guatemala's Public Prosecutor's Office found that 76 of such cases reported to police in 2013 \""were perpetrated by a current or former partner.\"" The report had similar findings in El Salvador and Honduras. Sullivan explained that while more current data isn't widely available, in her experience, the numbers don't seem to have dropped.\n\n\n\n\""Let's say you don't know the language, you're experiencing acute trauma, you arrive at the border,\"" said Sullivan. \""And a border patrol officer with a gun and a uniform is standing there saying, 'Why are you here?' and you say, 'I want to seek asylum,' and he hands you a list of reasons, and there's no gender on there, and there's a social group. The likelihood that you're going to look at that and say, 'that's me' is very, very low.\""\n\n\n\nSullivan explained that, in a state of desperation, some people check off another protected ground like race or religion, complicating the adjudication process. She said that a judge might ask, \""Is she not credible? Is she just trying to say anything to get in the door? It sort of triggers a series of skepticisms.\""\n\n\n\nThe relative ambiguity around domestic violence as a reason for asylum means applicants are sometimes denied asylum because abuse is often regarded as a personal matter, like in Sessions' 2018 ruling, and not a broader societal issue. Many domestic violence survivors seeking asylum have no power against their abuser \u2014 no governmental or institutional protection \u2014 because the wider culture, including governmental actors and police officers, reinforces these household dynamics, Sullivan said. The household, she said, is just a part of a national problem, and domestic violence is often gender-based violence.\n\n\n\nKathleen Kuehnast, director of Gender Policy and Strategy at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said that while many people experiencing domestic violence are women, men and boys also experience sexual violence, often used to humiliate. She also emphasized the need to recognize LGBTQIA+ people in discussions of gender-based and domestic violence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""It's time we stood up and said, 'Why are we continuing to exclude gender?'\"" said Sullivan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDoes the United States provide legal counsel for asylum seekers? What is the asylum process?\n\n\n\nPerez-Davis, from the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, explained that an asylum officer who works for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) \""is supposed\"" to ask every person at the border if they are seeking asylum. But this doesn't always happen, and asylum seekers are often put in immigration detention. If they declare their need for asylum, they are given what\u2019s known as a credible fear interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""It's a very traumatic experience because it happens to people within hours or days after having done the trek into the United States,\"" said Perez-Davis. \""That happens to people who are maybe for the first time telling their story, and they're telling this story over the phone.\""\n\n\n\nPerez-Davis explained that some credible fear interviews were face-to-face before the pandemic, but not many, and an asylum officer conducts the interviews. People who pass the interview wait, usually in immigration detention, for a judge to review their I-589 application, which is a form in English that asylum seekers have to fill out in English. She noted that this is the asylum process for people who have been apprehended at the border\u2014someone already in the United States who may, for example, have a lapsed visa, would use another process.\n\n\n\nMany asylum seekers cannot afford lawyers, Dutton said, and are often in immigration detention centers away from resources. She explained that the immigration court is not required to provide asylum seekers with legal counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""In criminal law, there are public defenders, and so if you can't afford an attorney, there will be an attorney appointed to represent you to help safeguard your rights as you go through criminal proceeding,\"" said Dutton. \""In immigration law and immigration courts, it's a civil proceeding, and there is no right to have a council appointed for you.\""\n\n\n\nWill this change last?\n\n\n\nImmigration law is in the executive branch and, as a result, decisions can be overturned by the Attorney General fairly quickly.\n\n\n\n\""I have concluded that the issues should instead be left to the forthcoming rulemaking, where they can be resolved with the benefit of a full record and public comment,\"" Garland stated in his decision.\n\n\n\nWhile rulemaking is more difficult to overturn, said Dutton, it's also \u201ca pretty lengthy process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\""Usually they issue a proposed rule, and then invite public comment to get feedback on whether the rule is good or bad or what will work or won't work, and then they'll subsequently issue a final rule,\"" said Dutton.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lengthy process is worth it, Perez-Davis said, telling a story about one of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project members who entered the United States seeking asylum in 2014, under the Obama administration. After President Donald Trump came into office in January 2017, the United States denied her case. She appealed, the judge decided he wasn't going to hear her case, so she re-appealed. It's 2021, and she is still in limbo.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""She's in a totally different ballpark, a better ballpark,\"" said Perez-Davis about the Garland ruling. \""but it just goes to show you the lens which people have are at the whims of the political tug.\""\n"
Britney Spears lost her reproductive freedom. She is not alone.,-3.33,48.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/britney-spears-reproductive-rights/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-24,19thnews.org,"\nWhen Britney Spears revealed on Wednesday that being under conservatorship had denied her the right to have her IUD removed and have another child, her words set off shockwaves of horrified disbelief.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cI deserve to have the same rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things, and more so,\u201d Spears said in Wednesday\u2019s testimony to the judge.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut reproductive coercion is hardly unique to Spears: It\u2019s a systemic component of an American system, both legal and cultural, that disproportionately impacts women and marginalized communities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd while it has a long and tragic history in this country, the practice remains as pressing of an issue in the present, a chilling reminder of the ways reproductive autonomy is seized as collateral to limit the rights of some.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is shocking to a lot of people. It probably shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d said Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University. \u201cForcible sterilization, whether temporary through the use of long-acting contraception, or permanent through tubal ligation or salpingectomy, is actually quite common in the United States, certainly for those in the disability community.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs recently as September 2020, a whistleblower alerted officials that undocumented immigrants being held at the for-profit Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia were being forcibly sterilized. There, forced hysterectomies were allegedly not only performed without informed consent, but often without even the attempt at consent given the language barrier that existed between those being detained and those responsible for their care.\n\n\n\nBut the practice extends well beyond immigrant detention centers. In the United States, there is no federal oversight or regulation of reproductive health care within the prison and jail system, including for prenatal and postpartum care. Not only are incarcerated pregnant people separated from their newborns anywhere between 24 and 48 hours after giving birth, but in 23 states, there are no laws barring the shackling of inmates during childbirth. Until 2016, no one had even begun collecting data on how many pregnant people are incarcerated in the U.S., let alone their birth outcomes, including pregnancy-related and infant death.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe reproductive justice movement arose out of the history of reproductive coercion facing Black families and communities of color since the very founding of the United States. Enslaved people were forced to carry unwanted pregnancies. Modern gynecology as we know it was born from medical experiments performed on enslaved people with neither anesthesia nor consent. The federal court opinion in the 1974 case of Madrigal v. Quilligan called out the way that Mexican-American women were being coerced into unwanted sterilizations at Los Angeles County USC Medical Center. Though the ruling was never made public, it resulted in medical consent forms being made available in multiple languages for hospital patients, and in patients under the age of 21 being granted 72 hours to make decisions regarding sterilization procedures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nPower imbalances \u2014&nbsp;often rooted in race \u2014&nbsp;continue to play a role in determining who is granted reproductive rights, and to what extent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe same holds true when it comes to people living with disabilities, including those related to mental health. In the 1927 ruling Buck v. Bell, the Supreme Court decided it was constitutional for the state of Virginia to forcibly sterilize a \u201cfeeble minded woman\u201d for the betterment of the \u201cwelfare of society.\u201d This standard stood until 1945\u2019s ruling in Skinner v. Oklahoma, where the court determined that any policy of forced sterilization should be subject to the strictest possible scrutiny. Jasmine E. Harris, a law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, called the Buck v. Bell case one of power and control, not dissimilar to what is currently playing out with Spears. \u201cWhat Britney\u2019s testimony should make us all do is to stop and say, if you apply an intersectional lens to this ... stripping someone of legal capacity is in the state subordination playbook. We\u2019ve seen this happen with other marginalized communities, but in particular women.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe attention surrounding Spears\u2019 conservatorship case is no doubt influenced by her fame (and wealth, and race). But the public reaction to her reproductive choices being controlled by others speaks to how little is understood about a still relatively common practice. Leah Goodridge, a social justice lawyer who has worked with low-income women, noted the ways in which Spears\u2019 case stands out because of her race.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cBritney Spears is a famous woman who is White, with money, and a certain level of privilege that comes along with that, and she is still entangled and the victim of misogyny,\u201d Goodridge said. \u201cSo the takeaway also is, \u2018Can you imagine for Black and brown women, for women of color who are also facing similar dynamics, but don't have the same privilege?\u2019\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKimberly Mutcherson, co-dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School, said reproductive coercion has been and will continue to be highly gendered in our country \u201cin part because women have the capacity for pregnancy \u2014 but also because it is a place where law can continue to regulate the kinds of choices that women get to make about how we get to live our lives.\""\n\n\n\nSpears\u2019 family is famously from Louisiana, where right now 94% of counties are without an abortion provider, with 72% of the state\u2019s women living in those counties. The state has some of the country\u2019s strictest and most aggressive abortion regulations: Should Roe v. Wade be overturned at any point, abortion would immediately become illegal there. Louisiana still requires that those seeking abortion care receive medically inaccurate but state-mandated counseling 24 hours before any abortion procedure, necessitating two separate in-person trips to the clinic. (Telehealth for abortion care is also banned there).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Spears is unable to have her unwanted IUD removed, many women in Louisiana struggle to get access to desired contraception, especially long-acting reversible forms like IUDs. According to Power to Decide, the national campaign to prevent unplanned pregnancy, 312,390 Louisiana women in need of birth control live in contraceptive deserts, meaning they lack access to a county health center providing the full range of contraceptive choices. An additional 8,590 women live in counties without a single health center that provides the full range of options.\n\n\n\nThe self-described trauma faced by Spears is one faced by countless people in the United States, past and present, who find themselves up against a system where their reproductive choices are determined for them by others based on where they live, their mental health history, immigration status and race. Spears\u2019 story feels so jarring because it shines a light on an American problem not rare, but ubiquitous.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can really draw this sort of painful timeline in this country about how reproduction has been manipulated for populations of people who were thought unworthy of parenting or unworthy of procreation,\u201d Mutcherson said. \u201cAnd so in that sense, what\u2019s going on with Britney Spears, frankly, isn't that shocking. Because it is something that law in the United States, in various ways, has allowed for centuries.\u201d\n"
For the People Act blocked by Senate Republicans,-7.0,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/voting-rights-for-the-people-act-vote-senate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-22,19thnews.org,"\nA sweeping bill to curtail the influence of money in politics and protect access to the ballot box failed to clear a procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, complicating Democratic efforts to counter a slew of restrictive voting bills being advanced by Republican-controlled state legislatures.\n\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who recently added voting rights to her portfolio, presided over the 50-50 party-line vote in the evenly divided Senate. Harris could not act as a tiebreaker because it was a procedural vote, known as the legislative filibuster, which requires 60 senators to support opening debate on a bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHarris will, in the coming days and weeks, continue to meet with voting rights advocates across the country to make the case that easing, and not restricting, access to the ballot box is essential to protecting democracy, according to a White House official.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe vice president has previously traveled to Greenville, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia, to meet with voting-rights advocates. She will continue to meet with leaders in states where legislatures are considering or have passed bills to restrict voting access, the White House said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is clear, certainly, for the American people, that when we\u2019re talking about the right to vote it is not a Republican concern or a Democratic concern, it is an American concern, this is about the American people\u2019s right to vote, unfettered,\u201d Harris told reporters after the vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fight is not over,\u201d she added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chair of the Rules Committee that oversees the administration of federal elections, said before the vote that her panel would hold a series of field hearings on voting rights. That will include an examination of Georgia\u2019s law enacted this year that imposes new identification requirements for absentee voters and limits the use of drop boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cTo my Republican colleagues: this is not the end of the line for this bill, this is only the beginning. Because if you had it your way, voters would not just be stuck at the end of the line but they wouldn\u2019t be able to vote at all,\u201d Klobuchar said in a speech on the Senate floor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGeorgia is one of at least 14 states that have enacted laws this year to restrict voting as of mid May, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive policy group that tracks voting access. There were nearly 400 bills introduced in 48 states with restrictive provisions during the same period.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday characterized it as a \u201cwave of anti-voter laws based on the same repeatedly disproven lies that led to an assault on our nation\u2019s Capitol.\u201d\n\n\n\nPsaki was referring to the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol in January as lawmakers met to certify President Joe Biden\u2019s valid victory in the November 2020 election. Democrats, and some Republicans, have said former President Donald Trump encouraged the insurrection by repeatedly and erroneously saying voter fraud cost him the election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are putting these laws in place because they did not like the outcome and they\u2019ve continued to perpetuate a lie about the outcome of the election,\u201d Psaki told reporters, saying Biden would work with Harris to identify state legislators who want to expand voting access.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans have argued that the For the People Act is not necessary and an unacceptable federal intrusion into states\u2019 election administration. Supporting it would also likely draw criticism from Trump, who to a large extent remains the figurehead of the Republican Party even after his defeat. A top aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the For the People Act \u201cthe worst piece of legislation I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives approved its version of the measure, known as HR 1, in March. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republican opposition to the bill showed \u201cthey know that the only way for them to win elections is to suppress the vote.\u201d\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans\u2019 universal opposition to advancing the For the People Act meant \u201cvoter suppression has become part of the official platform of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the fight for voting rights, this vote was the starting gun, not the finish line,\u201d Schumer said, adding: \u201cWe are going to explore every last one of our options.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Democrats have limited options in the Senate, where their chances of passing a voting bill are tied to efforts to change or get rid of the legislative filibuster, which requires support from 60 senators to advance nearly all legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA handful of Democrats, with Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona being the most vocal among them, have said they are either reluctant or opposed to changing the Senate filibuster rule. Others have argued that protecting voting is so integral to preserving our democracy that it trumps the importance of Senate rules.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSinema reiterated her position in a Washington Post op-ed on Monday night, noting that even though she co-sponsored the voting bill, she believes the filibuster \u201ccompels moderation and helps protect the country from wild swings between opposing policy poles.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWould it be good for our country if we did [eliminate the filibuster], only to see that legislation rescinded a few years from now and replaced by a nationwide voter-ID law or restrictions on voting by mail in federal elections, over the objections of the minority?\u201d Sinema wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 140 LGBTQ+ community leaders and activists in Arizona released an open letter on Monday calling on Sinema, who as the first out bisexual person elected to Congress received support from LGBTQ+ rights groups, to end the filibuster. On Tuesday, at least 10 people were arrested during a demonstration at Sinema\u2019s state office organized by the Arizona Coalition to End the Filibuster.\n\n\n\nErrin Haines contributed to this report.&nbsp;\n"
Explainer: Title IX change for transgender students after Bostock,-7.0,46.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/the-19th-explains-what-did-title-ix-changes-just-do-for-trans-students/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,19thnews.org,"\nLast week, the Department of Education issued a new interpretation of Title IX, extending protections to transgender students and rejecting the direction that had been taken by the Trump administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Department makes clear that all students \u2014 including LGBTQ+ students \u2014 deserve the opportunity to learn and thrive in schools that are free from discrimination,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe federal-level interpretation comes as statehouses have passed legislation discriminatory and sometimes harmful toward transgender youths, but its effects might not be immediately noticeable.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the new guidance means for transgender students and school administrators.\n\n\n\nWhat is Title IX? And what does it mean to \u201cinterpret\u201d a statute?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments, enacted in 1972 and signed into law by former President Richard Nixon, prohibits discrimination on the \u201cbasis of sex in any education program or activity offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nErin Buzuvis, associate dean for academic affairs and professor of law at Western New England University, said that Title IX is a statute, enforced by regulations. And then one level below that, there are interpretations.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn terms of interpreting Title IX, that is the purview of the administration in power,\u201d Buzuvis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of saying, \u2018This is how we\u2019re exercising the statute.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s recent interpretation stems from Bostock v. Clayton County, a case the U.S. Supreme Court decided last year. The ruling upheld the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and protected employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has upheld the right for LGBTQ+ people to live and work without fear of harassment, exclusion and discrimination \u2014 and our LGBTQ+ students have the same rights and deserve the same protections,\u201d Cardona said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut interpretations can be reversed from one administration to the next, leaving protections shaky. A change to a statute\u2019s regulations, Buzuvis said, would have a more lasting effect \u2014&nbsp;but also take a longer period of time to establish. The Trump administration\u2019s regulations related to sexual assault, passed in 2018 and enacted in 2020, were the first Title IX guidance to go through a formal notice-and-comment process since 1997.\n\n\n\nWhat does the Department of Education\u2019s recent clarification mean for transgender students?\n\n\n\nRodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said that it was already illegal to discriminate against transgender people, but that the particulars of who was protected under Title IX were heavily contested.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThis announcement now means that transgender youth know definitively that it is illegal for schools to discriminate against them,\u201d Heng-Lehtinen said. \u201cIt is a very big deal and puts a harder point on it. It means that they know the federal government has their backs.\u201d\n\n\n\nLGBTQ+ students often face disproportionate bullying, harassment and victimization \u2014 which has been exacerbated during COVID-19. While learning remotely, students haven\u2019t had access to school-based mental health services and other supports. Over the past year, 42 percent of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide and 94 percent said politics has also impacted their mental well-being, according to &nbsp;the Trevor Project, an organization dedicated to suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a transgender student in school right now and a teacher is harassing you because you\u2019re trans or the school is shutting you out of certain programs, now you\u2019ll be able to file a complaint against that and be in a much stronger position to win against the school,\u201d Heng-Lehtinen said.\n\n\n\nWith the protections no longer ambiguous, Heng-Lehtinen said, schools that do not reinforce protections for transgender students face a greater chance of losing federal funding. Heng-Lehtinen said he anticipates many schools will update their policies in response to the new interpretation.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more to do to make sure schools are really safe,\u201d Heng-Lehtinen said, \u201cbut this is a big step forward.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow does the guidance compare to that of the Trump administration?\n\n\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Education Department had issued guidance saying that the Supreme Court ruling did not offer protections to transgender students. Title IX, the administration argued, did not apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration threatened last year to withold federal aid from schools that allowed transgender athletes to participate in sports. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in April, and under Biden, the Department of Justice revoked support for a lawsuit challenging the rights of two Black trans track runners in Connecticut to compete.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDavid Hinojosa, director of the educational opportunities project at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that protections for transgender students had been in limbo for the past four years and that the new guidance would instruct school districts on what to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving worked for school districts, albeit briefly, I know that school districts pay attention to guidance from the Education Department,\u201d Hinojosa said. \u201cIt could have far-reaching implications as school districts revisit, revise policies or face potential complaints.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow will this federal stance impact states pushing anti-LGBTQ+ bills?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbout a dozen states this year introduced bills that would limit trans health care for kids, and at least 19 states are also considering bills that would limit trans youth participation in sports.\n\n\n\nThe clarification doesn\u2019t have an immediate legal impact on undoing any of those state laws. What it does, though, is signal to the states that there will be consequences if they try to test the protections of Title IX, Buzuvis said.\n\n\n\nMost school districts and colleges and universities receive some kind of federal money. The new clarification puts many of them at risk of having to decide whether to receive federal funding or break state law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Education Department \u201chas never revoked funding under Title IX,\u201d Buzuvis said. \u201cInfractions are usually one-on-one with institutions, not entire states. And institutions typically adjust their policies moving forward to avoid that kind of sanction.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf the federal government does revoke funding to an entire state, that would be unprecedented, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cHonestly, what\u2019s going to rock my world is when an actual enforcement matter comes up,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nIs this a partisan debate?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt appears so. The majority of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was introduced in majority-Republican statehouses, including in Montana, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Missouri and Tennessee. Meanwhile, mostly Democratic lawmakers in more than 10 states have filed at least 20 bills that would add protections for LGBTQ+ people.\n\n\n\nPolitics, more than legal implications, appears to be driving these bills, Hinojosa said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThese legislators don\u2019t care,\u201d Hinojosa said. \u201cThey just want to rally their political bases. They\u2019re not writing the checks that have to defend against the civil rights violations. The taxpayers do.\u201d\n\n\n\nTransgender rights, specifically those relating to transgender girls\u2019 participation in school sports, have largely become a litmus test for Republicans running for office. Many conservatives have voiced concerns that trans women will have an unfair advantage against cisgender women.\n\n\n\nIdaho was the first state to pass legislation barring transgender women from joining women\u2019s sports teams (though its enforcement was halted by a federal judge). Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee followed suit.\n\n\n\nAnd according to a recent poll conducted by Politico and Morning Consult, about 74 percent of Republicans and 40 percent of Democrats support this type of ban.\n\n\n\nSome states receive a significant amount of federal funding, up to hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases, Hinojosa said. Even the loss of that funding might not be enough to incentivize a change in state laws.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much these states are willing to dig their heels in,\u201d Hinojosa said. \u201cThey seem to have a no-holds-barred approach to these issues, so there\u2019s no real way of telling.\u201d\n"
Fate of infrastructure deal hinges on approving Biden’s plan for working women,-4.33,46.0,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/american-families-plan-infrastructure-negotiations/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-24,19thnews.org,"\nAs a bipartisan group of senators returned to the White House on Thursday to finalize an infrastructure deal, its path forward in Congress increasingly hinges on internal Democratic negotiations over a separate, sweeping proposal designed to support working women as they emerge from the first recession that has disproportionately impacted them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in his first address to a joint session of Congress in April, outlined what he hoped would be a historic $1.8 trillion investment in policies such as paid family and medical leave, universal pre-kindergarten and two free years of community college.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt was unclear at the time whether Biden\u2019s American Families Plan would move forward on its own, given near-total Republican opposition, or whether it would be paired with Biden\u2019s infrastructure-focused $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan.\n\n\n\nDemocrats subsequently decided to pursue a narrower, bipartisan infrastructure package on its own, then turn to a process known as reconciliation, which allows them to avoid overcoming a typically required 60-vote threshold in the evenly divided 100-seat Senate, to pass a version of Biden\u2019s families proposal with only Democratic votes.\n\n\n\nWhen the bipartisan group of senators engaged in infrastructure negotiations returned to the White House on Thursday, they announced they had agreed to invest $1.2 trillion over eight years, including more than $500 billion in new spending. Biden said \""none of us got what we all would\u2019ve wanted\"" and there were \""serious compromises on both ends.\""  Democrats will negotiate child care and other \""human infrastructure\"" using reconciliation as the two proposals move on a \""dual track,\"" Biden said.\n\n\n\nBut Democratic lawmakers have said that before they can approve the infrastructure deal, they need to see the parameters of the second spending package that will fund paid leave, education and other party priorities. Some would also like assurances from moderate colleagues such as Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona that they will not derail the second spending package.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t be done without the other,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters as he left a meeting with top White House aides on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had met with Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Shalanda Young, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice to discuss both the bipartisan infrastructure negotiations and the American Families Plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey underscored the importance of extending the child tax credit, and investing in the care economy, including expanding child care, to help ensure that women can return to the workforce,\u201d the White House said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth the House and Senate are aiming to vote on both bills sometime in July before Congress begins its August recess. Pelosi said when leaving the meeting that the House would vote on the bipartisan infrastructure package \u201cas soon as we see a reconciliation bill.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Thursday Pelosi was more blunt, saying the House would not vote on the bipartisan infrastructure package until the Senate has passed both the infrastructure and reconciliation bills.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t going to be no bipartisan bill unless we have the reconciliation bill,\u201d she told reporters in her weekly briefing.\n\n\n\nBiden said shortly after that he agreed with Pelosi's approach. \""I\u2019m not just signing the bipartisan bill,\"" he told reporters.\n\n\n\nSome senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have likewise indicated they would prefer to vote on, not just see, a reconciliation bill before voting on the infrastructure measure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe vehicle to set the parameters for what will make it into the American Families Plan will be budget resolutions passed by the House and Senate. The negotiations begin in the budget committees, and a draft proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Massachusetts, who chairs the Senate panel, is already circulating in Washington.\n\n\n\nBudget resolutions are non-binding blueprints that help guide congressional committees in areas like education and energy as they help assemble broad spending bills that are eventually passed and signed into law.\n\n\n\nSanders has proposed spending nearly $6 trillion over a decade \u2014 about $1.6 trillion more than Biden\u2019s proposals \u2014 on investments that include $200 billion in universal pre-kindergarten, $300 billion on child care, $225 billion on paid leave and $390 billion on education programs, including free community college, according to a draft reviewed by The 19th.\n\n\n\nManchin, one of the Democrats on the bipartisan infrastructure negotiation team, said this week that he supports using reconciliation to make such investments in \u201chuman infrastructure.\u201d But he also said recently that two free years of community college may not help students graduate, illustrating the extent to which Democrats will likely need to negotiate over Biden\u2019s families plan before agreeing to its passage.\n"
White House to review interagency protections for transgender Americans,-11.0,47.67,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/white-house-biden-transgender-policies/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-30,19thnews.org,"\nThe White House on Wednesday said it would gather federal agencies in the coming weeks, including the Justice Department, Defense Department and Department of Health and Human Services, to revise policies driving poverty, violence, and discrimination against transgender people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe announcement comes after the Biden administration had already pledged to reverse Trump-era policies that disproportionately impacted transgender Americans and restricted LGBTQ+ access to health care, housing, and equal treatment in prisons.\n\n\n\nThe administration\u2019s latest policy change affecting trans people came from the State Department, which said it would allow nonbinary and intersex people to obtain IDs and passports with an \u201cX\u201d gender marker instead of an \u201cM\u201d or an \u201cF.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMembers of the White House initiative announced Wednesday, headed by the Gender Policy Council and Domestic Policy Council, plan to meet with trans advocates in the next few weeks to hear their policy recommendations. Meeting with advocates will be the group\u2019s first step to address issues including employment discrimination, homelessness, abuse, and school bullying, White House spokesperson Matt Hill said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House has focused on trans rights at several events commemorating Pride month, culminating with a virtual \u201ctransgender equality\u201d event on Wednesday that included U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, HHS Secretary Rachel Levine and Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke as speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo far this year, hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in state legislatures,\u201d Biden said at his Pride speech last week in the East Room.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThese are some of the ugliest, most un-American laws I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve been here awhile.&nbsp; Many of them target transgender children, seeking to prevent them from receiving the appropriate medical care, for using the bathroom at high schools while they\u2019re \u2014 the one where they\u2019ll be most safe, even preventing them from joining sports teams with their classmates,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAshton Mota, the 16-year-old Human Rights Campaign ambassador who introduced Biden at his Pride speech last week, thanked the administration on Wednesday at the virtual transgender equality event. \""After coming out and receiving support from my family, that\u2019s one of the best things I could have asked for \u2014&nbsp;because it\u2019s given me a platform and a pedestal to be able to use my voice and represent a community that usually isn\u2019t given a seat at the table to have these important conversations,\u201d he said.\n"
Kagan warns Supreme Court has weakened voting protections at ‘perilous moment’,-12.0,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2021/07/kagan-dissent-brnovich-dnc-supreme-court-voting-rights/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,19thnews.org,"\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Thursday to make it easier for states to enact voting restrictions comes at a \u201cperilous moment\u201d when many Republican-led states are pursuing new laws that will \u201cpredictably deprive members of minority groups equal access to the ballot box,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan writes in a scathing dissent.\n\n\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling by the court in a case called Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the court\u2019s conservatives, led by Justice Samuel Alito, sided with Arizona that two of its laws related to the casting and collection of ballots did not violate a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, a 1965 law prohibiting racial discrimination in voting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe dissent offered by Kagan, who was joined by fellow liberal Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, reads as a civics lesson about the myriad of ways that White men, from before the Civil War until the present, have had advantages at the ballot box \u2014 and the \u201cpredictable consequences\u201d that will befall Black, Latinx and indigenous voters after their colleagues\u2019 \u201ctragic\u201d decision to further weaken the law meant to protect them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cIf a single statute represents the best of America, it is the Voting Rights Act. It marries two great ideals: democracy and racial equality,\u201d Kagan writes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf a single statute reminds us of the worst of America, it is the Voting Rights Act. Because it was \u2014 and remains \u2014 so necessary,\u201d she adds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nLeah Litman, a constitutional law professor at the University of Michigan, agreed with the dissenting justices that Thursday\u2019s ruling \u201call but eviscerated the remaining protections\u201d of the Voting Rights Act. It provides conservative courts with a \u201cset of weapons\u201d to \u201cwipe out\u201d future claims that voting laws have discriminatory impacts, she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Brnovich v. DNC case concerns two Arizona election laws: one that invalidates ballots cast by voters in incorrect precincts even if they are eligible to vote generally; and another that all but ended the practice of third parties collecting and dropping off batches of ballots during early voting. The DNC sued in 2016, saying both laws have a disproportionate impact on the state\u2019s racial minority voters that violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. A trial judge sided with Arizona, the DNC appealed, and the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, prompting Arizona to appeal to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStates have passed a slew of voting laws in recent years that, until the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, would have required \u201cpreclearance\u201d by the Justice Department if they were in a state or locality with a history of racial discrimination.\n\n\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative majority found in the Shelby County case that Congress had not appropriately updated the formula used to determine which areas were subject to preclearance when the Voting Rights Act was last renewed in 2006. The preclearance provision, formally called Section 5, was tossed out. Civil rights attorneys and voting right advocates have since relied on Section 2 to challenge potentially discriminatory voting laws.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Voting Rights Act\u2019s Section 2 prohibits laws and policies that intentionally discriminate on the basis of race, as well as laws that have a disproportionate impact on voters of color, regardless of intent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""Today, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a decision that will undoubtedly restrict the right to vote, and in particular, for voters of color,\"" said Vice President Kamala Harris, who was California's 32nd attorney general. \n\n\n\n\""This is the second time in the last eight years that the Supreme Court has dismantled crucial protections of the Voting Rights Act,\"" added Harris, whose White House portfolio includes voting rights.\n\n\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative justices on Thursday \u201clisted a set of factors\u201d that must be met to prove a Section 2 claim that will make it \u201cexceedingly, if not prohibitively, difficult for plaintiffs to win these challenges,\u201d Litman said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe mere fact there is some disparity in impact does not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote,\u201d Alito writes for the majority.\n\n\n\nKagan counters that the language in the Voting Rights Act is clear: \u201cCourts are to strike down voting rules that contribute to a racial disparity in the opportunity to vote, taking all the relevant circumstances into account.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is these relevant circumstances that Kagan discusses at length in her dissent, which describes how \u201cdrafters of the Voting Rights Act understood that \u2018social and historical conditions,\u2019 including disparities in education, wealth, and employment, often affect opportunities to vote.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor most of the century after the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, the democratic tenets it sets out, including the right to vote, only applied to White men, Kagan writes, saying the \u201cearliest state election laws excluded from the franchise African Americans, Native Americans, women and those without property.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford that citizenship rights did not extend Black Americans was its \u201cmost deplorable,\u201d Kagan writes, adding that many states, particularly in the U.S. South, continued to suppress the Black vote through a \u201cdizzying array of methods: literacy tests, poll taxes, registration requirements and property qualifications.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 1965, the year the Voting Rights Act overcame a Senate filibuster and was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson \u2014 who had asked Congress to write the \u201cgoddamnedest toughest voting rights act that you can devise\u201d \u2014 only 27 percent of eligible Black people in Georgia were registered to vote, only 19 percent in Alabama and just 7 percent in Mississippi.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBetween 1965 and 1970, nearly as many Black people registered to vote in six states in the U.S. South as had registered in the entire 100 years preceding the Voting Rights Act\u2019s passage, Kagan notes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cMuch of the Voting Rights Act\u2019s success lay in its capacity to meet ever-new forms of discrimination \u2026 and for decades, Section 5 operated as intended,\u201d Kagan writes, adding that between 1965 and 2006 the Justice Department blocked 1,200 voting laws it had found would have a discriminatory impact.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut in the years since the Shelby County ruling, states have passed dozens of laws, some of which previously may have been stopped before taking effect, and voters have thereby been disenfranchised, she writes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s erroneous claims that voter fraud cost him the election have further fueled skepticism about our electoral process, and that skepticism has prompted elected officials in mostly Republican-led states to propose a flurry of new restrictions on voting this year that range from stricter identification laws to the removal of names from voter-registration lists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs of June 21, 17 states had enacted 28 new laws that restrict voting access, including two more in Arizona, according to the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n\n\nThe previously passed Arizona laws at issue in Thursday\u2019s ruling both disproportionately affected voting access for voters of color, the dissenting justices said, echoing claims made by the DNC, Arizona\u2019s Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and voting-rights groups. Kagan notes that in 2016, Latinx, Black and Native American voters in Arizona were twice as likely to have their ballots discarded as White voters were.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome Republicans in the U.S. Congress, Arizona\u2019s Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and conservative-leaning advocacy organizations sided with Arizona\u2019s Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Arizona, some voters cast ballots at assigned precincts and others at county-wide voting centers. The state\u2019s law invalidating otherwise valid ballots cast in the wrong precincts resulted in ballots cast by Latinx, Native American and Black voters being tossed out at higher rates. Arizona\u2019s prohibition on ballot collection and submission by most third parties makes it disproportionately more difficult for the state\u2019s Native American voters, who are more likely than White voters to live in remote areas that do not have access to the U.S. mail service.\n\n\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, it is not \u2018very easy\u2019 for Black, Latinx and Native Americans to vote in and beyond Arizona,\u201d said Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project, a liberal nonprofit focused on racial justice issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlito opens the majority opinion by stating that \u201cArizona law generally makes it very easy to vote.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry Arizona since Bill Clinton did in 1996, but he only beat Trump there by about 10,000 votes \u2014 critical to his victory was a coalition of women made up of energized liberals, Latinas, indigenous activists and disaffected suburbanites.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is fewer votes than Arizona discarded under the out-of-precinct policy in two of the prior three presidential elections,\u201d Kagan writes in arguing that Arizona\u2019s laws result in a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d disparity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThe court decides this Voting Rights Act case at a perilous moment for the nation\u2019s commitment to equal citizenship. It decides this case in an era of voting-rights retrenchment \u2014 when too many states and localities are restricting access to voting in ways that will predictably deprive members of minority groups of equal access to the ballot box,\u201d Kagan argues.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the end of the dissent, Kagan notes that Congress, not the courts, should decide if and when Section 2 should be eliminated or otherwise reworked. The Voting Rights Act \u201cconfronted one of this country\u2019s most enduring wrongs\u201d and pledged to \u201cgive every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy \u2026 that law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this court,\u201d she writes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Brnovich decision comes just one week after a sweeping Democratic bill to protect and expand voting access stalled in the evenly split U.S. Senate, where most legislation needs 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles, making a path forward unlear. Democrats are planning to hold a series of field hearings in the coming weeks, beginning in Georgia, which has enacted one of the most stringent new voting laws in the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLitman said the end of Kagan\u2019s dissent is a message that \u201cCongress has to pass a new law, because the court just gutted the one we have.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou need to pass a new law and you need to insulate it from being gutted or invalidated by this court, that is the only option on the table,\u201d Litman said.\n"
Women in the Biden White House earn 99 cents for every $1 earned by men,-11.0,46.67,https://19thnews.org/2021/07/women-in-the-biden-white-house-earn-99-cents-for-every-1-earned-by-men/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,19thnews.org,"\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s White House has the narrowest gender pay gap of any administration since 1995, according to new salary data released Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe data, which the White House has been required to release publicly since 1995, shows that women in the Biden administration earn 99 cents for every $1 earned by men. That is far narrower than the gender wage gap in the country as whole \u2014 in 2021, women are earning 82 cents on the White man\u2019s $1.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn average, women earn $93,752 in Biden\u2019s White House, while men earn $94,639.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the 2020 Trump White House, women earned 69 cents on men\u2019s $1. In Trump\u2019s first year in office, 2016, women earned just 63 cents to men\u2019s $1.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s gap is also narrower than other Democratic presidents. In the Obama White House, women earned between about 84 and 89 cents on the dollar, according to an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe difference in the current administration is the split between men and women in terms of staff. About 60 percent of the staff is women, the White House said in a statement. (It has not responded to questions about whether any of its staff are nonbinary.)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe gender wage gap is typically a \u201craw\u201d figure that doesn\u2019t adjust for experience, education, title or other factors. It simply looks at median wages. In past administrations, a lack of women in higher-paid positions widened the gap.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut in the Biden administration, there is a wider distribution of women across the pay scale, not just in the lowest paid jobs where they have typically been concentrated. About 56 percent of the senior staff in Biden\u2019s White House are women, and about 36 percent come from racially and ethnically diverse communities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, the two highest paid people in the Biden White House are women: Immigration policy adviser Molly Groom earns $185,656, and senior policy adviser for broadband Elizabeth Hone earns $183,164. The two lowest-paid are men, who both earn $36,000.\n\n\n\nBiden has said repeatedly that he is focused on creating a more inclusive administration \u201cthat looks like America.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo that end, the White House staff now includes the first-ever chief diversity and inclusion director, Michael Leach. Last week, the president signed an executive order reestablishing a government-wide diversity and inclusion initiative that requires federal agencies to assess barriers to diversity in their workforces and establishes chief diversity officers across the administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOutside of the White House, the administration has appointed 16 high-level leaders who are the first in their communities to hold those positions, including first woman Vice President Kamala Harris, first woman Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary.\n\n\n\nHowever, the administration hasn\u2019t hit every mark. For the first time in two decades, there are no Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders serving as Cabinet secretaries.\n\n\n\nKelly Dittmar, the director of research and scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics said the figures on gender are a recognition of the commitment the administration made \u2014 and its intent to keep it, knowing the nation would closely be watching. The White House released the gender breakdowns in addition to the required salary data, which doesn\u2019t require gender to be noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have to be able to show this in order to push back against claims that they're not walking the walk after they make the commitment, and that has been a problem of many administrations \u2014 Democrat and Republican \u2014 before them, who have said, \u2018Yes, we support equity. Yes, we support inclusion.\u2019 And then when the numbers come out, you don't actually see it,\u201d Dittmar said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also true that there were likely more high-level Demoratic women for Biden to hire who were more enthusiastic about joining the administration. In the Trump administration, there was no shortage of qualified Republican women, Dittmar said, but there were women who were harsh critics of Trump, like MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, who previously worked in the George W. Bush White House and John McCain campaign.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cThe friendliness of Trump himself and the Trump administration toward women and toward equity issues \u2014 if that was a concern for women seeking a position \u2014 fear of being associated with that, and just worrying themselves about their own positionality,\u201d Dittmar said was likely contributing to some high-level Republican women choosing to stay out of the administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat also means many of the women the Trump White House recruited were younger. While there were some women in high-level positions, like former adviser Kellyanne Conway, aide Hope Hicks and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, more were concentrated in lower paid positions.

Advocates are grateful that efforts by states have gradually picked up steam in recent years, but they also want legislatures to take faster action in light of the ongoing effects of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nThe Louisiana law will eliminate the state sales tax from menstrual products and diapers. It\u2019s a similar story in Vermont, where diapers are already exempt, but now menstrual products will be too.\n\n\n\nJennifer Weiss-Wolf is a co-founder of Period Equity, a nonprofit that advocates for menstrual products to be tax-exempt. She noted in roughly six years of work to remove the tampon tax, at least 12 states have taken formal action (On Thursday, Maine's governor signed a budget into law that will eliminate the state's tampon tax later this year \u2014 others already had tax codes that exempted menstrual products.) Lawmakers in at least 20 states introduced legislation this year. But at least 28 states still have the menstrual-related taxes in the books. \n\n\n\n\""The fact that there are still that many states to go, and that many 'not success' stories for the two successes we saw this session, is obviously a signal that there's so much work to do,\"" she said.\n\n\n\nAndrea Elizondo is one of the co-founders and lead organizers for the Texas Menstrual Equity Coalition, a group that advocated this year for an ultimately unsuccessful bill to eliminate the tampon tax in Texas. She is also the advocacy and outreach operations director for Menstrual Flux, a small nonprofit that sends menstrual kits to anyone in need in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nElizondo said she was disappointed that the bill in Texas effectively died because time ran out this session, but she was proud that it advanced out of a legislative committee \u2014 a level of action that indicates it may move further along in the future. Elizondo thinks the bill competed for attention in a legislative session jam-packed with fights over a range of issues, including the budget and recovery from the pandemic. She also noted that the advocates she works with are not paid, and that they did the best that they could.\n\n\n\n\""Going into the next session, I think we have a better chance,\"" she said. \""... It's just a constant reminder that advocacy is a marathon, and it's a very long-term commitment.\""\n\n\n\nWeiss-Wolf, also vice president at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, said the pandemic is even more reason to remove the tampon tax everywhere; research shows people are struggling to purchase menstrual products. Elizondo agreed, noting that the effects of poverty on accessing menstrual products existed way before the pandemic and have only accelerated. She remembers growing up in a single-parent household and having to ration menstrual products between what she and her mother could afford and accessing some limited supplies at school. She tried to use products from home only on the weekends and after school.\n\n\n\n\""There's so much to teenage life that's already stressful and uncomfortable as you go through puberty, that being aware that you lack resources is another additional element and stressor in your life,\"" she said.\n\n\n\nWeiss-Wolf said that in some state legislatures there is an argument over reducing tax revenues amid budget constraints. This doesn't fly with her.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""We should never accept that the status quo must fall on the backs of women and people who menstruate to be the bridge there,\"" she said. \""An inequitable and discriminatory tax like the tampon tax can't be the answer to questions or concerns they have about budget shortfalls.\""\n\n\n\nPeriod Equity is part of a lawsuit filed last year that challenged the constitutionality of Michigan's 6 percent sales tax on menstrual products. The lawsuit is pending, but Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in February told Michigan Advance that her latest budget proposal would include ending the state sales tax on menstrual products. She had previously expressed support for eliminating the tax.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we work together to lead a long-lasting economic recovery for our state, this is a fundamental step we can take to create a more equitable economy for all Michiganders,\u201d she told the nonprofit news site.\n\n\n\nWeiss-Wolf said legal action in other states is a possibility in the future. She noted that the Michigan lawsuit has drawn the attention of other lawyers, law students and legal clinics around the country. \""Nothing's off the table. In fact, it's all even more on the table,\"" she said.\n\n\n\nWeiss-Wolf said the tampon tax is \""the tip of the iceberg\"" in a multifaceted strategy aimed at ensuring menstrual access, dignity and equity for all people. That includes making menstrual products more accessible to people in schools and other facilities. \""It's a much broader agenda than just that legislation,\"" she said of the tampon tax. \""So all of it is fuel in the tank for everything still to come.\""\n"
How COVID-19 has endangered gender equity worldwide,-7.0,44.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/05/how-covid-19-has-imperiled-gender-equity-worldwide/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,19thnews.org,"\nFor over a year, the global health community has been sounding the alarm about what the coronavirus crisis could mean for gender equity efforts worldwide. Early research paints a grim picture: increases in unintended pregnancies, higher rates of gender-based violence, more young girls dropping out of school and getting married. But it will take years for the full effects to become clear.\n\n\n\nThe health crisis appears on the wane in the United States, but worldwide, vaccine access is limited and COVID-19 is surging. Cases in India are so high that hospitals are running out of beds and oxygen, and experts say the surge will spread to other countries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s troubling, says Dr. Natalia Kanem, who heads the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Kanem, a medical doctor and epidemiologist by training, focuses on global reproductive health and gender equity. Already, she is worried about how the pandemic has affected women and girls across the globe. Without support from nations like the United States \u2014 which already has purchased more than enough vaccines to immunize the entire country \u2014 the consequences could be severe.\n\n\n\nKanem spoke with The 19th about how the pandemic has affected reproductive health access and the broader implications if the coronavirus surge is not reversed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\nShefali Luthra: When all this began, what kind of impact did you expect? And at what point did you start to worry about the reproductive health ramifications?\n\n\n\nDr. Natalia Kanem: Our whole team looked around and understood that movement restriction seemed to be a first order of response. This can also have a devastating impact on people who are vulnerable, whether it is because a woman is in a remote location, or a girl is not going to school, she is now vulnerable to issues like child marriage and female genital mutilation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur real fear was gender-based violence skyrocketing. We also worried about lack of access to contraception, because women might be behind blockades or just be scared to go to their regular clinic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat has the pandemic meant for access to contraception? And how did it exacerbate some of the barriers that already existed?\n\n\n\nUNFPA has been on the ground throughout the pandemic trying to ensure that sexual and reproductive health was classified as essential, which has not been true in every case.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith contraception, it wasn't as bad as we thought it was going to be. Initially, we thought that with 12 million women losing access to contraception, that we might have as many as 2 million or so unintended pregnancies. We did better.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut then you did the comparison for developing countries versus the rich countries. There was no baby boom in the rich countries because women had access to contraception. In times of uncertainty, people typically will not want to start families. But in the developing world, the access was not there.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt wasn't a huge baby boom, but the rate of teen pregnancy has gone up. Kenya has documented this, and others, subsequently. It's not going to be as bad as we thought originally, but the rate of unintended pregnancy also went up.\n\n\n\nThings like economic shutdowns and school closures \u2014 what role did those play in women\u2019s unemployment, and bigger picture, in affecting gender-based health inequities?\n\n\n\nTypically, in other crises, girls who drop out of school don't go back. Some of the boys do, usually the girls don't. And that has a devastating effect on the future for the economic power of a girl.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe logistics were compounded by \u2014 how can I put this delicately \u2014 in the diplomatic sphere, women's issues were not prioritized. So personal protective equipment for the female workforce was a huge hurdle. Up to today, we have a nurse, we have a cleaner \u2014 of course, men as well as women, but the health workforce we estimate is 70 percent female. They're scared to bring COVID home.\n\n\n\nAnd there is the pervasive nature, even when there is no crisis, of women's bodily autonomy not being respected. If the girl is home from school, that sets up a whole new dynamic where she's not reporting to other adults besides those that surround her in the neighborhoods. She is vulnerable by being available. And the pressures on the household have meant that some people are turning to early marriage as a \u201csolution.\u201d Violence all the way up to femicide has increased.\n\n\n\nOur prediction sadly did come true. For contraception, people rallied. On this other sphere, it's really been a disaster.\n\n\n\nIndependently of early marriage and female genital mutilation, we estimate violence within the home rose by 20 percent during lockdowns. One in three is the estimate over the lifetime of a woman of being victimized by gender-based violence. But now what we see is that during the lockdowns, violence increased by 20 percent, leading to over 1 million additional cases of domestic violence every single week of this pandemic. When you multiply those weeks to make it a year, and now we're in the second year, it is horrendous.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""...during the lockdowns, violence increased by 20 percent, leading to over 1 million additional cases of domestic violence every single week of this pandemic.\""\n\n\n\nWe projected [gender equity] program disruptions. We would have an additional, beyond the baseline, 2 million cases of female genital mutilation and 13 million cases of child marriage over the next decade to be blamed squarely on the health system breakdown, program disruption, school closure. We just did a survey in a refugee camp in Kenya called Dadaab. Dadaab has already documented an increase of 20 percent in female genital mutilation since March last year.\n\n\n\nLonger term, what are these effects and trends going to mean, and how long is it going to take for us to fully understand the impact of what this has meant for women and girls?\n\n\n\nPregnancies don't stop for pandemics. Access to life-saving contraception and reproductive care is a basic right. And sexual and reproductive health is essential health care everywhere, all the time. So the pandemic is kind of being layered onto a situation where the essential needs of women were already not being respected.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf anything, it shows us that the type of inequality that we have in this world is absolutely not sustainable. We really have to uphold the rights of women to determine what happens to their body.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLooking at the longer-term picture, we are scrambling to get data that is disaggregated appropriately. The top-level story doesn't tell us the details of what happened to the rural girl age 12 to 15, who was either in school or out. When we look at the planning that it's going to take to ensure that boys and girls have the right kind of information, to engage in healthy, safe behavior \u2014 this was already on the agenda. But now to me it shows us the urgency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother point was, as we're talking about the new workplace, this is more evidence of why we need to support paternity and parental leave policies so that men, too, can participate in caregiving. It's been a real eye-opener that many men stepped up. Perhaps not enough, but many men. This old mythology that \u201coh, no, you know, the woman must do it all\u201d \u2014 it's been blown apart.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt seems clear other countries will be in a state of health emergency for much longer than the United States. What are the implications for reproductive autonomy and for gender equity? Are there some countries where things might get worse, and others where it gets better?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been painful to see the scramble for equitable vaccine access.\n\n\n\nInequalities can no longer be justified. We are really pleading with the world that has vaccines \u2014 and some in excess \u2014 to join this effort to, in a methodical way, get life-saving vaccines to countries who otherwise will be at the bottom of the barrel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne other quick thing: We've been following the advice for pregnant women. And big studies reported just last week assured us that it is better and protective for pregnant women to be vaccinated. So that's something that I'm glad there's data now to buttress the recommendations.\n\n\n\nThinking about what we're seeing in India \u2014 are you worried about what the coming months or even years could look like not just in South Asia, but worldwide? And what should countries like the United States be doing?\n\n\n\nIt is lamentable, what we're seeing in places like India, Brazil, the USA, parts of Europe. Certainly I think there are many under-the-radar, burgeoning pandemics all over the world.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe succeed when we work in solidarity. There is no way that one can isolate one's country from a pandemic, which is fast-moving, and also developing variants. This fight against COVID is not bound by geography or privilege. A virus anywhere is a virus everywhere.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\""We would have an additional, beyond the baseline, 2 million cases of female genital mutilation and 13 million cases of child marriage over the next decade to be blamed squarely on the health system breakdown, program disruption, school closure.\""\n\n\n\nLeaving behind certain parts of the world is not going to work. And what I've also been at pains to say is that, no matter what the tragedy may be, women and girls bear the brunt. They're the last to be fed, and they're fed the least. They're the first to sacrifice their health care so that everybody else can be taken care of.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nApart from urging the international community to play their part in ensuring that the vaccines are distributed equitably, we also need to look at the fundamental weaknesses of power imbalance. Equal rights may exist on paper, but they're not translated into reality.\n\n\n\nWhat have I not asked you that you think I should?\n\n\n\nWhat we've been talking about is not revolutionary. I mean, we've been talking about the bare minimum.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe don't have to wait 3,000 years for people to stop beating their wives. It should stop now. The same with crimes like sexual assault. People should be identified and perpetrators should be punished. It's not a victim-blaming exercise anymore. I believe that women themselves have taken the mantle and said, \u201cWe refuse to be disempowered. It's actually not about empowerment, we want some real power. And not only in the home, but in every stratum of society.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI think this is a tipping point where we can get serious about some of these issues of real equality for women and girls.\n\n\nBecome a 19th member today.\"",\n        \""_mini_banner_content\"": \""field_5ed9258064966\""\n    },\n    \""align\"": \""\"",\n    \""mode\"": \""edit\""\n} \/-->\n\n\n\n"

‘Booster shots not needed… at this time’: Fauci says Pfizer apologized for blindsiding feds with 3rd Covid jab notice,0.0,44.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/528865-fauci-pfizer-vaccine-booster/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.rt.com,"White House Covid-19 adviser Anthony Fauci said Pfizer gave the feds no warning before announcing that it would seek emergency approval for a third vaccine dose, maintaining that, for now, booster shots are unnecessary.Fauci appeared with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday night to address the Big Pharma firm’s announcement the day prior, noting he was not informed about the statement ahead of time while stressing US health agencies’ current recommendations about a booster dose.“Certainly, Pfizer is doing their own studies… and as they’ve indicated they’re ultimately going to apply to get authorization to give a boost,”he said, adding that those who’ve received two doses of Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines, or one of Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot jab,“do not need to get a boost right now.”Dr. Anthony Fauci says fully vaccinated Americans do not need to get booster shots right now.“The FDA, CDC and NIH are now gathering information through clinical studies and laboratory studies to determine if and when we might need boosters. But that's not right now.”pic.twitter.com/3NM7E2vNKVHowever, the health adviser also noted that studies into additional doses are ongoing within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the National Institutes of Health, suggesting they have not been ruled out for good.“Wolf, we are on the same page,”he said, later adding,“It appears to be a mixed message, but it’s not. The message is very clear: The CDC and FDA say if you’ve been fully vaccinated, at this point in time you do not need a booster shot.”"
"Biden administration reverses Trump policy on pregnant immigrants, with new instructions never referring to them as ‘women’",1.0,42.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/528860-biden-pregnancy-border-migrants-flip/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.rt.com,"US President Joe Biden has changed immigration policy to bar the detention or arrest of “individuals known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing,” according to a recent update from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Announced by Biden on Friday, the decision to reimpose a ban on the detention of pregnant women and girls was initially outlined in a memo signed last week by acting ICE Director Tae Johnson.Boasting of the new policy, Johnson said the border agency is“committed to safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system and preserving the health and safety of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals.”He added that“given the unique needs of this population,”ICE won’t lock up anyone currently or recently pregnant“unless release is prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist,”but did not elaborate on what might warrant such exceptions.The measure does not rule out arresting pregnant, postpartum or nursing women, the ICE memo stresses, but does require that if theyareto be housed in US detention facilities, they must receive mental health services and other appropriate care. The agency is also still permitted to send expecting women to immigration courts.ICE went out of its way to avoid specifying the gender of any hypothetical prisoner in its memo, a deliberate move intended to include transgender males among the group of pregnancy-capable individuals to whom the policy applies,accordingto a senior administration official who spoke to USA Today on Friday.The decision is not so much new as it is a reversal of a 2017 policy enacted by former president Donald Trump, who placed the fight against illegal immigration at the center of his successful 2016 election campaign. Under Trump’s predecessor and Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, ICE had a stated policy of only detaining pregnant immigrants“under extraordinary circumstances.”During Trump’s first two years in the White House, pregnant immigrants were detained 80% more frequently than during the last year of Obama’s presidency, according to a Government Accountability Report released last year.Biden’s version of the policy does expand the period in which illegal migrants can claim exemption from ICE detention, however. While Obama’s policy restricted itself to pregnant women only, Biden’s shield includes those who gave birth up to one year ago, as well as nursing women."
Texas man who famously waited hours to vote in Democratic primary faces up to 40yrs in prison for illegal voting,-1.0,42.0,https://www.rt.com/usa/528946-famous-texas-voter-arrested/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-11,www.rt.com,"A man hailed by mainstream media outlets for standing in line for six hours to cast his ballot in last year’s Democratic primary has been arrested for voting illegally. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted.Hervis Rogers, 62, was a felon on parole at the time he voted in the November 2018 general election and the March 2020 Democratic primary, according to a two-count indictment by Texas prosecutors. His arrest set off a storm of criticism from the ACLU, anti-incarceration activists, and left-wing pundits, who claimed that it was unjust and racist, since Rogers is black.Having a Democratic voter who went viral for his determination turn out to be a felon voting illegally is rather controversial for a party that has fought against claims of illegalities surrounding the 2020 vote. Some have argued that the prosecution of Rogers is another attempt by Republicans to disenfranchise non-white voters.“This is a voter-suppression prosecution, pure and simple, a poster child for Jim Crow 2.0,”the Texas AFL-CIO union group said.“Unfortunately, it confirms that Texas’ shameful legacy of disenfranchisement is alive and well and desperately needs fixing.”""This is a voter suppression prosecution, pure and simple, a poster child for Jim Crow 2.0. Unfortunately, it confirms that Texas’ shameful legacy of disenfranchisement is alive and well and desperately needs fixing.” -@RickTxAFLCIO#txlegeRogers was hailed for waiting in line more than six hours to vote on Super Tuesday 2020, reportedly casting the last ballot at a Houston polling site after 1am local time. National media outlets such asUSA Todaypicked up the story, quoting him as saying,“I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion. I wasn’t going to let anything stop me, so I waited it out.”The local NPR affiliate said he voted for Joe Biden.Carla Reed and Hervis Rogers, the last two voters at Texas Southern University. Finally got their ""I voted"" stickers. They waited six hours, until just after 1am.#TXDecidespic.twitter.com/ngh5gl1nNyTop Democrats, such as SenatorChuck Schumer(New York) and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, also pounced on the incident to argue that the fact Rogers had to wait so long to vote was the result of GOP voter suppression.Unfortunately, it also turned out to be an example of alleged voter fraud. Rogers was convicted of felony burglary in 1989 and 1995. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in the latter case, then was released in 2004 with his parole scheduled to run to June 2020. That means he was still on parole when he voted in 2018 and again in March 2020, according to the indictment.He was jailed last week, with bail set at $100,000. Voting while serving a felony sentence, including parole, is punishable in Texas by two to 20 years in prison, meaning Rogers could get a 40-year term if convicted and hit with the maximum penalty on each count with sentences running consecutively.The Bail Project, an activist group that campaigns against cash bail, posted bond for Rogers on Saturday, securing his release while awaiting trial. Bail Project founder Robin Steinberg accused Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton of using the indictment as a“targeted message of fear”to suppress the“turnout of people of color.”The group added that Rogers believed he was eligible to vote.The ACLU, which is aiding Rogers’ legal defense, said the prosecution shows that“even innocent mistakes in the voting process can be criminalized.”We're so relieved that Hervis Rogers is no longer in jail. He shouldn't have been arrested and charged in the first place. We'll keep fighting for him and for our right to vote.pic.twitter.com/1why8H0mnyNicole DeBorde, a legal analyst for CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News, also represents Rogers. She said Rogers completed rehabilitation after“mistakes in his youth,”adding,“This case, for us, is about who we let the government decide to throw out like trash and who we deem worthy of the basic rights to participate in the processes we all hold dear.”Rogers was about 36 at the time of his last conviction.Social media users attacked the Texas AG for charging Hervis. For instance, poll analyst David Rothschild called Paxton a“shockingly bad person”who was“doing bad things to good people to score cheap political points in your voter-suppression crusade to create permanent white rule in Texas.”Author Megan Kelley Hall said Paxton deserves to go to jail, adding, “You are scum. You are a monster and a poor excuse for man. I hope you go someplace much hotter than Texas.”You are a shockingly bad person, doing bad things to good people to score cheap political points in your voter suppression crusade to create permanent white rule in Texas.You are a disgusting piece of trash who deserves to go to jail. You are under indictment, you are under FBI investigation for fraud. YOU ARE THE CRIMINAL, NOT HERVIS ROGERS.You are scum. You are a monster & a poor excuse for a man. I hope you go someplace MUCH hotter than TX.Paxton responded to media coverage critical of the indictment, including a local NPR report, by saying“Hervis is a felon rightly barred from voting under Texas law … I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it.”Hervis is a felon rightly barred from voting under TX law. This liberal NPR article even says so, but buries it: “Rogers voted before his parole was scheduled to end, he was likely ineligible to cast a ballot on Election Day.”I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it!https://t.co/cXTjGIXfe1Governor Greg Abbott used the case as an example to argue that illegal voting should be a major concern.“Voter fraud is real,”he said.“It occurs mostly by mail ballots or ballot harvesting, but as seen here, it also occurs in person.”"
"Canada's international image is a kind and gentle one. But internally, this Canada Day was a reminder of the nation’s dark history",0.0,37.0,https://www.rt.com/op-ed/528268-canada-day-dark-history/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,www.rt.com,"Usually a day of fireworks, patriotism, and picnics, this July 1 was a day of protest following the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves of indigenous children, a harrowing reminder of how recently Canada failed its people.Yesterday was Canada Day, a celebration of Canada’s confederation, which occurred on that same date in 1867. Usually, the federal holiday is a day of celebration and festivities. But this year, after the harrowing discovery of hundreds of indigenous children’s unmarked graves, for many the day became a day of protest.In an international context, Canada is often painted as a kind and gentle nation, especially when compared to its southern neighbor, the United States. After all, Canada did not have institutionalized slavery, Jim Crow, or redlining. However, that's not to say the country doesn’t have its own moral failings, and the Canadian government’s relationship with indigenous peoples is indeed a tragic one, particularly with regard to the practice of residential schools.Residential schools were an initiative by the Canadian government wherein indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded boarding schools, most of which were operated by the Catholic Church. The government’s goal for the children was compulsory assimilation into the majority culture, and reports that children would be beaten for speaking their native languages, rather than English or French, are common.Over 150,000 indigenous children attended residential schools from the 1880s until 1996, with unknown numbers suffering physical and sexual abuse, and thousands more never returning to their families. In 2008, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology to former students of residential schools, approximately 80,000 of whom were still living at the time,stating:“The Government of Canada built an educational system in which very young children were often forcibly removed from their homes, often taken far from their communities. Many were inadequately fed, clothed and housed. All were deprived of the care and nurturing of their parents, grandparents and communities. First Nations, Inuit and Métis languages and cultural practices were prohibited in these schools. Tragically, some of these children died while attending residential schools and others never returned home. [...]The Government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the Aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly.”Knowledge of the horror conducted in residential schools is not as common as one would imagine, even among Canadians, but in recent weeks, the travesties have been catapulted to national headlines with the discovery of unmarked graves across the country at sites of formerly operating schools. Over 800 bodies of children have been found in graves asshallow as three feet, but reports have yet to emerge on what could have killed these children, whether disease, malnourishment, or other factors.Such a grim discovery would be difficult for any nation, but what has compounded the outrage is the reminder of just how recent these atrocities were. Chief Jason Louie of the Ktunaxa Nation went on record to state that he, like many other members of the indigenous community, had family members who were forced into residential schools, whose abusers were yet to be held to account.“The Nazis were held accountable for their war crimes,”Louie said.“I see no difference in locating the priests and nuns and the brothers who are responsible for this mass murder to be held accountable for their part in this attempt of genocide of an Indigenous people.”And so, in the midst of the nation’s attempt to reconcile with its not-too-distant past, this year's Canada Day was unusually somber as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that, in remembrance of the victims and their families, the Canadian flag would be at half-staff for the day.But despite the government's attempts to placate the increasingly indignant public, #CancelCanadaDay was trending on social media, and Canadians nationwide went out not to march in parades while wearing red and white, but to protest wearing orange in solidarity with First Nations peoples. Monuments to Canada’s history, and specifically its colonial heritage, were also targeted, with crowds in Winnipeg going as far to topple statues ofQueen Elizabeth II and Queen Victoria.And although crowds are calling for the identification and prosecution of government officials who facilitated residential schools, some of whom may still be alive, the state is not the only institution that was involved in the project. The Catholic Church infamously operated about 70% of residential schools, but unlike the Canadian government, the Pope has yet to issue a formal apology, though he is scheduled to meet with indigenous leaders in the coming weeks.This lack of reconciliation is what is believed to be the motive behind a recent string ofchurch arsons, both on and off reserves, though there is no conclusive evidence of such.Although Canada’s national day was doubtlessly a boiling point, the recession of protests should not be mistaken as any sign of unity or healing. The divisions that have been exacerbated by this latest controversy highlight Canada’s political, racial, and even religious cleavages, which will take more than a typical Canadian “I’m sorry” to move past."
"Man vandalizes Hunter Biden art gallery by spray-painting ‘Daddy’, assaults gallery employee, gets arrested",0.0,36.67,https://www.rt.com/usa/528937-hunter-biden-paintings-vandalized/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-11,www.rt.com,"A man has been arrested in New York after being accused of vandalizing Hunter Biden’s art gallery and assaulting an employee who attempted to stop him.Rodrick Webber, 47, allegedly spray-painted the word“Daddy”on a wall inside the New York City art gallery. Webber later revealed to investigators that he was trying to write the phrase “Daddy is a war criminal” on the wall, in reference to Hunter Biden’s father, President Joe Biden.Webber could not finish his message as he was approached by a gallery employee who attempted to stop him, and who was then allegedly assaulted.The vandalism reportedly damaged a painting worth over $14,000, though none of Biden’s paintings were ruined. Biden’s fall show will reportedly be bringing in figures as high as $500,000. The upcoming show has faced scrutiny from critics, who have described the costly art show as an ethical issue for the administration, especially considering past allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden.In response to the controversy, the White House helped draft an agreement with the gallery keeping all buyers anonymous, even from the artist himself – a move that has only earned further criticism and concern.“The president has established the highest ethical standards of any administration in American history, and his family’s commitment to rigorous processes like this is a prime example,”White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement.Webber said his protest had nothing to do with Hunter Biden’s art, and everything to do with his father’s alleged “war crimes.”The man told the New York Post that he was also suspicious of the prices Biden’s artwork is demanding.“While Hunter Biden and his artwork is, you know, it’s not bad, it’s curious to me that it’s raising prices of half a million dollars just out of the blue. It says to me that there’s some kind of malfeasance there,”he said.In a previous social media post, Webber accused the art gallery hosting Hunter Biden’s work of supporting a“war crime family.”Webber also appeared to defend the physical incident with the gallery worker, saying,“his big a** girthy body was on top of me.”According to Webber, the employee actually assaulted him and he is open to filing a civil suit in the future.The alleged vandal has been charged with criminal mischief and assault."

Against this supposed“threat,”the Justice Department hasasked fornew powers of prosecution, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hasclaimedthat right-wingers and conservatives,“inspired by foreign terrorist groups”and“emboldened by the breach of the US Capitol Building,”are“plotting attacks against government facilities”and“threatening violence against critical infrastructure.”In addition to their own powers, the DHS, FBI, and National Security Council also want to hire third-party ‘researchers’ to spy on Americans, recentreportshave claimed.Though the riot on Capitol Hill was broken up in a matter of hours and Congress returned to work the same evening, the FBI has left no stone unturned in finding and prosecuting hundreds of Trump supporters who took part.

Local mediareportedthat a lifeguard overseeing a kiddie pool was first to feel unwell, and it was not long before dozens of other visitors, including children, felt symptoms such as skin and inhalation irritation consistent with chemical poisoning.Among those rushed to hospital was a three-year-old toddler, who is believed to be in stable condition.

Look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated.

‘Unacceptable’: Fox News blasts NSA after report reveals they ‘unmasked’ host Tucker Carlson in communications,12.0,27.0,https://www.rt.com/usa/530158-tucker-carlson-nsa-spying-unmasking/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.rt.com,"After the National Security Agency (NSA) denied targeting journalist Tucker Carlson, a new report has revealed the agency “unmasked” the Fox News host’s name while monitoring third-party communications.Numerous lawmakers have called for an official investigation into Carlson’s recent claims that the NSA has been spying on his communications with the intention of taking him off the air. The agency pushed back against the claim last month, though critics noted the statement released about the accusations wasn’t exactly a clear ‘denial.’A statement from NSA regarding recent allegations:pic.twitter.com/vduE6l6YWgAccording to a report from The Record, citing multiple people familiar with the situation, the NSA has completed a review of Carlson’s allegations and found that his name was“unmasked”in third-party communications being monitored.“Unmasking”is a process through which officials can request a redacted name of a US citizen in a final intelligence report being revealed to better understand the messages being looked at.There is no further information about the specific communications, but Carlson had mentioned, before making his NSA accusations, that he was attempting to get an interview with Russian president Vladimir Putin.The report claims that though Carlson’s name was revealed, his own communications were never gathered through“incidental collection,”which allows officials to obtain data from a citizen that is in contact with a foreign person already being monitored.Fox News has defended their popular-but-controversial host and said it is“entirely unacceptable”for the NSA to“unmask”Carlson’s name while he is attempting to do his job.“For the NSA to unmask Tucker Carlson or any journalist attempting to secure a newsworthy interview is entirely unacceptable and raises serious questions about their activities as well as their original denial, which was wildly misleading,”the network said in a statement read off on Friday by ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ guest host Mark Steyn.The NSA now admits that it ""unmasked"" Tucker's identity after an intelligence intercept. Plus: the tyrants at Facebook confirm that they have been censoring this show.pic.twitter.com/AeYbQzNWLINeither the NSA nor Carlson have directly commented on the latest development, though Carlson has stuck by his claims. The Fox News host did become a hot topic of conversation on social media over the weekend, though not due to his spying accusations or the“unmasking”revelation about the NSA, but rather from a tiff with Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-California) that ended with the Democrat lawmaker stating,“I’m just not that into you.”Swalwell posted alleged screenshots of a conversation between him and Carlson where the Fox News host told the lawmaker to call him, and Swalwell refused, citing Carlson’s criticism of his wife earlier in the week – according to the segment, Carlson claimed Swalwell’s campaign had spent $20,000 at a hotel where his wife used to work.Swalwell refused to talk to Carlson – for which the host branded him a“coward”– and instead launched the #TuckerTantrum hashtag, which became popular among Democrats. Swalwell has not commented on the report about the NSA“unmasking”a reporter’s name.After years of lying about me and my family,@TuckerCarlsonis losing his mind that I won’t return his calls. Sorry, Tucker, I’m just not that into you. Who knows what lie he’ll tell next?#TuckerTantrumpic.twitter.com/vwX7AfwJ1ZHave your wife’s lawyer call him back.Oh my Gawd!

"Mental 'virus' or real, governments can't just censor and imprison their way out of immunity debt",23.0,21.33,https://www.rt.com/op-ed/529447-immunity-debt-covid-censorship-reality/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,www.rt.com,"Covid-fearing parents may think they’re doing their kids a favor by keeping them inside, masked and encased in a bubble of hand sanitizer. But as humans we need pathogens to function – literally and metaphorically.Evolution, it turns out, isn’t stupid. There’s a reason our guts are swarming with bacteria, and while we’ve been taught to recoil at the very concept (especially after a year and a half of plague-talk in which bacteria are regularly brutally assaulted with jets of hand sanitizer for nothing more than existing), those microscopic creatures actually digest our food for us. If it weren’t for them, we’d starve.The bacterial colonies that call us home also need to interact with one another, which means once in a while touching a doorknob (or even a subway pole) and not immediately dousing your microscopic hitchhikers in caustic death-juice; sneezing on public transit without having to worry you’ll be lynched; and letting your kid play in the mud with other kids. Their lives could depend on it, as several countries previously praised for their ability to control their citizens are being reminded.Under Covid-19’s new abnormal, we think nothing of going weeks without seeing friends, months without seeing family, long periods without so much as touching another person, and are told that this is not only healthy – if you don’t do it, you could die! So we learn to run across the street when we spot an old friend coming in for a hug, and to almost preemptively say “no” when our kids ask if they can for once play with their friends in real life instead of through an endless series of screens.Turns out this is a great way to guarantee future epidemics. New Zealand, a global media darling for its 26 (reported) Covid deaths, is experiencing a major spike in a normally non-threatening childhood illness, since – while kids remain all but unaffected by Covid-19 - the same doesn’t hold true for other common respiratory diseases. Nearly 1,000 cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been diagnosed in just five weeks in the country, more than half of the number usually reported in an entire 29-week winter, according to the Guardian, which quoted public health experts placing the blame squarely on the “immunity debt” incurred from the country’s prolonged, stringent Covid lockdowns. In other words, “two weeks to flatten the curve” was one thing, but 18 months later, the curve is flattening us.This problem wasn’t exactly unknown to medical science, and NZ’s willingness to go down this path rather than, say, encourage residents to come out of their homes and behave like normal humans when the worst danger of Covid-19 had passed, speaks to a pattern of martyrdom and virtue signaling that President Jacinda Ardern has capitalized on expertly. Her government postponed elections, forced new arrivals into “quarantine camps” for a period of not less than two weeks even with negativetest results(positive results, or worse a refusal to be tested, could have you locked upeven longer), and has all but smothered the independent press. The economy imploded, posting its largest quarterly decline in history, and housing costs remained unmanageable for many.Yet she and her party got a historic mandate to rule (in October’s delayed election, with unprecedented numbers of mail-in ballots, after Facebook shut down one of the opposing parties’ pages right before Election Day, and other asterisks that went unmentioned by the press as they dined on her fiance’s cooking during the vote count). Turns out democracy is a risk factor for Covid-19, too. Who knew?The phenomenon of “immunity debt” translates well to information, and Wellington isn’t the only government long overdue for a reckoning regarding the censorship it’s been forcing down its citizens’ throats, supposedly in the name of protecting them from infectious bad ideas. Kiwis were already resigned to being shut out of the global conversation after the Christchurch mosque shooting made it OK – nay, expected! – for an emergency to require termination of non-approved communications – and 10-year prison sentences for anyone who wouldn’t comply anddelete the wrongthink. For a “democratic” country to enact such censorship would have elicited screams if it had come from Trump’s America, but Ardern was doing it in the name of Safety. With literally no way to test the success of such measures other than an absurd “X number of days without another mass shooting,” thesilencing campaignwas preemptively declared a success and governments around the worldsigned on, elevating censorship to the chief crime (and protest)-fighting method. Object? What are you, a terrorist?Applying analogous measures while the world panicked over Covid-19 was a no-brainer, and in many countries it has been effectively – if not literally – forbidden to question the official story of the virus’ arrival and spread, even though the World Health Organization and its national counterparts were changing that “official story” on a monthly, if not weekly basis. Context-free videos of people dropping to the ground and convulsing in China, even without an implication those people evenhadthe virus, put the fear into the rest of the world and, by the time American news networks were getting caught rerunning footage of packed Italian hospitals as “Covid-hit New York City,” even dissenting voices had largely shied away from questioning the “facts” the government was putting out. Only in cases where the government was not pushing total fear was it acceptable to mock the orders one was given, because not wanting us to live in fear could only mean they didn’t really care about us.With Trump safely out of the White House, though, the entire American power structure has presented a united front pushing the same stultifying and borderline-nonsensical message of fear on offer from Ardern. The Biden administration is no longer even covering up unconstitutional behaviors like “flagging misinformation” for Facebook to delete, and even the White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki seems to have been forced intoarguing with herselfas social media muffles all opposing voices. Pacified by deliveries of occasional helicopter money whose value is steadily declining – a fact they might understand if they hadn’t declared math racist – Americans have proudly stepped up to act as the guards in the narrative managers’ mental prison. Far from demanding more transparency from their government, Americans are demanding less, while dog piling on dissenters – aware at some basic level they’re being lied to but unwilling to admit who’s doing the lying.New Zealand’s censorship may be more photogenic – certainly Ardern is easier on the eyes than the ever-stumbling gaffe-mummified Biden – but both countries are headed straight for a wall built up by years of unpaid epistemological “immunity debt.” One cannot simply stuff “offensive” ideas or “misinformation” down the pipes eternally unless one wants to experience a killer mental toilet backup. The more reality has diverged with whatever is believed by these increasingly-unhinged closed societies, the more of a mess that backup will leave. Neither country can afford such a meltdown, and both would be wise to start allowing reality to filter back into their media before it’s too late. That means ending knee-jerk social media censorship (which has been shown to make usersmoregulliblewhen it comes to fake news, anyway), rolling back the ever-expanding definition of “hate speech,” and in general behaving like adults.Instead, Wellington istryingto make “hate speech” itself a crime punishable by three years in prison, and continues to push absurd poll results in which “75% of New Zealanders feel like the country is heading in the right direction, and for the most part, Covid-19 is not impacting their future.” Washington is trying to take the Second Amendment away from its citizens even while still choking on the First. Meanwhile, over in the UK, the Johnson government is warning of an influenza “epidemic” even as citizens remain under lockdown from the last Covid wave. It’s hard to guess which of these three policies will fail first, but whichever one it is, I wouldn’t want to be in charge of the cleanup job."
State gets sued over law demanding transgender people give proof of surgery if they want to change sex on birth certificate,2.33,40.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/529509-montana-aclu-transgender-lawsuit/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,www.rt.com,"Two transgender plaintiffs are suing the state of Montana over a law requiring proof of sex change surgery to alter one’s gender on their actual birth cert, something they and activists claim infringes on their civil rights.The law in question was signed by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte in April and requires the state health department to receive“a certified copy of an order from a court with appropriate jurisdiction indicating that the sex of the person born in Montana has been changed by surgical procedure.”Activists have blasted the law, saying it restricts the rights of transgender people. In the complaint filed Friday, the defendants argued that it was put in place to“marginalize transgender people.”The two plaintiffs are Amelia Marquez, who was born male but identifies as female, and John Doe, who was born female and identifies as male. They are requesting a state court to ban the enforcement of the law.Marquez argued in the lawsuit that the law does not account for factors that may be holding transgender people back from getting genital surgery. Marquez claimed she has gone through hormone treatments, but is unable to afford or take the time off of work to get the actual surgery.Doe, meanwhile, has gone through“masculinizing chest reconstructive surgery”and taken other steps“to bring his body into conformity with the male gender identity,”but he does not want further surgery.Marquez said not being able to actually change the gender on her birth certificate“is a painful and stigmatizing reminder of the State of Montana’s refusal to recognize me as a woman.”Marquez and Doe are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which blasted the Montana government for increasing“government bureaucracy in people’s lives”and not providing a valid reason why proof of surgery for an individual needs to be on record with the state.“Courts and state lawmakers around the country have increasingly said that these barriers to accurate identity documents are unnecessary and serve no purpose for the government,”John Knight, senior staff attorney with the ACLU LGBTQ & HIV Project, said in a statement.“Transgender and non-binary people need recognition of who they are and not permission from the government to live their lives.”Similar lawsuits in Ohio and Utah led to judges ruling that it was people’s right to change their birth certificates without rules restricting gender changes.The lawsuit against Montana’s law also lists Gov. Greg Gianforte, Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, and its head Adam Meier, as defendants."
Biden administration sees highest number of illegal immigrants attempt to cross US southern border for 2 decades,13.33,27.0,https://www.rt.com/usa/529502-190k-illegal-immigrants-us-border/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,www.rt.com,"Nearly 190,000 people tried to illegally enter the United States from its southern border with Mexico in June – the highest number in more than 20 years, and as much as ten times the total recorded during some months under Trump.According todatafrom US Customs and Border Protection, June saw 188,829 illegal immigrants attempt to cross the border. The highest number of attempts in 21 years, June’s statistics were also over 8,000 people more than May, nearly 10,000 more than April, and over 80,000 more than February.The statistics show that the number of illegal border crossing attempts shot up considerably following the inauguration of President Joe Biden. 101,095 attempts were made in February compared to 78,442 in January, when Biden took over the White House from President Donald Trump – who was notoriously tough in his policies on illegal immigration.The number of illegal border crossings is now as much as ten times higher than during Trump’s presidency, where the number of attempted crossings was as low as 17,106 in April 2020.Biden has taken a different tone to Trump in his border policies, opting to halt construction of a southern border wall and backing a bill – that waspassedby the House in March – which gives illegal immigrants in the country a pathway to citizenship. One of Biden’s first acts in office was to terminate Trump’s ‘National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States’.However, the increase in attempted border crossings under the Biden administration has seemingly forced the president to change his position on immigration.“I can say quite clearly: don't come over,”Biden told illegal immigrants after being hit with a huge increase of 72,000 border crossings in March. The call did not appear to have any considerable impact on the number, which has continued to rise month on month."
‘We can’t coddle violent criminals!’ DC police chief shreds media & ‘dysfunctional’ justice system after upscale district shooting,7.0,38.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/530112-dc-police-dysfunctional-courts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.rt.com,"Washington, DC’s police chief took both the justice system and the media to task after another shooting in broad daylight this week, saying local courts are allowing violent criminals to run free as the press turns a blind eye.Briefing reporters on a brazen daytime shooting in an upscale DC district the day prior, Metropolitan Police chief Robert Contee decried the“unacceptable”wave of violence gripping some of the city’s neighborhoods, arguing that a dysfunctional court system was failing to keep dangerous offenders off the streets.“We could take the political route and talk about all of this fluffy stuff, but I’m going to give it to you straight, where the issues are,”he said at the press conference on Friday.D.C. police chief Contee is BRINGING it: ""The justice system we have right now is not functioning the way that it should. The courts are not open. That is a fact. Barely open. So cases from last year...they have not been disposed of, what do you think those individuals are?""pic.twitter.com/H4YKxGzsmOTwo men were injured in Thursday’s incident, which saw more than 10 shots ring out on DC’s 14th Street. Police said the victims were“conscious and breathing”soon after the incident, though they offered few other details about their condition. Law enforcement also released footage of the suspected shooter and one accomplice, who fled the scene in a dark, four-door car, asking the public to help identify them. They remain at large.The suspects and vehicle, described as an older black sedan, were captured by a nearby camera and can be seen in video here.pic.twitter.com/n8P2gR5ps9Contee fumed that Thursday’s shooting only garnered media attention due to its location near the high-end Le Diplomate restaurant, suggesting the press often ignores violence in other neighborhoods. He pointed to the 922 shootings and 198 homicides tallied in DC in 2020, a 16-year high, saying such violence“should be shocking to the conscience of every person in our city”and has“been happening for a long time.”“This is what the response should look like. It should look like this,”he said, gesturing toward the crowd of reporters around him.“Because there are a lot of corners I go to after a murder has occurred, and it’s just me, it’s just the officers.”Contee added that a large backlog of cases involving violent criminals from 2020 had“not been disposed of”due to delays caused by Covid-19, asking,“Where do you think those individuals are? Anybody want to take a guess? They’re in the community.”The flipside to the judicial gridlock, however, is that some defendants havelanguished in custodywell beyond their ultimate sentences as they awaited trial. Meanwhile, as of Wednesday, the nation’s capital had recorded105 homicidesso far in 2021, keeping pace with last year’s decade-and-a-half high."
"As thousands of inmates sent home over pandemic could be told to return to prison, activists urge Biden to #KeepThemHome",0.33,31.0,https://www.rt.com/usa/530165-biden-covid-inmates-keep-them-home/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.rt.com,"Activists are urging Congress and President Joe Biden to act before low-level criminals, sent to serve their sentences under house arrest at the height of Covid-19 pandemic, are forced to return to prison to finish their time.A report this week from The New York Times about prisoners potentially being taken back into custody has had criminal justice reform activists up in arms, including groups such as the NAACP and ACLU.On Saturday, activists vented their frustrations on social media, led by figures such as lawyer Emily Galvin-Almanza, using the hashtag #KeepThemHome to urge action from the administration.Good morning everyone. I'm joining@JoshuaBHoeto stage a 24 hour effort calling on@POTUSto#KeepThemHome. You may not know this, but several thousand people were screened to be sent home from prison to weather the pandemic.https://t.co/w0KGj7O1X5NOTHING is better for public safety than supporting people who have navigated the system, come home, and succeeded - that is the best possible outcome 4,000 people have been home for 16 months successfully and could be sent back#KeepThemHome@POTUS@VPpic.twitter.com/s19XcAWzthThe controversy over these prisoners’ future stems from a memo issued by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which stated that inmates whose sentences extend beyond the“pandemic emergency period”would need to return to jail to complete their terms. According to the Times report, Biden officials have agreed with the legal opinion, meaning thousands of inmates who were released at the height of the pandemic to help slow the spread of the virus could be on their way back.Critics have argued, however, that those who have remained in compliance while being monitored at home deserve to be allowed to continue to serve their sentences at home.With the official state of emergency likely continuing through the end of the year, activists have argued that either Congress could step in and expand federal authority to keep inmates at home beyond the pandemic, or Biden himself could use his clemency powers to commute sentences.“Imagine being sent home from prison.....doing the hard work of re-integrating and finding work and support ONLY TO BE SENT BACK TO PRISON 16 MONTHS LATER FOR NO GOOD REASON,”podcaster and consultant Joshua B. Hoetweetedon Saturday.“Biden-Harris ran on criminal justice reform.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who argued in April that very few inmates in home confinement have broken the guidelines for their limited release or gotten into further legal trouble.Less than 1% of people serving their sentence at home under the#CARESActhave violated their terms of release, yet thousands are at risk of going back to prison.

Kendrick Fulton, 47, for instance, was serving a 17 year sentence for selling crack cocaine when he was let out of prison 11 years earlier than he was supposed to. He has already served 17 years and is working in Round Rock, Texas.“I served over 17 years already. What more do you want? I should go back for another 11 years to literally just do nothing?”he told Reuters in April, about the potential of being rounded up by the FBI and taken back to prison."
Bilingual orders & no more gas: Police slapped with new RESTRICTIONS after George Floyd protest settlement in North Carolina,-1.0,39.67,https://www.rt.com/usa/530166-charlotte-police-settlement-george-floyd/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.rt.com,"Civil rights groups are celebrating a settlement with the city of Charlotte, North Carolina imposing new bans on police dispersing protests, stemming from a 2020 George Floyd demonstration where CS tear gas was used.The lawsuit brought forth by the groups alleged that police orchestrated an attack on hundreds of protesters who gathered on June 2, 2020 to protest the death of George Floyd the previous month in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Footage from the protest appeared to show protesters being surrounded and chemical weapons being deployed by police, a tactic activists were quick to denounce and claim it was excessive force.Part of the settlement reached with the city includes new restrictions on how police in the city can handle dispersing protesting crowds. The use of CS tear gas, for instance, will be prohibited. Other revisions to police directives include allotted time being given for protesters to disperse after an order is given, and for that order to be given in both English and Spanish. At least two exits for protesters to disperse also need to be clearly communicated. Other measures include prohibiting pepper balls being aimed at the heads and necks of protesters.The revisions will be in place for four years and include“a mechanism to enforce violations,”according to a press release announcing the settlement.Groups behind the lawsuit include the ACLU of North Carolina, the Charlotte Chapter of the NAACP, and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.“This agreement is a step in the right direction, but it’s insufficient to reckon with the violence and trauma protesters endured at the hands of police across the state last year,”Kristie Puckett-Williams, statewide manager of the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina’s Campaign for Smart Justice, said.CMPD Chief Johnny Jennings responded to the settlement by saying some policies had already been changed in light of the controversial protest response and he was open to the new changes.“We are a learning agency and always looking for ways to improve as we owe that to the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County and all of those we serve because it is the right thing to do,”he said.Jennings has been promoting police reform in his position. He even recently announced what has been described as a ‘customer training’ program for police officers, helping to repair the relationship between police and the public. The program, announced last month, is using a consultant who previously worked for companies such as Chick Fil-A and Starbucks.“That encounter, although it’s a negative incident, does not have to be a negative encounter with that officer,”Jennings said.“When we can leave a positive impression with that interaction … [we] don’t let that person to go away feeling CMPD officers are bad people or are jerks or whatever name you want to come up with.”"
‘Reached the limits’ of voluntary system: New York Mayor de Blasio urges businesses to force vaccines on employees,5.33,43.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/530113-de-blasio-vaccinate-employees/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.rt.com,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has urged employers to be as aggressive as possible in mandating that workers get vaccinated against Covid-19, marking the latest sign the US jab campaign is shifting from cajoling to forcing.“I’m calling on all New York City employers, including our private hospitals, to move immediately to some form of mandate,”de Blasio said on Friday in aradio interview. He called on employers to impose“whatever the maximum is you feel you can do.”De Blasio’s comments come amid rising US Covid-19 infections, as the reportedly highly contagious Delta variant of the virus spreads across the country. With unvaccinated Americans entrenched in their hesitancy – newly released Associated Press-NORC poll results show that 80% who haven’t yet received the jab don’t plan to do so – Democrat politicians and public-health experts are increasingly calling for local mandates that leave people virtually no choice but to get the shots.After more than six months of New York’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout, during which residents were given“every form of incentives,”the city has“reached the limits of a purely voluntary system,”de Blasio said.“Any type of mandate helps. It will move the ball. It will get more people vaccinated,”he added.Both President Joe Biden and de Blasio have fallen short of their vaccination goals. The mayor had aimed to have 5 million New Yorkers fully inoculated against the virus by the end of June, but the current total is less than 4.5 million. Nationwide, the flow of Americans getting Covid-19 shots has plunged since, reaching a daily peak of 4.6 million in April, averaging around 500,000 a day in recent weeks, as those who wanted the jabs have already had plenty of opportunity to get them.Earlier this week, De Blasio ordered that employees of New York’s public hospital system and Health Department clinics need to get vaccinated or be tested for Covid-19 every week. He admitted that he hoped such testing would become so tiresome that recalcitrant employees would find it in their interest to be inoculated, and he wants the private sector to use the same sort of tactics.“We need to get more serious than ever about vaccination,”de Blasio said.“If everyone was vaccinated right now, we would not be having a conversation about the Delta variant. This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”De Blasio’s mandate push marks a shift from his past stance, when he had insisted the city could persuade vaccine-hesitant residents to get the jabs through awareness campaigns and incentives, including prize draws, for those who cooperated. About 70% of New York adults have received at least their first vaccine dose, which is just above the 69% national rate.Ironically, the mayor pitched“freedom”as a motivation for forcing people to get the shots, which have received only emergency use authorization from the FDA.“If people want freedom, if people want jobs, if people want to be able to live again, we have got to get more people vaccinated,”he said.Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, and Andy Slavitt, a former Covid-19 adviser to the administration, are among those who have similarly suggested employers and local governments use mandates to make life less tenable for those who choose not to get inoculated.CNN’s Washington bureau chief reportedly offered much the same sentiment in an email that was accidentally made public this week, saying,“This is the point re: carrot vs. stick. The Carrot is no longer going to work.”De Blasio plans to ratchet up the pressure on vaccine-hesitant New Yorkers over time, especially city employees.“I’ve been very explicit about the fact that this is the beginning and we’re going to climb up the ladder of measures to address this situation,”he told WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer.“We’re going to be making announcements piece by piece.”"
"Hesitancy battle lost? Vast majority of unvaccinated Americans say they WON’T be getting Covid-19 jabs, poll shows",8.0,29.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/530109-poll-unvaccinated-americans-entrenched/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.rt.com,"The Biden administration faces an uphill battle to meet its goals for Covid-19 vaccinations, as a newly released poll shows that 80% of American adults who haven’t yet recived the jab have no intention of doing so.The results of theAssociated Press-NORC poll, which was released on Friday, revealed that 45% of unvaccinated respondents said they“definitely”wouldn’t be getting inoculated against the virus, with 35% indicating they“probably”wouldn’t do so. Only 19% of those who hadn’t been vaccinated intended to get the shots, and just 3% consider those plans definite.The responses suggest there is little room for growth in US vaccination rates, because 67% of participants had already received the jab, and only 1% of overall respondents said they would definitely get inoculated. Just 5% said they would probably get vaccinated. Other unvaccinated Americans don’t plan to get jabbed, meaning around 73% is the apparent upside for the nation’s adult vaccination rate.President Joe Biden had aimed to have 70% of US adults vaccinated with at least their first dose by July 4, but fell short, at 67%. Nearly three weeks beyond his target date, some 69% of adults have received a Covid-19 shot, according toCDC data. Nearly 60% of adults are fully vaccinated, and the rate is 49% for the overall population.Perhaps more troubling for vaccine proponents is the declining rate of new vaccinations. After the rollout hit a one-day record of 4.6 million doses delivered on April 10, the daily pace has slowed to around 500,000 in recent weeks. In Alabama, which ranks last in the nation, with just 34% of its population fully vaccinated, and only a trickle of residents rolling up their sleeves to get the shots, Governor Kay Ivey became so frustrated on Thursday that she said it’s“time to blame the unvaccinated folks”for rising Covid-19 infections.While 83% of Democrat adults have been vaccinated, according to the Associated Press-NORC poll, just 51% of Republicans have been. And Republicans are more skeptical that the vaccines will be effective against the highly infectious Delta variant of Covid-19, which has driven the country’s recent jump in new cases.The poll found that 58% of Republicans expect the vaccines to work well against new variants, while 81% of Democrats expressed confidence. Among unvaccinated Americans, 64% don’t trust the shots to prevent the spread of Delta.An Israeli government study earlier this month found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 64% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant. The drugmaker had claimed a 95% overall efficacy rate. Biden declared earlier this week that,“You’re not going to get Covid if you have these vaccinations.”But infections among vaccinated Americans have risen amid the spread of the Delta variant. In fact, there have been such cases among White House staffers, but Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, declined on Friday to tell reporters the number of so-called“breakthrough”infections.With most unvaccinated Americans firmly entrenched in their decision, some public-health experts are calling for tougher measures to force people to get the shots. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, has called for local governments, businesses and schools to mandate vaccination because the administration would face too much public backlash if it tried to make the jabs compulsory.Former White House Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt suggested on Thursday in aCNN interviewthat unvaccinated workers and students should be forced to take tests daily, at their own expense, to prove they’re not infected. Making people come in an hour before work or class to take a Covid-19 test and pay for it would cause more Americans to“take the option to get vaccinated,”he argued.“We should be really seriously considering whether schools, workplaces, government agencies ought to be saying, ‘Hey, if you’re coming here, you need to be vaccinated, and if you’re not, you need to show you’ve got a negative test every single day,”Slavitt said."

She claimed unvaccinated Americans posed a threat to those who were vaccinated, despite the latter being protected from the virus.Regardless of the efforts of Psaki and the rest of Joe Biden’s administration, the number of vaccinations administered continues to fall with each update, and interest in getting vaccinated remains significantly low for those who have avoided inoculation thus far.The results of a poll released by the Associated Press on Friday showed that the majority of unvaccinated respondents had little to no interest in changing their status, with 45% saying they had no plans to get vaccinated, and another 35% saying they would likely not be getting vaccinated in the future."

Photos circulating online were animals under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not dogs under our care.KSAR and a number of other animal charities had been attempting to get a large group of rescue dogs on board an evacuation flight, but were reportedly denied by the Pentagon and ordered by the military to turn the animals loose at the airport.

"White House turns the tables on ‘defund the police’ slogan, suggesting it was Republicans’ idea all along",11.0,35.67,https://www.rt.com/usa/528329-jen-psaki-defund-police-biden/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-03,www.rt.com,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has drawn ire from conservatives for once again claiming Republicans are more in favor of ‘defunding’ the police than President Joe Biden and Democrats.After several exchanges with Fox News’ Peter Doocy this week, Psaki found herself being accused of spinning the president’s past stance on police reform and funding. Psaki argued Republicans’ failure to support legislation such as the American Rescue Plan, which included police funding, made them guilty of wanting to take funding away from police.In their most recent exchange, Doocy questioned the White House’s position on“defunding the police,”citing Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta’s Senate testimony from July 2020. Back then, she said it is“critical for state and local leaders to heed calls from Black Lives Matter and Movement for Black Lives activists to decrease police budgets.”Psaki pushed back, saying Gupta has clarified that she is not in support of defunding the police and then addressed the pair’s back-and-forths on defunding the police.Biden, Psaki claimed,“ran on and won the most votes of any candidate in history on a platform of boosting funding for law enforcement after Republicans spent decades trying to cut the COPS program.”The COPS program is an initiative for hiring new police officers.She then cited Republican opposition to the American Rescue Plan once again to swipe at conservatives.“I don’t have time to read out all their names today,”Psaki said.The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, among other things, included $350 billion that state and local governments could use for police funding, but Republicans rejected the spending package as too expensive at the time.Though Biden has never directly endorsed defunding the police - he has said he does not support it - support for slashing police budgets has become fairly common among Democrats. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), have openly shown support for ‘defunding’ the police.Psaki’s attempts to argue that“defund the police”- a slogan made popular at Black Lives Matter protests and by liberal activists - is a Republican effort have been blasted by conservatives, who have gone so far as to accuse the press secretary of lying.“He just called it ‘reform’ instead, Jenn. Americans aren’t as stupid as the Biden admin thinks they are,”one Twitter user wrote in a Saturday tweet, adding numerous tweets from Biden during the 2020 presidential election calling for police“reform.”He just called it ‘reform’ instead, Jenn.

Fauci says US would still have smallpox & polio if vaccines got the same pushback then as they do now in attack on Fox,9.33,38.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/529515-fauci-smallpox-disinformation-fox/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.rt.com,"White House Covid-19 adviser Anthony Fauci has argued that if the US government faced the same level of vaccine hesitancy when smallpox and polio vaccines were rolled out, the diseases would still run rampant in the US.While US President Joe Bidenpointedthe finger at Facebook as the main culprit behind underwhelming vaccine uptake in the US, Faucitooka shot at the conservative cable news media.Responding to CNN’s Jim Acosta question of whether Tucker Carlson’s hugely popular show on Fox News would have prevented the eradication of dangerous diseases in the US had it been around decades ago, Fauci appeared to agree.“Do you think we could have eradicated polio or defeated the measles if you had Fox News night after night warning people about these vaccine issues that are, you know, bunk?”Acosta asked Fauci during an interview on Saturday.Dr. Anthony Fauci to@Acosta: ""We probably would still have smallpox and we probably would still have polio in this country if we had the kind of false information that's being spread now.""pic.twitter.com/MVUxEPX5yf“If we had had the pushback for the vaccines the way we’re seeing on certain media, I don’t think it would have been possible at all not only to eradicate polio, we probably would still have smallpox,”Fauci said, before adding that he was“certain”that polio would have been still active in the US.The US had its last outbreak of smallpox back in 1949, and since 1972, the vaccine is no longer commonly administered. The last wild case globally was in 1977. Shortly after 9/11, President George W. Bush ordered smallpox vaccinations for 500,000 US troops in high-risk parts of the world and frontline healthcare workers who were willing to get vaccinated. However, at the time there were concerns about possible life-threatening side effects of the jab, with the New York Timesreportingthat“the decision had been difficult for President Bush, given the probability that some people would die of the vaccine’s side effects.”According to a 2003 modelstudy, published in theNew England Journal of Medicine, if 60 percent of the US population was vaccinated, this would be beneficial in an unlikely scenario of a national bioterrorist attack with the smallpox virus, but otherwise would have caused some 482 deaths nationally.The US has been polio-free since 1979, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) crediting“a successful vaccination program”with two vaccines introduced in the mid-1950s and early 1960s for uprooting the disease in the US. Worldwide, polio cases have plummeted dramatically since the late 1980s, with the World Health Organization reporting only 22 cases in 2017.

Researchers blame the same hackers who went after the meatpacker JBS.The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)saidon Friday evening it was“taking action to understand and address the recent supply-chain ransomware attack against Kaseya”and providers that employ their software.Supply chain attack of Kaseya, commonly used in managed service provider environments in the United States, leading to mass ransomware event.Details in link and thread as they develop:https://t.co/YStENYMTdWKaseya has taken their cloud service offline. It initially said 200 companies were affected, but later changed that to“a small number.”Neither the company nor CISA have said anything about how the hackers may have gained access.John Hammond of the cybersecurity firm Huntress Labs said“thousands”of computers were affected.“We currently have three Huntress partners who are impacted with roughly 200 businesses that have been encrypted,”he said, calling it a“colossal and devastating supply chain attack.”John Hammond, senior security researcher at Huntress Labs, on the Kaseya breach: ~200 companies that use Kaseya's tech had their networks encrypted by REvil (think of this as SolarWinds but with ransomware). ""This is a colossal and devastating supply chain attack.""pic.twitter.com/c9xDnrJw9fBrett Callow, a ransomware expert at Emsisoft, told AP he was unaware of any previous ransomware attacks on the supply chain on this scale, calling it“SolarWinds with ransomware.”While the US government has blamed last year’s SolarWinds breach on Russia – Moscow hasdeniedany involvement, calling the insinuations“absurd”and“pathetic”– the Kaseya hack seemed to be the work of REvil, a group many US researchers have described as“Russian-speaking.”“Based on everything we are seeing right now, we strongly believe this (is) REvil/Sodinikibi,”Hammond said.REvil is a criminal syndicate the FBI blamed for the May ransomwareattack on JBS, the Brazilian-based meat-packing conglomerate, which disrupted meat processing and deliveries in the US, Canada, and Australia. JBS admitted on June 10 that it had paid a $11 million ransom to the hackers in order to restore operations and prevent future disruptions.While the White House did not blame Russia for the JBS attack, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that“responsible states do not harbour ransomware criminals”after the FBI pointed to REvil as the likely culprit behind the breach.Cyber-sleuths also don’t believe the timing of the reported Kaseya hack was an accident. It came as the US was gearing up for a three-day weekend to celebrate the Independence Day holiday, and many companies as well as government agencies were closing up shop early.“There’s zero doubt in my mind that the timing here was intentional,”Jake Williams of Rendition Infosec told AP.Washington has repeatedly accused Moscow of either orchestrating cyberattacks on US infrastructure or“harboring criminal entities”that do so. Last month’s summit between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva prominently featured a discussion on hacking.On Friday morning, the Russian Embassy in Washington issued a statement noting that“constant attacks on critical infrastructure in Russia”are coming from US soil, and expressed hope the Americans would“abandon the practice of unfounded accusations and focus on professional work with Russian experts to strengthen international information security.”"

"Vatican Indicts 10 People, Including a Cardinal, in UK Deal",0.0,47.67,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/vatican-scandal/2021/07/03/id/1027352/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-03,www.newsmax.com,"A Vatican judge on Saturday indicted 10 people, including a once-powerful cardinal, on charges including embezzlement, abuse of office, extortion and fraud in connection with the Secretariat of State’s 350 million-euro investment in a London real estate venture.The president of the Vatican's criminal tribunal, Giuseppe Pignatone, set July 27 as the trial date, but lawyers for the defendants immediately questioned how they could prepare for trial so soon given they hadn't yet formally received the indictment or any of the documentation in the case.The 487-page indictment was handed down following a sprawling, two-year investigation into how the Secretariat of State managed its vast asset portfolio, much of which is funded by the Peter’s Pence donations from the faithful. The scandal over multimillion-dollar losses has resulted in a sharp reduction in donations and prompted Pope Francis to strip the office of its ability to manage the money.Five former Vatican officials, including Cardinal Angelo Becciu and two officials from the Secretariat of State, were indicted, as well as Italian businessmen who handled the London investment.Also indicted on alleged embezzlement charges was an Italian intelligence expert accused of buying luxury goods with Holy See money intended to help free Catholic priests and nuns held hostage by rebels in Africa.Vatican prosecutors accuse the main suspects of bilking millions of euros from the Holy See in fees and other losses related to financial investments that were funded in large part by donations to the pope for works of charity. The suspects have denied wrongdoing.One of the main suspects in the case, Italian broker Gianluigi Torzi, is accused of having extorted the Vatican out of 15 million euros to turn over ownership of the London building in late 2018. Torzi had been retained by the Vatican to help it acquire full ownership of the building from another indicted money manager who had handled the initial investment in 2013, but lost millions on what the Vatican said were speculative, imprudent deals.Vatican prosecutors allege Torzi inserted a last-minute clause into the contract giving him full voting rights in the deal.The Vatican hierarchy, however, signed off on the contract, with both the pope's No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his deputy approving it. Neither was indicted. In addition, Francis himself was aware of the deal and Torzi's involvement in it.Vatican prosecutors say the Vatican hierarchs were hoodwinked by Torzi and aided in part by an Italian lawyer — who was also indicted Saturday — into agreeing to the deal. The Secretariat of State intends to declare itself an injured party in the case.Torzi has denied the charges and said the accusations were the fruit of a misunderstanding. He is currently in London pending an extradition request by Italian authorities, who are seeking to prosecute him on other financial charges.His representatives said they had no immediate comment Saturday since they hadn't yet seen the indictment.Also indicted was a onetime papal contender and Holy See official, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, who helped engineer the initial London investment when he was the chief of staff in the Secretariat of State.Francis fired him as the Vatican’s saint-making chief last year, apparently in connection with a separate issue: his 100,000-euro donation of Holy See funds to a diocesan charity run by Becciu’s brother.Vatican News, the in-house media portal, said Becciu had originally not been part of the London investigation but was included after it appeared that he was behind the proposal to buy the building. Prosecutors also accuse him of interfering in the investigation.In a statement Saturday issued by his lawyers, Becciu insisted on the “absolute falsity"" of the accusations against him and denounced what he said was “unparalleled media pillory"" against him in the Italian press.""I am the victim of a plot hatched against me and I have been waiting for a long time to know any accusations against me, to allow myself to promptly deny them and prove to the world my absolute innocence,"" he said.Becciu has denied wrongdoing in the London investment; he has admitted he made the donation but insisted the money was for the charity, not his brother.One of Becciu’s proteges, Cecilia Marogna, was indicted on embezzlement charges. Becciu had hired Marogna as an external consultant after she reached out to him in 2015 with concerns about security at Vatican embassies in global hotspots. Becciu authorized hundreds of thousands of euros of Holy See funds to her to free Catholic hostages, according to WhatsApp messages reprinted by Italian media.Her Slovenian-based holding company, which received the funds, was among the four companies also ordered to stand trial.Marogna has said the money was compensation for legitimate security and intelligence work and reimbursements for her expenses. Vatican News, citing the indictment, said she spent the money on purchases that were incompatible with the humanitarian scope of her company.In a statement Saturday, her legal team said Marogna had been prepared for months to “provide a full accounting of her work and fears nothing about the accusations made against her.""Also indicted were the former top two officials in the Vatican’s financial watchdog agency, for alleged abuse of office. Prosecutors say that by failing to stop the Torzi deal, they performed a “decisive function"" in letting it play out, Vatican News said.The lawyer for the former office director, Tommaso di Ruzza, said he had only seen the Vatican press statement about the allegations but insisted that his client “has always acted in the most scrupulous respect of the law and his office duties, in the exclusive interest of the Holy See.""The former head of the office, Rene Bruelhart, defended his work and said his indictment was a “procedural blunder that will be immediately clarified by the organs of Vatican justice as soon as the defense will be able to exercise its rights."""
The Death of Faith in America,1.67,28.67,https://www.newsmax.com/michaelsavage/faith-michael-savage-america/2021/07/23/id/1029741/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.newsmax.com,"The following column is adapted from ""The Michael Savage Show"" podcast, available for download onSpotify,Apple Podcasts, and wherever podcasts are heard.Today, I am going to talk about the death of faith in America.This has a double meaning: The death of faith, per se, in America. And the death of “faith in America.”You could say the death of religion and we still have religion, but do we still have faith?I will talk about the differences between faith and religion, glimpses of God in things we see and do.I will talk about how Christianity seems to be dying while Islam is growing.I will discuss the crucifixion and what Christ means if you're not a Christian.I will talk about my early days, my travels to the South Pacific islands collecting medicinal plants, and how they had a deeper meaning than I may have known at the time. I discussed spirituality with the indigenous peoples of the South Pacific islands.All good religions teach “Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you.” There's not a religion on earth that does not teach that except one.The Jewish religion is the hardest to follow because it's complicated.I will discuss the meaning of the garden of Eden, and the land of nod. And I will tell you how religion and faith connects you to the power of the universe.Let me begin with this.We now have churches in America, let's call them the “United churches of the woke.”A friend of mine wrote and said, ""Michael, churches won't be destroyed or repurposed under the new communism as they were in Russia. Rather, communism is the new religion and the churches, their indoctrination facilities, are woke.""""The new Bible interpretation is really communist indoctrination. The plague spreads. It's a full on attack on every institution,"" the friend added. ""And we ask what is next? Evil knows no limits.""What began with Karl Marx and the Unitarian church is now infecting traditional churches as well.You have to go back to the schizophrenia of Christianity itself, faith versus good works, which is an ambiguity that goes all the way back to the disciples and early councils.Faith is about personal belief and a relationship with Jesus: confession and salvation. Good works is about living your life as the man Jesus supposedly did.Christianity was almost entirely faith-based for many centuries, but in the 20th century the faith interpretation took a beating from science.Darwin bashed creationism. Freud bashed religion as an illusion based on childish impulses.And then totalitarian regimes used science as leverage to gain control. As you know, Marx called faith “the opiate of the masses” and right now communists are burning churches, especially in Canada.In the 20th century, faith became unfashionable among Western intelligentsia.There were notable exceptions, such Albert Einstein, but even the Catholics got in on it with Vatican II.It was intended to update the church; they killed the Latin liturgy.And now the current Pope — whom I call “the bouncer” — is lecturing us on immigration and climate change.If you can believe this? A Pope lecturing us on immigration and climate change!At the middle of the 20th Century there was the advent of secular humanism, which filled the gap left behind by the death of faith. Remember the famous saying “Is God dead?”And then along came the thoroughly secular Unitarian church, the main front organization for secular humanism. ""Atheists with children.""Their tenets contain not even a hint of faith. Here they are from the Unitarian Universalist website:“The inherent worth and dignity of every person.”“Justice equity and compassion and human relations.”“Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations.”“A free and responsible search for truth and meaning.”“The right of conscience, the use of the democratic process within our congregations & society at large.”“A world community with peace, Liberty, and justice for all.”“Respect for the independent web of all existence in which we are all a part.”And then of course the tenet that drives it all is that poor people are good, and rich people are bad.This flows directly from the good works interpretation of Christianity.Jesus supposedly said to his disciples “Truly. I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again, I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. (Matthew 19: 21-24)And now, we arrive at a new place: the worship of technology.These days, everyone carries an iPhone.Everyone is an intelligentsia wannabe.Education: Everyone is supposed to be brainwashed in the college. Technology: Today is where the high priest is the high-tech guru.Faith is falling even more and more out of fashion than ever before.And so, what began with Karl Marx and the Unitarians is now infecting traditional churches.I will give you much more on faith and our search for meaning, on today’s Michael Savage podcast.A National Radio Hall of Fame recipient, Savage has hosted his radio show for more than 25 years and launched The Savage Nation Podcast in January of 2019 with one of the most successful podcast debuts.

Critical Race Theory's Chief Marketing Officer,15.33,31.33,https://www.newsmax.com/christopherrufo/critical-race-theory-crt-anti-racism-christopher-rufo/2021/07/23/id/1029723/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.newsmax.com,"This column was originally published onCity Journal.Ibram X. Kendi’s name is everywhere: public school curricula, corporate training programs, even the U.S. Navy’s official readinglist. The Boston University professor has become the latest star in the long tradition of racial activism.But despite his laudatory reception in the press, his philosophy would jeopardize the American system of individual rights and equality under the law—and is finally getting the scrutiny it deserves.Kendi’s rise to prominence was swift. He published a bestselling book,Stamped from the Beginning, in 2016, but after the death of George Floyd in 2020, Kendi’s subsequent book,How to Be An Antiracist, began selling an astonishing number of copies—including institutional sales to public schools, government agencies, and professional organizations, all seeking to understand the ongoing racial unrest.During the conflict, Kendi appeared constantly on television, delivered speeches to elite institutions, and positioned himself as the guru of America’s racial reckoning.But since the protests have died down, many Americans have realized that Kendi’s brand of “antiracism” is nothing more than a marketing-friendly recapitulation of the academic Left’s most pernicious ideas.While Kendi, born Ibram Henry Rogers, presents himself as a radical subversive, he is really an ideologist of elite opinion, subsidized heavily by America’s corporations and public institutions. Kendi’s work has been used and recommended by Fortune 100 companies, the federal bureaucracy, and the United States military—the very foundations of the power structure he claims to oppose.Kendi’s thesis—that if the races are equal, then racial disparities can owe only to racism and must be rectified through “antiracist discrimination”—is a simplistic reiteration of critical race theory’s core concepts.As journalist Aaron Sibarium hasdocumented, Kendi has borrowed ideas from critical race theory and translated them into a media-friendly narrative. “When I see racial disparities, I see racism,” Kendisays, excluding other explanations.His logic often descends into circularity: when asked to define the word “racism,” hetoldattendees at the Aspen Ideas Festival that it is “a collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity that are substantiated by racist ideas.”In another nod to 1960s-style radicalism, Kendi alsoclaimsto oppose capitalism. “The life of racism cannot be separated from the life of capitalism,” he says. “In order to truly be antiracist, you also have to truly be anti-capitalist.”But Kendi, like fellow traveler PatrisseCullorsof Black Lives Matter, is a prolific capitalist in his personal life.He charged Fairfax County schools $20,000 anhourfor a virtual presentation and has merchandised his entire line of ideas, releasing self-help products and even an “antiracist” baby book.He has accepted millions fromtechandpharmaceuticalcompanies on behalf of his Antiracism Center. Fighting against capitalism, as it turns out, is a lucrative enterprise.Posturing aside, Kendi’s actual proposals,from“defunding the police” to restricting free speech, are alarming. Kendi advocates race-based discrimination, arguing that “the only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination.”Heproposesa federal Department of Antiracism that would be unaccountable to voters or legislators, permanently funded, and granted the power to suppress “racist ideas” and veto, nullify, or abolish any law at any level of government not deemed “antiracist.”As Americans begin to consider his ideas more seriously, Kendi finds himself on the defensive.In recent months, he has released a series of touchy and short-tempered articles and statements, claimingthat“there is no debate about critical race theory” one moment, thendistancinghimself from critical race theory the next—notwithstanding that, only two weeks before, he hadclaimedthat critical race theory was “foundational” to his work.When he’s put on the spot, Kendi reverts to word games and deflection, rather than defending his position on substance.Perhaps that is because Kendi’s chief proposal—so-called “antiracist discrimination”—remains deeply unpopular.Despite the recent push toreplace equalitywith “equity,” Americans still support the system of individual freedom, equality under the law, and colorblind public policy.Even in deep-blueCaliforniaandWashingtonState, voters have recently rejected affirmative action at the ballot box, notwithstanding heavy support for those measures from multinational corporations and the Democratic establishment.Kendi fashions himself a revolutionary, but the masses oppose his ideas. Like many activists before him, he will likely be absorbed into the fabric of elite institutions—where supposedly radical ideas are cosseted into conventional wisdom.Christopher F.

John Bel Edward said. ""Indeed, Louisiana leads the nation in case growth, with 47 cases per capita.""""This should come as no surprise,"" he added, ""to anyone who has watched our case counts and hospitalizations continue to climb, and it necessitates additional guidance for how all people should stay safe in Louisiana right now, including wearing masks indoors, when unable to maintain social distancing, testing after suspected exposure even if they are vaccinated and, if possible, working remotely from home to limit exposure to groups.""The press release included guidelines that all residents should wear a mask regardless of their vaccination status.The governor touted the state already has ""the best tool"" to fight the virus, ""the COVID-19 vaccines."" Though the vaccination rate in Louisiana has increased, Edwards urged, ""we need even more people in our state to go sleeves up and take the COVID-19 vaccine.""""Increased vaccinations, when coupled with more masking, testing and distance, can get us out of the fourth surge, but only if people take action quickly,"" Edwards added.According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention data, 41% of Louisiana residents have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while only 36% are fully vaccinated.Dr. Joseph Kanter, a state health officer, stated, ""we are in a very dangerous surge right now.""""To ensure their own safety people in Louisiana should take precautions immediately,"" he added.

The biggest thing that they want canceled is they don't want you talking about the election that just took place because they say, 'holy sh*t, they caught us.'""Trump said the Democrats are more than moving to socialism with their massive spending and support for Marxists like Black Lives Matter.""We are at the beginning of a communist system,"" Trump said. ""Radicals are seizing power and destroying everything we hold dear as Americans, and it's happening, and I said it was going to happen.""They dismantled the rule of law, censor speech, take over the free press, imprison political opponents – you see that's happening all over; look at what I've been through for years – and, of course, hold fake phony elections.""It was recently revealed that during the hand recount in Fulton County [Georgia], Joe Biden had batches of ballots go for him: 100% for Biden, nothing for Trump. I got nothing. You get nothing. Give me a one vote. One vote.

""It's interesting that people on the right who support widespread gun rights don't want to see restrictions, but people on the other side don't want to see restrictions on abortion.His comments come after discussions on whether he thinks the Supreme Court will eventually overrule the Roe v. Wade abortion decision, and during talks about his opinions about a lawsuit from retailers in Connecticut who say a recent update to a statewide computer system is unduly delaying the sales of guns.""I think that in Connecticut, probably the Supreme Court if they take the case will say (they have) gone too far in restricting gun rights,"" said Dershowitz on the case going in that state.The Connecticut Citizens Defense League, which filed a lawsuit in 2020 after the state used the COVID pandemic to stop fingerprinting for gun sales, is back with a new lawsuit over gun sales, reports Hartford,Conn., CBS affiliate WFSB. A judge ordered that fingerprinting be immediately resumed, and the CCDL has returned to court over two new systems.The group says a new fingerprinting system isn't working because local police departments are having problems with the software and have not been trained on it. Another new rule requires retailers to call the state to get approval before selling a weapon, but the sellers say the call-in system is constantly offline.""I think the court will uphold background checks, but background checks are being used to stop people from exercising their constitutional right to buy the guns,"" said Dershowitz.""That's the problem. The state won't even do a background check and they can't sell the guns. It would be like the state saying you have to have an ID for voting and then refusing to give out IDs. If you're going to impose a restriction on a right, you have to make it easy to avoid that restriction. You cannot use the restriction as a way of undermining the right itself. That would be true of guns. That would be true of voting. That would be true of abortion.""Meanwhile, when it comes to abortion, Dershowitz said the Supreme Court does not have five votes to overturn Roe V. Wade, and hereiteratedthat he doesn't think Republicans will want that to happen anyway.""I'm not saying that the political considerations will come into play, but Roe v Wade has been a godsend for the Republican Party,"" said Dershowitz.

Just 12 percent of Republicans polled approve of the job he’s doing.Biden’s rating dipped 6 percentage points since June.The survey, taken July 6-21, found that 45 percent of adults disapprove of Biden’s performance and 5 percent don’t have an opinion.It comes as the price of food, appliances, cars and gasoline are on the rise and the highly contagious delta variant continues to spread in the U.S.Biden has also been working to get Congress to pass his $1.2 trillion infrastructure package, though Republicans voted Wednesday against advancing it as they draft final legislation.His $3.5 trillion spending plan to address climate change, childcare and healthcare, is also heavily opposed by the GOP.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has blasted the plan as ''wildly inappropriate'' and a ''left-wing dream of [Senate Budget Chairman] Bernie Sanders.''""It is a wild spending, taxing spree completely inappropriate for the country, which is already suffering from dramatic inflation right in line with what it was 40 years ago based on what they’ve already done on a single party-line vote earlier this year,"" McConnell said.""This is wildly inappropriate for the country — totally out of bounds for what ought to be done, and that’s why it will generate zero Republican support.""And hopefully, there will be a few brave Democrats who understand that running the country into the ground both with taxing and debt is not a good idea.''The poll is based on telephone interviews conducted July 6-21, 2021, with a random sample of 1,007 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

National Guard Cancels Training Sessions Lacking Congressional Reimbursement,2.0,44.33,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/military-congress-budget-money/2021/07/24/id/1029819/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.newsmax.com,"The National Guard is making good on its threat earlier this year to cancel summer training sessions unless Congress pays up for its deployment to Washington D.C., in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.A spokesman for the Guard toldThe Hillthat six training sessions of the Nebraska National Guard were canceled because it had not yet received reimbursement for the month’s long deployment earlier this year and said more sessions will likely be canceled.“There will likely be more things that would be canceled if the funding is not restored,” National Guard Spokesman Wayne Hall told The Hill Saturday.Thousands of Guard troops were called toWashington, D.C. after hundreds of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, trying to disrupt a joint session of Congress tallying the final Electoral College vote of the 2020 election.The number of troops shrank during the next several months to about 2,500 before they were cut loose in May.The cost for the deployment,$521 million, however, remains unpaid by Congress.""Without reimbursement funding, there is significant impact on National Guard readiness if we're not able to resolve this in a timely manner,"" U.S. Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement on July 17.Another event, a marksmanship training in August, has also been canceled, according to the article.""We just couldn't incur the cost,"" Maj. Scott Ingalsbe, spokesperson for the Nebraska National Guard, told CNN.According to National Guard officials, the canceled events are saving money from lodging and meals it provides to members during their weekend service.“I am proud of the 300 Nebraska Airmen and Soldiers who answered the call in January to secure our nation’s capital and ensure a peaceful transfer of power. Their regularly scheduled training and the correlated pay and benefits – modest paychecks families depend on to pay rent and put food on the table – should never be in doubt,” U.S. Maj. Gen. Daryl Bohac, Adjutant General of the Nebraska National Guard, said in a statement to The Hill.“While we have already cancelled or postponed several events to conserve resources, further loss of funding would be detrimental to our future readiness for federal missions or emergencies here in the state of Nebraska.”A bipartisan group of70 Congressmenare asking leadership to pass and distribute the funding soon.“Without immediate action, the brave volunteers of our National Guard will suffer, and the National Guard Bureau estimates its readiness will decrease by 15-20%, the group’s letter to the leadership said. “We urge you to swiftly come to an agreement on emergency appropriations that includes full reimbursement for the National Guard.”Senators from both parties who lead the Appropriations Committee said that they want to see the funds appropriated in August but could not say if they would also be distributed the same month, according to The Hill."
Sen. Portman on Infrastructure Debate Deadline: 'Don't Have Product Yet',3.0,43.0,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/portman-infrastructure-schumer/2021/07/18/id/1029022/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.newsmax.com,"Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Sunday a bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure package was being hammered out over the weekend, and pushed back at a Wednesday deadline from Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for a vote to begin debate on a bill.In an interview on CNN’s“State of the Union,”Portman said a premature vote would be meaningless.“We're still working on it. It's more important to get it right. We are still negotiating,” he said of efforts by a bipartisan group in which he’s involved.“Last night I was negotiating some of the final details with the White House and later [Sunday] we'll be having additional negotiations with the Republicans and Democrats who come together to put this bill into a track that's very unusual for Washington.”“People are used to legislation being on the Republican side or Democrat side,” he continued. “This is a little confusing for people because it's actually 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats putting this together. Chuck Schumer, with all due respect, is not writing bill. Nor is [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell [R-Ky.], by the way. So that's why we shouldn't have an arbitrary deadline of Wednesday. We should bring the legislation forward when it's ready.”Schumer’s aim for Wednesday to start a debate on an infrastructure package is a waste of time.“Start debate on what? We don't have a product yet,” he said, adding: “This is a complex bill that involves several committees, lot of very tough issues because we've got to resolve them between us first… We're moving as fast as we can.”But Portman was dismissive of a second Democrat-led $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, calling it a “strictly… partisan exercise more typical of Washington” — and asserted it’s not linked to the bipartisan $1.2 T infrastructure package.“Ours is unusual, and that's one reason you see this difference between what Sen. Schumer wants to do,” he said.“This is spending that will be spent not next year. It won't be spent for the most part until the next five to ten years or more, and it goes into long-term assets which may last 50, 70 years,”he pointed out.More importantly, he said, the packages “are not linked and cannot be linked.”“To President [Joe] Biden's credit, he has said they are not linked. They're totally separate,” he added. “Ours is a bipartisan process. Again it's about infrastructure only, which is a different kind of spending than what the Democrats are talking about. … Theirs is spending on new social programs and huge tax increases. No, I'm not for that. I think it's a terrible day for our economy coming out of the pandemic. I hope that they're not successful.”“Ours is on an entirely different track and everyone acknowledges that,” he declared.Related Stories:Fran Beyer is a writer with Newsmax and covers national politics."

Missouri City Using 'Trusted' Leaders To Dispel Vax Fears,0.0,44.33,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/missouri-covid-19-disinformation/2021/07/18/id/1029037/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.newsmax.com,"The mayor of Springfield, Mo., where COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed, said Sunday the spread of disinformation helped fuel the uptick and “trusted” community leaders and institutions are now working to persuade people to get vaccinated and bring the numbers down.In an interview on CBS News’“Face The Nation,”Springfield Mayor Ken McClure said social media has sped up the spread of bad information about vaccinations.“We are seeing a lot of spread through social media as people are talking about fears which they have — health related fears, what it might do to them later on in their lives, what might be contained in the vaccinations,” he said. “And that information is just incorrect. And I think we as a society and certainly in our community are being hurt by it.”Now, McClure said, the city has turned to its leaders to help spread the word that vaccines are safe.“We are a community of collaboration,” he said. “Nothing really of substance gets done in Springfield without a lot of people talking about it. And so, we're focusing on those trusted community leaders, those trusted community institutions. And we know that if it comes from the community and leaders of people trust that that helps…. we are working with so many entities to try to spread the word. And these are trusted sources. And I think that's a key to what we have to do to overcome this.”McClure added local pastors have also “been a great help through this.”According todatafrom the Springfield-Greene County health department on Sunday, 40.15% of the population is fully vaccinated — far short of the 70% goal. The number of fully vaccinated residents is 101,292, the data showed, with 116,640 partially vaccinated.“We had just this past week, for example, the latest numbers showing that we had the largest increase in our vaccination rate in several weeks,” McClure said. “And so I'm optimistic that that message is starting to take hold right now.”McClure said “community collaboration… is going to be the key to our success.”“We know what the solution is. It's vaccination,”he said.“People need to get it. It's readily available. We have so many sites that can provide that service. The age groups are now all encompassing down to age 12. So, it gets down to the community leaders, the community institutions that people trust, saying you have to get vaccination. That's the only way that we are going to emerge from this.The mayor said he believes the controversy over door-to-door knocks to get people to take the vaccine has been overblown — and misses the fact that in his city, that’s how public health works.“The whole discussion and going door to door has been overblown, I will tell you that public health has been using the …door to door philosophy for years,” he said. “It has been a tried-and-true practice which they use our Springfield Greene County Public Health Department is using it, has been using it for a long time. But the key is that these are trusted community people. We call them community advocates. So, it gets down to the people that community members will trust, the spreading information that is factual and trustworthy.”Fran Beyer |editorial.beyer@newsmax.comFran Beyer is a writer with Newsmax and covers national politics.Fran Beyer is a writer with Newsmax and covers national politics."
Lindsey Graham: 'I'd Leave' To Disrupt Quorum On Dem $3.5T Reconciliation Bill,18.33,32.67,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/graham-reconciliation-senate/2021/07/18/id/1029036/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.newsmax.com,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Sunday he would “leave town” to deny a voting quorum on a Democrat-led $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that would greenlight a “tax and spend dream of the socialist left.”In a fiery renunciation of President Joe Biden’s social spending plan on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” Graham said he would do what Texas Democrats did to avoid a vote on a controversial new voting law — skip out.“If for some reason they pass reconciliation, budget resolution to bring that bill to the floor of the United States Senate, the $3.5 trillion bill, you've got have a quorum to pass a bill in the Senate, I would leave before I would let that happen,” Graham vowed. “So to my Republican colleagues, we may learn something from our Democratic friends in Texas when it comes to avoiding a $3.5 trillion tax and spend package. Leave town.”More than 50 Texas lawmakers arrived in Washington last Monday after leaving their home state on a private charter flight. The numbers meant the House would not have enough lawmakers in attendance to conduct business and could not, at least for now, vote on an overhaul of election laws.The cross-country exodus was the second time that Democratic lawmakers have staged a walkout on the voting overhaul, a measure of their fierce opposition to proposals they say will make it harder for young people, people of color and people with disabilities to vote.“Hell yeah, I would leave,” Graham said of how he’d handle the reconciliation vote in the Senate. “I would use everything in my toolbox. It's got nothing to do with infrastructure. It's a tax and spend dream of the socialist left.”“If it takes me not showing up to stop that, I will do it because if we pass that bill, you're going to have inflation through the roof and if they put legalizing illegal immigrants in that bill, you're going to have a complete run on the border,” he asserted. “It will be throwing jet fuel on a fire, called illegal immigration. It would lead to an invasion of illegal immigrants if we put amnesty in the $3.5 trillion bill so I would do anything I could to stop that.”According to Graham, Senate Democrats “don’t want to work with us,” and President Joe Biden’s tenure so far has been “disappointing.”“I was part of a bipartisan group that passed a comprehensive immigration bill and we spent $40 billion to secure the border,” he recounted, “[Sen. Charles] Schumer [D.N.Y.} and [Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick] Durbin voted for a $40 billion border security bill that built walls, did away with catch and release.”“To my Democratic colleagues, if you want to provide legal status for the DACA population, I will work with you. I want you to finish the wall which needs to be finished, and end catch and release for the asylum seekers which will shut off a wave of illegal immigration and I will vote for DACA legalization,” he vowed.But, Graham said, securing the border is “dead and buried and replaced by the party of open borders.”“If you voted for Joe Biden, thinking he would be a moderate voice and would have led us to a centrist agenda, you've got to be sorely disappointed because there's nothing moderate about the Biden administration,” Graham asserted.Graham also derided Biden’s criticism of new voting laws in some states.“He's trying to change the subject because he can't talk about his policies,” Graham charged. “His policies are failing at the border, rampant inflation, you can't walk out in the streets without worrying about getting shot or your child kidnapped, radical Islam is on the rise.“He can't talk about policy because he's failed on the policy front so he's trying to make all of us racist as Republicans. … Demagoguery. It's offensive to me. What he's saying is a lie. He's trying to change the subject to try to talk about anything but his failed presidency. We're coming back in 2022 and I hope to God [former] President [Donald] Trump runs in 2024.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.Related Stories:Fran Beyer is a writer with Newsmax and covers national politics."

Intergovernmentel Panel on Climate Change published their latest report. As usual, it is full of dire doomsday predictions, bare in facts, but full of computer-programmed assumptions.It supposedly reflects the unanimous consent of all involved government salaried so-called scientists. Yet, they denounce those brave souls who dare to say that reducing CO2 kills trees and is wasteful.Incidentally, don’t you ever believe that all scientists are honest and their opinions can’t be bought especially if the pressure to satisfy the politics of their own government is involved.A present example is the current “mask” debacle of the COVID pandemic. Here physicians draping their mantel as scientists gladly mouthpiece their president's opinion no matter how absurd and contradictory it may be.Now, a no less reputable publication as The Wall Street Journal in their opinion page of August 10 had the courage and dare criticize the UN report. I more correctly labeled the paper a political document intended to give friendly politicians arguments to spend even more trillion of dollars on so-called GREEN projects resulting, for example, on the lack of enough electricity in Texas and California.After having killed the coal business, their next goal is to go after natural gas. All this, because since about 1850, the earth has warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius, and it warmed barely 0.1 degrees since 2013 (according to the last “estimate”).I wonder who in 1850 was able to travel around the world and measure the temperature at exactly 12 noon (to be consistant).Even the former bugaboo of the melting of the Arctic sea ice now has only “low confidence”.(meaning we don’t know). The words “low confidence” and “best estimate” are used throughout their report (to play it safe in case later facts may contradict their prognosis.)One of the predictions rating “higher certainty” was that major storms, such as hurricanes, will appear more frequently. I live in southern Florida and have seen major hurricanes in 1992, 2005 and 2017. Pretty consistently every 12 years. No acceleration here.Yet something good came out of this report: The scientists agreed, to include ancient trees and ice samples in their evaluations. These, incidentally show that during the past 219,000 years the world temperature alternated between -6 and plus 0.7 degrees Celsius from an average temperature.I like to remind my readers that I survived the following doomsday predictions during my lifetime: In 1960, the coming of the ice age. In 1970, all trees were dying due to acid rain. In 1980, we would die from sunburns due to lack of ozone in the atmosphere.All these predictions were based on unanimous scientific support. Now, after December 1997, global warming became the vital issue. I wonder what comes next?Dr. Hans Baumann, a former Corporate Vice President and founder of his company, is a well known inventor, economist, and author having published books on scientific, economic, and historical subjects.

Fed Has a Sunny View of Inflation While Companies See the Clouds,4.67,45.0,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/bon-business-cos-fin/2021/07/18/id/1029042/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.newsmax.com,"The Federal Reserve may be downplaying the risk of lingering inflation, but those with arguably the best vantage point -- the companies themselves -- are taking a less optimistic view of rising prices.Just last week, Conagra Brands Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. signaled that higher input costs will be more than a blip. Instead, they expect everything from raw ingredients to labor to remain substantially more expensive in coming months.“I’m not going to assume it’s going to be transitory,” PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston in an interview on Bloomberg TV on July 13. “It’s going to be with us through the better part of next year.”If these forecasts are accurate, equity investors will eventually have to reckon with a sustained inflationary environment. They’ve been complacent so far, which has contributed to a rally in technology stocks and other groups with higher valuations that do well when Treasury yields fall. But that can change quickly if inflation remains elevated and yields climb, according to Michael Darda, chief economist and market strategist at MKM in Stamford, Connecticut.“We see risk building in these sectors which would be vulnerable to a reversal in real rates or a rise in inflation expectations,” he wrote in a research note on July 14.Soothing MarketsReassurances from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that rising costs remain manageable helped soothe markets last week, particularly after a July 13 report showed the consumer price index rose the most since 2008 last month.The yield on 10-year Treasuries tumbled from roughly 1.42% on July 13 to below 1.30% on July 16. The S&P 500 Index slid 1% but remained within spitting distance of the record high reached earlier this month. And megacap technology stocks like Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. extended their recent rallies despite the broader decline in equities.Meanwhile, inflation and the ability of companies to pass on costs to customers has emerged as one of the biggest themes this earnings season. The word inflation was mentioned on 87% of the earnings conference calls by S&P 500 companies tracked by Bloomberg this month, compared with 33% in the same period a year ago.On Conagra’s July 13 call, inflation was mentioned 49 times. The maker of Vlasic pickles and Slim Jim snacks saw its shares sink after it cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year because it expects higher input costs to weigh on margins. Two analysts reduced their ratings on the stock, which fell 3.5%, its biggest weekly decline in a month.PepsiCo fared better, as investors cheered its profit and revenue growth forecasts despite the inflation warnings. Johnston, the company’s CFO, said customers are willing to pay more for its products, which helps offset higher input costs. The stock rallied 4.2% for its best week since March, and it closed at a record on Friday.Banks Are AlrightOf course, there are plenty of executives that think fears of runaway inflation are overblown. On JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s earnings call last week, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told analysts that inflation may be worse than the Fed anticipates but “it won’t make any difference” if jobs are plentiful and growth remains strong. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group chief David Solomon said he expects the pressures from inflation to be transitory and that “any resulting risks could be adequately managed.” The KBW Bank Index fell 2.4% on the week, the biggest decline in a month.That said, these more optimistic views aren’t particularly surprising since financial firms are expected to do well if inflation spikes.“Some level of inflation is absolutely absorbable and potentially, to the extent there’s higher interest rates, would be positive” for banks, said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan.The ability to counteract the effects of inflation will likely be at the top of investors’ minds this week when Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. report earnings.“The economy was very strong in the second quarter, so I expect most companies will be able to beat on the bottom line if not on the top line as well,” said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Co. “It’s going to be all about whether they can pass along price increases.”"
G-20 Finance Ministers Back Deterring Use of Tax Havens,1.33,43.0,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/italy-g20-finance-ministers/2021/07/10/id/1028154/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.newsmax.com,"Top finance officials representing most of the world's economy have backed a sweeping revision of international taxation that includes a 15% global minimum corporate levy to deter big companies from resorting to low-rate tax havens.Finance ministers from the Group of 20 countries endorsed the plan at a meeting Saturday in Venice.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the proposal would end a “self-defeating international tax competition” in which countries have for years lowered their rates to attract companies. She said that had been “a race that nobody has won. What it has done instead is to deprive us of the resources we need to invest in our people, our workforces, our infrastructure.”The next steps include more work on key details at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and then a final decision at the Group of 20 meeting of presidents and prime ministers on Oct. 30-31 in Rome. Italy hosted the finance minister's meeting in Venice because it holds the rotating chair of the G-20, which makes up more than 80% of the world economy.Implementation, expected as early as 2023, would depend on action at the national level. Countries would enact the minimum tax requirement into their own laws. Other parts could require a formal treaty. The draft proposal was approved July 1 in talks among more than 130 countries convened by the OECD.The U.S. already has a minimum tax on overseas earnings, but President Joe Biden has proposed roughly doubling the rate to 21%, which would more than comply with the proposed global minimum. Raising the rate is part of a broader proposal to fund Biden's jobs and infrastructure plan by raising the domestic corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.Yellen said she was “very optimistic” that Biden’s infrastructure and tax legislation “will include what we need for the United States to come into compliance” with the minimum tax proposal.Republicans in the Congress have expressed opposition to the measure. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, has blasted the OECD deal, saying, “This is an economic surrender to China, Europe and the world that Congress will reject.”The international tax proposal aims to deter the world's biggest firms from using accounting and legal schemes to shift their profits to countries where little or no tax is due — and where the company may do little or no actual business. Under the minimum, companies that escape taxes abroad would pay them at home. That would eliminate incentives for using tax havens or for setting them up.From 2000-2018, U.S. companies booked half of all foreign profits in seven low-tax jurisdictions: Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore and Switzerland.A second part of the tax plan is to permit countries to tax a portion of the profits of companies that earn profits without a physical presence, such as through online retailing or digital advertising.That part arose after France, followed by other countries, imposed a digital service tax on U.S. tech giants such as Amazon and Google. The U.S. government regards those national taxes as unfair trade practices and is holding out the threat of retaliation against those countries' imports into the U.S. through higher import taxes.Under the tax deal, those countries would have to drop or refrain from national taxes in favor of a single global approach, in theory ending the trade disputes with the U.S.U.S. tech companies would then face only the one tax regime, instead of a multitude of different national digital taxes."
We Need Help': Haiti's Interim Leader Requests US Troops,0.0,43.33,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/haiti-president-killed/2021/07/10/id/1028149/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.newsmax.com,"Haiti’s interim government has asked the U.S. and U.N. to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries to stabilize the country and prepare for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination.Amid the confusion, hundreds of Haitians gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince pleading for a way out of the country. Women carried babies and young men waved passports and ID cards as they cried out, “Refuge!” and “Help!”“We definitely need assistance and we’ve asked our international partners for help,” Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. “We believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving the situation.”The stunning request for U.S. military support recalled the tumult following Haiti’s last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation — which lasted nearly two decades — as a way to avert anarchy.The request was received but there has been no decision, according to a US official familiar, speaking on condition of anonymity because not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But the Biden administration has so far given no indication it will provide military assistance.For now, it only plans to send FBI officials to help investigate a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutional standoff.Haiti also sent a letter to the United Nations requesting assistance, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Saturday. The letter asked for troops and security at key installations, according to a U.N. source speaking on condition of anonymity because details of the letter are private.On Friday, a group of lawmakers announced they had recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti’s dismantled senate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government’s authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Moïse had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government.One of those lawmakers, Rosemond Pradel, told the AP that Joseph “is neither qualified nor has the legal right” to lead the country.Joseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Moïse’s murder for political gain.“I’m not interested in a power struggle,” said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. “There’s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that’s through elections.”Meanwhile, more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of an murky, international conspiracy: a shootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy, a private security firm operating out of a warehouse in Miami and a cameo sighting of a Hollywood star.Among those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed more than a dozen former members of Colombia’s military.Some of the suspects were seized in a raid on Taiwan’s Embassy where they are believed to have sought refuge. National Police Chief Léon Charles said another eight suspects were still at large and being sought.The attack, which took place at Moïse’s home before dawn Wednesday, also seriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami for surgery. She issued a statement Saturday implying the president was killed for trying to develop the country. “The mercenaries who assassinated the president are currently behind bars,” she said in Creole, “but other mercenaries currently want to kill his dream, his vision, his ideology.”Colombian officials said the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. U.S.-trained Colombian soldiers are often recruited by security firms and mercenary armies in conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and drug cartels.The sister of one of the dead suspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP that she last spoke to her brother late Wednesday — hours after Moïse’s murder — when the men, holed up in a home and surrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of a shootout.“He told me not to tell our mother, so she wouldn’t worry,” said Yenny Capador, fighting back tears.It’s not known who masterminded the attack. And questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president’s residence posing as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president.Capador said her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank of sergeant, was hired by a private security firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti.Capador said she knew almost nothing about the employer but shared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security — a company based in Doral, a Miami suburb popular with Colombian migrants.The wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia’s W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month — a paltry sum for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, noncommissioned officers and professional soldiers, earned from their pensions.Uribe is under investigation in the alleged murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 who was presented as someone killed in combat, one of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia’s U.S.-trained army more than a decade ago.CTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated with several other Florida-registered entities, some since dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp.CTU’s website lists two addresses, one of which is a gray-colored warehouse that was shuttered Friday with no sign indicating who it belonged to. The other is a small suite under a different company’s name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionist said Intriago stops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an email seeking comment.“We are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened, so that my brother’s reputation does not remain like it is,” said Capador. “He was a humble, hard-working man. He had honors and decorations.""Besides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans.Investigative Judge Clément Noël told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noël said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday.Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his Haitian hometown of Jacmel.He worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organization set up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His now-deactivated Facebook page features photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag.Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages doesn’t have any military training and doesn’t believe he was involved in the killing.Joseph refused to specify who was behind the attack, but said that Moïse had earned numerous enemies while attacking oligarchs who for years profited from overly generous state contracts.Some of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate President Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged.Analysts say whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. The growing power of gangs displaced more than 14,700 people in Haiti last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.“This country has nothing to offer,” said 36-year-old Thermidor Joam, one of those thronged outside the U.S. Embassy on Friday. “If the president can be killed with his own security, I have no protection whatsoever if someone wants to kill me.”Prosecutors also want to interrogate members of Moïse’s security detail, including the president’s security coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri Hérard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.“If you are responsible for the president’s security, where have you been?,” Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. “What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?”"

Do not allow tax increases. Thinking about it, I have never seen anything so easy to win politically.”Thebipartisan Senate dealannounced last month by President Joe Biden includes some existing infrastructure programs, as well as $579 billion in new money over eight years to patch highways, rebuild bridges, speed rail traffic and more spread broadband internet access. The plan also calls for spending billions of dollars into coastlines and waterways washing away because of rising sea levels and $7.5 billion into financing a half-million electric vehicle charging stations.Republicans are insisting that the legislation not be funded by pulling back tax cuts Trump enacted in 2017.A bill could come onto the Senate floor for a vote as soon as July 19, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she won't bring the measure up in the House unless the Senate passes a $6 trillion bill through the reconciliation process.However, there are House members already endorsing the bipartisan Senate bill, including the House Problem Solvers caucus, whichsaid in a statementthat the Senate bill is ""closely aligned with our own 'Building Bridges' proposal released last month.""Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he thought “there’s a decent chance” for a bipartisan bill to come together, but told the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce that he wants the measure to be paid for, because ""we've added quite enough to the national debt.""However, earlier in the week, the Kentucky Republican warned that his party will wage ""one hell of a fight"" if Democrats try to pass the bill along party lines.""This is going to be a hell of a fight over what this country ought to look like in the future, and it's going to unfold here in the next few weeks,"" McConnell said.

"Teachers, Activists Prepare to Battle Conservatives in Court on 'Institutional Racism'",6.0,40.33,https://www.newsmax.com/us/education-racism-critical-race-theory-activists/2021/07/10/id/1028161/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.newsmax.com,"Courtrooms and local school board meetings are setting up as the battleground for a major cultural conflict between conservatives, parents, teachers, and social justice activists on controversial critical race theory.According to theBritanica website, critical race theory is an ""intellectual movement and loosely organized framework of legal analysis based on the premise that race is not a natural, biologically grounded feature of physically distinct subgroups of human beings but a socially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of color.""Although it has been a staple of law schools since the 1970s, the theory has come to the education mainstream due to changes in the way some view gender and items like The New York Times ""1619 Project,"" which claims the country's founding was based more in the slave trade and ""white supremacy"" more than an effort to create an egalitarian society.Educators and the unions that represent them argue these ""darker"" moments of American history have been whitewashed in the past and need to be taught to present the most accurate picture of the country.Opponents, including conservatives and newly formed parent organizations, say the material is too divisive and ends up indoctrinating children to a more far left-wing view of America.Suburban districts, like Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia, have gainednationalprominence following contentious board of education meetings with advocates on both sides speaking out.Parents and others are seeking the recall of board members for absorbing the controversial theory into the district's policies and curriculum, while the board denies it is teaching the theory to students.Several statesare currently considering legislation to ban teaching the theory or its application in classrooms throughout the country.Recently, American Federation of Teachers Union President Randi Weingarten compared the battle to the1925 ""Scopes Trial""where a teacher was tried for teaching evolution to students in Tennessee.""We're looking at court actions because these laws conflict with standards and our licensure requirements and our professional obligations,"" Weingarten, leader of the country's second largest teacher's union, said.She denied members of her union are teaching the theory.""Let's be clear: critical race theory is not taught in elementary schools or high schools,"" she said. ""It's a method of examination taught in law school and college that helps analyze whether systemic racism exists — and whether it has an effect on law and public policy. But culture warriors are labeling any discussion of race, racism or discrimination as CRT to try to make it toxic. They are bullying teachers and trying to stop us from teaching students accurate history.""Delegates from the largest union, the National Education Association, said they would expand teaching ""anti-racism and diversity"" in classrooms, and said it has set aside several million dollars to defend members in court for teaching ""accurate"" history.It is also asking members to ""fight back"" against the anti-critical race theory movement, saying in a statement that ""it is reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed"" by critical race theory."

Biden's Antitrust Legislation Starts Battle With BigTech,7.67,43.0,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/whitehouse-joebiden-bigtech-antitrust/2021/07/10/id/1028168/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.newsmax.com,"On Friday, President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order aimed at reining in big tech companies that could fundamentally alter how they do business.But the responsibility to enforce the order will fall on government agencies, but implementing the practices from the order could take them years.The Federal Trade Commission, which already has big tech in its sights, is expected to be a likely battleground.  But some observers are doubtful the FTC, which the bulk of the responsibility for the order falls to, can enact meaningfully change due to an era of deregulation the agency underwent during the 1970s and 1980s.Since the advent of mainstream internet use, the agency has struggled to keep up with unfair practices online, especially in areas regarding user privacy, big data, and tech mergers.Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association that holds Apple Inc., Facebook, and Google as its members, defended the tech community as a vibrant and competitive industry.""Elements of this executive order threaten our global leadership and hard-won success,"" he said, according toThe Wall Street Journal. ""Prohibiting these acquisitions will dry up venture capital, harm entrepreneurs and small businesses and make our economy less competitive.""Democrat FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter tweetedin response to theWhite House's fact sheeton the ""anticompetitive"" executive order.""So excited about @POTUS's EO on competition,"" she said, ""it is an ambitious agenda that will help our markets work better and create a more equitable economy for all people - esp workers, marginalized communities, entrepreneurs, small biz.""One of the most significant parts of the order would encourage the FTC to establish new rules for online surveillance and the accumulation of user's private data, which could massively impact big platform companies.According to the White House fact sheet, ""many of the large platforms' business models have depended on the accumulation of [extraordinary] amounts of sensitive personal information and related data."" The order would also push for the FTC to bar ""unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces.""Though the White House didn't point to any companies, in particular, it did cite that one of the practices internet retail companies use is to ""see how small businesses' products sell and then use the data to launch their own competing products,"" followed by ""display[ing] their own copycat products more prominently than the small businesses' products.""This, according to the White House fact sheet, would be barred by the FTC.Proposed deals under the new order, including mergers and acquiring companies would now undergo more scrutiny. For the last decade, the White House said, “the largest tech platforms have acquired hundreds of companies — including alleged ‘killer acquisitions’ meant to shut down a potential competitive threat.”FTC Chair Lina Khan and the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Richard A. Powers, released a joint statement, reading, ""We plan soon to jointly launch a review of our merger guidelines with the goal of updating them to reflect a rigorous analytical approach consistent with applicable law.”"
Democrats Blame GOP for Democrat-Invented Defund-the-Police Efforts,16.33,26.33,https://www.newsmax.com/murdock/democrats-defund-police/2021/07/02/id/1027291/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,www.newsmax.com,"As violent crime surges from coast to coast, Democrats could do one of two things about their defund-the-police initiatives that are propelling this mayhem. They could defend their efforts and say, in essence,Who cares about the burgeoning carnage? We want social justice, the blood of innocents be damned.Or they could apologize:We blew it! Our soft-headed ideas were gunned down by reality. Sorry!Instead, Democrats are performing a political trifecta of hypocrisy, deceit, and psychological projection:Democrats didn’t defund the police. Republicans did.Lying Democrats now blame Republicans for defunding police and, presumably, unleashing the ensuing epidemic of lawlessness.Their “proof?” Republicans opposed Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that provided $350 billion in aid to states, cities, and tribes. Nowhere does this 242-page bill mention “police” or “law enforcement.” This legislation lets “public safety officers” participate in an $80 million allotment for “mental health and substance use disorder training.” Also, “public safety” is among the purposes of a $772.5 million outlay to Tribal governments.Now,post facto, Biden encourages states and cities to spend some of this $350 billion on police. If Biden told them tomorrow to dedicate this sum to food for orphans, he could slam Republicans for “starving orphans to death.”This massive, filthy lie is refuted easily by Democrats’ pro-defunding comments and the defunding perpetrated in Democrat-run cities after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd beneath the knee of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin.•Last July 8, activist Ady Barkan asked candidate Joe Biden in a virtual interview, “But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?” away from police.“Yes, absolutely,” Biden said from his Delaware bunker.•ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos asked candidate Kamala Harris on June 9, 2020 if she supported Mayor Eric Garcetti’s, D-Los Angeles, plan to “take some of the money from policing, about $150 million, invest it in health initiatives, training initiatives for youth.”Harris replied: “I applaud Eric Garcettifor doing what he’s done.”•Vanita Gupta, now Biden’s associate attorney general, said on June 16, 2020, that officials should “decrease police budgetsand the scope, role, and responsibility of police in our lives.”•Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., told a rally on June 7, 2020: “Not only do we need to disinvest from the police, but we need tocompletely dismantlethe Minneapolis Police Department.”•“Defunding police meansdefunding police,” Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,  D-N.Y., said on June 30, 2020. “It does not mean budget tricks or funny math.”Atop these and many more pro-defunding comments by the Democrat-Left, leaders in Democrat-run cities defunded their police departments. Among numerous such actions, consider these:•Portland, Oregon’s City Commission voted 3-1 on June 17, 2020 todefund $15 millionfrom its police budget, nixing 84 positions.According to theNational Fraternal Order of Police, Portland’s homicides soared 800% through May 25, 2021 versus that date last year.•The Washington, D.C. City Council’s Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety voted unanimously on June 25, 2020 todefund $15 million from the Metropolitan Police Departmentand shift that sum to social programs. Homicides up 35%.•The Los Angeles City Council voted 12-2 on July 1, 2020 todefund the LAPD by $150 million. Homicides up 27%.•The New York City Council that day voted 32-17 todefund the NYPD by $1 billion. Homicides up 22%.•The Minneapolis City Council voted 7-6 last December 10 todefund its police department by $8 millionand spend that sum on other services. Homicides up 56%.Beyond defunding, Democrats demonized police as trigger-happy racists who shoot Blacks for sport. This has fueled resignations, retirements, and a “don’t get involved” attitude by cops in metaphorical handcuffs.Rather than make jackasses of themselves by baselessly pinning their tails on elephants, Democrats simply should apologize for their massive defunding debacle and beg for the American people’s forgiveness.Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News Contributor, a contributing editor with National Review Online, and a senior fellow with theLondon Center for Policy Research.Bucknell University’s Michael Malarkey contributed research to this opinion piece."
Sen. Cruz: Flagging COVID Misinformation by Biden Admin For FB Removal Is 'Collusion',17.33,28.33,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/cruz-misinformation-facebook-first-amendment/2021/07/18/id/1029031/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.newsmax.com,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Sunday blasted the Biden administration for flagging content for Facebook to remove as misinformation, calling it blatant “collusion.”In an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” Cruz railed about a news conference last week in which White House press secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged the Office of the Surgeon General has upped it’s social media tracking of “disinformation” on COVID-19.“It was undoubtedly collusion,” Cruz said.“It is amazing.. … It makes clear that everything we thought about the Biden  administration, about their willingness to trample on free speech, to trample on the Constitution, to use government power to silence you, everything we feared they might do, they are doing and worse. And I think [former] President [Donald] Trump’s lawsuit [against Big Tech] got much, much stronger.”The Surgeon General's office issued a new report Wednesday titled, ""Confronting Health Misinformation,"" that makes recommendations for social media platforms to ""impose clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies,” Real Clear Politicsreported.And at a news conference the next day, Psaki admitted Facebook would be involved.""We're flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation. We're working with doctors and medical experts…who are popular with their audience with accurate information,"" she said. ""So, we're helping get trusted content out there.""During the same briefing, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said misinformation is a public health threat.“Today, we live in a world where misinformation poses an imminent and insidious threat to our nation’s health,” Murthy said, Voxreported, adding that “modern technology companies” have allowed misinformation and disinformation to spread across their platforms “with little accountability.”But Cruz argued the effort is no different than what is done in communist countries.“I got to say, it's the same thing you see happening in a communist country like China and a communist country like Cuba, where if there are facts that are contrary to the government … they prevent you from sharing the facts,” he said.“They're doing the same thing in the United States. It's a frightening threat not just for free speech but for the ability for the American people to learn the truth on a host of issues.”Cruz said he expects Trump’s lawsuit will be challenged — and prevail.“The challenge his lawsuit faces is the following,” Cruz explained, “The First Amendment applies only to government action. The first words of the First Amendment are ‘Congress shall make no law,’ So it applies to the federal government. It has since been incorporated and applied against the state government and so the argument that a lot of the talking heads put out immediately after … Trump filed his lawsuit is they said, well, Facebook is not the government. Twitter is not the government so this lawsuit will get thrown out.”But Cruz argued: “The Supreme Court has long recognized a line of cases that when government uses a private company as a tool, as an arm to implement a government policy — and in this instance when government explicitly asks a private monopoly to censor the following speech that we disagree with — that that private company can be treated as a state actor.”“Nobody in their right mind would argue that a private organization behaving essentially as stormtroopers, trying to confiscate guns, nobody would argue that that's not state action, that that doesn't violate the Second Amendment,” he said. “What the Biden administration is doing with Facebook, Twitter and Google is the same thing. They're going to monopolies and saying ‘you are our tool to censor views we disagree with.’”Cruz referenced the case of the origins of the coronavirus, as a case of censorship on a topic that now appears to have gained credibility.“For months they were censoring where the virus originated…. censorship has been over and over again, silencing things that are true,” he railed. “They banned, for example, any arguments that the coronavirus originated in a Chinese government lab in Wuhan, China. It now appears the overwhelming weight of the evidence suggests that's in fact where it originated, in a Chinese government lab.”Cruz also lamented the Democratic Party of becoming “structurally” pro-China .“The Democratic Party today is funded by — their biggest funders are Big Tech and Big Tech is in bed with the Chinese communists,” he said. “Among the biggest funders of the Democratic Party are the giant corporations and many of the giant corporations, the Fortune 50 and Fortune 100 are in bed with the Chinese communists.”Related Stories:Fran Beyer is a writer with Newsmax and covers national politics."

He said Biden could easily convince Democrat moderates like West Virginia Senator Joe Machin to get behind a tailored ""carveout,"" which would only change the filibuster toward legislation directly tied to constitutional rights.""Pick up the phone and tellJoe Manchin, 'Hey, we should do a carveout.' I don't care whether he does it in a microphone or on the telephone — just do it,"" Clyburn said to Politico.Biden has so far publicly expressed little interest in changing the legislative filibuster in order to pass Democrats' massive election reform bill as well as a second piece of legislation that reauthorizes sections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But Clyburn said Biden ""should endorse"" a legislative carveout immediately, particularly after a recent 6-3Supreme Courtruling that upheld GOP-backed voter restriction laws in Arizona.On Friday, White House Press SecretaryJen Psakisaid that Biden's upcoming Tuesday speech in Philadelphia is set to address voting rights as a ""moral obligation,"" rather than a simple legislative consideration.Clyburn also told Politico that he tried talking with Manchin last month as the Democratic senator and crucial swing vote was proposing changes to the the election reform bill. Clyburn said he told Manchin at the time: ""I'm not asking you to eliminate the filibuster ... But what I'm saying to you is that nobody ought to have the right to filibuster my constitutional rights.""Some top Democrats, including Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, have likened state-by-state GOP voter suppression bills to aggressive forms of ""white supremacy."" Casey saidRepublicansacross the country are are creating more hurdles for mail-in voting or early voting under the guise of ""phantom voter fraud.""Harvard University law professor and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe appeared to agree with Clyburn's tactic to circumvent Senate Republicans, tweeting Saturday: ""This is the solution: Enact a carveout for laws protecting constitutional rights.""Meanwhile, dozens of states have recently passed GOP-backed voter suppression laws that are being pushed through state legislatures almost purely on party-line Republican votes. The six Supreme Court justices who recently upheld the Arizona voter restrictions were all appointed by a Republican Party president.Newsweekreached out to Clyburn's office Saturday for any additional remarks about the filibuster.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."

She spoke to Kansas City's news channelFox4 WDAF-TV about her daughter's death and vaccine hesitancyin an interviewbroadcast this week.""She was afraid of the side effects, I think. You hear a lot of horror stories. I, myself, when I had the shot, it was rough, so it scared her and freaked her out. So she didn't want to do it. I couldn't convince her,"" Carmichael told the Missouri news channel.Jones, who resided in Grain Valley, was a mother of two, including her 18-year-old daughter Adriana, who just graduated from high school. The teen told Fox 4 that her mother was her ""best friend.""""There were so many days where I would just stand there next to my mom and say, 'Wake up, mama, wake up.' She would never wake up, and I just wish that she would. I don't think anyone should have to go through what we went through. Especially with the variant,"" the daughter said.Carmichael urged everyone to take the pandemic seriously and get vaccinated. ""Please take this seriously. You don't want to see a family member you love go through this,"" she said.Jones was reportedly hospitalized on May 9. She was then placed on a ventilator and died on June 9.""After she got it, she said, 'Mom you were right, about the shot, about masks, being diligent and all that.' I was like, 'I don't want to be right. I want you to be well. That's all that matters,'"" Carmichael said.Missouri continues to have one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., ranking above just 11 other states, according to aNew York Timestracker. Just under 56 percent of the state's adult residents have received at least one shot of the vaccine while just under 49 percent are fully vaccinated.

SomeRepublicansstrongly oppose the former president seeking elected office in the future, while others remain supportive of Trump but fear he could hurt the GOP in down-ballot races in more moderate districts. Meanwhile, most Republican voters appear supportive of him seeking the White House again.""Donald J. Trump is running again in 2024, there's absolutely no doubt about that,"" Bannon said inan interviewwith Newsmax on Friday. He then took aim atindictments againstthe former president's business—the Trump Organization—in New York. Bannon argued that these were politically motivated to ""try to stop him.""""They're not gonna stop him. This is only going to make the MAGA movement more determined,"" the former Trump administration official said. Bannon went on to say that ""the MAGA movement, the America First movement is more engaged, more energized.""Bannon's remarks came after Trump suggested on Wednesday that he planned to run again in 2024.During a Fox News town hall, right-wing opinion hostSean Hannityasked the former president: ""Without giving the answer what the answer is, have you made up your mind [about 2024]?""""Yes,"" Trump replied.""It's not that I want to,"" Trump added later. ""The country needs it. We have to take care of this country. It isn't fun, fighting constantly, fighting always.""Polling conductedby Quinnipiac University from May 18 to 24 found that two-thirds (66 percent) of Republicans would like to see Trump run for president again. Just 30 percent said they were against the idea. An even greater majority (85 percent) of GOP voters said that they wanted Republican candidates for elected office to agree with Trump on policy issues. However, the polling showed that two-thirds (66 percent) of Americans overall do not want the former president to seek the White House again.Trump and his alliescontinue to falsely claimthat PresidentJoe Bidenwon the 2020 election through widespread voter fraud. These extraordinary allegations have been thoroughly litigated and wholly debunked, but many GOP voters appear to still believe the lies. The recent Quinnipiac poll found that two-thirds of Republicans believe that Biden's win was not legitimate, while just a quarter (25 percent) believe the president actually won.Bannon served as the chief executive of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and went on to work as the former president's chief strategist and senior counselor in the White House from January 2017 to August 2017.

Gretchen Whitmer Says Kamala Harris Is Unfairly Treated Because of Race and Gender,-7.0,34.67,https://www.newsweek.com/gretchen-whitmer-says-kamala-harris-unfairly-treated-because-race-gender-1607748,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,www.newsweek.com,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer says she's been in a pensive mood lately, having spent recent days writing a victim impact statement ahead of the sentencing of an anti-government extremist who took part in a plot to kidnap and kill her last year. Her statement, which will be revealed in federal court on sentencing day next month, has forced her, she says, to take stock of what she's been through over the past year and what that portends for the nation going forward. ""We've come to a dangerous moment in our nation where it's not just about disagreement, it's about threats of violence,"" she tellsNewsweek.A one-time short-lister for vice president on the 2020 Democratic ticket, she's especially sensitive to the intense, angry and personal attacks visited every day upon the actual person who became the first female veep,Kamala Harris. ""This is the horrible, destructive climate we find ourselves in,"" Whitmer tellsNewsweek. ""Certainly, the vice president is treated differently because of racial politics and gender politics—and it's just not fair.""Indeed, Whitmer, who turns 50 next month, views many of the political dramas she and others have faced in recent months as a product of that viciousness. A year ago, she was one of the fastest-rising political stars of the pandemic era, enjoying the highest approval ratings of her career; most Michiganders polled said they were appreciative of the decisive, if restrictive, actions she took to curb the spread of COVID. Not everyone, though—an angry and vocal minority resented what they viewed as intrusions on their personal liberty, including a group that matched on the state capitol with guns hanging effigies of her. As she rounds the corner toward her 2022 re-election, though, her popularity has cooled: She's still above water with a 50 percent approval rating compared to 44 percent disapproval, but that's a clear erosion from the 63 percent who approved of her leadership at the height of the crisis.COVID politics became more complicated as the pandemic wore on. Her administration repeatedly lost in court as she tried to extend and retain her ability to impose some of the nation's more draconian restrictions, including prolonged business shutdowns and even, at one point, restrictions on whether Home Depot could sell gardening supplies. An impromptu trip to Florida in March to see her ailing father led to a monthlong scandal over whether she'd violated any of her own COVID orders by traveling out of state (she hadn't) and whether the taxpayers would foot the bill for the private jet she traveled on (they didn't; her campaign committee did). She had to apologize in May after aFacebookpost showed her maskless and packed in at an indoor restaurant table with 12 friends in contravention of a state order requiring six feet of social distance and much smaller groups of patrons. ""I am human,"" she said. ""I made a mistake, and I apologize.""Now the Republican-run legislature is poised later this year to use an unusual signature-gathering process that cannot be vetoed by the governor to pass restrictive voting legislation that would reduce voting hours and ballot dropbox availability and strip the governor's office of the emergency powers she used to respond to the pandemic.Whitmer spoke toNewsweekabout the pace of Michigan's COVID recovery, her personal pandemic protocol, the sentencing of one of her would-be kidnappers, the unique challenges facing women in political office and more. (This conversation was edited for clarity and length.)Q: Last time we spoke, you said your close ties to President Joe Biden would help the state. Then, in April, Michigan had a big COVID spike and you asked the administration for more doses of vaccine but were denied. Did you call the president about that and did the exchange go better than last year when you complained about a lack of PPE and Donald Trump responded by calling you ""the woman from Michigan"" who ""has no idea what she's doing?""A: I did. They understood that I was making the case to surge vaccines to a hotspot, which was Michigan at the time. They had a different strategy. I respect that, but they also respect the fact that I'm just trying to do my job and protect the people of my state.Q: A few weeks ago, a report from the website WalletHub found that Michigan has had the slowest recovery from COVID of any state. They based that on hospitalizations, COVID positivity rates, unemployment and other factors. Some of that data was outdated—case numbers and hospitalizations had fallen dramatically by the time the report came out— but are you satisfied with the recovery?A: There have been a lot of rankings over the last year. Michigan also got the Golden Shovel Award [from the construction trade magazineArea Development] with regard to manufacturing investment because we've announced thousands of jobs even in the middle of a pandemic. We have seen our GDP grow 7.6 percent in the first quarter of 2021, which is faster than any of our fellow Midwestern states. Taking a picture from one aspect is certainly not telling the whole story. I recognize there's always more work to do. But we've come a long way and we're going to put our foot on the gas with $300 million in grants to small businesses that raise wages to $15 per hour, $370 million for child care for low-income Michiganders and $100 million for grants to particularly hard-hit small businesses like restaurants.Q: The state is at about 62 percent of adults vaccinated now and seems to have hit a stubborn ceiling, falling short of the president's goal of 70 percent by July 4.A: Yeah, we always knew there would come a time when we would have more vaccines than demand. It means we transition to mobile efforts and smaller neighborhood efforts and partnerships with churches and other community organizations. It's important to recognize that the legislature hasn't been a whole lot of help on this front. Many have resisted getting vaccinated themselves, so this is part of the climate we're navigating. If we could all embrace the science and the incredible promise of these vaccines, we would be able to move faster.Q: Do you still wear masks?A: I follow the house rules. And that's what I've encouraged everyone else to do. So if I go into an establishment where people are wearing masks, I wear a mask. If I am at an establishment where they don't require people to wear masks, knowing that I've got the full benefit of full vaccination, I don't wear a mask. But I anticipate that I'll keep a mask in my bag for quite a while. And if there are small, crowded spaces, I may put it on on occasion. But at this point, I feel very safe and comfortable having been vaccinated. It's a relief.Q: You were considered for vice president, and now we do have our first woman in that office. What do you make of how much criticism she gets?A: You know, I've been a target of white supremacists' efforts to kidnap me, put me on some sort of a sham trial, and execute me. This is the horrible, destructive climate we find ourselves in. Certainly, she's treated differently because of racial politics and gender politics—and it's just not fair. She's doing an incredible job as our vice president, she is carrying the mantle of this administration, she's a full partner to the president. And I think she's someone of whom we should all be proud.Q: Do you think the controversy surrounding your trip to Florida was also unfair or was it fair game? Would you have done anything differently?A: You know what? I violated none of the rules. I followed the ethics laws. I went for two days to check in on a parent who's got serious health issues. I am a daughter as well as a mother and wife and governor. The problem is that we've got a Republican Party in Michigan that wants to politicize every little thing. I suppose that it's just something that we have to accept in this environment, but it certainly was not based on any genuine failure to follow the law or follow ethics rule. It was simply a daughter needing to check it up on her dad. And that's what it was.Q: Are you concerned about the efforts to change the election laws and strip you of emergency powers?A: I think everyone should be concerned when voting rights or powers to keep people safe are in jeopardy in Michigan and everywhere. I think about how much more we could accomplish if the party leaders at the Capitol would focus on getting the federal dollars deployed to help businesses and to help get our kids back in school. Instead, they're spending their time making it harder for people to vote and taking away emergency powers of the office of the governor. Neither one of those things helps solve the problem for a business that was left out of one of the federal programs that they needed to simply survive. None of their actions are helping students who need to get back in the classroom. They not only don't solve the problems that are real, but they create other problems that we will all pay a price for.Q: Are you surprised at how the Republican Party has responded to the January 6 riots on the Capitol?A: It's really sad, and it's disturbing what this could mean for our democracy. It used to be when a party lost the presidency and theSenateand the House—all three things happened in the last four years—the party would recalibrate. Every report shows there wasn't a scintilla of fraud in the 2020 election, so it shows how cynical and destructive they're willing to be to win a future election. In Michigan, the SenateRepublicansdid their own assessment of the election. Their own report says there was no fraud in the election. But they released that report on the same day that they moved these barrier-to-voting bills. This could have consequences not just for Michiganders, but for the nation. As Michigan goes, so goes the rest of the country.Q: What is your mindset now that you've had some distance from the whole kidnapping plot thing?A: You know, [with] the sentencing of the first plotter coming up, I was asked to give a victim impact statement. I wasn't sure whether I was going to do that, frankly, but I did. This last year and a half has been hard on every single one of us, and some of us haven't quite processed at all, I can tell you that. Going through that process of writing that statement was a moment of where I kind of checked in. I know the burden I carry is a lot lighter than that which many people carry every day. But certainly, this last year and a half has taken a toll on all of us in this in our own way.Q: Do you think that the things you've experienced over the past year or so—from the kidnapping plot to the way opponents talk about you to the efforts to depower your office—are unique to you as a prominent woman?A: I think my experience is different than my male counterparts, yes. There's a layer of misogyny on top of all of the other stuff that every governor in the nation is confronting that is unique to women officeholders. But whether it is a public health official like Dr. Fauci or an election official like [Michigan Secretary of State] Jocelyn Benson or her counterpart in Georgia, or municipal officeholders who upheld election laws, we've come to a dangerous moment in our nation where it's not just about disagreement, it's about threats of violence. And that's not right. It's downright dangerous for the individual, but it's dangerous for our democracy, too.Correction July 30 5:57 a.m. ET: This story was updated to correct Whitmer's age."

At that time, several efforts were made across the south to remove Confederate monuments and rename public spaces honoring Confederate figures after a 2015 deadly shooting in Charleston left nine African Americans dead.But in an effort to stop the statue's removal, the ""Unite the Right"" rally led to further racial and social unrest, as white supremacist protesters violently clashed with counter-protesters. One woman, Heather Heyer, was killed when a man drove into a crowd of pedestrians. Dozens of others were injured as the violent clashes carried on for more than a day.Now, after years of contention, protests, and lengthy litigation, the statues will be moved into storage until their final disposition is decided on by the city council. The stone bases of each statue will be left temporarily and removed at a later date.Crowds of people were seen cheering in the park on Saturday as the both statues were removed. The city designated a public viewing area for community members to watch.Jim Henson, who lives in nearby Barboursville,told the Associated Presson Saturday he came to witness the ""historic"" event.

Congress Should Apply Public Accommodation Laws to Big Tech | Opinion,4.33,35.33,https://www.newsweek.com/congress-should-apply-public-accommodation-laws-big-tech-opinion-1608038,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,www.newsweek.com,"Large tech platforms have used protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to control the public discourse through their content moderation practices with impunity. Section 230, in part, protects internet platforms from civil liability when they engage in ""good faith"" blocking of content that either they or their users consider ""obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.""Last week's Florida federal district court ruling inNetChoice v. Moodyadds another level of complexity for state legislatures seeking to regulate such Big Tech practices. Namely, the court may have extended the scope of the First Amendment's ""compelled speech"" doctrine—protection usually reserved for traditional publishers, like newspapers—to apply to online platforms when they block content. Unless the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit rules differently, Section 230 and the First Amendment now protect these platforms from state legislators passing similar types of laws as the oneFlorida just passed.Crucially, however, this does not stopCongressitself from appending public accommodation requirements to an internet platform's Section 230 protections. Put simply, if large internet platforms want these legal immunity protections, then they cannot discriminate against a user based on his/her social status or political beliefs. There must be a non-discrimination ""stick"" to match the legal immunity ""carrot.""The overarching problem is that Section 230 is woefully outdated. Worse,courtdecisions have further insulated platforms from civil liability when they make politically biased determinations. This is whyTwittercan get away with blocking theNew York Post's legitimate reports onHunter Biden, or whyFacebookcan label articles from conservative outlets ""false information"" but will not do so for liberal-leaning outlets reporting on the same event. These court interpretations have thus allowed Big Tech companies—like Twitter,Facebookand Google—to control and, in many cases, shut down conversations with almost no accountability.Keep in mind, when Congress enacted Section 230, the internet was nascent. In 1996, internet services—such as web browsers or instant messaging—acted more liketraditional common carriers. Moreover, these early tech pioneers did not have as much of a penchant for exerting almost total editorial privileges over their platforms. Instead, those earlier companies, such as AOL and Netscape, were more interested in simply transmitting messages irrespective of their content. Hence, Congress placed Section 230 in Title II of the Communications Act—that is, the ""Common Carrier Regulation"" section—because Congress intended to apply the legal immunity only to internet companies that merely passed along user-generated messages.The provision's goal was simple: Tech companies should not be held liable for content they neither publish nor control. Congress provided these protections to give internet-based companies the tools to protect users—mainly children—from harmful content and conduct encountered when using their sites. The law also sought to encourage and promote online discourse, more generally. Congress certainly did not intend these companies to use Section 230 protections to advance their political agendas.It follows that Big Tech curation practices intended to amplify or discourage various viewpoints may fall outside the scope of Section 230's original intended purpose. For example, former Representative Chris Cox (R-CA) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR)—generally credited as the authors of Section 230—wrote: ""Section 230 is not the source of legal protection for platforms that wish to express a point of view."" They go on to say that ""[w]hen a website expresses its own opinion, it is, with respect to that expression, a content creator and, under Section 230, not protected against liability for that content.""To foster the law's intended purpose and combat bad case law, Congress should now apply our public accommodation laws—chiefly, the Civil Rights Act of 1964—to these platforms if they wish to continue availing themselves of Section 230's legal immunity protections. Public accommodation laws prohibit an underlying entity, such as a restaurant or in this case a social media platform, from discriminating against customers when offering its service. Public accommodation requirements, as a statutory creation of Congress, can protect consumers who are not otherwise members of a constitutionally protected class. Specifically, Congress can write a new public accommodation law to prevent internet platforms from discriminating against users who express a certain political viewpoint.Applying this type of public accommodation law on common carrier-like private entities is not a novel concept. For instance, airlines cannot refuse the service of a paying customer based on race, gender or evenpolitical affiliation. This is also true for parcel services, such asFedExor USPS, where federal law prohibits denying service or discriminating against a parcel sender or recipient based on political belief.Congress needs to take the reins away from courts and Big Tech and establish true internet freedom. One avenue it can take is applying public accommodation laws that bar platforms from discriminating against users because of their political views. Such measures are not only in line with the animating spirit of Section 230, but they affirmatively advance it.Joel Thayer focuses his law practice on telecommunications, regulatory and transactional matters, as well as privacy and cybersecurity issues. He has represented clients in front of myriad legal and regulatory fora, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission and federal administrative agencies.

These extraordinary allegations have already been thoroughly litigated in state and federal courts and wholly discredited. But the businessman continues to travel around the country, attending events where he promotes false claims and misinformation about the election results.""God's had his hand in all of this,"" Lindell told an excited crowd at an Anaheim, California, ""Health and Freedom Conference"" on Saturday. A video of the remarks was uploaded to Lindell's website Frank Speech. ""It was his timing. Can you imagine, if it would have happened earlier, you'd have all these people over here—they'd think they won and—and plus they don't want to accept that it was fraud.""The MyPillow CEO said that now that people are seeing Biden's policies ""they are more open to seeing"" that the election was fraudulent.""And I know, not I believe, I know this will be the greatest uniting of our country in history. And we will once again be one nation under God and it will be the biggest revival for Jesus in history.""Earlier in his speech, Lindell argued that there were several ""miracles"" over the past few months, saying these things allowed the truth to be revealed.""God's had his hand in all of this, that's a miracle,"" he said.Lindell argued that the fact that judges ruled against Trump's and his supporters' election challenges actually has allowed what he claims is the truth to be revealed. He also said that the fact that both of Georgia'sSenateseats flipped from Republican to Democrat in the January run-off was another ""miracle,"" claiming that this was obvious evidence of more voter fraud.Despite Lindell's and Trump's claims, they have not provided evidence that substantiates their allegations. Dozens of election challenge lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies have failed in state and federal courts. Even judges appointed by Trump and otherRepublicanshave rejected the allegations.Meanwhile, audits and recounts in key battleground states—such as Georgia where the election was overseen by apro-Trump Republican—have reaffirmed Biden's victory. The victories of Georgia's two Democratic senators,Raphael WarnockandJon Ossoff, were also reaffirmed by audits of the run-off results.Former U.S. Attorney GeneralWilliam Barr, who was widely viewed as one of Trump's most loyal Cabinet members, said in December that there was ""no evidence"" to substantiate the claims of widespread fraud. Furthermore, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at theDepartment of Homeland Securityasserted that the election was the ""most secure in American history.""Lindell and other key Trump supporters appear to be pandering their claims about the election to right-wing Christian nationalists. The former president received substantial support from conservative Christians, with roughly 8 in 10 white evangelicals casting their ballots for him in 2016 and then again in 2020. This religious demographic tends to be politically animated by their staunch opposition to women's reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, and greater legal protections for the transgender community.The organization Christians Against Christian Nationalism, led by Amanda Tyler,earlier this month launcheda new curriculum in a bid to address the surge in Christian nationalism across the country.

Simon D. Schuster, the executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, told WXYZ.""That broad latitude that elected officials have to at least attempt to explain away potentially inappropriate financial transactions is striking,"" he added.The wedding was not the first time Burcroff has faced scrutiny for questionable spending.Earlier this year, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson launched an investigation into Burcroff's finances following reports that the mayor has improperly used funds to pay family members, yacht club memberships, and to purchase a Jeep Wrangler. It is illegal to use campaign spending for personal use in Michigan.WXYZfirst reporteda series of questionable payments made by the mayor in December, which included more than $6,000 worth of payments made to his children, brother and son-in-law for office rent and campaign office maintenance.The news outlet also uncovered $3,800 paid in membership fees to the Belleville Yacht Club, where his daughter's wedding was held.In response to the secretary of state probe, in May, Wholihan acknowledged that Burcroff used the $4,500 for his daughter's wedding, as well as nearly $15,000 for donations to his local church in May. As reported by WXYZ, Wholihan said that the mayor has since returned up to $20,000 back to his campaign.According to the city's website, Burcroff is a Navy veteran and local business owner and father of three children, who ""believes that integrity-driven leadership, outstanding customer service, safe neighborhoods, financial stability, and a 'business friendly' city administration are important areas for local government to focus on.""The mayor, who said earlier this year he will not be seeking re-election, remains under investigation by the secretary of state.Newsweekcontacted Burcroff for additional comment, but did not hear back in time for publication.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."

The state's vaccination rate is currently at 36 percent, the fifth-lowest in the nation, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Cassidy pointed to the White House andDemocratsinCongressfor Louisiana's mistrust of the vaccine.

""'Oh, here we're going to be partisan, but over here you better trust us.'

"U.S., Israel Walk Out of United Nations Meeting After Zionism Likened to Racism",-3.0,45.0,https://www.newsweek.com/us-israel-walk-out-united-nations-meeting-after-zionism-likened-racism-1631589,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,www.newsweek.com,"After a draft resolution was introduced at theUnited NationsGeneral Assembly that likened Zionism to racism, the U.S. and Israel walked out of the annual meeting, the Associated Press reported. The provision, which also singled out Israel for criticism, was eventually discarded.Zionism is ""the Jewish national movement of self-determination in the land of Israel — the historical birthplace and biblical homeland of the Jewish people,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League. The assembly was scheduled on Wednesday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the U.N. World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa, a controversial gathering that saw disputes over the Middle East and slavery's legacy, AP reported.Twenty countries made the decision to boycott the commemoration, according to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. The organization called on additional countries to join their efforts ""in continuing to fight racism, bigotry, and anti-Semitism.""For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began early last year, more than two dozen world leaders appeared in person at the U.N. General Assembly on the opening day of their annual high-level meeting Tuesday. In speech after speech, the atmosphere was somber, angry and dire.Chinese PresidentXi Jinpingwarned that ""the world has entered a period of new turbulence and transformation."" Finland President Sauli Niinistö said: ""We are indeed at a critical juncture."" And Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado Quesada declared: ""The future is raising its voice at us: Less military weaponry, more investment in peace!""Speaker after speaker at Tuesday's opening of the nearly week-long meeting decried the inequalities and deep divisions that have prevented united global action to end the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed nearly 4.6 million lives and is still raging, and the failure to sufficiently tackle the climate crisis threatening the planet.COVID-19 and climate are certain to remain top issues for heads of state and government.Following the commemoration for the U.N. World Conference Against Racism, heads of state will start delivering their annual addresses again in the vast General Assembly hall. Speakers include King Abdullah II of Jordan, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.Perhaps the harshest assessment of the current global crisis came from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who opened his state of the world address sounding an ""alarm"" that ""the world must wake up.""""Our world has never been more threatened or more divided,"" he said. ""We face the greatest cascade of crises in our lifetimes.""""We are on the edge of an abyss—and moving in the wrong direction,"" the secretary-general warned.Guterres pointed to ""supersized glaring inequalities"" in addressing COVID-19, ""climate alarm bells...ringing at fever pitch,"" upheavals from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Yemen and beyond thwarting peace, and ""a surge of mistrust and misinformation (that) is polarizing people and paralyzing societies.""Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the pandemic was a reminder ""that the entire world are part of a big family.""""But the solidarity test that we were put to failed us miserably,"" he said. ""It is a disgrace for humanity that vaccine nationalism is still being carried on through different methods,"" and underdeveloped countries and poor segments of societies have been ""literally left to their fate in the face of the pandemic.""As for the climate crisis, Erdogan said whoever did the most damage to nature, the atmosphere and water, ""and whoever has wildly exploited natural resources"" should make the greatest contribution to fighting global warming.""Unlike the past, this time no one can afford the luxury to say, 'I'm powerful so I will not pay the bill' because climate change will treat mankind quite equally,"" the Turkish leader said. ""The duty for all of us is to take measures against this enormous threat, with a fair burden-sharing.""Romania's President Klaus Iohannis did find something positive from the COVID-19 crisis.""While the pandemic affected almost all aspects of our lives,"" he said, ""it also provided us with opportunities to learn, adapt and do things better.""Two of the most closely watched speeches on Tuesday were delivered by U.S. PresidentJoe Bidenand Chinese President Xi Jinping.In an AP interview on Saturday, Guterres warned that the world could plunge into a new and probably more dangerous Cold War if China and the United States don't repair their ""completely dysfunctional"" relationship. ""Unfortunately, today we only have confrontation,"" he said.Biden said in his U.N. address that the United States was not attempting to be divisive or confrontational.""We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs,"" he said. ""The United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges even if we have intense disagreements in other areas.""Speaking later, Xi said disputes among countries ""need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation.""""One country's success does not have to mean another country's failure,"" Xi said. ""The world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries.""By tradition, the first country to speak was Brazil, whose president, Jair Bolsonaro rebuffed criticism of his handling of the pandemic and touted recent data indicating lessAmazondeforestation. He said he was seeking to counter the image of Brazil portrayed in the media, touting it as a great place for investment and praising his pandemic welfare program, which helped avoid a worse recession last year.Bolsonaro said that his government has successfully distributed first doses to the majority of adults, but doesn't support vaccine passports or forcing anyone to have a shot. He has said several times in the past week that he remains unvaccinated. He had COVID-19 last year.Brazil's health minister, Marcelo Quiroga, who was with Bolsonaro, later tested positive for the coronavirus and will remain in isolation in the United States, the government said.

"On Two-Year Anniversary of Mueller Testimony, Trump's World Looks Very Different",-8.67,38.0,https://www.newsweek.com/two-year-anniversary-mueller-testimony-trumps-world-looks-very-different-1612374,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.newsweek.com,"On July 24, 2019, special counselRobert Mueller IIItestified before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees House about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Now, two years later, much has changed in the world, especially for former PresidentDonald Trump, whose life was demonstrably affected by the Mueller report.Throughout his historic testimony, Mueller, who led the investigation into Russia's interference and whether Donald Trump's associates aided those efforts, declined to offer many personal opinions related to the findings in the 448-page report he had submitted that April.However, he did offer a stark warning about Russian meddling in American politics: ""They're doing it as we sit here.""""I hope this is not the new normal,"" he said, ""but I fear it is.""His report pointedly noted thatCongresshad the authority to decide if Trump had obstructed justice and then could take further action if it was deemed warranted. Sen.Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, remarked on July 24 that ""Robert Mueller's report is an impeachment referral, and it's up to Congress to act.""And act Congress did, with the House of Representatives impeaching Trump in December 2019, though theSenateacquitted him a few months later in February 2020.Trump's world looks drastically different than it did the two years when Mueller gave his testimony. In fact, much has changed for the former president since the last anniversary one year ago.On July 24, 2020, Trump was still president, and he was still tweeting. Not only did he lose the 2020 U.S. presidential election, but he has also since been banned fromTwitter.He was also impeached by the House a second time, this time for incitement of insurrection. Once again, he was acquitted by the Senate.Before that impeachment, though, Trump was the nation's leader during an unprecedented pandemic, and he also contracted the coronavirus.Even now—and even after losing numerous lawsuits attempting to overturn the results of the election—he continues pushing debunked claims of election fraud during appearances on conservative news outlets and at rallies around the country.This week,The WashingtonPostreported Trump's political action committee ostensibly formed to fund challenges to the election results raised about $75 million in the first half of this year, yet the PAC spent none of the money on audits or other election-review measures.As has been the case for most of Trump's adult life, his name also hasn't been out of the news. Sometimes, this attention comes from association, like his company and its longtime finance chief being charged in early July for what prosecutors called a ""sweeping and audacious"" tax fraud scheme [Trump himself was not charged].Other times, his name makes headlines after he releases statements on any number of subjects. On Friday, for instance, he ridiculed the Cleveland baseball club for changing its name from the Indians to the Guardians.Mainly, though, Trump appears to be plotting his future these days.Some ideas he's teased have already seemingly been dropped, such as launching his own social media platform. Instead, he debuted a blog, but then that shut down after 29 days. [However, Jason Miller, a former top Trump advisor, launched Gettr early this month that courts conservatives.]Other big-picture plans remain unclear, but the former president seems to be building up to something important, with many speculating another run for the White House in 2024. Many pundits, in fact, spend more time not asking ""if"" he will run, but ""who"" will be his running mate, with most agreeing it won't beMike Pence.Recent news may at least mean Trump might be done facing repercussions from the Mueller report. On July 2, the U.S.Supreme Courtcleared away court decisions where the House Judiciary Committee was told it could access secret grand jury records from key witnesses in the Mueller investigation.The decision means the House now won't get those grand jury records, thus ending CongressionalDemocrats' attempts of finding out what witnesses said confidentially under oath about their interactions with Trump during the 2016 campaign.The Justice Department under Trump had tried to block the release of those grand jury documents for two years. PresidentJoe Biden's Justice Department reportedly also didn't see the need to continue pursuing the matter.Should he want the GOP nomination, though, the job presently appears to be his for the picking. A poll from theJohn BoltonSuper PAC, released on July 19, found 46 precent of likely Republican primary voters said they would back Trump being the nominee. That was the highest level of support for any potential Republican candidate polled by more than 30 points.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."

Dickerson asked the former CISA director if he noticed a similarity to his fight against election misinformation.""Absolutely,"" Krebs responded.

He latersuedTrump campaign lawyer Joe DiGenova for defamation and emotional distress after the lawyer called for his execution on Newsmax.Krebs was also asked to note changes to the kinds of misinformation being disseminated now versus when he was with the CISA.

Again, the profiteers, you have conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers. You have political activists as well... You tend to have an overlap of these different actors.""

""But they get the seeds of division that they then amplify, they drive more activity, and ultimately what they're looking to do is undermine our confidence in the United States of America.""Krebs again drew similarities between the vaccine and the election by mentioningFacebook's role in spreading both helpful and harmful communication. He said the Biden administration and Facebook can both be right in their recent blame-shifting regarding COVID-19 misinformation.""Facebook and other social media platforms can provide helpful information on the facts behind the vaccine. And the same thing happened in the elections last year. They had a banner and a trust page. But at the same time, there are those that can use those platforms for their own benefits to continue to push disinformation,"" Krebs said.PresidentJoe Bidensaid on Friday that a total of 12 accounts are responsible for a majority of the vaccine misinformation on Facebook and the platform was ""killing people."" Facebook retorted in a blog post by saying 85 percent of its users were vaccinated or plan to be, and the administration was ""looking for scapegoats for missing their vaccine goals.""The ""Dirty Dozen,"" as Krebs called the accounts, have contributed to the misinformation about the vaccine, but the issue goes beyond that. Even though many of the 12 have been de-platformed, the misinformation has become part of the rhetoric around the vaccine, he said.""[Vaccine misinformation] is now so pervasive that it exists just naturally within the ecosystem on Facebook and elsewhere,"" Krebs said.Krebs called for Facebook to be more transparent with their algorithm so that security experts and consumers can hold misinformation-spreading users accountable.""Unfortunately, fear sells and those clicks drive more engagement,"" Krebs told Dickerson.Newsweekreached out to Facebook for comment.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."

Lindsey Graham Suggests Senators Leave D.C. to Prevent Infrastructure Bill via Reconciliation,0.0,43.33,https://www.newsweek.com/lindsey-graham-suggests-senators-leave-dc-prevent-infrastructure-bill-via-reconciliation-1610815,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.newsweek.com,"SenatorLindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, suggested that GOP senators should take a cue from Texas State HouseDemocratsand leave the U.S. Capitol to deny Democrats quorum if the proposed $3.5 trillion ""human infrastructure"" reconciliation bill makes it to a vote.Senate Majority LeaderChuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and PresidentJoe Bidenunveiled the $3.5 trillion spending proposallast week. The massive bill would work to fund childcare, provide money for education priorities, and expand health care access to millions of Americans. ButRepublicanshave vocally opposed the plan, raisingconcerns about inflationand saying the bill will make Americans dependent on the government.""You've gotta have a quorum to pass a bill in theSenate,"" Graham pointed out during a Sunday morning interview withFox News.The GOP senator, who serves as the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, said that he would ""leave"" before he allowed the proposed budget reconciliation package to pass through the upper chamber ofCongress.""So, to my Republican colleagues, we may learn something from our Democratic friends in Texas. When it comes to avoiding a $3.5 trillion tax and spend package. Leave town,"" Graham said.Asked to clarify his position, Graham asserted ""hell yeah I would leave!"" The senator said he would ""use everything lawfully in my tool box to prevent rampant inflation.""He argued that the package had ""nothing to do with infrastructure,"" despite Democrats describing it as such.Last Monday,more than 50 Texas Democratsfrom the state's House of Representative flew to Washington, D.C. to deny Republican lawmakers quorum as they attempted to pass contentious election reforms. Democrats argue that the legislation amounts to voter suppression, or ""the new Jim Crow""—as it appears it would make it harder for many Texans, particularly in minority communities, to cast ballots in future elections. The GOP election legislation was largely motivated by former PresidentDonald Trump'sdebunked claimsthat the 2020 election was fraudulent.A 2013 report from the Congressional Research Service published on the Senate's website explains that ""a straightforward reading of the Constitution's quorum requirement would seem to require a simple majority of Senators, or a minimum of 51 if there are no vacancies in the body."" However, the Senate generally operates under the presumption it is complying with this rule unless a Senator ""suggests the absence of a quorum.""The current Senate is evenly split, with 50 Republicans and 50 members of the Senate's Democratic Caucus. As a result, all 50 GOP senators would need to be on board with Graham's plan and leave the Capitol in order to deny Democrats quorum.Newsweekreached out to Senate Minority LeaderMitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, to ask if GOP leaders were actively considering Graham's proposed strategy. McConnell's press representatives did not immediately respond.Inflation concerns were fueled this week by June data showing that, excluding food and energy, it rose 4.5 percent—the largest move since September 1991. Consumer prices increased by 5.4 percent in June as well, marking the largest monthly gain in about 13 years.Treasury SecretaryJanet Yellenand Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powelldownplayed the concerns, however. They argued this inflation was expected as the U.S. economy reopens after lockdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic, due to pent-up demand and disruptions in the supply chain. They said that the Federal Reserve still has ample tools to combat inflation if it worsens, while asserting that they expect the problem to resolve in the coming months.SenatorBernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, toldCNNlast week that the $3.5 trillion proposal from Democrats would not impact inflation.""This bill ... will pay for itself. It will be paid for in a variety of ways, but significantly by higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations,"" the progressive lawmaker said. ""So that should not add to the inflation concerns.""Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."
Ex-Surgeon General Jerome Adams Calls on CDC to Promote Masking Again,0.0,43.33,https://www.newsweek.com/ex-surgeon-general-jerome-adams-calls-cdc-promote-masking-again-1610799,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.newsweek.com,"Jerome Adams, the former U.S. Surgeon General, has expressed concern that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has moved too quickly in relaxing mask mandates.Adams, who served during the presidency ofDonald Trump, made his worries known in a lengthyTwitterthread posted on Saturday night.""Last year Tony Fauci and I famously, prematurely, & wrongly advised against masks,"" Adams said at the start of the thread. ""I felt it was the best call at the time, but now regret it. I'm worried the CDC also made a similarly premature, misinterpreted, yet still harmful call on masking in the face of delta variant.""Adams's concerns stem from the ongoing spread of the Delta variant, a mutation of the original strain of COVID-19. This new strain is known to be more infectious than the original and is currently causing cases to spike in parts of the U.S.In light ofsurging case numbers, thanks to this variant,Los Angelesand Las Vegas counties have broken with CDC guidelines and mandated masks indoors. More mandates and guidances could be forthcoming.""Both the conditions (rising cases) & the science (delta variant) changed, but what people heard and held to was masks were no longer needed..."" Adams said. ""Now you have health officials, cities & counties (eg LA County), & likely soon states issuing guidance in direct conflict w/ the mask guidance[the CDC] issued a month ago. The sooner CDC says we were wrong, & hits the reset button, the better. Trust me- I know more than anyone.""In the thread, Adams also makes reference to his andDr. Anthony Fauci's insistence in the early days of the pandemic that masks would not be necessary for all people. He explained that the call was based on their limited knowledge at the time and an effort to preserve the supply of masks for medical professionals who needed it most at the time.Last year Tony Fauci and I famously, prematurely, & wrongly advised against masks. I felt it was the best call at the time, but now regret it.I’m worried the CDC also made a similarly premature, misinterpreted, yet still harmful call on masking in the face of ⬆️ delta variant.As scientists gained a better understanding of COVID-19 and how it spreads, it was decided to reverse this call and mandate masks for all.Now Adams believes that the CDC should do the same. Specifically, he mentions mandating masks for all, even the fully vaccinated, in areas with rising case numbers.The CDC has stated that the current vaccines on offer are able to offer protection from the Delta variant. Reports indicate that the vast majority of recent cases in the U.S. involve unvaccinated patients.According to theNew York Timesvaccination tracker, at least 68 percent of U.S. adults have received at least one vaccine dose, while 59.3 percent are fully vaccinated. The U.S. vaccination rate was recently eclipsed by Canada's, despite the neighboring country struggling with availability earlier in the year.Newsweekreached out to the CDC for comment.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."

A larger percentage of men, 35 percent, said they would fit under the wide umbrella of that term, while only 30 percent of women surveyed said the same.The term ""woke"" has become a divisive political and cultural reference as conservatives often use it to mock progressives as elitist or arrogant. A 60 percent majority ofDemocratssurveyed said they think ""wokeness"" is a good thing for the country, but only about 20 percent ofRepublicansagreed.Polled voters were evenly divided in their view of whether being ""woke"" is a positive or negative concept for the country moving forward. Respondents were asked if ""wokeness"" is doubling down on the country's racial and social divisions, or if it is a helping the U.S. to evolve for the better. Exactly 50 percent of voters said ""wokeness"" is stoking differences and causing unrest, while another 50 percent said it is developing and evolving the country for the better.Massive partisan divides were evident, as 70 percent of Democrats said ""wokeness"" is a good thing alongside 54 percent of independent voters. By comparison, a 72 percent majority of Republicans said ""wokeness"" is further dividing the country along racial and ethnic lines.One major factor in theThe Hill/HarrisX poll is the large share of U.S. voters who acknowledged they are not entirely sure what the term ""woke"" really means. Although the phrase has seeped into mainstream discussions pertaining to politics, sports and education, the murky term for one's awareness of racial prejudice still leaves many Americans confused.Thirty-one percent of respondents said flatly, ""I don't know what woke means""—including 37 percent of women versus 26 percent of men. And an additional 13 percent of those surveyed said they are ""unsure"" whether or not they could be considered woke.But a large gray area is present throughout the poll results. Forty-one percent of respondents said they don't think being woke is either a good or a bad thing. A plurality, 45 percent, of women voters said they don't think ""wokeness"" has either a good or bad effect on the country's current direction.Newsweekreached out to the survey authors for any additional remarks about the ""wokeness"" poll released this week from a nationally representative sample of registered voters.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."

And that just made the process longer and more intensive,"" said Randy Capps, the director of research for U.S. programs at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.""The average wait time nationwide has doubled since Trump became president,"" said Rand, who's now the co-founder ofBoundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship.The wait time is getting worse as a result of the pandemicFor nearly three months, the Trump administration canceled most citizenship interviews and ceremonies, saying they wanted to keep applicants and staff safe during the pandemic.At the same time, immigration officials rejectedbipartisan callsto administer the Oath of Allegianceremotelybecause of ""logistical challenges"" and ""security concerns.""U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees legal immigration, tells Newsy it's working around the clock to make up for the lost time. But analysts estimate that hundreds of thousands of people who were on track gain citizenship in time to vote in the 2020 election may now miss out on that opportunity.""It's a few hundred thousand people that USCIS would have to complete various procedures for in time for the election at a time when they don't appear to have the resources to do that,"" Capps said.That could impact some swing states on election day.""The margins were really, really close in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin last time. And, you know, even a few thousand might make a difference there Or it could have a big impact in Florida. There are a lot of people naturalizing there, even possibly Arizona or Texas,"" Capps said.Starting on October 2nd, the Trump administration will nearly double the fee to apply for citizenship, from $640 to $1,170. It will also make it harder for low-income applicants to qualify for a fee-waiver.USCIS, which is almost entirely funded by the fees it collects from applicants, says the changes are necessary to recoverthe agency's costs of services.But critics say the move could be an intentional attempt to price out poorer immigrants.Ben Schamisso, Newsy, Chicago"

He's also said it's vulnerable to foreign interference. But a senior official with the office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters Wednesday there's no evidence of any such efforts.A senior FBI official added that it would be extraordinarily difficult to tamper with the results in any measurable way.Intelligence officials have previously accused Russia, Iran and China of utilizing disinformation campaigns and other methods to interfere with the November election. However, officials say none of those tactics appear to be targeting mail-in voting initiatives.U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russia had used a campaign of propaganda and hacking to support the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. Officials told reporters yesterday the nation has become ""a lot more aware"" of potential foreign interference since then.For Newsy, I'm Adam Elrashidi."

Well, this is the first time we got some real information about what happened before that viral video picks up and again. This is all coming from the Wisconsin Department of Justice, the group that's investigating the shooting. They investigate all police- involved shooting. A third party has to investigate those types of incidents in the state of Wisconsin.""So, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, police were called to the scene after a woman called the police, saying that her boyfriend was on the premises and wasn't supposed to be there. Now they did not clarify whether that boyfriend in question is, in fact Jacob Blake, but their story picks up with trying to arrest Jacob Blake, and essentially, they say the Kenosha Police tased Jacob Blake, and he continued to walk toward his vehicle. And obviously, as you know, that is where the viral video picks up the other detail.""The major detail that came out of this press conference yesterday was the fact that Jacob Blake had a knife in on the scene. Now, police say they found that knife on the floorboard of the driver's seat. They did not say whether or not he was reaching for the knife, whether he pulled the knife or whether he had it, um, on his person throughout the altercation. But according to Wisconsin Department of Justice, Jacob Blake himself admitted that that he had a knife on the scene. So that was part of what we learned.""Lastly, Officer Rusten Sheskey has been identified as the officer on the scene who fired seven shots. He was the only officer to fire and there were three different officers on the scene. All three of those officers are now on administrative leave.""Magarino: ""We've seen protests in the town all week. Can you take us through what happened overnight?""Andress: ""Well, things remain peaceful overnight. This is the first time since Sunday that there hasn't been any tear gas destruction or looting throughout this. You know what has been obviously a chaotic week? People did march in protest, protest well passed the curfew, but, um, things remained peaceful throughout. Obviously, the governor had an influx of National Guard officers. It went from 1-25 to 50 now to 500 that air here and available to provide support to Kenosha police in the event of destruction. Now the other thing I want to mention, um, we also didn't see any organized militia groups.""Obviously, last night, obviously, the night before last, there was that terrible incident that left two people dead and one person injured that involved sort of organized militia groups roaming the streets of Kenosha. That census it got was here before we left. Actually, when protesters were kind of in this town square area and barbecuing and essentially just being here on the premises. And an armored truck sort of hopped a curb and rode up in front of us, where we were about to go live on the air with guns drawn. Obviously, protesters approached these folks that were standing in that general area and nothing came of it. But that was the census that got overnight, According to people who were here on the scene throughout the overnight hours. Each time I talked to you, you know, it's a different scenario There are different people, different movements, different forms of protest.Magarino: ""And, I mean, clearly, the story will continue to develop your on it.

Latest live updates.New Jersey school districts submitting plans to the state to switch to all-remote classes amid thecoronaviruspandemic need to have a justifiable reason and a plan to fix that obstacle by a set date, Gov.Phil Murphymade clear Wednesday, a week after he opened the door delays for in-person classes.In hisreversal last week in allowing schoolsto opt for remote learning, the governor said the Department of Education would consider those requests if schools can’t meet COVID-19 safety requirements, including having barriers or social distancing measures in place in classrooms and issues with ventilation systems.Dozens of schools have announced remote-only plans in recent days, pending state approval. NJ Advance Media has beenproviding live updates on those individual districts announcements.“A reminder to all school districts that any resubmitted plans to begin the school year with all-remote learning must cite specific health and safety reasons for the ... change, which district leaders must certify to, as well as a timeline to get to in-person instruction,” Murphy said Wednesday athis latest coronavirus briefing in Trenton.“All districts must meet the same health and safety standards we reiterated for districts last week and in all the guidance that has been released over the past few months,” he added. “And all plans must be reviewed by executive county superintendents, as well as both the Department of Education and the Department of Health.”CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:Live map tracker|Newsletter|HomepageMurphy has stressed with his remote-learning decision that the goal is still for as many districts to reopen with in-person learning as soon as possible.After the announcement, many school districts that had initially called for students and teachers to return to physical classrooms have been holding emergency meetings to approve revised their plans.At least 139 school districts had inquiredwith the Department of Education about making the switch as of Tuesday, officials said.Newark’s school district, the state’s largest,announced Monday it would seek to reopen with all-remote classesto start the year.For schools that do return to in-person classes, the state guidelines say if one or two students or teachers in a single classroom is diagnosed with the coronavirus, everyone he or she came in close to at the school could be asked to stay home for 14 days.

DNC 2020: Harris speaks alongside other Democratic groundbreakers,-7.67,44.33,https://www.nj.com/politics/2020/08/dnc-2020-harris-speaks-alongside-other-democratic-groundbreakers.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nj-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,www.nj.com,"In this image from video, Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks about voting during the third night of the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, Aug. 19, 2020. (Democratic National Convention via AP)APWILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Former President Barack Obama warned that American democracy could falter if President Donald Trump is reelected, a stunning rebuke of his successor that was echoed by Kamala Harris at the Democratic Convention Wednesday night as she embraced her historic role as the first Black woman on a national political ticket.Obama, himself a barrier breaker as the nation’s first Black president, pleaded with voters to “embrace your own responsibility as citizens – to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure. Because that’s what is at stake right now. Our democracy.”Throughout their convention, the Democrats have summoned a collective urgency about the dangers of Trump as president. In 2016, they dismissed and sometimes trivialized him. Now they are casting him as an existential threat to the country. The tone signals anew that the fall campaign between Trump and Joe Biden, already expected to be among the most negative of the past half century, will be filled with rancor and recrimination.Yet on the third night of the Democrats’ four-day convention, party leaders also sought to put forward a cohesive vision of their values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change and tighten gun laws. They drew a sharp contrast with Trump, portraying him as cruel in his treatment of immigrants, disinterested in the nation’s climate crisis and over his head on virtually all of the nation’s most pressing challenges.Democrats also demonstrated a hope that Biden, a 77-year-old white man, can revive the coalition that helped put Obama into office, with minorities, younger voters and college-educated women blunting Trump’s lock on many white and rural voters.The evening marked a celebration of the party’s leading women, including remarks from Hillary Clinton, the first woman to become a major ticket presidential nominee; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who challenged Biden during the primary and is now supporting his campaign.Harris, a 55-year-old California senator and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, addressed race and equality in a personal way Biden cannot when he formally accepts his party's presidential nomination on Thursday.“There is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work,” Harris said, her words emphatic though she was speaking in a largely empty arena near Biden’s Delaware home.“We’ve got to do the work to fulfill the promise of equal justice under law,” she added. “None of us are free until all of us are free.”Just 76 days before the election, Biden must energize the disparate factions that make up the modern Democratic Party – a coalition that spans generation, race and ideology. And this fall voters must deal with concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic that has created health risks for those who want to vote in person — and postal slowdowns for mail-in ballots, which Democrats blame on Trump.Democrats hope that Harris and Obama in particular can help bridge the divide between those reassured by Biden’s establishment credentials and those craving bolder change.The pandemic forced Biden's team to abandon the traditional convention formatin favor of an all-virtual affairthat has eliminated much of the pomp and circumstance that typically defines political conventions. It was completely silent, for example, as Harris took the stage to make history at the Chase Center in downtown Wilmington. She was flanked by American flags but no family, and her audience consisted of a few dozen reporters and photographers.After two nights that featured several Republicans, the proceedings on Wednesday emphasized core Democratic values on areas like climate change and gun violence that particularly resonate with younger voters.On guns, Biden wants to repeal a law shielding firearm manufacturers from liability lawsuits, impose universal background checks for purchases and ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines. On climate, Biden has proposed a $2 trillion plan to invest in clean energy and end carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2035, even though his proposals don’t go as far as activists’ preferred “Green New Deal.”Wednesday night, former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords reflected on her own journey of pain and recovery from a severe brain injury nearly a decade after being shot while meeting with constituents. She urged America to support Biden.“I struggle to speak, but I have not lost my voice,” Giffords said. “Vote, vote, vote.”It's Trump's turn next. The president, who abandoned plans to host his convention in North Carolina and Florida, is expected to break tradition and accept his nomination from the White House lawn.In the meantime, he's seeking to take attention from Biden. Trump will stop near his Democratic rival's birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania on Thursday. He's also participating in a prime-time interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 rival, implored Democrats to turn out in larger numbers in November to block the president's reelection.“For four years, people have said to me, ‘I didn’t realize how dangerous he was.’ ‘I wish I could go back and do it over.’ Or worst, ‘I should have voted,’” said Clinton, the first woman nominated president by a major party. “Well, this can’t be another woulda coulda shoulda election.”“Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line,” she added, “because they are.”Obama spoke harshly of Trump, too.“Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” Obama said, speaking from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, a backdrop chosen to reinforce what the former president sees as the dire stakes of the moment.“I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president,” Obama continued, describing Biden as his brother. “I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously.”Obama confidants say that the former president’s support for Biden is unequivocal, but he worries about enthusiasm among younger voters, particularly younger voters of color. Democrats concede that one of the reasons Trump won the presidency in 2016 was because those voters didn’t show up in the same large numbers as when Obama was on the ballot.Beyond the carefully scripted confines of the virtual convention, there were modest signs of tension between the moderate and progressive wings of Biden’s Democratic Party.In particular, some progressives complained that pro-Biden Republicans such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich have been featured more prominently than the party’s younger progressive stars like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Climate activists also complained that the party appeared ready to drop a provision in the platform that calls for an end to fossil fuel industry subsidies and tax breaks.Sen. Warren, a favorite of progressives for demanding bold change, spoke for around five minutes.And While Warren urged people to vote for Biden and gave a hearty endorsement for several of his economic and child care plans, she hinted that she would not retreat from her push for a more progressive agenda should her party retake the White House.“We all need to be in the fight to get Joe and Kamala elected,” Warren said. “And after November, we all need to stay in the fight to get big things done.”___By Steve Peoples, Michelle L.

The plans are subject to approval by the state Department of Education.Last week, Gov. Phil Murphy said districts that are unable to meet the requirements to safely reopen for in-person instruction will be allowed to start the school year withvirtual instructionas long as they have a plan to overcome those challenges and bring students and teachers back to classrooms at a future date.After the governor’s announcement, many school districts that had initially called for students and teachers to return to physical classrooms have been holding emergency meetings to approve revised their plans.At least 139 school districts had inquiredwith the Department of Education about making the switch as of Tuesday, officials said.For schools that do return to in-person classes, the state guidelines say if one or two students or teachers is diagnosed with thecoronavirusin aNew Jersey classroom, everyone he or she came close to at school could be asked to stay home for 14 days. But if two people in different classrooms get sick, the entire school could be shut down.Pleasantville school district officials announced Tuesday night that astudent athlete tested positive for COVID-19after participating in two weeks of on-campus practices. Those in contact with the student have been asked to self-quarantine. The district held a special meeting Tuesday night to seek a switch to all-remote learning.The following districts are now planning to start with all-remote classes for the 2020-2021 school year.

"N.J. reports 455 new COVID-19 cases, 9 more deaths. Transmission rate increases again, to just below key mark.",0.0,53.75,https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/09/nj-reports-455-new-covid-19-cases-9-more-deaths-transmission-rate-increases-again-is-just-below-key-mark.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nj-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,www.nj.com,"Withan unusual new school year kicking offandlimited indoor dining set to returnfor Labor Day weekend, New Jersey on Thursday reported nine more deaths attributed tothe coronavirusand 455 new cases.That marks the first time in 12 days the state has reported more than 400 positive tests in a single day.“That’s another data point that (shows) we’re not out of the woods yet,” Gov.Phil Murphysaid while announcing the latest numbers duringan unrelated event in Iselin.Meanwhile, the state’s rate of transmission ticked up for the sixth straight day, with the latest number sitting at 0.99 — just below the critical benchmark of 1, which determines whether the outbreak is expanding or shrinking.Murphy did not detail when the newly reported deaths occurred.The new figures come a day before the six-month mark since the Garden State announced its first COVID-19 case.In that time, the state has reported just under 192,973 positive tests out of more than 2.93 million administered tests. That’s the eighth-most cases in the U.S.Out of those, New Jersey has reported 15,971 deaths related to the virus — 14,188 lab-confirmed and 1,783 considered probable. That’s the second-most coronavirus deaths in the country.More than 33,900 residents have recovered, according toJohns Hopkins University, though that number is likely much higher.New Jersey’s latest transmission rate is up from 0.96 announced Wednesday. The number has increased incrementally in recent days after declining for more than a week.Any number above 1 means each newly infected person, on average, is spreading the virus to at least one other person. Any number below 1 means the virus is decreasing.New Jersey, a densely populated state of 9 million residents and once an early hot spot, has seen its daily numbers drop significantly since April, when the state was routinely announcing hundreds of new deaths and thousands of new cases a day.The state has seen new deaths hover around 10 and new cases in the 300s over the last several days. Thursday marked the first time since Aug. 22 the state reported more than 400 new cases.“We’re a heckuva lot better than we were four or five months ago, but we’re still not out of the woods” Murphy said during an interview Thursday afternoonon MSNBC’s “Meet the Press Daily.”“This is very much still with us.”The governor has also stressed this is a “big week” as the state takes closely watched reopening steps. Gyms were permitted toreopen to limited indoor capacityTuesday, whilebars and restaurants will be allowed to reopen indoor diningat 25% capacity Friday.Movie theatersandindoor performing arts venuescan reopen with restrictions on Friday, too.Plus, as the new school year begins, state officials said434 districts will beginwith a a hybrid model or in-person and remote learning, 68 will start with all in-person classes, 242 start all-remote, and 22 will start with some combination of the above.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s top infectious disease expert, has pleaded with the American people to be cautious over the Labor Day weekend.“We know from prior experience as you get into the holiday weekend, the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, there’s a tendency of people to be careless somewhat with regard to the public health measures,” Faucitold MSNBC on Wednesday. “I want to use this opportunity to almost have a plea to the people in this country to realize that we really still need to get our arms around this and to suppress these types of surges we’ve seen.”Murphy was asked if he’s worried about lax behavior this weekend in New Jersey. He said the bigger concern is indoor house parties compared to outside events, and he called on families and friends getting together to do so outside.“If they’re gonna get together, I hope they do, but I hope they do it outside,” the governor told reporters after Thursday’s event. “Do it with face coverings. Enjoy yourselves, but do it responsibly.”#COVID19UPDATE: New Jersey has 455 new positive cases, pushing our cumulative total to 192,973.Sadly, we are reporting 9 new confirmed COVID-19 deaths for a total of 14,188 lives lost.Learn more:https://t.co/JW1q8awGh7pic.twitter.com/yz7lLPNdyYHOSPITALIZATIONSThere were 500 patients with COVID-19 or under suspicion for it across New Jersey’s 71 hospitals Wednesday night.

The plan calls for the installation of wells at the Peters Mine Pit area of the Ringwood Mines site, then use of those wells to pump an oxygen-releasing compound into the aquifer below the site.That compound is expected to break down the chemicals contaminating the aquifer, including the cancer-linked substance1,4-dioxane.

So why would that change now?Wells joined Fox News Radio’s“The Brian Kilmeade Show”on Thursday. Among the topics of discussion:MLBcommissionerRob Manfred’sdecision torelocatethe2021 All-Star Gamefrom Atlanta to Denver. Wells made it quite clear where he stands on theissue. Per theNew York Post:“I’ve had a lot of dealings with Rob Manfred back in my playing days, and I never liked the guy. To me, how do you change the games, the dynamics, and hurt a city like Atlanta that really needs some income in that situation? I mean, Atlanta’s a great place to play baseball. ... I don’t watch baseball anymore, Brian. I refuse to watch it because of this. I don’t want no part of it, and this was my life … For me not to want to go to a baseball game or even watch, it kills me, because I don’t put up with that kind of crap, and I don’t condone it.”Last week, Manfredpulledthe Midsummer Classic from Atlanta in the wake of Georgia’s recently-passedvoting rights law. On Tuesday, MLB formallyannouncedthe game is heading toCoors Field.The idea ofmoving the gamewas pitched two weeks ago by MLB Players Association executive directorTony Clark. Among the items contained in the legislation, per theWashington Post:Last week,President Joe Bidenbacked the players’ union, tellingESPNhe would“strongly support”relocating the All-Star Game.“This is Jim Crow on steroids what they’re doing in Georgia and 40 other states. What’s it all about? Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Can’t do that? Come on. Or you’re going to close the polling place at 5 o’clock when people just get off? This is all about keeping working folks that I grew up with from being able to vote.”Two days later, Manfred announced Atlanta was losing the 2021 Midsummer Classic.“Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views. I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB Draft.”Introducing Yankees Insider:Get exclusive news, behind-the-scenes observations and the ability to text message directly with beat writersHere are the details on Coors Field landing the All-Star Game, per MLB Communications:Major League Baseball announced today that the 2021 All-Star Game presented by Mastercard and its surrounding events will be hosted by the Colorado Rockies. The national broadcast of the All-Star Game on FOX will be held on Tuesday, July 13th. Baseball’s 91st Midsummer Classic will be the second ever in Denver, joining the 1998 event at Coors Field.MLB chose the Rockies because they were already in the bidding process to host a future All-Star Game. The Rockies had supplied a detailed plan for hotel, event space and security that took months to assemble, and MLB staff had already made several site visits to Denver. In addition, Governor Jared Polis and Mayor Michael Hancock have both committed to provide the necessary facilities and services needed to support this year’s festivities.Commissioner of Baseball Robert D. Manfred, Jr. said: “Major League Baseball is grateful to the Rockies, the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for their support of this summer’s All-Star Game. We appreciate their flexibility and enthusiasm to deliver a first-class event for our game and the region. We look forward to celebrating our sport’s best players and entertaining fans around the world.”“We are excited to host this year’s All-Star festivities at Coors Field,” said Rockies Chief Operating Officer Greg Feasel. “We are confident that our organization along with the city, state, VISIT DENVER and the Denver Sports Commission are capable of putting on this premier event in a relatively quick time frame because of the preparations that had already been done. Summer in Colorado is something everyone in the country should experience, and we embrace this opportunity to show off our beautiful ballpark and everything our city, state and region have to offer.”The Los Angeles Dodgers remain the hosts of the 2022 All-Star Game, as previously announced.

Thank an N.J. teacher for your home’s high resale value | Letters,-5.0,28.33,https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/04/thank-an-nj-teacher-for-your-homes-high-resale-value-letters.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nj-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-07,www.nj.com,"Star-Ledger letters to the editorIn the recent article listing“The 25 N.J. towns with the highest tax bills for schools,”NJ Advance Media, probably inadvertently, also made a list of 25 of the top school districts in New Jersey.This, along withrecent teacher-salary articles,appears to be an ongoing campaign to malign public schools and teachers. It’s as if you’re trying to create animosity toward state-certified professional educators, but this has finally backfired.Some of the “highest tax” districts provide not just the top schools in New Jersey, but in the nation, since New Jersey public schools are tops in the country, as perEducation Week— an item that was reported in your paper on Sept. 2, 2020.I’m a mathematics teacher, so let’s take advantage of this teachable moment. The “top 25” list, based on the dollar amount of the average home’s property tax bill for schools, consists of communities with some of New Jersey’s highest real estate values. On a percentage-of-value basis, these bills may actually be low.But, let’s dig a little further. What exactly keeps the properties in sought-after New Jersey communities so valuable? The excellent school districts!Suppose we did away with property taxes to support schools altogether. I’d say the right thing to do is, when you sell your home, hand over to the local school district the 30% or so premium that its desirable schools added to your selling price.On that basis, you’d be getting quite a deal right now — even a steal. So, good for you. We teachers certainly don’t begrudge you that appreciation in home value. We’re proud to be an integral part of what makes our state so great. It’s why we have dedicated ourselves to what we do for your children and ours.Instead of the constant criticism, how about a little public thank-you to the hard-working teaching professionals in your town who make your children’s lives, your life, and the life of the community better every day?John Sincak, ParsippanyN.J. legislators take aim at ‘Zoom Zombies’Distracted driving is a leading killer on our roads. As natives of Hudson County, one of the most dangerous counties in the state for motor vehicle crashes, we share an urgency to advance solutions to curb this deadly problem.The New Jersey Legislature has a ready opportunity to do so by passingA-885,which bans viewing of distracting content on devices while behind the wheel. This legislation is bolstered by a newTransportation Research Board reportthat endorses prohibitions on distracted viewing. Watching a movie or participating in a video call simply should not be done while driving. Unfortunately, these incidents are occurring on our roads and state laws should be updated to prohibit them.Nationally,over 3,000 people were killed and 420,000 were injuredin distracted driving crashes in 2019 — and the numbers were likely underreported. The monetary cost is approximately $48 billion annually. In New Jersey, traffic crashes cost nearly $13 billion each year.As the parents of teenagers who are driving or soon will be, we are especially attuned to the fact that teens have the largest proportion of drivers distracted in fatal crashes. We urge the Legislature to close an unintended gap in the state’s distracted driving law and prioritize enactment of A-855.Assemblyman Nicholas Chiaravalloti, D-Hudson, and Cathy Chase, Falls Church, Va.Note: Chiaravalloti is the prime sponsor of A-855. Chase is the president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.They feel good by making others feel badIn his recent op-ed article, “Hate is thriving in New Jersey,”Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray overlooked an important point.Bigotry — and the authoritarianism that often accompanies it — is a personal adjustment to fears and insecurities that plague the bigot, and is often successful in a superficial way. It directs self-doubt outwards as anger, makes bigots feel superior and often gives them a purpose in life that they wouldn’t otherwise have, such as advancing the bigot’s group, or suppressing or destroying the targeted group.Bigotry provides an outlet for someone’s externalized anger. It is far more complex than the result of misinformation alone.Jerry Soffer, MaplewoodThe rich can pay moreWhat’s the big deal about President Joe Biden wanting toraise the general corporate tax rate to 28%to help finance an infrastructure package?This tax rate was 35% while Barack Obama was president, and stayed there until the 2017 Donald Trump tax bill cut it to 21%.Corporate income taxes should be at least 50%, as should the top personal income tax rate for rich people — and no loopholes, either!An April 4 “60 Minutes” story about the Ford Foundationstated that the 90 top richest people in America have more wealth than the entire bottom half of America,about 140 million people.Why aren’t the Democrats ending the congressional filibuster and the electoral college, too? Why aren’t we doing what Finland, the nation rated first for happiness of its citizens, is doing? The United States is No. 14.Michael J. Meketen, Old BridgeToo few in N.J. aboard ‘No SALT, no deal’ trainSeveral New Jersey Democrats campaigned for Congress last year with a promise to fight to restore the unlimited deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) against federal income taxes.

Bill Pascrell, D-9th Dist., andJosh Gottheimer, D-5th Dist., are to be commended for stating clearly in the past week thatthey would not back any tax code changes unless Congress restores the SALT deduction.But, why are we not hearing from the other Democrats who campaigned on this issue and were reelected last year?Alfred DelliBovi, Long BranchOur journalism needs your support.

"N.J. reports 45 COVID deaths, 3,578 cases as hospitalizations climb to 7-week high",0.0,49.33,https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2021/04/nj-reports-45-covid-deaths-3578-cases-as-hospitalizations-climb-to-7-week-high.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nj-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-07,www.nj.com,"New Jersey on Wednesday reported another 3,578 cases ofthe coronavirusand an additional 45 deaths as hospitalizations rose to the highest number of patients since mid-February.Gov.Phil Murphyprovided the latest update on the pandemic during a briefing in Trenton. Half of thenewly disclosed COVID-19 casesin the most recent seven-day period originated in five states — with New Jersey among them. The others are Florida, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania.New Jersey’s seven-day average for confirmed cases is 3,559, down 11% from a week ago, but up 26% from a month ago. Officials have warned that a surge in cases from variants that are more easily transmissible is likely driving the recent infections. Increases in hospitalizations typically follow a week to 10 days later.Murphy said outbreak models show a peak in cases and hospitalizations by April 18 in both the best case and moderate case scenarios. In a high scenario, the peak would come in mid-to-late May.“We’re likely looking at a reality somewhere between best and moderate,” Murphy said. “We all have to redouble our efforts to keep the high case model from becoming a reality.”PANDEMIC MODELING UPDATE:This chart shows the high points in our best-case, moderate-case, and high-case scenarios in our key metrics, and the dates on which those numbers are expected to be reached.pic.twitter.com/C19rzRScssThe state’s 71 hospitals reported 2,375 patients as of Tuesday night, up 43 from the day before and the highest number since Feb. 15. But that’s still well below the recent high of 3,873 on Dec. 22.“Hospitalizations remain high. We are seeing increases primarily among young individuals,” said Judy Persichilli, commissioner of the state Department of Health. “New Jersey ranks third in hospitalizations per 100,000 in the United States. Unfortunately, our deaths still remain in double digits.”New Jersey health facilities and vaccine centers have now administered nearly 4.9 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine since the state’s first shot was given Dec. 15. That includes more than 3.1 million people with at least one dose and nearly 1.9 million people considered fully vaccinated, according tostate data.Murphy has set a goal of vaccinating 70% of the state’s 6.9 million adults by the end of June. As of Wednesday morning, 45% of adults have received at least one dose and 27% are considered fully vaccinated. He announced Wednesday thathe and his wife Tammy Murphy plan to be vaccinated Fridayat the Atlantic City mega-site.The state’s rate of transmission is 1.04, down from 1.06 on Tuesday and 1.07 on Monday. Any number over 1 indicates that the outbreak is growing, with each new case leading to at least one other case. A declining transmission rate means the spread is slowing.The positivity rate for tests conducted on Saturday, the most recent day available, was 12.37% out of 24,717 tests. The positivity rate on weekends tends to be higher due to fewer tests being conducted.In all, New Jersey has now reported 824,179 coronavirus cases out of more than 12.3 million PCR tests since the state reported its first case on March 4, 2020. There have also been 113,800 positive antigen tests. Those cases are considered probable, and health officials have warned that positive antigen tests could overlap with the confirmed PCR tests because they are sometimes given in tandem.The state of 9.2 million people has reported 24,749 residents have died from complications related to COVID-19 — 22,176 confirmed deaths and 2,573 fatalities considered probable. The probable deaths, which are revised weekly, increased by five on Wednesday.CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:Live map tracker|Newsletter|HomepageVACCINATIONS BY COUNTYCOUNTY-BY-COUNTY NUMBERS (sorted by most new cases)HOSPITALIZATIONSThere were 2,375 patients hospitalized with confirmed (2,244) or suspected (131) COVID-19 cases across New Jersey’s 71 hospitals as of Tuesday night — 43 more than the previous night.That included 455 in critical or intensive care (seven fewer than the night before), with 249 on ventilators (22 more).There were also 338 COVID-19 patients discharged Tuesday and 367 people admitted.By comparison, hospitalizations peaked at more than 8,300 patients during the first wave of the pandemic in April.SCHOOL CASESNew Jersey has reported 221 in-school coronavirus outbreaks, which have resulted in 1,002 cases among students, teachers and school staff this academic year, according to the state’s dashboard.The state definesschool outbreaksas cases where contact tracers determined two or more students or school staff caught or transmitted COVID-19 in the classroom or during academic activities at school. Those numbers do not include students or staff believed to have been infected outside school or cases that can’t be confirmed as in-school outbreaks.There are about 1.4 million public school students and teachers across the state, though teaching methods amid the outbreak have varied, with some schools teaching in-person, some using a hybrid format and others remaining all-remote.Murphy last week announced most New Jersey schools can moveclassroom desks three feet apart, instead of six feet, under new social distancing guidelines.The governor also said the state’s schoolswill return to full in-person classesfor the next school year and districts will not be allowed to offer virtual learning, even for parents who want that option due to ongoing COVID-19 concerns. But Murphyclarified Tuesdaythat students and teachers who have health issues that could put them at greater risk of a serious coronavirus case will have a virtual option.AGEBREAKDOWNBroken downby age, those 30 to 49 years old make up the largest percentage of New Jersey residents who have caught the virus (30.9%), followed by those 50-64 (22.9%), 18-29 (19.8%), 65-79 (10.4%), 5-17 (9.4%), 80 and older (4.6%) and 0-4 (1.9%).On average, the virus has been more deadly for older residents, especially those with preexisting conditions.

Those numbers have been slowing as vaccinations continue at the facilities.GLOBAL NUMBERSAs of Wednesday, there have been more than 132.5 million positive COVID-19 tests across the world, according toa running tally by Johns Hopkins University.

The average refund is $924 and worth $35.7 million in all, it said.Across the country, taxpayers are due more than $1.3 billion in refunds, the IRS said.The refunds are for people who did not file a2017 tax return,the agency said, but now, an important deadline is looming.“Time is quickly running out for these taxpayers,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. “There’s only a three-year window to claim these refunds, and the window closes onMay 17.”The IRS previouslyextended the 2020 tax year deadlineto May 17.If people don’t claim their refunds within three years, the money becomes the property of the U.S. Treasury, the IRS said.The IRS is encouraging people to file their returns before it’s too late.“The IRS reminds taxpayers seeking a 2017 tax refund that their checks may be held if they have not filed tax returns for 2018 and 2019. In addition, the refund will be applied to any amounts still owed to the IRS or a state tax agency and may be used to offset unpaid child support or past due federal debts, such as student loans,” it said.Low income earners who don’t file a tax return could lose not only their refunds, but also theEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC),which for 2017 was worth as much as $6,318, the agency said.The income thresholds for the 2017 EITC were:If you are missing W-2, 1098, 1099 or 5498 forms for 2017, 2018 or 2019, you should request copies from your employer or bank.

Wingnut turned loose in GOP caucus. What’s next? | Editorial,-13.0,32.33,https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/02/wingnut-turned-loose-in-gop-caucus-whats-next-editorial.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nj-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-02,www.nj.com,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called for President Biden to be impeached on his first day in office and endorsed the execution of prominent Democrats such as Speaker Pelosi, but she gets to write our laws.Greene believes the Parkland and Sandy Hook massacres werefalse-flag operations, says no plane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, and speculates that “space lasers” controlled by a Jewish investors caused California wildfires, but she has a seat on the Education Committee in the US House of Representatives.Greene perpetuates the dangerous lies that the 2020 election was stolen and believes that Americans may need to reclaim freedom with “the price of blood” — the calling card for Capitol insurrectionists — but she remains unmuzzled by spineless House Republican leaders.It is chilling to have anyone whopromotes political violence, foments sedition and spouts insane conspiracy theories in a seat of power. So if the Republican party has any intention of purging its nihilistic fringe and restoring any credibility, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy needs to remove Donald Trump’s favorite freshman from her committees, where she may do serious damage to the rest of us.And if he balks, theDemocrats must do it for him.Because we should agree on this much: This is not just the kind of talk that gets you ostracized in your workplace and disqualified from public service. This is the kind of talk that gets you criminal charges for credible threats of violence and a week in psychiatric observation.I am retweeting this video of Marjorie Taylor Greene without comment. The video speaks for itself.Also, Representative Greene is a Member of the House Republican Caucus in good standing.pic.twitter.com/1geqDo9ND4It was only 24 months ago when another Trump ally,proud Iowa bigot Steve King, wasstripped of his committee assignmentsafter admitting support for white supremacy. McCarthy called King’s remarks “not the party of Lincoln,” and “definitely not American.”His only remark about Greene, however, was a pre-packaged tsk-tsk — largely because she is a Trump acolyte, one of several new members who embraceQAnon, the racist, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that believes that Trump is fighting a deep-state cabal of satanic pedophiles and cannibals. It is now a significant portion of the Republican base: 30 percent of GOP voters have a positive view of QAnon, a new poll found.The Democrats are bringing a resolution to the floor Wednesday to strip Greene of her committee seats, which could force McCarthy’s hand. But if he doesn’t take action — essentially agreeing with Senate leaderMitch McConnell,who called Greenea “cancer” on the party Monday— McCarthy should prepare for the possibility that her flaky faction will take over GOP before long.His only alternative is to surrender to the new ethos, which is tragic, because we are well past the point-and-giggle phase of these proceedings,particularly on a state party level.The Arizona GOPcensured Cindy McCain for endorsing Biden and Republican governor Doug Ducey for imposing COVID emergency rules, and is pushing a bill that would allow the Legislature to override the popular vote in presidential elections.The Oregon GOPpassed a resolution that said the Capitol riot was a false flag, engineered by Trump’s opponents to make him look bad.The Virginia GOPnominee for governor, who calls herself “Trump in heels,” said the Capitol attack was justified because Covid restrictions caused fear that we are “losing our republic.”The Hawaii GOPissued tweets last week defending QAnon and praising the “high quality work” of a Holocaust denier.So it is no surprise that theDepartment of Homeland Security issued a bulletinlast week that there will bemore violence by right wing extremists“emboldened” by the Capitol attack. Greene isn’t so much an outlier as representative of what’s coming up the pipeline: The Republicans have spent four years in abject fear of Trump, and now they are afraid of a violent, racist,ignorant back-bencher from rural Georgia.It still leaves McCarthy with one question to answer: If Marjorie Taylor Greene satisfies his standards for decency, what can we expect next?Our journalism needs your support.

"Despite plea from Sicknick’s family, Senate expected to block commission to investigate Jan. 6 insurrection",-3.0,46.33,https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/05/despite-plea-from-sicknicks-family-senate-expected-to-block-commission-to-investigate-jan-6-insurrection.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nj-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-28,www.nj.com,"Gladys Sicknick, center, mother of Brian Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer who died after the Jan. 6 mob attack on Congress, leaves a May 27, 2021, meeting with Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin after urging him to support an independent commission to investigate the insurrection. At far right is Sicknick's girlfriend,  Sandra Garza.APA day after hearing pleas from the mother and girlfriend of the late Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, Senate Republicans on Friday were poised to block anindependent, bipartisan commissionto investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.Gladys Sicknick and Sandra Garza on Thursday had held face-to-face meetings with several Republicans, urging them to support the commission. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell came out against the panel, and it appeared that proponents of the commission could not attract support from the 10 GOP senators needed to bring the legislation up for debate.“If they look at the footage that happened, it’s very obvious that that was not a peaceful day,” Garza said after one meeting on Thursday. “Police officers were getting attacked, they were getting beaten, fire extinguishers were being thrown at them, they were being attacked by flag poles.”The panel, to be comprised of five Democrats and five Republicans with support from both parties required to issue subpoenas, would have been modeled after the 9/11 Commission chaired by former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, who endorsed a similar probe of Jan. 6.“Usually I stay in the background,” Sicknick said. “I couldn’t stay quiet any more.”Brian Sicknick, anative of South River, was one of five people who died after pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol while Congress was certifying the electoral votes that would make Joe Biden the next president. Hundreds of rioters were arrested.A majority of Americans, 55%, called the Capitol attack an assault on democracy that should not be forgotten, while 39% — including 74% of Republicans — said it was time to move on, according to aQuinnipiac University pollreleased Thursday.Once the Capitol was cleared on Jan. 6, a majority of House Republicans, including Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-2nd Dist.,voted against certifying the electoral votesin two battleground states. Trump wasimpeached a week laterfor an unprecedented second time on charges of inciting the riot.Sicknicklay in honorin the Capitol Rotunda in February as President Joe Biden and congressional leaders paid their respects.The commission’s mandate would be to look at what happened on Jan. 6 and the reasons why it occurred, including whether Trump and congressional Republicans played any role in encouraging the insurrection, such asgiving reconnaissance toursof the Capitol the day before, as alleged by Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-11th Dist.On Tuesday, Trump issued a statement claiming that in the U.S. “our elections are rigged, corrupt, and stolen.”The U.S. House approved the commission on May 19, with 35 Republicans, including Rep. Chris Smith, R-4th Dist., joining every Democrat in voting yes. The vote came after negotiations led to an agreement to evenly divide the 10-member panel between the parties and to issue a report by the end of the year as to not continue the investigation into the 2022 midterm elections.But after approving the talks, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, rejected the outcome and opposed the commission.So did McConnell, of Kentucky, who said on the Senate floor Thursday that “there is no new fact about that day that we need the Democrats’ extraneous commission to uncover.”At the same time, several Republicanshave downplayed the insurrection, with Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., calling it a “normal tourist visit,” Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., accusing federal prosecutors of “harassing peaceful patriots,” and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., repeating the debunked claim that antifa, the loose confederation of anti-fascist protesters, was responsible.House Republicans removedRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., from her leadership position when she refused to question the outcome of the 2020 election and acknowledged that Biden was the president.Our journalism needs your support.

It increased Monday to 0.96. It was at 0.95 for two consecutive days prior to Monday.

But, right now, with the numbers we are seeing, we have to take these steps to preserve and protect — as best we can — public health and to try to slow the spread of this virus.”Murphy added that “indoor sports is an area of concern” and sports “generally is an area of concern.”The state had recently bannedall indoor interstate organized sportsup to the high school level to fight the virus.Still, the governor said it’s “very hard to distinguish” whether it’s from the actual sporting event or pre- or post-game activities — “whether it’s the locker room or a pizza party.”Murphy also said specifically that “hockey is in our crosshairs.”“I’m not sure why, but we are hearing more than anecdotal, more than here or there, a lot of noncompliance, including by parents,” he said. “I’ve got nothing against hockey, but watch yourselves. We have that high on the list right now. And unless we see better compliance and lower levels of infection, we will take action.”CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:Live map tracker|Newsletter|HomepageIndoor religious services and celebrations, political activities, weddings, funerals and memorial services, and performances in New Jersey will continue to be limited to 25% of capacity but with a maximum of 150 people. Indoor dining will also remain limited to 25% capacity, Murphy said.The governor stressed that even in outdoor gatherings, people are still subject to social-distancing restrictions and required to wear masks when it’s not possible to keep your distance from others.New Jersey reported 3,399 new cases Friday, 4,395 on Saturday, 4540 on Sunday, and2,232on Monday.Both Saturday and Sunday’s cases broke records — but with a caveat. The state’s testing capacity in the spring was about 4,000 tests a daily, while current daily testing ranges from between 15,000 to 55,000 a day, according to the state Department of Health’s COVID-19 dashboard. That means there were likely many more cases in the spring that went undetected.Hospitalizations are still far below the more than 8,000 patients New Jersey had in April and deaths have so far not risen at the rate they did in the spring.Still, hospitalizations are at their highest level since June, daily percent positivity is steadily climbing and officials warn deaths are likely to increase. There were 2,320 patients hospitalized in New Jersey with confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases as of Monday night — the most since May 30. The state reported 14 more deaths Monday.The executive order says that about 13% of all outbreaks in New Jersey between March 20 through Nov. 1 came from private gatherings.Murphy has instituted a number of other restrictions to help fight the spread. New Jersey bars and restaurants are nowrequired to close indoor diningbetween 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. each day. Plus, the governor has given local governmentsthe choice to institute 8 p.m. business closingsif they want.The governor also said Mondaythe state reserves the rightto order another near-lockdown like it did to combat the first wave in the spring.“Sadly, we have to with these numbers,” Murphy said.Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

N.J. officer was fired though sex assault charge against him was dropped. Now he’s suing.,0.0,48.33,https://www.nj.com/union/2020/11/nj-officer-was-fired-though-sex-assault-charge-against-him-was-dropped-now-hes-suing.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nj-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-17,www.nj.com,"North Plainfield Officer Mikeedwar Jean-BaptisteProvided by Toscano Law FirmA North Plainfield police officer who was fired after asexual assault charge against him was droppedhas filed two lawsuits seeking his job back and financial damages, claiming he was treated unfairly because he is Black.Mikeedwar Jean-Baptiste, 32, of Union, was a police officer in theNorth Plainfield Police Departmentfor seven years before accusations he sexually assaulted a homeless woman in 2017 derailed his career.But after the charge was dropped in 2019 when the woman refused to testify, the police department still moved to terminate Jean-Baptiste in what he claims is a racist vendetta. The borough attorney has denied this in an answer filed in court.The suit filed Oct. 22 by Union attorney Lawrence N. Lavigne names as defendants the police department, the borough, Chief William Parenti and Lt. Russell Flynn, who conducted an internal affairs investigation.Jean-Baptiste has maintained for years that what really happened in a Kenilworth hotel March 3, 2017 was a sexual encounter between two consenting adults when he was off duty.In court documents, authorities said the woman went to police for help because she and her son were homeless. Police claimed in a probable cause statement that Jean-Baptiste first referred her to social services but ultimately got them a hotel room and raped her while she said “no” and tried to get away.The lawsuit said the accusation of sexual assault was actually made by her boyfriend, who came to the hotel the next day and argued with her, resulting in Kenilworth police being called. The suit said she declined to file a complaint against him but the borough denied this in a court filing.Kenilworth police notified North Plainfield police and he was suspended with pay and questioned by Flynn as part of an internal affairs investigation, the suit said.On March 23, 2017, Flynn found the woman in the Middlesex County jail and “illegally and improperly interviewed the incarcerated alleged victim for 20 minutes without recording the interview” or taking notes, which the suit claims violated local and state law enforcement guidelines and rules.The lawsuit claims she still didn’t want to file charges but Flynn eventually coerced her into doing so — something the borough’s attorney, Eric M. Bernstein, also denied in court filings. Jean-Baptiste was suspended without pay and indicted in January of 2018. He was earning a salary of $73,474, state records show.The criminal charge wasdropped just before trialin June of 2019, with Union County Assistant Prosecutor Scott Peterson stating in court that the woman did not wish to relive the assault by taking the stand.At the time, Jean-Baptiste’s criminal attorney, Patrick Toscano, demanded that the police department reinstate his client to active duty, reimburse him for lost pay and pay his criminal legal fees at $625 an hour.Instead, the police department and a municipal judge ruled in September of 2019 that he would be fired for misconduct.The lawsuit claims that Flynn and Parenti wanted Jean-Baptiste fired because he was Black, and so encouraged Kenilworth police and prosecutors to pursue the charges against Jean-Baptiste despite the woman’s refusal to participate and a lack of evidence. Bernstein, the borough attorney, denied this in court.Jean-Baptiste claims in the suit he suffered economically and emotionally and deserves compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys fees and costsIn a separate civil complaint filed Oct. 16 by Morristown attorney Robert E. Dunn, Jean-Baptiste asked a judge to reinstate him. He argued that the notice of disciplinary charges and the hearing were deficient and lacked specifics about the allegations, as well as evidence.Rebecca Everett may be reached atreverett@njadvancemedia.com.

Along with Saturday’s slight drop in cases, the rate of transmission of the virus went down from 1.18 on Friday to 1.16.

"Without Enough Water To Go Around, Farmers In California Are Exhausting Aquifers",-1.67,48.33,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/22/1019483661/without-enough-water-to-go-around-farmers-in-california-are-exhausting-aquifers,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,www.npr.org,"The next time you pick up some California-grown carrots or melons in the grocery store, consider the curious, contested odyssey of the water that fed them. Chances are, farmers pumped that water from underground aquifers on a scale that's become unsustainable, especially as the planet heats up.Facing an ongoing drought that is squeezing surface water supplies, farmers are extracting groundwater at higher rates to continue growing food as usual.California's farmers probably will pump an additional six to seven million acre-feet of water from their wells this year, above what they normally use, according toJosue Medellin-Azuara, a water expert at the University of California, Merced. That quantity would cover 10,000 square miles with a foot of water, and far exceeds the amount that naturally replenishes the aquifer, even during a year with normal rainfall.""It's a huge amount,""says Steve Jackson, a farmer in Visalia who helps to manage 40,000 acres of almonds and other crops. ""I'd say 90 to 95 percent of our crop demands this year are going to be met by groundwater.""This year, however, may mark the beginning of the end of California's great groundwater grab. The state is preparing to phase in new limits on groundwater pumping that will force painful adjustments on the state's farmers.California is a powerhouse of food production, growing some 40 percent of the country's fruit, vegetables, and nuts. Yet the production depends on a supply of water that's increasingly fragile and unreliable as the climate warms.""Drought reveals the lie of a place,"" says Mark Arax, the Fresno-based author ofThe Dreamt Land, a history of California's water conflicts. ""The lie is our ambition. We've taken on too much.""In good years, an intricate system of dams, aqueducts, and irrigation canals captures water from rivers and melting snow, much of it in the northern part of the state, and moves that water to fields in the wide Central Valley where most crops are grown. The system also supplies coastal cities, but agriculture remains the largest consumer of water.This year, rivers are running low. The state's biggest reservoirs containless than halfthe average amount of water, and farmers have been forced to rely on their wells. ""This year, there is no allotment, because there is no water,"" says Kathy Briano, referring to the amount of water that farmers are assigned for irrigation use. Briano grows almonds near the town of Porterville, and she's relying on her wells instead.Until now, groundwater use in California has been unrestricted. Farmers and cities could pump as much as they wished. And there was a time when that water source seemed inexhaustible.The Central Valley aquifer is like a giant, multi-layered lake beneath the ground. ""A hundred years ago, when you tapped a foot into the earth, in certain parts of the valley, the water would gush out,"" Arax says. At that time, wells typically only needed to be 50 or 80 feet deep.But year after year, towns and farmers --- but mostly farmers --- pumped more water out of the aquifer than nature put back in, and the water table fell. Today, farmers and towns are drilling wells over a thousand feet deep. Extracting so much water even changed the region's geology.""As you draw the water up and out of the earth, the earth itself then collapses and sinks,"" Arax says. ""We're not sinking by inches. We're sinking by feet.""Briano says the problems first became obvious during the drought of 2014-2015. ""Everybody was pumping,"" she says. ""You had to pump all that you needed, and you just brought that groundwater down to nothing.""On her ranch, the water table dropped by 60 feet. The well that supplied water to her house went dry. The same thing happened to hundreds of people who relied on shallow wells in the nearby town of East Porterville. ""People were without water, and they had to bring water tanks in. They had no water at all!"" she says.During that drought, there was growing pressure to enact limits on groundwater use. Susana De Anda, executive director of theCommunity Water Center, in the town of Visalia, was among those pushing for change. ""When 90 percent of our valley residents rely on groundwater, we have to be sure that we're sharing that for all beneficial uses,"" she says. ""That means that we should not over-pump.""In 2014, California passed theSustainable Groundwater Management Act(SGMA). It requires big changes, but they will be enforced only gradually, over the next two decades.Under this law, overuse of the aquifer must end by 2040. By that date, use and replenishment of the state's groundwater must be in balance.State and local officials now are coming up with limits on groundwater use to achieve this. In practice, it could mean that farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, which occupies a large area of the Central Valley between Sacramento and Bakersfield, will have to cut their groundwater pumping by 70 or 80 percent by 2040, compared to what they're using this year.In order to enforce these limits, some authorities are requiring meters on wells. Others are monitoring water use through satellites that can detect which crops are being grown.The reaction among farmers has been mixed. Some, like Steve Jackson, agree that limits are necessary, even though groundwater has kept his farm alive in drought years. ""It is a lifeline, but I think that it's a lifeline that we've all taken for granted, and it's not infinite,""he says. ""I think that's what's coming home to all of us.""The limits probably will mean that some land will no longer grow crops, although there's dispute about how much. One study, backed by the agricultural industry,predictsthat a million acres, or 20 percent of the fields in the San Joaquin Valley, will be taken out of production. Other researchersthinkit will be half that much. Farmers are likely to adapt by shifting their limited water supplies to their most valuable crops. They also will be able, for the first time, to buy and sell groundwater allotments, shifting the water to the places where it's worth the most.Other farmers, like Kathy Briano, reject the prospect of idling fertile Central Valley land. Briano agrees that it makes sense to protect the aquifer. But to make up for it, she wants the state to deliver more water from dams and reservoirs, to which she says the farms are entitled. ""My solution is, you need to bring us more water,"" she says. ""We can't keep taking from the valley, because we're taking away [food] production, and where can we grow everything? Right here!""Mark Arax, the writer, says the changing climate is likely to breed more conflicts like this, also in other parts of the country. ""How we deal with this becomes an example for the rest of America, when it comes to their doorstep,"" he says.The California dream was born in the Gold Rush, claiming nature and re-shaping the land. Now, Arax says, it's time to re-invent that dream."
Georgia County Tried To Help Everyone Facing Eviction. Now A Crisis Looms,-3.67,45.33,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/23/1019324305/georgia-county-tried-to-help-everyone-facing-eviction-now-a-crisis-looms,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.npr.org,"Back around the start of the year, Michael Thurmond had a problem. He's the top elected official in DeKalb County, Ga. Congress had approved about $50 billion to help people catch up and pay rent to avoid eviction.But Thurmond worried that his county wouldn't get enough money to help everybody.""What do I say to the family who is the first in line after all the money has run out?"" he asks.So he and county officials decided to impose limits. Congress authorized more than a year of back rent assistance that would be paid in full. But the county imposed a different rule — it pays just 60% of the back rent someone owes. The landlord is supposed to absorb the loss beyond that or the renter comes up with the difference or something in between.""Either you can help a smaller number of people by providing them greater assistance or you help a larger number of people by providing them with less assistance,"" Thurmond says. ""So we took the position that we should help as many families as possible.""But that hasn't been the way things have played out. And with a federal eviction moratorium expiring next week, critics say DeKalb has reached a crisis moment.Safiya Kitwana's landlord sticks notes with a big red Sharpie marker on her door, telling her she's facing eviction and now owes upward of $13,000.""When they leave the note by the door, my kids, like they're wondering, 'Mommy, what we're going to do?' "" she says. ""I don't have answers for them.""Kitwana is exactly the type of person Congress was trying to help. She's a single mom with two teenage kids living in Lithonia, Ga. She lost her job at a call center when COVID-19 cases were spiking last winter.And she quickly applied when the county's rental assistance portal went live in February.""I was probably one of the first people that submitted that application,"" she says.Finding work again has been hard. She has a back injury and needs a desk job. But after she applied for the rental assistance money, she got no response.""I submitted my application at least four different times,"" she says. ""And nobody would get back to me.""Around the country, many states and counties had trouble getting online systems for rental assistance up and running. Many of them crashed. In DeKalb, the systemgot hacked. Some programs got bogged down with bureaucratic rules.All these problems have been delaying people getting help.In fact, in DeKalb County, 93% of the money that's been allocated still hasn't reached anybody. (The county was awarded $38.7 million and says it has only managed to distribute $2.8 million.)Kitwana recently heard that she had finally been approved. But with that cap in DeKalb County — she can only get 60% of the rent she owes. That still leaves her thousands of dollars behind. She doesn't have it. And so her landlord rejected the offer and is on the verge of evicting her.""The landlord, they're not accepting it,"" she says. ""There's myself and tons of families that are going through this, and I'm trying to figure out where does this make sense?""It doesn't make sense, says Rebecca Yae with the National Low Income Housing Coalition. ""Of all the other programs that I've seen, this is definitely one of the more shocking ones."" Yae says capping payments for back rent at 60% is far too restrictive. ""This is extremely low, unfathomable; they really should be paying the full back rent.""DeKalb's cap on back rent is certainly more restrictive than other nearby counties in Georgia. Gwinnett, Clayton and Cobb counties do not have caps that low, and agencies in the city of Atlanta and Clayton County are paying 100% of back rent.Yae says many other programs besides DeKalb's are also having trouble getting more than a small fraction of their money out the door.Meanwhile, a federal moratorium that's been preventing a lot of evictions is set to expire next week.""There is really no time left,"" Yae says. ""Programs need to change now.""For his part, DeKalb's Thurmond says despite the problems, his county is working hard to help all the people it can.""I do believe that if we continue to work at it and find a solution, we can help people,"" he tells NPR. ""We've helped over 500 families in DeKalb County. That's real.""He says the program provides lawyers to help renters negotiate with landlords. It's made some other improvements.But that 60% cap on back rent is still in place. And legal aid lawyers say that's going to mean hundreds of people such as Kitwana are going to get evicted.They say they would also like to see DeKalb and other counties in the area give that money for back rent directly to renters if the landlord rejects the deal. The Treasury Department guidelines encourage that. But some programs, including DeKalb's, still are not doing it.For her part, Kitwana is just hoping the county changes its rules soon.""They're not reevaluating what they're doing and how they're hurting families,"" she says.Thurmond says he is reevaluating and everything is on the table. So the county might decide to pay more back rent or pay it in full. But with the eviction moratorium expiring next week, the clock is ticking."
Texas Begins Jailing Border Crossers On Trespassing Charges,-3.67,45.67,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/23/1019706421/texas-arrests-border-crossers-trespassing-charges,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.npr.org,"AUSTIN, Texas — Texas is beginning to arrest migrants on trespassing charges along the U.S.-Mexico border as part of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's actions that he says are needed to slow the number of border crossings, jailing at least 10 people so far with more on the way, authorities said Thursday.The arrests put in motion plans that Abbott first announced in June, when he also said that Texas would continue building former President Donald Trump'sborder walland called on other governors to deploy law enforcement and National Guard members to the southern border.The detainees are being held at what had been an empty state prison in Dilley, Texas, about 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) north of the border city of Laredo, said Robert Hurst, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. He said the converted facility will be able to hold more than 950 people.All of those arrested so far have been single adult men, according to Val Verde County Attorney David Martinez, who said he was advised last week that the number of migrant arrests could increase to as many as 100 or 200 per day. Such large numbers, he said, ""would overwhelm not only my office, but our entire system pretty quickly.""Most land along the southern Texas border is private, but Martinez said his understanding was that state troopers would not arrest family units. Last week, U.S. officials reported that they had encountered 55,805 members of families with children in June, which was up 25% from the previous month. That figure still remains far below the high of 88,587 in May 2019.""If John Doe is caught on my property and he has his wife and his children with him, chances are he's not going to be arrested,"" Martinez said. ""That's what's been represented to me.""A spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety did not immediately return a message Thursday.Val Verde County, which has around 50,000 residents, has become the backdrop of Abbott's criticism of President Joe Biden over the border as the two-term governor, who is up for reelection in 2022, has sought to take Trump's mantle on immigration. He returned to the county last weekend along with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials, including Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, who tweeted this week that she had tested positive for COVID-19.""The state jail commission has worked out a way to jail far more people that are currently being jailed,"" Abbott said during his visit on Saturday.But the largest Texas counties along the southern border, where crossings are typically the highest, have rejected Abbott's offer to heighten enforcement and accept disaster declarations, which governors typically only grant during events like hurricanes or wildfire.Migrants arrested by state troopers for trespassing first began showing up to the former prison on Tuesday. Prison officials said in a statement said that preparations for the facility included temporary air conditioning — which many Texas prisons don't have in living areas — and training and licensing jailers.Since first announcing earlier this summer that Texas would begin charging migrants with state crimes, Abbott has said law enforcement would not be involved in ""catch and release"" and said those arrested would spend time behind bars. But Martinez said he would handle the cases same as usually does, which typically means offering time served.""My office is working really hard to try to minimize the amount of time that they have to sit in that jail,"" he said."
Prosecutors Say They Have Evidence Of More Abuse And Bribery In The R. Kelly Case,0.0,52.67,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/23/1019972507/r-kelly-prosecutors-evidence-more-crimes-bribery-trial,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.npr.org,"Editor's note: This report includes allegations of sexual assault and physical abuse.Federal prosecutors are seeking to have evidence of what they say are more alleged, but uncharged, crimes committed by R&B singer R. Kelly admitted at his upcoming trial in New York. Theallegationsinclude the abuse of teenage girls and women dating as far back as 1991, the sexual abuse of a 17-year-old boy, physical abuse, hush payments and bribery.The New York indictment, which is one of two sets of federal charges currently levied against Kelly, was filed inMarch 2020and includes six alleged victims.The filing submitted by the prosecutors on Friday includes 20 Jane Does and two John Does. In or around December 2006, the government alleges, Kelly initiated a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old boy whom he had met at a Chicago McDonald's, and directed the boy to have sexual encounters with other people as well.That boy introduced Kelly to a second teenage boy, John Doe No. 2, who was then 16 or 17 years old, with whom Kelly allegedly tried to start a sexual relationship as well. Several years later, Kelly is alleged to have started having sex with this second John Doe, and also forced several of his girlfriends and other sexual partners, including a minor girl, to have sex with this young man. Prosecutors say that Kelly often filmed those incidents.The government is also asking the judge to allow video recordings of Kelly physically and verbally abusing two women as evidence at the trial.The prosecutors also allege that around 1994, Kelly had one of his associates pay an Illinois state employee $500 to create a fake ID for the singer Aaliyah, who was then 15 years old and Kelly's protégée. The purpose, they say, was so that Kelly could marry Aaliyah, because Kelly believed that she was pregnant — and if they were married, she could not then be forced to testify against him in court. (The two were married on Aug. 31, 1994. R. Kelly was indictedin 2002on 21 counts of child pornography, but was eventually acquittedin 2008. Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001.)The prosecutors also allege bribery involving Kelly and his associates that transpired far more recently. Following the release of the widely seenSurviving R. Kellydocuseriesin early 2019, a person listed in the court filings as Kelly's ""crisis manager"" allegedly told the singer that he was in contact with ""two people"" who ""know a lot"" and suggested that Kelly ""figure out what you can do for them,"" indicating that they were open to being bribed. Kelly allegedly responded by asking how much money was needed. In the same conversation, the ""crisis manager"" told the singer that he had paid a clerk in Cook County, Ill., $2500 and had given the clerk a burner phone to pass along information about Kelly's legal situation.Kelly is currently being held in Brooklyn. The two sets of federal charges against him are pending in New York andin Illinois. In all, he faces 22 federal criminal charges that involve allegedly abusing girls and women over the course of more than two decades, and that he led a circle of managers, drivers, bodyguards and other entourage members who helped him. His New York trial is scheduled to begin on Aug. 9."
The Sexualization Of Women In Sports Extends Even To What They Wear,-0.67,38.67,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/23/1019343453/women-sports-sexualization-uniforms-problem,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.npr.org,"It's 2021, but the policing of female athletes' bodies is a practice that continues to thrive.The Norwegian women's beach handball team is in abattlewith the sport's governing bodies to wear less-revealing uniforms. After the team'srepeated complaintsabout therequired bikini bottomswere reportedly ignored, they wore shorts during a recent game in protest and were fined 150 euros (around $175) per player.It's similar in theme to another trending story: Welsh Paralympian Olivia Breen recentlyrecounteda competition official remarking that her briefs were ""too short and inappropriate."" Sharing her story led other female athletes who have experienced similar body policing to do the same, she said onInstagram.It has been a shock to many that women athletes are still having to fight such battles, but to some, it's no surprise at all.For retired soccer playerBriana Scurry, the ordeal that the Norwegian team is facing is ""enraging"" and ""absurd"" — and not unfamiliar, she told NPR. Scurry, who has played in three World Cups and has two Olympic gold medals, recalled representing the U.S. in the Olympics in the 1990s and the women's team having to wear ""hand-me-down jerseys and shorts from the men's team"" because the sponsor made the uniforms with only the male team in mind.The women's skill had earned them a presence on a global stage, yet they were stuck wearing ill-fitting uniforms — an unnecessary distraction that can be demoralizing.""You should feel like a superhero in itbecause you're representing in a very special and positive and powerful way, and [you shouldn't] have to worry about the cut of the short,"" Scurry said.Unfortunately, unreasonable expectations aren't new. One of the most egregious offenses occurred in 2012, when the Badminton World Federation tried (andfailed) to force female players to wear skirts in order to ""look feminine and have a nice presentation.""On the flip side, the International Volleyball Federation softened its regulations in 2016 to allow players towear hijabsin a bid to make the sport more welcoming.In general, the strictness of any sport's dress code is dependent on its governing body. It's why some female athletes may have a range of uniform options to choose from, while others, like the Norwegian women's beach handball team, still find themselves battling antiquated dress codes.Women being judged on their perceived femininity rather than their athleticism is a symptom of a bigger problem. Sports are often a ""microcosm of our society,"" said Akilah Carter-Francique, the executive director for the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change at San José State University.""There are those societal expectations that fall in line with gender norms that are couched in patriarchy about how women should present themselves. ... From hair to makeup to clothing, to how tight [or loose] the clothing is, to the colors,"" Carter-Francique told NPR. ""[All] so that they can be more in line with this notion of girlhood, of womanhood, of what is deemed femininity.""Having to combat sexist standards that echo what they're already dealing with isn't the only thing that can turn girls away. A lack of access and cultural stigma also contribute to low participation numbers, according toa reportfrom the Women's Sports Foundation, and girls who do stick with sports may find themselves in programs that receive less attention and funding.A change in culture needs to happen, Scurry said.""It starts with the dollar, and it starts with the seed — not the fruit,"" Scurry said. ""If you were planting 100 seeds and you plant 98 on one side and two on the other? Good luck with the harvest on the other side. ... You have to be a lot more fair in the beginning, not at the end."""
Public Health Experts Call On CDC To Change Its Mask Guidance,-6.0,45.33,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/22/1019311989/public-health-experts-call-on-cdc-to-endorse-masking-indoors,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,www.npr.org,"Thesummer surgein COVID-19 cases is an unwelcome surprise for health officials and experts who thought, for a brief period, that the U.S. had the coronavirus pandemic largely under control.""This is the low season. It shouldn't be spreading as fast during summer,"" saysAli Mokdad, who tracks coronavirus trends at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. Respiratory diseases such as the flu and COVID-19 usually spike in the winter, when people spend much of their time sequestered indoors.But now, in the blazing heat of summer,hospitals in some parts of the countryare again getting slammed with COVID-19 patients. Holiday gatherings over the Fourth of July — which President Biden once hoped would mark the country'sindependence from the virus— may have fuelednew outbreaks. Cases, hospitalizations and deaths areticking upafter a long decline.Back in mid-May, whenover a million new peoplewere getting vaccinated each day, theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidancedeclaring that it was safe — for fully vaccinated people — to shed their masks in most settings. ""You can do things you stopped doing because of the pandemic,"" the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said at the time.Now, with vaccination progress stalling, a growing chorus of doctors and experts is saying the CDC let up on masking too early. They want the nation's public health agency to call for masking and mitigation measures in areas that are suffering, to stop the virus's spread.""We need to reduce the circulation of the virus right now, so when we start the surge in the winter, we will be in a better position,"" Mokdad says.The CDC's May guidance was based on sound science but led to poor policies, saysDr. Ali Khan, a former CDC official who's now at the University of Nebraska Medical Center's College of Public Health. The vaccines do protect people from getting seriously ill from COVID-19, so letting vaccinated people stop wearing masks made sense.""The science was strong at that time,"" Khan says. The CDC intended for the announcement to encourage people to get vaccinated. It did for some, says Khan, but it also led to the de facto lifting of mask policies for unvaccinated people — just before the more transmissible delta variant started to take hold.The summer surge, he says, is the result: ""Those who didn't want to wear a mask and didn't want to get vaccinated are out there now spreading disease to others who are not vaccinated.""The timing of the guidance was off, saysJessica Malaty Rivera, an infectious disease epidemiologist who has worked with theCOVID Tracking Project.""When the Biden administration and the CDC [said] if you're vaccinated, you can take your mask off, I screamed,"" she says. ""Because for so long, we've been talking about getting to a place where transmission is low and vaccination is high. Transmission was lower [at the time]. Vaccination was not high. So it seemed truly premature.""The tone of the messaging also signaled to vaccinated people that they could throw caution to the wind, Rivera says. ""It gave people, in their minds, immunity passports,"" she says. ""It said to them, 'I'm vaccinated — I can go to Miami. I'm vaccinated — I can go to this party in a basement.' ""The messaging around lifting mask use should have been more gradual, Rivera says: ""You can change some of your behavior, but don't just have a rager as if the pandemic wasn't happening. Calibrating, instead of eliminating [all caution], was where we needed to go.""It's not too late for the CDC to change its tune now, particularly with a more transmissible virus spreading rapidly, saysDr. Carlos del Rio, an epidemiologist at Emory University: ""In my mind, it would be advisable for CDC to say, given the spread of the delta variant in our country, we would recommend thatpeople go back to using masks indoors,"" particularly in areas with huge spikes in cases.""It would be helpful for the CDC to say, if your numbers get to a certain level, you should recommend masking,"" he says.Implementing indoor mask mandates for everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is ""the right and scientific thing to do,"" says IHME's Mokdad. ""That's the only way we can send a signal to the public in the United States that we're not out of danger, [while] we encourage [more] people to go and get the vaccine.""Several health care organizations have recently called for universal masking for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, includingNational Nurses United, a large nurses union, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, whichrecently recommended universal masking in schools. Rivera says this policy would be safer and easier to implement than theCDC's guidance, which offers different options for vaccinated and unvaccinated people.""Who is going to be monitoring who is vaccinated and who is unvaccinated? Teachers, administrators, parents?"" Rivera asks. She adds that having different rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated people ""creates all kinds of issues of equity and judgment and access.""So far, the CDC stands by its statement that vaccinated people do not generally need to wear masks. ""At this time, we have no intention of changing our masking guidance,"" wrote CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald, in bold text, in an email to NPR.In a White Housepress briefing on July 22, the CDC's Walensky described mask-wearing, for vaccinated people, as ""a very individual choice.""""You have exceptional levels of protection from that vaccine, and you may choose to add an extra layer of protection by putting on a mask,"" she said, while also suggesting that local officials in places with large gaps in vaccination coverage and rising case rates consider ""additional measures.""The public is lulled by the fact that the summer surge is largely hitting unvaccinated young people, who are more likely to survive COVID-19, says Khan. But there's a danger that the surge in cases could spill back into more vulnerable groups, such as older adults and immunocompromised people.""There are still many people in those high-risk groups that have not yet gotten the vaccine, and it's not 100% effective,"" he notes. Meanwhile, cases are rising rapidly week over week.Vaccinated people are still protected. But the more virus that's circulating in the community, the more likely it is that people — both unvaccinated and vaccinated — will get it.""What you don't want is disease to spread from younger people back into high-risk individuals, which would be a disaster,"" Khan says.NPR's Allison Aubrey, Selena Simmons-Duffin and Rob Stein contributed to this report."
Facebook Boots NYU Disinformation Researchers Off Its Platform And Critics Cry Foul,-2.0,43.75,https://www.npr.org/2021/08/04/1024791053/facebook-boots-nyu-disinformation-researchers-off-its-platform-and-critics-cry-f,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-04,www.npr.org,"Facebook has blocked a team of New York University researchers studying political ads and COVID-19 misinformation from accessing its site, a move that critics say is meant to silence research that makes the company look bad.The researchers at theNYU Ad Observatorylaunched a tool last year to collect data about the political ads people see on Facebook. Around 16,000 people have installed the browser extension. It enables them to share data with the researchers about which ads the users are shown and why those ads were targeted at them.Facebook said on Tuesday that it had disabled the researchers' personal accounts, pages, apps and access to its platform.""NYU's Ad Observatory project studied political ads using unauthorized means to access and collect data from Facebook, in violation of our terms of service,"" Mike Clark, Facebook's product management director, wrote in ablog post.He said Facebook took action ""to stop unauthorized scraping and protect people's privacy"" in compliance with an agreement it reached with the Federal Trade Commission in 2019, when it paid a$5 billion penaltystemming from the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal.But on Wednesday, the researchers said they're not gathering private information about Facebook users.""We really don't collect anything that isn't an ad, that isn't public, and we're pretty careful about how we do it,"" said Laura Edelson, a doctoral candidate at NYU who helps lead the research project and whose account Facebook disabled. She noted that the code for the browser extension is public and that it has been reviewed by outside experts.Facebook says the browser extension violates its privacy rules because it collects information about advertisers, including their names, Facebook IDs and photos. The company says the data collected by the tool could also be used to identify information about users who interacted with the ads but did not consent to share their information.Damon McCoy, an associate professor at NYU who was also cut off from Facebook, said he believes the company is using privacy claims as a pretext because it's unhappy with the team's research.""It feels like Facebook is trying to intimidate us, and not just us, but they're trying to send a message to other independent researchers that are trying to study their platform,"" he said. ""We need transparency and accountability.""NYU Cybersecurity for Democracy, the team of researchers behind the Ad Observatory project, foundmisleading political adsthriving on Facebook in November 2020 despite the platform's policies; uncoveredflaws in the company's political ad disclosures; and tracked the degree to whichright-wing misinformationgets more engagement on the platform. They are also part of aproject that is tracking false claims about COVID-19 and vaccineson social media, a subject that has become a source of tension betweenFacebook and the White Housein recent weeks.""This is sort of a blind men and an elephant problem,"" Edelson said.To gain a more complete picture of disinformation on Facebook, she said, ""we really need to be able to put the pieces together, from the way ads that advertise a certain message are publicized to the way they're targeted"" to messages that aren't ads but that are posted by people looking to spread false information in a coordinated way.Facebook publishes its ownlibrary of political adswith information about who paid for an ad and when it ran, but it does not include details on how ads are targeted to specific subsets of users. It does make ad targeting data available to researchers who participate in a program it controls.In the blog post, Facebook's Clark said that the company offers researchers ""privacy-protective methods to collect and analyze data"" and that ""we welcome research that holds us accountable, and doesn't compromise the security of our platform or the privacy of the people who use it.""The NYU researchers say their work is an important independent check on Facebook.""We don't think Facebook should get to decide who gets to study it and who doesn't,"" Edelson said.Facebook declined to comment further on Edelson and McCoy's claims.On Wednesday, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., called Facebook's decision to disable the NYU team's access ""deeply concerning.""""For several years now, I have called on social media platforms like Facebook to work with, and better empower, independent researchers, whose efforts consistently improve the integrity and safety of social media platforms by exposing harmful and exploitative activity,"" he said in a statement. ""Instead, Facebook has seemingly done the opposite.""Warner also called on Congress ""to act to bring greater transparency to the shadowy world of online advertising.""Fellow Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon also slammed the social network, writing in aTwitter post: ""After years of abusing users' privacy, it's rich for Facebook to use it as an excuse to crack down on researchers exposing its problems.""Wyden said he had contacted the FTC to ask about Facebook's claim that it was concerned the NYU tool violated its privacy order, calling that excuse ""bogus.""The FTC declined to comment.Ramya Krishnan, a staff attorney at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute, said Facebook's decision to cut off the NYU team illustrates how powerful the platform has become — and why lawmakers need to act.""The company functions as a gatekeeper to journalism and research about how the company's platform works and the impact of its platform on society. And we think that that is untenable,"" she said. ""The public urgently needs to know and needs to understand the implications of Facebook's platform for public discourse and democracy.""The Knight Institute, which is representing NYU's Edelson and McCoy in this matter,urged Facebookback in 2018 to create a ""safe harbor"" provision in its terms of service that would allow academics and journalists to research and collect data from its platform, while protecting users' privacy. But, Krishnan, said negotiations with the company ended in a stalemate.Now, she said, the solution lies in Washington. She says Congress should ""mandate transparency"" on social media platforms and create a safe harbor law protecting research.""We're not saying that Facebook doesn't have legitimate reasons for, in general, prohibiting scraping,"" she said. ""But intentionally or not, those prohibitions are also impeding journalists' and researchers' ability to study, understand and report about the platform.""Editor's note:Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters."
Mexico Sues U.S. Gun Manufacturers For Contributing To Arms Trafficking Deaths,-1.67,45.0,https://www.npr.org/2021/08/05/1025011396/mexico-sues-u-s-gun-manufacturers-for-contributing-to-arms-trafficking-deaths,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-05,www.npr.org,"MEXICO CITY — The Mexican government sued United States gun manufacturers and distributors Wednesday in U.S. federal court, arguing that their negligent and illegal commercial practices have unleashed tremendous bloodshed in Mexico.The unusual lawsuit was filed in U.S. federal court in Boston. Among those being sued are some of the biggest names in guns, including: Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.; Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Inc.; Beretta U.S.A. Corp.; Colt's Manufacturing Company LLC, and Glock Inc. Another defendant is Interstate Arms, a Boston-area wholesaler that sells guns from all but one of the named manufacturers to dealers around the U.S.The manufacturers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Mexican government argues that the companies know that their practices contribute to the trafficking of guns to Mexico and facilitate it. Mexico wants compensation for the havoc the guns have wrought in its country.The Mexican government ""brings this action to put an end to the massive damage that the Defendants cause by actively facilitating the unlawful trafficking of their guns to drug cartels and other criminals in Mexico,"" the lawsuit said.The government estimates that 70% of the weapons trafficked to Mexico come from the U.S., according to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. And that in 2019 alone, at least 17,000 homicides were linked to trafficked weapons.The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the U.S. firearm industry's trade association, said in a statement that it rejected Mexico's allegations of negligence.""These allegations are baseless. The Mexican government is responsible for the rampant crime and corruption within their own borders,"" said Lawrence G. Keane, the group's senior vice president and general counsel. The Mexican government is responsible for enforcing its laws, he said.The group also took issue with Mexico's figures for the number of guns recovered at crime scenes and traced back to the U.S. It said that traces were attempted on only a fraction of the recovered guns and only on the ones carrying a serial number, making them more likely to have originated in the U.S.Alejandro Celorio, legal advisor for the ministry, told reporters Wednesday that the damage caused by the trafficked guns would be equal to 1.7% to 2% of Mexico's gross domestic product. The government will seek at least $10 billion in compensation, he said. Mexico's GDP last year was more than $1.2 trillion.""We don't do it to pressure the United States,"" Celorio said. ""We do it so there aren't deaths in Mexico.""Ebrard said the lawsuit was another piece of the government's efforts against guns. ""The priority is that we reduce homicides,"" he said. ""We aren't looking to change American laws.""Mexico did not seek the advice of the U.S. government on the matter, but advised the U.S. Embassy before filing the lawsuit.Steve Shadowen, the lead attorney representing Mexico, said that in the early 2000s about 30 U.S. cities brought similar litigation against gun manufacturers arguing that they should be responsible for increased police, hospitalization and other costs associated with gun violence.As some cities started winning, gun manufacturers went to Congress and got an immunity statute for the manufacturers. Shadowen said he believes that immunity doesn't apply when the injury occurs outside the United States.""The merits of the case are strongly in our favor and then we have to get around this immunity statute which we think we're going to win,"" he said. ""That statute just simply doesn't apply. It only applies when you're in the United States.""He said he believes it is the first time a foreign government has sued the gun manufacturers.Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and expert on gun policy, called Mexico's effort a ""long shot.""""It is a bold and innovative lawsuit,"" he said. ""We haven't seen anything like this before. The gun manufacturers have enjoyed broad immunity from lawsuits for now two decades.""He said he had not seen arguments that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act applies only to damages in the United States.The sale of firearms is severely restricted in Mexico and controlled by the Defense Department. But thousands of guns are smuggled into Mexico by the country's powerful drug cartels.There were more than 36,000 murders in Mexico last year, and the toll has remained stubbornly high despite President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's pledge to pacify the country. Mexico's nationwide murder rate in 2020 remained unchanged at 29 per 100,000 inhabitants. By comparison, the U.S. homicide rate in 2019 was 5.8 per 100,000.In August 2019, a gunmen killed 23 people in an El Paso Walmart, including some Mexican citizens. At that time, Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said the government would explore its legal options. The government said Wednesday that recent rulings in U.S. courts contributed to its decision to file the lawsuit.It cited a decision in California allowing a lawsuit against Smith & Wesson to move forward, a lawsuit filed last week against Century Arms related to a 2019 shooting in Gilroy, California, and the $33 million settlement reached by Remington with some of the families whose children were killed in the Newtown, Connecticut, Sandy Hook Elementary mass school shooting.Winkler, the UCLA professor, mentioned the Sandy Hook lawsuit as one that initially few thought would go anywhere.""The plaintiffs in that case made an innovative and bold argument, too,"" he said. ""They argued that the immunity statute does not prevent these gun makers from being held liable where they act negligently.""""Over the past year or so, we've seen some cracks in the immunity armor provided by federal law,"" Winkler said. ""Even if this lawsuit moves forward, it will be extremely difficult for Mexico to win because it will be hard to show that this distribution process or their distribution practices are a manifestation of negligence on the part of the gun makers."""

And while hospitalizations and deaths remain low, the number of child coronavirus infections increased by 3% over the last two weeks of the month after declining earlier in the summer.Since the pandemic began a year and a half ago, approximately 4.2 million children have tested positive for the coronavirus. The good news is that severe illness and death are still uncommon for children who contract the virus. In states reporting, children accounted for fewer than one-quarter of 1% of all COVID-19 deaths. Seven states reported no child deaths, while other states reported 0-0.03% of all child coronavirus cases resulting in death. As of July 29, a total of 358 children have reportedly been killed by COVID-19 in the U.S.""However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,"" the report reads.That said, the report acknowledged that the figures could be inaccurate for a handful of reasons. The ages designated as a ""child"" vary from state to state, ranging from newborns to 20, and some states altered their definition of a child during the pandemic.Further complicating things, the most up-to-date numbers include testing figures from only 11 states, according to the report. Only 23 states and New York City reported hospitalizations and 43 states — along with New York City, Puerto Rico and Guam — reported mortality rates. Florida stopped reporting child hospitalizations in late June and Iowa stopped updating child testing data shortly after. And in Nebraska, the COVID-19 dashboard has been unavailable since the end of June.Parts of the country are considering reimplementing protective measures as cases climb. With the start of the school year just around the corner, the same organization that conducted the report is recommending that students over the age of 2 and all staff — vaccinated or not — mask up.Some states though, including Arkansas,Florida, South Carolina and Texas, have implementedlaws prohibiting mask mandates in schools.With cases running rampant across his state, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is caught in a bind. The governor is still not in favor of a statewide mandate, but he wants thelaw banning state and local mask mandates overturnedto give schools the opportunity to implement mask mandates.""In hindsight, I wish that it had not become law,"" Hutchinson said at a news conference Tuesday. ""But it is the law, and the only chance we have is either to amend it or for the courts to say that it has an unconstitutional foundation.""To date, the coronavirus has claimed the lives of more than 612,000 people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently walked back its previous message that most vaccinated persons could engage in nearly all activities mask-free. It is now recommending that everyone, regardless of vaccine status,return to wearing masks indoorsin areas where transmission rates are high."

That's compared with 82% for traditional 911 response teams, which include police.Additionally, 50% of people treated by B-HEARD were transported to the hospital for more care, a far lower number than the 82% who are transported to the hospital with traditional 911 response.The city said that 911 operators routed 138 mental health emergency calls — 25% of the number of calls during the pilot period — to B-HEARD and expect that number to grow to 50% in the coming months.""This is great news. A smarter approach to public health and public safety. A smarter use of resources. And the evidence — from Denver to New York — shows that responding with care works,"" U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.,tweeted.New York's program is modeled after a successful, decades-old program in Eugene, Ore., known as Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets, orCAHOOTS. Other similar programs have launched in California, Colorado, Georgia and Montana.In Minneapolis, where police killed Floyd last summer, the city will start sending outcivil crisis response teamsinstead of police to certain mental health calls next month.Mental health-related calls accounted for22% of casesin which on-duty police used lethal force and killed someone, according to data from 2009 to 2012 from 17 states where data was available."

Because of the delays in delivering the data — which the bureaufirst signaled in April 2020— some state and local governments have had to push back election dates.The upcoming release of the second major set of 2020 census results is coming amid a string of controversies that have raised questions about the data's quality. Aside from COVID-19 disrupting door-knocking efforts, last year's count was upended by Trump officials' last-minute schedule changes as well as the specter of the previous administration's failed push for a citizenship question that was likely tosuppress census participation among Latinx and Asian American residents.Many data users are also concerned about the usability of redistricting data about rural and small geographic areas because of the effects ofthe agency's new privacy protection system.The bureau's acting director, Ron Jarmin, however, has emphasized that the data's quality is ""quite remarkable amid all the challenges we faced last year.""""Every way we've analyzed the 2020 Census — through our extensive reviews during data processing, by comparing the numbers to population benchmarks, and looking at the operations — the census data are high quality and are fit to use for redistricting,"" Jarmin said ina blog post last month."

Dixie Fire Stirs Anxiety In The California Town Decimated In 2018 By The Camp Fire,-1.67,47.33,https://www.npr.org/2021/08/05/1025127666/paradise-dixie-fire-camp-fire-wildfire-paradise-california,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-05,www.npr.org,"Out-of-control wildfires in northern California are burning homes and again forcing thousands to evacuate.One of the biggest concerns remainsthe Dixie Fire, the second largest wildfire in the U.S. It has now burned some 322,000 acres, including much of the northern Sierra Nevada town of Greenville.Until recently, the Dixie Fire had been burning in mostly remote wild lands. But that changed dramatically Wednesday as erratic winds sent the flames racing toward whole communities around the popular vacation enclave of Lake Almanor.By late afternoon, an ominous emergency alert broke into local radio here warning all Greenville, Calif.,residents to leave immediately.""We lost Greenville tonight,"" said U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa in anemotional videoto his constituents posted to Facebook. ""There's just no words for how us in government haven't been able to get the job done.""Only a dramatic change in the weather will stop wildfires like this in an era of climate change. They're also burning through dense, overgrown forests built up from a legacy of suppressing fires. The Dixie Fire is the latest to rage in this mostly rural part of the Sierra Nevada that's been traumatized by huge and deadly wildfires since 2018.""It started at the same place theCamp Fire did, that's all people needed to hear,"" says Steve Crowder, the mayor of Paradise, Calif.His community is still reeling from the Camp Fire in November of 2018, which killed 85 people and destroyed close to 19,000 structures. The Dixie Fire started in the same area, also likely due to downed power lines.""It really is tough on people,"" Crowder says. ""It just brings back all kinds of memories.""The huge, volcano-like plume of the Dixie Fire can be seen from out the back of Paradise town hall, though so far it's burning away from it. But people who have moved back in, like Stephen Murray, know that could easily change. Paradise is about 15 miles as the crow flies from where the Dixie Fire started and is still burning.""Last Thursday, I had my truck packed and I was ready to leave. Even though I rebuilt my home and all that, it's not worth staying,"" Murray says. He didn't end up leaving for good though, for now. He's been making a living as a contractor, clearing out debris from burnt out lots. But it's so dry he can only operate machinery in the early morning due to the threat of sparks igniting more fires.""Unfortunately the Dixie Fire has put me out of work for the last 20 days,"" Murray says.In the hot afternoon sun obscured by dense smoke, he looks nervously at his neighbor's abandoned property, overgrown with dry brush.But even if the Dixie Fire were to blow back this way, the irony is that Paradise today is actually pretty safe, for now. New power lines are being buried underground. Homes are being built to more fire resistant code. And most of the forests are gone because thousands of trees had to be removed.""This is a safer community and quite honestly one of the safest in the Sierra,"" says Jim Broshears, a longtime wildland fire chief who now runs the town's emergency services.This is of little solace to the thousands of Camp Fire survivors who decided to leave Paradise and put their lives back together elsewhere.Linda and Bob Oslin moved to a home about 30 minutes away from Paradise after losing everything in the Camp Fire. They wereevacuated due to wildfires last summerand figure it's only a matter of time before they'll have to leave again.They have suitcases packed and their essential documents are already in a pickup outside.""I have my suitcase ready to go and I just live out of my suitcase,"" Linda says. ""This is our life from ... May to December.""The Oslins know this could soon be their life year round as wildfire ""seasons"" are now a relic of the cooler past."

The weekend rally has drawn the attention of far-right extremist groups,The Associated Press has reported.Monday's vote of confidence in Capitol security plans came following a security briefing for the top Democratic and Republican leaders in each chamber by Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger and House Sergeant-at-Arms William Walker. Both Manger and Walker were installed in their posts after their predecessors were forced to resign following the Jan. 6 attack.""They seem very, very well-prepared, much better prepared than before Jan. 6,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""And I think they are ready for whatever might happen.""Schumer made the remarks following the joint meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.Manger said he shared with the leaders the intelligence the agency is aware of, along with its operational plan for that day.He also told reporters he expects the fencing to return later this week.""The fence will go up a day or two before [the rally] and, if everything goes well ... it will come down soon after,"" he said.The perimeter fencing was previously installed in the hours following the Jan. 6 insurrection andremained in placeuntil July.It drew opposition from many Republicans and some Democrats, who said the fencing had turned the seat of American democracy into a fortress.The Capitol Police Board, a small panel that includes top security officials in each congressional chamber, approved the plan Monday to put up the fencing around the complex temporarily. And last week the board issued an emergency declaration that will go into effect at the time of the demonstration to allow Capitol Police to deputize outside law enforcement officials as special officers for the department.For its part, the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department, or MPD, has also said it's ready to defend the Capitol.""MPD will have an increased presence around the city where demonstrations will be taking place and will be prepared to make street closures for public safety,"" Chief Robert Contee said recently.Congress is not slated to be in session on Saturday, but lawmakers, law enforcement agencies andsurrounding neighbors are bracing for the event.And on Monday, Capitol Policearrested a manwith weapons near Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington.Pelosi said the security briefing was a reminder of improvements installed since the Jan. 6 insurrection.""It seems much better,"" Pelosi told Capitol Hill reporters. ""I'm sure we'll have ongoing communications.""In a statement, Capitol Police said the agency is aware of online discussions regarding the Saturday event. Manger said that while demonstrators have a right to protest, he urged those looking for trouble to stay away.""We are here to protect everyone's First Amendment right to peacefully protest,"" Manger said. ""I urge anyone who is thinking about causing trouble to stay home. We will enforce the law and not tolerate violence.""Capitol Police noted that since Jan. 6, the agency has improved training, installed a new emergency response plan, added additional equipment and launched a departmentwide operation planning process. It has also held planning meetings for the Saturday event for the last month."
Blinken Pushes Back On GOP Criticism Of The U.S. Withdrawal From Afghanistan,-1.0,44.0,https://www.npr.org/2021/09/13/1036736805/afghanistan-withdrawal-blinken-criticism,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-13,www.npr.org,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed back Monday against harsh Republican criticism of the handling ofthe military withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying the Biden administration inherited a deal with the Taliban to end the war, but no plan for carrying it out.In a sometimes contentious hearing Monday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Blinken sought to blunt complaints from angry GOP lawmakers about the administration's response to the quick collapse of the Afghan government and, more specifically, the State Department's actions to evacuate Americans and others.Blinken echoed White House talking points blaming the Trump administration for the situation that President Joe Biden inherited in Afghanistan. Republicans savaged the withdrawal as ""a disaster"" and ""a disgrace."" And while some Democrats allowed that the operation could have been handled better, many used their questions to heap criticism on former President Donald Trump.The State Department has come under heavy criticism from both sides for not doing enough and not acting quickly enough to get American citizens, legal residents and at-risk Afghans out of the country afterthe Taliban took control of Kabul on Aug. 15. Some seeking to leave remain stranded there, although Blinken could not provide a number.""This was an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the committee. He said the abrupt withdrawal along with leaving some Americans and Afghans behind had ""emboldened the Taliban"" and other U.S. adversaries. ""I can summarize this in one word: betrayal.""His GOP colleague Steve Chabot of Ohio was even more blunt. ""This is a disgrace,"" he said.The chairman of the committee, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, urged his colleagues to keep politics out of their criticism. But he acknowledged that there had been problems. ""Could things have been done differently? Absolutely,"" he said.Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who has been ostracized by many in the GOP for his criticism of Trump, placed blame for the situation on both Trump and Biden. ""The Trump administration failed in the setup and the Biden administration failed in the execution,"" Kinzinger said.In the first of two days of congressional testimony, Blinken tried to calmly deflect allegations of unpreparedness by noting that the Biden administration had inherited a U.S.-Taliban peace deal from its predecessor, along with a languishing program to grant visas to Afghans who had worked for the U.S. government.Blinken, who had publicly predicted in June that a complete Taliban takeover would not happen ""from a Friday to a Monday,"" also tried to preempt criticism of the prediction by noting that no one in the U.S. government expected the Afghan government to fall as quickly as it did.""Even the most pessimistic assessments did not predict that government forces in Kabul would collapse while U.S. forces remained,"" Blinken said in prepared remarks released ahead of his appearance. He also defended the evacuation effort, saying it succeeded despite near insurmountable odds.""The evacuation was an extraordinary effort — under the most difficult conditions imaginable — by our diplomats, military, and intelligence professionals,"" he said. ""In the end, we completed one of the biggest airlifts in history, with 124,000 people evacuated to safety.""But Republicans, in particular, have been demanding answers as to why American citizens were left behind in the chaotic days and weeks before the military completed its withdrawal on Aug. 30.In a preview of GOP questions, the Republican National Committee released a statement earlier Monday with the banner headline ""Fire Blinken,"" demanding that he be held to account for what it described as a litany of failings.""Blinken's disastrous handling of Afghanistan and weak leadership put American lives in danger, including the lives of Americans still trapped in Afghanistan,"" the GOP committee said.Blinken is very close to Biden and his job as America's top diplomat is almost certainly safe, but criticism of the administration's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal has not been limited to Republicans.Numerous Democrats have also questioned the policy and expressed concern about stranded Americans, green card holders and Afghans who could face retaliation from the Taliban because of their work or ties to the U.S. government over the past 20 years.State Department officials have acknowledged that the congressional hearings could be contentious and possibly ugly, but many remain convinced the U.S. military and other officials did the best they could under extremely trying circumstances — including the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and the crush of thousands of desperate people at Kabul's airport seeking to leave the country."

During stops in Idaho and California Monday, and Colorado Tuesday, Biden planned to make the pitch that the bill shouldn't just be about replacing old systems, but rather upgrades that make communities like those in the West more resilient to withstand extreme weather.""We can't continue to ignore the reality,"" Biden said.In Boise, Biden recounted how western wildfires this year alone have scorched an area larger than New Jersey. More than 43,000 ignitions have burned some 5.4 million acres of land, slightly higher than all of last year which saw one of the more destructive seasons on record.Idaho and neighboring Oregon are also among a handful ofwestern states reporting their hottest summers on record.""This summer we're getting clarity on the question of how bad climate change can get,"" said Larry O'Neill, the state climatologist for Oregon.Much of the Northwest has also been choked with dense, hazardous smoke for weeks this summer, leading to more calls for an overhaul of U.S. firefighting policy. On the ground in the West, there is also pressure on the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies to be more aggressive with restoration projects in overgrown forests where natural wildfires have been suppressed for a century.""Since the early 1900s the policy has been to fight fires, the seasons are getting longer, it's putting more demands on those people who are required to fight the fires,"" said Boise resident Marshall Brezonick, on a recent smoke shrouded hike on a popular trail in the foothills outside the city. ""It's getting worse with climate change."""
Mexico's Supreme Court Has Voted To Decriminalize Abortion,-4.33,47.33,https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034925270/mexico-abortion-decriminalized-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-07,www.npr.org,"Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion as a crime, a landmark ruling that clears the way for the legalization of abortion across the country.The court took up the issue on Monday when eight of 11 justices voted to revoke a law in the state of Coahuila that punished women with up to three years in prison for having an abortion — even in cases of rape. The other three justices joined in the decision Tuesday, declaring such laws unconstitutional.""Today is a historic day for the rights of all Mexican women,"" said Supreme Court Chief Justice Arturo Zaldivar on Tuesday.""It is a watershed in the history of the rights of all women, especially the most vulnerable,"" he added.The ruling sets a precedent that would force judges across Mexico—home to one of the world's largest populations of Catholics—to hand down similar rulings and expands early abortion for millions of women in Mexico's 32 states.The decision was being celebrated as a major victory for the women's rights movement across Latin America that has gained momentum in recent years, prompted byrecord femicide ratesand a majorabortion rights victoryin Argentina last year.Inspired by that hard-fought triumph, tens of thousands of women in Mexico have taken up green bandanas — a symbol of abortion-rights activists in Argentina — calling for the decriminalization of abortion beyond the four states where it is legal up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.""This Supreme Court decision has legal ripple effects beyond the Mexican state of Coahuila and applies across Mexico,"" Paula Avila-Guillen, executive director of the Women's Equality Center, said in a statement following the decision.""As of this moment, any Mexican state that criminalizes abortion is in direct defiance of the Federal Constitution. As of this decision, all Mexican states where abortion is still criminalized are obligated to modify their legal frameworks to comply with the standard set by the Court,"" Avila-Guillen added.She noted that the ruling sets a precedent for women who are currently behind bars for seeking an abortion to be freed.Avila-Guillen called Mexico's decision a bright spot in the fight to protect women's reproductive rights around the world — one that comes just days after Texas enacted what amounts to the strictest anti-abortion measure in the U.S. The Texas law bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.""The pro-rights 'Green Wave' is poised to take over the region and bring it to the 21st Century, even as we see the United States Supreme Court and Texas walk women back into darkness,"" she said.Now that women in Coahuila, which borders the state of Texas, can choose to terminate their pregnancies through the first trimester, Avila-Guillen suggests some American women may benefit from Mexico's new law.She asks: ""Could the safest way for Texan women to have access to a safe, legal abortion soon be to make their way to Mexico?"""

The bishops are meeting Tuesday to discuss next steps.The independent commission urged the church to take strong action, denouncing ""faults"" and ""silence."" It also called on the Catholic Church to help compensate the victims, notably in cases that are too old to prosecute via the courts.""The consequences are very serious,"" Sauvé said. ""About 60% of men and women who were sexually abused encounter major problems in their emotional or sexual life.""""We consider the church has a debt towards victims,"" he added.The 2,500-page document was issued as the Catholic Church in France, like in other countries, seeks to face up to shameful secrets that were long covered up.Victims welcomed the report as long overdue.Francois Devaux, head of the victims' group La Parole Libérée (The Liberated Word), said it was ""a turning point in our history.""He denounced the coverups that permitted ""mass crimes for decades.""""But even worse, there was a betrayal: betrayal of trust, betrayal of morality, betrayal of children, betrayal of innocence,"" he said, calling on the church for compensation.Olivier Savignac, the head of victims association Parler et Revivre (Speak Out and Live Again), contributed to the investigation. He told The Associated Press that the high ratio of victims per abuser was particularly ""terrifying for French society, for the Catholic Church.""Savignac assailed the church for treating such cases as individual anomalies instead of as a collective horror. He described being abused at age 13 by the director of a Catholic vacation camp in the south of France who was accused of assaulting several other boys.""I perceived this priest as someone who was good, a caring person who would not harm me,"" Savignac said. ""But it was when I found myself on that bed half-naked and he was touching me that I realized something was wrong....And we keep this, it's like a growing cyst. It's like gangrene inside the victim's body and the victim's psyche.""The priest eventually was found guilty of child sexual abuse and sentenced in 2018 to two years in prison, with one year suspended.The commission worked for 2 1/2 years, listening to victims and witnesses and studying church, court, police and news archives starting from the 1950s. A hotline launched at the beginning of the review received 6,500 calls from alleged victims or people who said they knew a victim.Sauvé denounced the church's attitude until the beginning of the 2000s as ""a deep, cruel indifference toward victims.""The report says an estimated 3,000 child abusers - two-thirds of them priests - worked in the church during the seven-decade period. That figure is likely to be an underestimate, Sauvé said. The tally of victims includes an estimated 216,000 people abused by priests and other clerics, he said.The estimates are based on research led by France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research into sexual abuse of children in the French population.""Sometimes church officials did not denounce (sex abuses) and even exposed children to risks by putting them in contact with predators,"" Sauvé said. ""We consider ... the church has a debt toward victims.""The president of the Conference of Bishops of France, Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, said the bishops ""are appalled"" at the conclusions of the report.""I wish on that day to ask for pardon, pardon to each of you,"" he told the victims.Sauvé said 22 alleged crimes that can be pursued have been forwarded to prosecutors. More than 40 cases that are too old to be prosecuted but involve alleged perpetrators who are still alive have been forwarded to church officials.The commission issued 45 recommendations about how to prevent abuse. These included training priests and other clerics, revising Canon Law — the legal code the Vatican uses to govern the church — and fostering policies to recognize and compensate victims.The report comes after a scandal surrounding now-defrocked priest Bernard Preynat rocked the French Catholic Church. Last year, Preynat was convicted of sexually abusing minors and given a five-year prison sentence. He admitted abusing more than 75 boys for decades.The Preynat case led to the resignation last year of the former archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who has been accused of failing to report the abuses to civil authorities when he learned about them in the 2010s. France's highest court ruled earlier this year that Barbarin did not cover up the case.French archbishops, in a message to parishioners read during Sunday Mass across the country, said the publication of the report is ""a test of truth and a tough and serious moment.""Pope Francis issued in May 2019 agroundbreaking new church lawrequiring all Catholic priests and nuns around the world to report clergy sexual abuse and cover-ups by their superiors to church authorities.In June, Francis swiftly rejected an offer from Cardinal Reinhard Marx, one of Germany's most prominent clerics and a close papal adviser, to resign as archbishop of Munich and Freising over the church's mishandling of abuse cases. But he said a process of reform was necessary and every bishop must take responsibility for the ""catastrophe"" of the crisis."

Outdoor Workers Could Face Far More Dangerous Heat By 2065 Because Of Climate Change,-5.33,46.0,https://www.npr.org/2021/08/17/1028552251/outdoor-workers-could-face-far-more-dangerous-heat-by-2065-because-of-climate-ch,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-17,www.npr.org,"Outdoor workers in the United States could face four times as many days with hazardous heat by mid-century if action isn't taken to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, according toa reportpublished Tuesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).The consequences of that extreme heat can be severe: a new NPR/Columbia Journalism School investigation found thatat least 384 workers have diedfrom environmental heat exposure in the last decade. And the problem is getting worse: the three-year average of worker heat deaths has doubled since the early 1990s.""The last seven years have been the hottest on record,"" said Rachel Licker, the senior climate scientist and an author of the UCS report, said in a statement. ""Without additional protections, the risks to workers will only grow in the decades ahead as climate change worsens, leaving the roughly 32 million outdoor workers in our country to face a brutal choice: their health or their jobs.""The report also projects a severe economic toll, with the average outdoor worker losing more than $1,700 each year because of work stoppages on days when heat and humidity top 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends employers reduce work schedules.Lost wages from extreme heat are projected to amount to more than $55 billion annually.People of color, who are disproportionately represented in outdoor occupations, stand to be hit especially hard hit. More than 40 percent of U.S. outdoor workers identify as African American, Black, Hispanic or Latino, according to the report, and they could lose $23 billion in annual earnings by 2065 if no action is taken to reduce emissions.The finding mirrors previous research that has shown that residents of low-income areas and communities of color in American citiesendure far higher temperaturesthan people who live in whiter, wealthier areas.Kristina Dahl, a UCS senior climate scientist and and an author of the report, said in statement that existing inequities faced by people of color, including ""increased exposure to air pollution, lack of access to quality health care and adequate cooling, and underfunded social services,"" can compound the impact of extreme heat. Migrant workers, she said, including those in the country illegally, are especially at risk.In addition to the heightened risks posed by climate change, the UCS report highlights the lack of federal worker protections as a major issue for worker safety.As NPR haspreviously reported, at least a dozen companies have had multiple employees die from environmental heat exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not adopted a national heat standard to safeguard workers and often decides not to penalize companies for worker deaths.The report's authors call for a number of policy changes, including adapting worker schedules to coincide with cooler times of day and lessening overall workloads. Employers, the report says, should also implement mandatory heat safety plans, heat monitoring and reporting requirements, and multilingual training for supervisors and workers to facilitate better and faster responses to dangers imposed by extreme heat.""We know this risk is worsening and has significant implications for workers, employers and the broader economy, so we need to be prepared,"" Licker said.Regulation and adaptation alone will not be enough to address the problems faced by workers as long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to warm the planet.The projections in the UCS report, though, are based on a scenario that seems increasingly less likely: a constant level of emissions through mid-century.That projection would place the world far out of step with the goals set by the Paris Agreement — a commitment signed by nearly all of the world's countries which seeks to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F).As part of the deal, the United States has pledged to halve its emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Other countries have set similar targets.Right now, though, few of the world's biggest economies, including the U.S., are on track to meet those goals — something the report's authors say needs to change.""To limit future extreme heat, the United States must urgently contribute to global efforts to effectively constrain heat-trapping emissions by investing in just and equitable solutions that get us to net-zero emissions no later than 2050,"" Licker said."

""I am deeply saddened by the facts we now face, but I do not regret my decision.""Speaking about the Taliban's sudden ousting of the U.S.-backed government, Biden acknowledged, ""The truth is this did unfold more quickly than we anticipated,"" but he added he would not pass the war on to a fifth U.S. president or say that ""a little more time"" in Afghanistan ""will make all the difference.""Last month Biden had said it was ""highly unlikely"" that the Taliban would overrun the country when U.S. forces departed.Though Biden said he accepted responsibility for how the withdrawal is unfolding, in White House remarks he largely blamed the Afghan military for not standing and fighting against the Taliban as well as Afghan political leaders for fleeing.A senior administration official told NPR on Monday that most U.S. Embassy staffers have beenevacuatedfrom Kabul, with a small footprint on the ground at the city's airport. The official said the administration expects it will take ""a few more days"" to continue to move those people out.The White House views the situation as volatile and serious, the official said, but not a worst-case scenario since there has not — so far — been widespread violence around Kabul.The official also defended the administration's preparations for the evacuation. ""This is a scenario that sadly we were ready for,"" the official said — though U.S. plans have been changed several times in recent days as the evacuations have been launched, including sending in thousands of U.S. troops to help the process.Criticism of how the U.S. exit was orchestrated has been bipartisan.Some hawkish Republicans have blasted Biden for failing to prevent the Taliban takeover and warned of the potential risk of the renewed growth of terrorist cells.Others, such as former President Donald Trump, who inked a 2020 deal with the Taliban and set the timeline in place for the U.S. exit, focused on the withdrawal itself.""It's not that we left Afghanistan. It's the grossly incompetent way we left!"" Trump said in a statement at the end of Biden's remarks.""This is President Biden's Saigon moment,"" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said Sunday on CBS'Face the Nation, referring to the chaotic departure from Vietnam in 1975. ""And, unfortunately, it was very predictable. It seems like many in President Biden's intelligence community got this devastatingly wrong.""Some Democrats have made similar criticisms and largely have focused on the potential humanitarian crisis, particularly for women and girls left behind after the withdrawal. Other Democrats have been supportive of the decision but are privately hand-wringing over the potential political problem the chaotic exit creates for the party in power.The fast collapse of the Afghan government and the lack of a fight from the Afghan military, Biden said, reinforced his decision to leave — and that a military solution to a secure and stable Afghanistan didn't exist.""There was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces,"" Biden added. ""That's why we are still there.""The president pointed out that going into Afghanistan was about getting those ""who attacked us"" on 9/11, to make sure al-Qaida and other terror groups can't use Afghanistan as a place from which to attack the U.S. again.He noted that al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was killed a decade ago and that the mission was ""never supposed to be nation-building"" or ""creating a unified, centralized democracy.""The goal, he said, was ""preventing a terrorist attack on the American homeland"" and the mission needs to be ""narrowly focused on counterterrorism.""That is something Biden has been saying for more than a decade since he was former President Barack Obama's vice president.Biden added that the U.S. needs to ""face threats of today,"" ""not yesterday's.""The president, who had been following the crisis overseas from Camp David, returned to the White House on Monday afternoon to make the speech as thousands of U.S. forces have been sent back in to secure the Kabul airport to finish evacuating Americans and others who helped the U.S. during the war.Biden took no questions from reporters after his remarks and then returned to Camp David.He acknowledged that the scenes on the ground are ""gut-wrenching"" for U.S. veterans and aid workers who spent years serving and working in Afghanistan.""For those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and for Americans who have fought and served in the country, this is deeply, deeply personal,"" he said."
Families Who Receive Food Stamps Will See The Largest Benefits Increase In History,-2.33,43.33,https://www.npr.org/2021/08/16/1028080631/food-stamps-snap-program-largest-single-increase-in-history,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-16,www.npr.org,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has approved a significant and permanent increase in the levels of food stamp assistance available to needy families — the largest single increase in the program's history.Starting in October, average benefits for food stamps — officially known as the SNAP program — will rise more than 25% above pre-pandemic levels. The increased assistance will be available indefinitely to all 42 million SNAP beneficiaries.The aid boost was first reported byThe New York Timesand the details were confirmed by a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department. They will be formally announced Monday by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.The aid boost is being packaged as a major revision of the USDA's Thrifty Food Plan. In concrete terms, the average monthly per-person benefits will rise from $121 to $157.The increase is part of a multi-prongedBiden administration effort to strengthenthe country's social safety net. Poverty and food security activists maintain that longstanding inadequacies in that safety net were laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting an opportunity to make generational improvements that reach beyond the current public health crisis.Activists say the previous levels of pre-pandemic SNAP assistance simply weren't enough, forcing many households to choose cheaper, less nutritious options or simply go hungry as the funds ran low toward the end of the month."
Biden Asks Congress For $30 Billion To Help Disaster Relief And Afghan Evacuees,-3.0,48.0,https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034923509/biden-asks-congress-for-30-billion-to-help-disaster-relief-and-afghan-evacuees,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-07,www.npr.org,"President Biden is asking Congress for billions in additional funding to help with natural disasters and aid for Afghan evacuees.The White House wants $24 billion in additional funding to help recovery efforts for the California wildfires and several hurricanes, including Hurricane Ida. Biden administration officials are also asking for $6.4 billion to help with resettling vulnerable Afghans in the United States.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the request for disaster relief necessary to help communities recover quickly from the destruction caused by hurricanes, wildfires and flooding.""Given the scale and scope of these natural disasters, everyone must work together to get Americans the help they desperately need,"" he said in a statement. Schumer also toured storm damage from Ida with the president on Tuesday afternoon in the New York borough of Queens. Biden visited areas in New Jersey hit by Ida earlier Tuesday.The money to resettle vulnerable Afghans comes as the Biden administration estimates that 65,000 will be brought to the U.S. by the end of the month. An additional 30,000 would arrive over the course of the next 12 months. The U.S. and allies evacuated about 124,000 people last month from Kabul, the Afghan capital.""This money is certainly critical ... to make sure that we are fulfilling this bipartisan commitment to our Afghan allies and partners,"" a senior administration official said Tuesday on a call with reporters.Shalanda Young, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a blog post that aid would be used for security screenings as well as humanitarian assistance to Afghans through the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. It would also include funding for public health screenings and vaccinations.""The operation to move out of danger and to safety tens of thousands of Afghans at risk, including many who helped us during our two decades in Afghanistan, represents an extraordinary military, diplomatic, security, and humanitarian operation by the U.S. Government,"" she wrote.She said the short-term funding request would help address urgent needs but also provide Congress additional time to pass full-year funding bills."

Tribes denounce North Dakota ID law in congressional hearing,-0.75,47.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/tribes-denounce-north-dakota-id-law-in-congressional-hearing,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,www.pbs.org,"BISMARCK, N.D. — Native American voters face poor access to polling sites, discrimination by poll workers and unfair identification requirements, tribal leaders told members of Congress who traveled Tuesday to a reservation in North Dakota wherevoting rightswere a key issue in last year’s U.S. Senate race.A House elections subcommittee’s meeting at the Standing Rock reservation was the latest in a series of on-site visits across the country on voting-rights issues. Activists told the panel that obstacles still remain more than five decades after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to eliminate such impediments for minority voters.“There continues to be barriers — interpersonal and systemic — at our polling locations in our tribal communities and for our Native voters across the state,” said activist Prairie Rose Seminole, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation in northwestern North Dakota.The bulk of the two-hour hearing focused on North Dakota’s voter ID requirements, which have led to two federal lawsuits by tribes who allege the rules are discriminatory and suppress the American Indian vote, which leans Democrat in a Republican-dominant state.The voter ID dispute drew national attention last fall because of a U.S. Senate race in North Dakota that was seen as critical to Republicans’ chances to keep control of the Senate. Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer defeated Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who was seeking a second term.North Dakota requires that a voter ID include a provable street address, which Secretary of State Al Jaeger says guards against fraud. Tribes allege the moves by state GOP leaders disenfranchised members who live on reservations where street addresses are uncommon or unknown and where post office boxes are the primary addresses.“The state knew this and they used it to suppress tribal voters,” said Charles Walker, CEO of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation.State officials have denied that. The U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed the state to continue requiring street addresses on voter IDs, though Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a dissent that “the risk of voter confusion appears severe.”The decision led to an intense effort by tribes and advocacy groups to get tribal members to the polls with proper ID during November’s general election. It was largely successful but cost the Spirit Lake and Standing Rock tribes a combined $14,000, in part because they waived normal fees for tribal IDs.“Fifteen dollars is milk and bread for a week for a poor family,” said Turtle Mountain Chippewa attorney Alysia LaCounte, who broke down in tears during her testimony.U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican, noted during the hearing that Cramer won handily despite high Native American voter turnout.Native American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De Leon responded: “We don’t think that outrage is a get-out-the-vote strategy, right?”“There are voter suppression issues going on throughout Indian Country that aren’t nearly getting the attention or resources that were poured into North Dakota because it just so happened that Sen. Heitkamp was running for re-election, and the Senate balance of power elevated this issue to the national stage,” DeLeon said.Davis replied, “So this was all a conspiracy to beat Heidi Heitkamp?”North Dakota Republican leaders have denied that Heitkamp’s surprise 2012 win influenced state voter ID law.OJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of the Four Directions advocacy group, which has been successful in voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota and other states, implored the subcommittee to work to increase federal dollars that states can dedicate to helping Native American voters.“The backbone of democracy is going to be given a brace, because people are going to vote,” he said."
Former Interior Secretary Zinke hired by gold mining firm,0.0,49.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/former-interior-secretary-zinke-hired-by-gold-mining-firm,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,www.pbs.org,"WASHINGTON — Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has a new job: a more than $100,000-a-year post with a gold-mining firm that’s pursuing project approvals involving the federal agency that Zinke left fewer than four months ago.Zinke told The Associated Press on Tuesday that his work for Nevada-based U.S. Gold Corp., which focuses on mining exploration and development, would not constitute lobbying. But that company’s CEO cited Zinke’s “excellent relationship” with the Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department in explaining his hiring.“We’re excited to have Secretary Zinke help move us forward” on two pending mining projects, in Nevada and Wyoming, Edward Karr, head of U.S. Gold Corp., said by phone.Karr said one of the mining projects is on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, which is under the Interior Department.A 2017 executive order by President Donald Trump says executive-branch appointees cannot lobby their former agency for at least five years after leaving their government post.Separately, criminal statutes impose one and two-year bans on various kinds of communications between senior federal officials and their former agency, said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit ethics-watchdog.Zinke, whoannounced his resignationfrom Interior in December amid ethics investigations, said Tuesday that his new mining job does not violate any prohibitions on post-administration lobbying.“I don’t lobby,” Zinke said. “I just follow the law, so I don’t talk to anybody on the executive side or influence” anyone.Karr says Zinke will receive a total of $114,000 a year in cash and stock as a board member and under a one-year consulting contract. The company’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says Zinke will also receive up to $120,000 a year in expenses.Zinke said his time in public office would be an asset at the mining company and in “making sure the environmental mitigation is done correctly.”“I understand the process,” he said. “There’s very few former state senators, congressmen and secretaries that know more about the process than I do,” said Zinke, who served in the Montana legislature and the U.S. House before being appointed to lead Interior.The purpose of federal lobbying freezes by recently departed senior officials is “to make sure there there’s a cooling-off period … so the former agency is not subject to the influence of their former head,” Canter said.Given the restrictions, she said Karr’s comment on Zinke’s good relationship with Interior “just raises questions about what he meant.”Zinke has a degree in geology from the University of Oregon. He never worked professionally in the field, instead becoming a U.S. Navy SEAL. But he said his education and political involvement in Montana mining projects would be useful at U.S. Gold Corp.Brown reported from Billings, Montana."
What to look for in the Mueller report,-3.75,41.5,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-to-look-for-in-the-mueller-report,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,www.pbs.org,"Seldom has a report in Washington been so vigorously debated before its release. After nearly two years of speculation over special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election, a redacted version of his final report is expected to be made public Thursday by Attorney General William Barr.Until then, we have just two pieces of real information in our pockets: Barr’sfour-page summaryof the report’s conclusion, andBarr’s testimonylast week, during which he said he would release as much of the report as legally allowed after redacting certain portions, with color coding to explain the justifications for each redaction.While we wait, some things are already clear. Here are key issues to watch for when the report appears, and a suggested list of search terms that could help uncover  potential surprises.The four big issuesAhead of the report, four issues loom largest: Russia’s election interference, the Trump campaign’s activities, and the questions of whether the president obstructed justice — whether a sitting president can be indicted.Obstruction of justice.Did the president obstruct justice? For many, this is the largest, potentially earth-shaking issue in the report. Barr’s summary indicated that Mueller was not able to conclude whether Trump’s actions could be construed as obstruction of justice. Instead, the special counsel has laid out arguments on each side.Look for:What is the evidence for and against obstruction?Can you indict a sitting president?Related to the discussion of obstruction, there are heated legal questions about whether the Justice Department can press criminal charges against any sitting president.Look for:The supernova issues: Did Mueller determine whether any sitting president can be indicted? Did that influence, or even dictate, his lack of conclusion over whether this president could be prosecuted for obstruction?The Russians.What did the Russians do to try to influence and manipulate the 2016 election?Look for:Extensive discussion of cyber-hacking operations as well as Russian use of social media to distort or amplify specific public sentiment around the 2016 race. Also, pay attention to any direct ties to the Kremlin and Putin.The campaign.What, if any, interaction did President Donald Trump’s campaign have with Russians involved in election interference? Barr’s summary states that Mueller’s investigation, “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.” But that is a limited statement. We do not know the degree to which Russians may have targeted Trump campaign officials and how they handled those interactions.Look for:Key campaign-Russia interactions, including the five below.The five big momentsHere are five interactions or events that may be significant in the report.Communication between Trump and Jeff Sessions, 2017.What, if anything, did the president say privately to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the FBI’s Russia investigation? And what did Trump say about the firing of FBI Director James Comey? Sessions recused himself from the investigation in March 2017, amid heavy pressure from the president to remain in charge of the probe. There are also questions about how Sessions and the president interacted with Russian officials, especially Sergey Kislyak, the former Russian ambassador to the U.S.Trump Tower meeting in New York, June 2016.The June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower, which included Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and a Russian attorney, dominated headlines when it wasrevealed a year later.Those involved initially said the meeting focused on Russian adoptions or Russian sanctions law, not the campaign. But Donald Trump, Jr., received emails ahead of the meeting promising damaging material on Hillary Clinton. What does Mueller say happened? And did the president know about the Russian offer?Air Force One, July 2017.After news of the Trump Tower meeting broke, President Trump, on board Air Force One,dictated a statementfor his son to the New York Times. His attorneylater admittedthe president’s role, despite initially, and repeatedly,denying it.Within days, it was clear that the statement did not describe the meeting fully, though Trump’s attorneys said it was accurate.Trump Tower Moscow plan, 2016.There is open debate over how seriously then-candidate Trump pursued what would have been amega-business dealfor a Trump Tower Moscow in 2016. The project is seen as an important indication of potential Trump conflicts of interest and possible attempts to cover them up.Republican National Convention, July 2016.As Republicans gathered to nominate Trump for the presidency, the party made alate change in its platformto water down an anti-Russia stance.Delegates have saidthis was pushed by the Trump campaign, but Trump officials at the time repeatedly denied it. Kislyak was also at the convention, where he spoke with Sessions and other campaign officials.12 key search terms to help guide you through the reportDonald Trump or the president.How much of the report focuses on the president himself?Obstruction.The potential crime that Mueller didn’t rule on one way or the other, according to Barr’s summary letter.Conspiracy.The initial focus of the FBI’s investigation: whether the Trump campaign conspired or colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.Vladimir Putin or president of Russia.Does the president of Russia appear in the report?James Comey.What did Mueller find or conclude about the president’s firing of and interactions with FBI director James Comey?Michael Cohen.Was the president’s former attorney helpful to Mueller? Does Cohen’s allegations of campaign violations appear in the report or does the document push back those public allegations against Trump?Michael Flynn.What does the report say about the former national security adviser, who was one of Mueller’s first cooperating witnesses?Christopher Steele or dossier.The so-called Steele dossier, a collection of allegations about Trump, sparked some initial FBI suspicion of the Trump campaign but it is seen by others as a fraudulent file meant to undermine him. Does Mueller mention it, or its allegations, at all?Facebook.How was the social media giant used and targeted by Russians? And does Mueller point to any flaws in company’s security or policies?Twitter or tweet.Did messages on social media, by the president or anyone else, affect Mueller’s investigation?Voting machine or state election or election system.To what degree did Russians attempt to, or succeed in, breaking into any voting infrastructure in the states?Inauguration.Did Mueller write anything about investigations into foreign attempts to donate money to the president’s inauguration?Reminder:If you want to check what we know currently,our Giant Russia Timelineis a good resource. It is giant, but also approachable and reader-friendly."

Trump’s nominee to lead FAA would face Boeing oversight questions,-0.75,56.25,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/trumps-nominee-to-lead-faa-would-face-boeing-oversight-questions,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,www.pbs.org,"President Donald Trump has tapped a former Delta Air Lines executive to lead the Federal Aviation Administration as the regulator deals with questions about its approval of a Boeing airliner involved in two deadly crashes within five months.The White House said Tuesday that Trump will nominate Stephen Dickson to head the FAA. The agency has been led by an acting administrator since January 2018.Separately, the Transportation Department confirmed that its watchdog agency will examine how the FAA certified the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, the now-grounded plane involved in two fatal accidents within five months.The FAA had stood by the safety of the plane up until last Wednesday, despite other countries grounding it.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao formally requested the audit in a letter sent to Inspector General Calvin Scovel III on Tuesday.Chao, whose agency oversees the FAA, said the audit will improve the department’s decision-making. Her letter confirmed that she had previously requested an audit. It did not mention reports that the inspector general and federal prosecutors are looking into the development and regulatory approval of the jet.The letter requests “an audit to compile an objective and detailed factual history of the activities that resulted in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft.” It also says the audit will help the FAA “in ensuring that its safety procedures are implemented effectively.”Boeing said in a statement Tuesday that it will fully cooperate with the audit.Questions about the FAA’s handling of the issue extend beyond U.S. borders and will pose an immediate challenge for Dickson, if he is confirmed to lead the agency.Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said this week that even if FAA certifies Boeing’s fix for the software on the 737 Max jet, “we will do our own certification.”Dickson was Delta’s senior vice president of flight operations until retiring on Oct. 1 after 27 years with the airline, including time flying the 737 and other Boeing jets. Before that, he was an Air Force pilot. He emerged in recent weeks as the likely choice to lead FAA.For the past 14 months, the agency has been under an acting administrator, Daniel Elwell, a former Air Force and American Airlines pilot.A Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia last October, and an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed this month near Addis Ababa.Investigators suspect that incorrect sensor readings feeding into a new automated flight-control system may have played a role in the Indonesian crash, and the Ethiopian plane had a similar, erratic flight path.Boeing began working on an upgrade to software behind the flight-control system shortly after the Lion Air crash. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in recent days that the company is close to finishing the update and changes in pilot training to help crews respond to faulty sensor readings.Elwell told House Transportation Committee members that Boeing expects the software update to be finished by Monday, according to a person familiar with the briefing who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the timing publicly. The FAA earlier required design changes to the flight-control system “no later than April.”After Boeing finishes the software, the FAA still must approve it.The Associated Press reported Monday that the Justice Department and the Inspector General are probing development of the Max, according to a person briefed on the matter. It is unclear when those inquiries began.The Justice Department and the Transportation Department’s inspector general are examining the way Boeing was regulated by the FAA, according to a person familiar with the matter and who asked not to be identified because the inquiry is not public.Critics have questioned the FAA’s practice of using employees of aircraft manufacturers to handle some safety inspections. FAA inspectors review the work of the manufacturers’ employees, who are on the company payroll and could face a conflict of interest.A federal grand jury in Washington sent a subpoena to someone involved in the plane’s development seeking emails, messages and other communications, the person told The Associated Press.A report in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday said the inspector general was looking into the plane’s anti-stall system. It quoted unidentified people familiar with both cases.The Oct. 29 Lion Air crash killed 189 people, and 157 died in the March 10 accident involving an Ethiopian Airlines jet. Both accidents happened shortly after takeoff.Other nations banned the Max 8 and a slightly larger model, the Max 9, in the days after the Ethiopian crash. The FAA and U.S. airlines that use the planes stood by the plane’s safety until last week.There are about 370 Max jets of various models at airlines around the world. American, Southwest and United have said the grounding of their Max jets have led to some canceled flights.The plane is an important part of Chicago-based Boeing’s future. The company has taken more than 5,000 orders and delivered more than 250 Max jets last year. Boeing still makes an older version of the popular 737, but it expected the Max to account for 90 percent of all 737 deliveries this year.Koenig reported from Dallas and Krisher reported from Detroit.

"For Midwest farmers, floodwaters threaten millions in crop and livestock losses",-0.25,54.5,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/for-midwest-farmers-floodwaters-threaten-millions-in-crop-and-livestock-losses,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,www.pbs.org,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Farmer Jeff Jorgenson looks out over 750 acres of cropland submerged beneath the swollen Missouri River, and he knows he probably won’t plant this year.But that’s not his biggest worry. He and other farmers have worked until midnight for days to move grain, equipment and fuel barrels away from the floodwaters fed by heavy rain and snowmelt. The rising water that has damaged hundreds of homes and been blamed for three deaths has also taken a heavy toll on agriculture, inundating thousands of acres, threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock.In Fremont County alone, Jorgenson estimates that more than a million bushels of corn and nearly half a million bushels of soybeans have been lost after water overwhelmed grain bins before they could be emptied of last year’s crop. His calculation using local grain prices puts the financial loss at more than $7 million in grain alone. That’s for about 28 farmers in his immediate area, he said.Once it’s deposited in bins, grain is not insured, so it’s just lost money.Once it’s deposited in bins, grain is not insured, so it’s just lost money. This year farmers have stored much more grain than normal because of a large crop last year and fewer markets in which to sell soybeans because of a trade dispute with China.“The economy in agriculture is not very good right now. It will end some of these folks farming, family legacies, family farms,” he said. “There will be farmers that will be dealing with so much of a negative they won’t be able to tolerate it.”Jorgenson, 43, who has farmed since 1998, reached out to friends Saturday, and they helped him move his grain out of bins to an elevator. Had they not acted, he would have lost $135,000.Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has declared a disaster in 41 of Iowa’s 99 counties, said she planned to press Vice President Mike Pence for a federal disaster declaration during his stops in Omaha to tour flooded areas along the Missouri River.“It will be helpful for him to see it. I’ve reached out, and we’ve told him it’s catastrophic,” she said.Pence said the Trump administration would expedite presidential disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa. He said he spoke to the governors of both states shortly after arriving to assure them federal aid will soon be on the way.The flooding is expected to continue throughout the week in several states as high water flows down the Missouri River. Swollen rivers have already breached more than a dozen levees in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.The flooding, which started after a massive late-winter storm last week, has also put some hog farms in southwest Iowa underwater. The dead animals inside must be disposed of, Reynolds said.The water rose so quickly that farmers in many areas had no time to get animals out, said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.“Places that haven’t seen animal loss have seen a lot of animal stress. That means they’re not gaining weight and won’t be marketed in as timely a manner, which results in additional cost,” he said.In all, Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson estimated $400 million of crop losses from fields left unplanted or planted late and up to $500 million in livestock losses.In a news release issued Tuesday, Gov. Pete Ricketts said there have been deadlier disasters in Nebraska but never one as widespread. He said 65 of the state’s 93 counties are under emergency declarations.In neighboring Missouri, water was just shy of getting into Ryonee McCann’s home along a recreational lake in Holt County, where about 40,000 acres (16,188 hectares) and hundreds of homes have been flooded. She said her home sits on an 8-foot (2.5-meter) foundation.“We have no control over it,” the 38-year-old said. “We just have to wait for the water to recede. It’s upsetting because everything you have worked for is there.”The Missouri River was forecast to crest Thursday morning at 11.6 feet above flood stage in St. Joseph, Missouri, the third highest crest on record. More than 100 roads are closed in the state, including a growing section of Interstate 29.Leaders of the small northwestern Missouri town of Craig ordered an evacuation. The Holt County Sheriff’s Department said residents who choose to stay must go to City Hall to provide their name and address in case they need to be rescued.In nearby Atchison County, Missouri, floodwaters knocked out a larger section of an already busted levee overnight, making the village of Watson unreachable, said Mark Manchester, the county’s deputy director of emergency management/911.Officials believe everyone got out before thousands of more acres were flooded. But so many roads are now closed that some residents must travel more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) out of their way to get to their jobs at the Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska, he said.“It’s a lot harder for people to get around,” Manchester said.River flooding has also surrounded a northern Illinois neighborhood with water, prompting residents to escape in boats. People living in the Illinois village of Roscoe say children have walked through floodwaters or kayaked to catch school buses.Flooding along rivers in western Michigan has damaged dozens of homes and businesses.Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis, Margery Beck in Omaha, Nebraska, and Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report."
Jury decides Roundup weed killer was major factor in man’s cancer,-1.33,50.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/jury-decides-roundup-weed-killer-was-major-factor-in-mans-cancer,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,www.pbs.org,"SAN FRANCISCO — Roundup weed killer was a substantial factor in a California man’s cancer, a jury determined Tuesday in the first phase of a trial that attorneys said could help determine the fate of hundreds of similar lawsuits.The unanimous verdict by the six-person jury in federal court in San Francisco came in a lawsuit filed against Roundup’s manufacturer, agribusiness giant Monsanto. Edwin Hardeman, 70, was the second plaintiff to go to trial out of thousands around the country who claim the weed killer causes cancer.Monsanto says studies have established that Roundup’s active ingredient, glyphosate, is safe.The outcome of such cases can help attorneys decide whether to keep fighting similar lawsuits or settle them.A San Francisco jury in August awarded another man $289 million after determining Roundup caused his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A judge later slashed the award to $78 million, and Monsanto has appealed.Hardeman’s trial is before a different judge and may be more significant. U.S. Judge Vince Chhabria is overseeing hundreds of Roundup lawsuits and has deemed Hardeman’s case and two others “bellwether trials.”The outcome of such cases can help attorneys decide whether to keep fighting similar lawsuits or settle them. Legal experts said a jury verdict in favor of Hardeman and the other test plaintiffs would give their attorneys a strong bargaining position in any settlement talks for the remaining cases before Chhabria.The judge had split Hardeman’s trial into two phases. Hardeman’s attorneys first had to convince jurors that using Roundup was a significant factor in his cancer before they could make arguments for damages.The trial will now proceed to the second phase to determine whether the company is liable and if so, for how much.Hardeman declined to comment outside court.“This has been a long time coming for Mr. Hardeman,” said one of his attorneys, Jennifer Moore. “He’s very pleased he had his day in court, and we’re looking forward to phase two.”Many government regulators have rejected a link between cancer and glyphosate. Monsanto has vehemently denied such a connection, saying hundreds of studies have established that the chemical is safe.Bayer, which acquired Monsanto last year, said in a statement after the verdict that it continues to “believe firmly that the science confirms glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer.”“We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto’s conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman’s cancer,” it said.Monsanto developed glyphosate in the 1970s, and the weed killer is now sold in more than 160 countries and widely used in the U.S.The herbicide came under increasing scrutiny after the France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, classified it as a “probable human carcinogen” in 2015.Lawsuits against Monsanto followed. The company has attacked the international research agency’s opinion as an outlier.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says glyphosate is safe for people when used in accordance with label directions.Hardeman started using Roundup products to treat poison oak, overgrowth and weeds on his Sonoma County property in the 1980s and continued using them through 2012, according to his attorneys. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2015."
North Carolina Republican in disputed Congressional race won’t run again,-7.0,58.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/north-carolina-republican-in-disputed-congressional-race-wont-run-again,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-02-26,www.pbs.org,"RALEIGH, N.C. — The Republican candidate whose narrow lead in a North Carolina congressional race was thrown out because of suspicions of ballot fraud announced Tuesday he will not run in the newly ordered do-over election, saying he needs surgery late next month.The withdrawal of Mark Harris, a candidate hobbled by links to alleged ballot fraud, could help Republicans in their effort to keep the competitive seat in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district.Harris announced his decision in a statement that focused on his health problems. He did not mention the alleged ballot fraud scandal.Harris had led Democrat Dan McCready by just 905 votes after November’s election, but the outcome was never certified. State election officials grew concerned about reports that an operative working for Harris was illegally tampering with absentee ballots.Harris last week stopped a special state elections board hearing by declaring he couldn’t continue to testify. He cited health problems caused by a blood infection that required hospitalization and led to two strokes. He also said he agreed that a new election should be called, despite his previous calls to be declared the winnerShortly after Harris spoke last week, the elections boardordered a new contest. A date for the new election has not been announced.WATCH: Do-over election in N.C. congressional district requires new primariesOn Tuesday, Harris encouraged his supporters to rally around Stony Rushing, a commissioner in Union County. The local official from the Charlotte suburbs would “stand firm on so many of the issues that concern us, including the issue of life, our national security, and religious freedom,” Harris said.Rushing, a firing range owner and licensed gun seller, has been a county commissioner off and on for more than eight years, first taking office in 2002. He didn’t return a phone call to his shooting range seeking comment on Tuesday.Only one other GOP candidate — former state Sen. Tommy Tucker of Union County — has publicly expressed interest in running for the seat. In a phone interview, Tucker said he’s “95 percent sure” that he plans to run for the seat. He said he had no idea how Harris’ near-endorsement of Rushing would affect the campaign.Former U.S. Rep. Robert Pittenger, whom Harris defeated in last May’s primary, told The Associated Press in an interview that it was “good for the country and the party” that Harris wasn’t running. When asked why, he said simply: “I think it’s just obvious.”Pittenger again closed the door on seeking his old job, saying he’s involved in a series of conferences around the world bringing lawmakers together to discuss counter-terrorism and security issues.Former Gov. Pat McCrory said Monday he wouldn’t seek the seat. He was previously mayor of Charlotte, a part of which is in the congressional district.McCready has been assembling a new campaign staff and raising money to run again in the district that stretches from Charlotte through several counties to the east along the South Carolina border. His campaign finance report showed McCready raised $487,000 during the final five weeks of 2018. His campaign sent out a campaign fundraising plea late Thursday, citing the state elections board’s decision.McCready formally announced his intention to run Friday before several dozen supporters at a brewery in Waxhaw, near Charlotte.“Folks, there’s a lot of people that have had their confidence shaken in recent weeks because of the fraud conducted by Mark Harris’s campaign,” McCready said. “There’s a lot of people right now in North Carolina that are disillusioned in our electoral process.”He told the crowd that he and his team were going to “knock on every door” in the district to earn votes and to reassure constituents that he’s the type of politician who will do the right thing.“We’re going to talk to people about doing what’s right instead of what’s wrong,” he said.Harris struggled during testimony last week over why he prepared for his primary election last year by seeking out and signing up Bladen County political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless, a convicted felon who had been accused of ballot fraud in the 2016 elections. The state elections board turned over evidence of his actions in 2017 to federal prosecutors, who took no action.According to testimony and other findings detailed at the hearing, Dowless conducted an illegal “ballot harvesting” operation: He and his assistants gathered up absentee ballots from voters by offering to put them in the mail.Dowless’ workers in rural Bladen County testified that they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates.It is generally against the law in North Carolina for anyone other than the voter or a family member to handle someone’s completed ballot.No criminal charges have been filed in the case. Dowless declined to testify last week after the elections board refused to grant him immunity from prosecution based on what he might say.Associated Press writers Gary D.

Read new Michael Cohen court documents that may offer clues on Mueller probe,-2.67,48.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-michael-cohen-court-documents-that-offer-clues-on-mueller-probe,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,www.pbs.org,"A federal judge in New York dropped a few more breadcrumbs Tuesday around special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, unsealing nearly 900 pages of court documents surrounding Michael Cohen, the former attorney and fixer to President Donald Trump.What are these documents exactly?These are the affidavits and search warrants which gave officers the legal authority to search Cohen’s homes and offices in 2018. In them, officials in the Southern District of New York laid out their suspicions about Cohen, how they planned to investigate and why those warrants were needed.Read the original documents below.Released months after they were first requested by news organizations, the documents are an early outline of the cases against Cohen, which played out in two separate investigations, one by Mueller’s team and another by federal prosecutors in New York. They also point to the cache of evidence the special counsel’s office has from Cohen and raise questions about who else may be tainted by it.Was there any new information in the documents?The filings reveal that in July 2017, when Cohen was stillreferring to himselfas the “personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump,” the FBI obtained search warrants for Cohen’s email. Investigators specifically gained permission to search emails dating back to January 2016.That period included the first few months of Trump’s presidency, as well as much of the 2016 campaign. Those are also key, disputed months in terms of Trump’s personal interest in Russia.Michael Cohen recently testified before Congress that Trump continued discussing a possible hotel deal in Russia through the first half of 2016. Cohen had previously testified that the discussions had stopped in early 2016, but later said that was a lie. The White House has repeatedly claimed that Cohen is now an unreliable witness who is inventing stories about Trump in order to gain sympathy in court and reduce his prison time. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and to several counts of campaign and finance violations.Also of interest in the documents: nearly 20 pages devoted to Cohen’s “illegal campaign contribution scheme,” which were entirely redacted by the judge. That is likely a reference to the case in which Cohen pleaded guilty to paying off two women to keep their alleged affairs with Trump silent during Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen has said Trump personally approved of and repaid him as part of that scheme, including making some payments as president in 2017. The White House has repeatedly said Cohen’s account is untrue.What did the early stages of the investigation look like?According to the court papers, authorities were eyeing Cohen for multiple crimes, including  bank fraud and making illegal campaign contributions in the 2016 cycle.A judge approved searches of Cohen’s Park Avenue apartment, downtown Manhattan office, a safe deposit box, hotel room and two Apple iPhones — leading to FBI raids that received significant media coverage last year. But the documents include some interesting details about the searches, such as a note that specifically gave investigators permission to “depress the fingerprints and/or thumbprints of Michael Cohen onto [his iPhone] or hold [the iPhone] in front of Cohen’s face … in order to gain access”.What’s not in the documents?While these are high-profile court papers, they do not substantially add to what we already know about the actions of Cohen or anyone else in the Trump campaign or Trump Organization.But the court filings underline one key aspect of Mueller’s investigation: The special counsel appears to have far more documents than the public knows about — and his team has had those documents for a significant amount of time."
Officials announce new measures to fight New York measles outbreak,-0.67,54.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/officials-announce-new-measures-to-fight-new-york-measles-outbreak,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,www.pbs.org,"NEW YORK — Officials trying to contain a measles outbreak in a county north of New York City on Tuesday ordered all unvaccinated people exposed to the disease barred from public gathering places, including houses of worship, for up to three weeks.The order, issued by Rockland County, comes one day after New York City closed a preschool over non-compliance with measles vaccine requirements.Both the county and city are struggling to contain a swelling number of measles cases centered in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods while battling lawsuits over their efforts to require vaccinations.Rockland County issued its order three days ahead of the start of Passover, when many families travel to be together and gather in synagogues.“Need we wait for someone to die?” Rockland County Executive Ed Day said in announcing the measure.New York officials provided an update on Wednesday over the measles outbreak in New York.New York City’s Board of Health will vote Wednesday on whether to extend an emergency declaration last week ordering mandatory vaccinations in four Brooklyn ZIP codes.Health officials have confirmed 329 cases of measles in the city and 184 cases in Rockland since the outbreak of the highly contagious disease began in October.After announcing the vaccination order on April 9, the city took the step Monday of closing the preschool portion of a private Jewish school because the school had failed to turn over vaccination and attendance records.“This is about protecting kids and it’s also about protecting some adults, including pregnant women, folks who are going through medical treatment like chemotherapy, some senior with compromised health conditions,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a TV interview . “Measles is very, very serious.”READ MORE: U.S. measles count up to 555, with most new cases in New YorkAlso on Monday, a group of parents filed a lawsuit against the vaccination order, arguing it was “arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law and in violation of petitioners’ rights under the United States Constitution and New York State law.”A judge in Brooklyn state Supreme Court declined to issue an injunction barring the city from enforcing the order, and the parties will appear in court Thursday.The plaintiffs in the lawsuit are identified by their initials. Their attorney, Robert Krakow, claimed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine “can cause many vaccine injuries, including encephalitis and death.”Medical experts have debunked those claims and proven that the vaccine is safe, but opposition to vaccines persists.“In 2017, measles killed 110,000 people worldwide, mostly children under the age of 5,” Day said in announcing the new anti-measles rules in Rockland.Under the county’s Communicable Disease and Exposure Exclusion Order, anyone either diagnosed with measles or exposed to a person who has been diagnosed with measles must stay away from indoor and outdoor places of assembly for up to 21 days. Violators could be fined $2,000 per day.While no one in the county has died of measles, the disease has caused several hospitalizations and a premature birth.Rockland County announced the new tactics to fight measles after an earlier order banning all unvaccinated children from indoor public places was halted by a judge. The county is appealing that ruling.The measles cases in Rockland and in Brooklyn have been traced to unvaccinated members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community who traveled to Israel, where a measles outbreak is occurring.Orthodox Jewish leaders say a small faction of vaccine opponents in the community has allowed the disease to spread.A Yiddish-language newspaper that serves the ultra-Orthodox community in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg section took the rare step last week of publishing an editorial in English excoriating those who refuse to vaccinate.“When it’s time to decide if to have a serious surgery, you don’t turn to a hotlines, but you go to a conventional doctor,” the editorial in Der Yid read. “When you need a referral to a good doctor for a serious health problem you don’t stand at the bus stop to and take a poll of friends for the right address, but you call those devoted rabbis who understand medical matters or the recognized medical referral agencies who are familiar with the best doctors. All of them say that one must vaccinate.”READ MORE: How social media is trying to contain misinformation over vaccines"

Analysis: Cities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic face bankruptcy,-2.0,44.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/analysis-cities-hit-hard-by-the-covid-19-pandemic-face-bankruptcy,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,www.pbs.org,"U.S. cities are fast running out of cash.The pandemic will reduce local government revenues by anestimated US$11.6 billionin 2020. With COVID-19 requiring residents to stay home and stores to shutter, the bulk of this reduction comes from a slump in local sales taxes. Declines will continue into 2021.State revenues are heading in the same direction, so many U.S. cities will need to rely on help from the federal government. Aid to cities may be part of the next pandemic aid package now being discussed by members of the House and Senate.But so far, the Republicans’ bill leaves out any new funding for state and local governments, while the Democrats’ bill includes $1 trillion for it.And if federal assistance arrives, it will not fix every city’s budget.The pandemic has hit budgets so hard that even cities in relatively good financial health – including those withrainy day fundsto help them through an emergency – will face significant changes to staffing and services.For cities in the poorest shape, the pandemic could mean bankruptcy.The Northern California city of Vallejo declared bankruptcy in 2008. Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesSize mattersBankruptcy is a legal process where people, companies and governments who cannot pay their debts seek to reduce them.Which debts get paid during a bankruptcy are important decisions. They involve how comfortable a city employee’s retirement might be, the level of health insurance for pensioners and workers, the extent of labor protections for employees and the future cost of borrowing for a city.City bankruptcy was created by Congress after the Great Depression, in response to4,770different units of city government going belly up.Twenty-seven statesnow allow their cities to file for bankruptcy.Those statesthat do not allow city bankruptcy – Georgia and Iowa explicitly prohibit filing, with the other 21 states having no specific allowance or prohibition – manage the problem of city indebtedness in various ways, ranging from strict budget oversight to the disbanding of heavily indebted cities. Since 1938, city bankruptcy has been usedaround 700times.A city’s bankruptcy differs from corporate bankruptcy in that it does not allow for the liquidation of assets. For cities, bankruptcy is used to reduce debts, not sell off things – such as public roads and buildings – to pay off debts. The bankruptcy judge’s role is to determine whether the proposed reduction is fair to all people the city owes money to, which may include workers, pensioners, bankers, suppliers and investors.But bankruptcies can look different in different cities.We are scholars who research changes in how cities go about budgeting.Our work hasshowed that the city bankruptcies that followed the Great Recession of 2007 and 2008 were not uniform.If you were in a big city, your government owed money to lots of people. The converse was true in small cities. As the number of participants in a bankruptcy increases, the task of deciding how much different creditors should get repaid becomes more complicated.Somebody doesn’t get paidWestfall Township, Pennsylvania, home to about 2,000 people, declared bankruptcy in 2009 after losing a lawsuit to New Jersey real estate developers David and Barbara Katz.Courts ruledthat the city owed the Katzes $20.8 million after improperly denying them permission to develop projects in the township.With annual revenues of just $1 million, Westfall had few options but to file for bankruptcy.Resolving Westfall’s bankruptcy meant reaching a new agreement with the Katzes. The bankruptcy court approved a$6 million settlementwith the developers and gave Westfall 20 years to pay. The city would also raise property taxes and delay the repayment of other debts. By 2014, Westfall’s budget had recovered enough for Pennsylvania toremove itfrom its list of distressed cities.Bankruptcy proceedings were more complicated in Vallejo, California, which is on the northern end of San Francisco Bay. Vallejo,population 120,000, had a 2008-2009 budget of $79.6 million. In 2008, the city lost around one-quarter of its revenues as local sales taxes and real estate development fees collapsed. Vallejo suddenly found itself unable to pay all of its bills.The City Council voted unanimously to file forbankruptcy.In its bankruptcy filing, the city estimated it had between 1,000 and 5,000 creditors. The most contentious part of the bankruptcy concerned the city’s obligations to its own unionized employees. Vallejo argued that its bankruptcy should include the option of reducing employee wages and benefits, and changing working conditions, if necessary, without union consent.The judge agreed and, in doing so,expandedwhat types of debt could be reduced in bankruptcy. This was, and remains,controversial. Although unions havepushed back, later bankruptcies have confirmed the court’s decision.Vallejo ultimately chose not to impose new employment contracts on most of its employees.That decision helped Vallejo avoid costly legal battles – but the city’s main expenditures, wages and pensions, remainedlargely unaltered. The city emerged out of bankruptcy solvent butstruggling. Filing for bankruptcy ended up costing Vallejo over $20 million in court and legal fees.Art, philanthropy and pension debts in DetroitVallejo’s bankruptcy foreshadowed an even more complex one in Detroit, where revenue decline and failedWall Street betsleft the city unable to balance its budget.Detroit listed 100,000 creditors in its 2013 bankruptcy filing, totaling$18.5 billionin debts. Like Vallejo, Detroit would have to decide which creditors to stiff, effectively asking them to pay for the city’s budget failures.Detroit’s biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesThe eventual settlement would reduce Detroit’s debts by $7 billion, mostly by slashing the amount of borrowed money the city would have to repay to banks and investors.Butno creditorwould walk away unscathed. Wages, pensions and health care for city employees were all cut. The city also entered into a complex “Grand Bargain” brokered by local philanthropists with the state of Michigan and pension holders that helped settle the city’s largest debt, which was to pensioners, while keeping in the city its one major asset, the Detroit Institute of Art’s collection.The administrative and legal costs of the Detroit bankruptcy came in at around $100 million.No single pathThe bigger the city, the more complicated and expensive the bankruptcy. More creditors means more lawyers making competing claims on the city’s dwindling revenues.It also makes the process of picking winners and losers more complex and something that can involve testing the limits of bankruptcy law. When these limits expand, just what going bust means can change dramatically. Things that once seemed untouchable, like pensions, can become vulnerable in bankruptcy courts.With many budgets in tatters, the prospect of growing numbers of city bankruptcies looms.Distressed citieswill have to figure out what the process means for them.It is rarely possible to predict what any city will decide. With any part of a city’s operations – including salaries, pensions, road repairs, borrowing, park maintenance, policing, libraries – potentially fair game, everyone involved faces great uncertainty. There is nosingle, predictable paththrough city bankruptcy.This article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license. Read theoriginal article."
How to spot Comet NEOWISE before it disappears for thousands of years,0.33,51.33,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-to-spot-comet-neowise-before-it-disappears-for-thousands-of-years,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,www.pbs.org,"There’s still a little bit of time to catch a glimpse of a newly discovered comet as it blazes across the night sky, especially if you have binoculars or a telescope handy.C/2020 F3 NEOWISE, also called Comet NEOWISE, was first spotted in late March of this year by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) mission. According to NASA, the comet’s nucleus is about3 miles in diameterand composed ofdust, rock and frozen gasesleft over from the birth of our solar system around 4.6 billion years ago.When comets near our sun, the increasing heat creates a coma, or a kind ofatmosphere composed of particles and gasesthat surrounds the nucleus. A combination of solar wind and the pressure of sunlight can blow some of that atmosphere away from the comet,forming two tails— one made of ions, and another made of dust — that can extend in the opposite direction of the sun for millions of miles. Imaging suggests that Comet NEOWISE could potentially have two ion tails, as well asits dust tail.Graphic courtesy of NASASpacePlace via Wikimedia Commons.Joseph Masiero, who serves as NEOWISE deputy principal investigator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said that spotting Comet NEOWISE was “exhilarating,” particularly given how rare it is for comets that are visible to the naked eye to pass by our planet.“These kinds of celestial events really help remind me how big and wonderful the universe is, and how fortunate I am to get to explore it in these difficult times.”“I’m pretty sure every astronomer surveying the sky has a secret hope to find the next naked-eye comet, so I feel like our team won the lottery on this,” Masiero said. “These kinds of celestial events really help remind me how big and wonderful the universe is, and how fortunate I am to get to explore it in these difficult times.”Comet NEOWISE made its closest approach to Earth on July 22 and has grown dimmer and dimmer as it heads back toward the outer reaches of our solar system. But if you want to try your luck over the next few days, find a patch of sky with a minimal amount of light pollution where your view won’t be obstructed by trees or buildings.Animation by Megan McGrew/PBS NewshourThen look to the northwestern sky below and just a bit west of the Big Dipper — the comet will be climbing higher above the horizon as the nights wear on. You can also use theComet NEOWISE appto help you figure out exactly where to look for the comet from your location.https://twitter.com/WIRED/status/1286359673554313216Although you may still be able to spot Comet NEOWISE with your naked eye, a pair of binoculars or a telescope should give you a clearer view. The publicationEarthSkyalso recommends using a high quality camera that can capture the comet with an extended exposure.If you miss the show this time around, you’ll just have to wait another 6,800 years or so for Comet NEOWISE to make its way back to Earth.Comet NEOWISE, also known as ‘C/2020 F3’, is seen on July 18, 2020 in Joshua Tree, California.

"Oleandrin is a deadly plant poison, not a COVID-19 cure",-3.4,46.2,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/oleandrin-is-a-deadly-plant-poison-not-a-covid-19-cure,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,www.pbs.org,"With COVID-19 cases and deaths rising in the U.S. and globally, identifying new therapies to prevent and combat the virus is a top priority. Natural products from plants are an attractive option in the search for a cure. Approximately374,000 plant speciesare on Earth; humans have used more than28,000of them as a form of medicine.But not all that is natural is necessarily safe. Scientists have not yet explored most of these species for their chemical makeup or therapeutic potential.As a medical ethnobotanist,I studythe traditional uses of medicinal plants to discover promising leads for new drugs to fight infectious diseases. It’s vital to consider both the potential benefits and risks of plant extracts in such research. I am concerned by recentreportsthat a chemical found in the oleander plant is being touted as a potential treatment for COVID-19.About the Oleander plantNerium oleanderis a highly toxic plant from the Apocynaceae family. Though renowned for its beauty and use in landscaping, this Mediterranean shrub is responsible for cases of accidental poisoning across the globe. All parts of the plant are poisonous. If eaten, it causes cardiac arrhythmias, or irregular heart rates, and can be lethal to both humans and animals.The chemical structure for oleandrin, the toxic compound in the beautiful plant oleander. Casssandra Quave, CC BY-SAOleandrin is the chemical that causes the plant’s lethal toxicity. It is known by scientists as acardiac glycoside, a class of organic compounds with a common feature: They exhibit powerful effects on heart tissue, often with deadly consequences.A pre-print article – that is, an article not peer-reviewed by other scientists – is now online. It reports how, in a test tube, oleandrin reduces production of the virus responsible for COVID-19. But this does not take into account the well-known cardiac toxicity of the chemical when consumed by an animal or human.Particularly worrisome is the idea that consumers may misinterpret any publicity surrounding oleander and try to self-medicate with this highly poisonous plant. I’m also concerned the dietary supplements industry may try to take advantage of the public’s fear of COVID-19 by developing supplements containing oleandrin.There are many other examples of natural plant extracts that are harmful. But oleander is particularly dangerous, because ingesting any part of the plant can lead to serious illness and possibly death. What’s more, there is no published scientific evidence on the safety of consuming oleandrin or its plant source,Nerium oleander. It is critical that the Food and Drug Administration and its commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, make certain the public is protected from this poison.This article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

What you need to know about hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus,-6.33,45.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-you-need-to-know-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-coronavirus,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-10,www.pbs.org,"There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that hassickened millions of people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, and killed thousands more. But health care workers have been trying to reduce the severity of people’s symptoms with medications designed to treat other ailments — including the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine.While there is anecdotal evidence some patients’ may have received hydroxychloroquine and then recovered, there is no data that proves it is effective in treating or preventing COVID-19. In fact, mounting data suggests this drug may do more harm than good when used to treat patients infected with novel coronavirus.The National Institutes of Health has launched clinical trials around the drug as a potential therapy for COVID-19 at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville and a network of more than 40 hospitals. But absent that kind of data, there has been confusion around how exactly to use the drug to treat patients sick with the virus — and whether it is effective.On April 24, the FDA warned the public against using hydroxychloroquine outside of a hospital since these clinical trials are not yet completed.“While clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for COVID-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered,” said FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen M. Hahn in areleased statement.For weeks, President Donald Trump has touted the use of the drug, along with chloroquine, as possible treatments. Often, he has suggested combining them with antibiotics.On May 18, Trump told reporters during a roundtable with restaurant industry leaders that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for at least two weeks, despite the fact that the drug remained an unproven form of treatment for COVID-19.“A couple of weeks ago, I started taking it,” Trump said. “I’ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it is not good, I will tell you right. I’m not going to get hurt by it. It has been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things. I take it.”In a large observational study that has since been discredited, researchers analyzed the effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine using data from nearly 97,000 patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 at 671 hospitals. Their findings, published May 22 in The Lancet, suggested that use of these drugs to treat COVID-19 was linked to higher rates of mortality and serious heart conditions. Researchers also said these drugs should not be used outside clinical trials, which have not yet concluded that either drug is safe or effective to treat people infected with novel coronavirus.But on June 4, the journal said the study’sauthors had retracted their workafter they “were unable to complete an independent audit of the data underpinning their analysis.”On June 15, the Food and Drug Administrationrevoked its emergency use authorizationfor hydroxychloroquine, saying the drug may not be effective to treat COVID-19 and “the drug’s potential benefits for such use do not outweigh its known and potential risks.”Public health officials have criticized Trump for pushing a drug without evidence of its efficacy in treating COVID-19, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has led the nation’s response to the virus, has said there is no data to support that this drug works.The president’s endorsement has emboldened at least two people to take chloroquine, absent a doctor’s orders, with tragic results. One Arizona couple consumed chloroquine phosphate, a chemical used to treat sick fish in their koi pond. Both in their 60s, the man and woman became ill, and the man later died,NBC News reported on March 23. They were afraid they would get sick with COVID-19, and ingested the chemical after President Donald Trump touted its possible benefits, according to the woman, who asked not to be named when she spoke to NBC News.Here’s what we know about the drug now and how researchers are working to determine if it truly can help patients infected with novel coronavirus.U.S. President Donald Trump stops a reporter from asking Dr. Anthony Fauci a question about use of the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat the disease caused by the new coronavirus near the end of the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 5, 2020.      REUTERS/Joshua RobertsWhat is hydroxychloroquine, and what does it treat?Centuries ago, the Incas in Perudried and ground cinchona tree bark, then mixed the resulting fine powder with a liquid. In doing so, they produced a medicine used to lower fever later called quinine.By World War II, researchers studied how to further develop quinine for antimalarial treatment, eventually creating chloroquine. Among soldiers who were administered these drugs, those with rashes and arthritis noticed their symptoms improved, paving the way for thisantimalarial medication to also be prescribed to reduce swelling and joint pain. By 1955, a synthetic and less toxic version of this drug, hydroxychloroquine, had become more widely available.Because hydroxychloroquine reduces inflammation, doctors have often prescribed it to treatrheumatoid arthritis, as well as lupus, sarcoidosis and other autoimmune diseases. Side effects tend to be mild and includenausea, vomiting and diarrhea, but if the drug is taken for long periods of time, arare eye disorder called retinopathymay develop, resulting in permanent vision loss. Patients in the United States often refer to hydroxychloroquine using the brand name, Plaquenil.Is hydroxychloroquine a safe treatment for patients with COVID-19?At Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Dr. Wesley Self said he has lost count of how many patients he has treated for COVID-19. To find better ways to take care of those patients, Self is serving as lead investigator for the nationwide clinical trial on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. On Thursday, theNational Institutes of Healthformally announced the trial.Researchers started enrolling trial participants on April 2, Self said. There is reason to think hydroxychloroquine could reduce swelling in the lungs of a person with the virus, Self said.But people with COVID-19 are taking many medications, and those medications may interact with each other in unexpected ways. On top of that, Self said people infected with the virus “may be more susceptible to side effects from medications.”“There’s promise for this drug, but we simply don’t have enough data in patients with COVID,” he said.To understand whether or not the drug might help COVID-19 patients, Self and his research team are conducting a randomized trial. That means some patients infected with the coronavirus will receive hydroxychloroquine, and some won’t.Those who do get hydroxychloroquine will receive the medication for five days. The research team will then compare which group of patients get better faster and which ones may have reactions and side effects from the drug, Self said. And investigators, medical teams and patients won’t know which patients get the medication, ensuring that — all else being equal — every patient gets the same level of care. The trial is expected to last several months, or until researchers see definitive evidence that the drug is or isn’t helping.“We know this is an emergency, so we were already working very quickly,” Self said. “We’re trying to run this study as fast as we can while making sure it is still safe.”Until researchers complete these trials, anyone touting the benefits of using these drugs is only speaking anecdotally. These trials “are the way we learn,” said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer for the American Society of Clinical Oncology and an expert on clinical trials. If the study is well-designed and conducted, the findings won’t be based on hearsay or intuition but scientific observation.Until then, it remains unclear if these antimalarial medications offer effective treatment and relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. And no one should take these medications without consulting with their health care provider.Researchers at the Microbiology Research Facility work with coronavirus samples as a trial begins to see whether malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. March 19, 2020.  REUTERS/Craig LassigWhat about people who take hydroxychloroquine to treat other conditions?The Food and Drug Administration issued anemergency use authorizationon March 28 for hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate. That made it available to public health authorities to tap into the Strategic National Stockpile’s supply as an option for treatmentThe next day, the Department of Health and Human Services accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine and one million doses of chloroquine to the Strategic National Stockpile, donated by Sandoz and Bayer, two pharmaceutical companies.“Anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” a department press release said. “Clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective.”Even before confirmation from clinical trials, demand for hydroxychloroquine has led to shortages for people prescribed to take the drug to treat other illnesses. Health care providers are warning that could be a dangerous problem on its own.“Treatment interruptions for those with SLE and other rheumatic diseases must be prevented, because lapses in therapy can result in disease flares and strain already stretched health care resources,” Drs. Jinoos Yazdany and Alfred H.J. Kim,wrote late last monthin the Annals of Internal Medicine.Autoimmune disease patients like James Kuhn said they fear they will have trouble filling prescriptions for a medication that they have relied upon for years.Kuhn has taken the medication as his primary therapy for 10 years to treat sarcoidosis, a rare disease that swells lymph nodes and organs, and Sjogren’s disease.Kuhn, who also volunteers as a patient advocate, refilled his prescription in mid-March. But he is worried when he hears that some pharmacists are scaling back 30- or 90-day prescriptions to just two weeks. That could mean immuno-compromised people like Kuhn must venture outside their homes more often and potentially expose themselves to novel coronavirus to get the medications they need.“If we catch the disease, it is a near-death sentence,” Kuhn said.His rheumatologist, Dr. Soha Mousa, has been consulting with her patients, including Kuhn, by telemedicine since the pandemic began, and they are telling her they are already having a tough time filling prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine. In some cases, pharmacies ask patients to provide proof of their diagnosis before receiving their medication, Mousa said.“I’m getting frantic messages, [like] ‘How am I going to survive?’” Mousa said.Mousa said she is asking her patients to shop around, if possible. Find different pharmacies, or shop online for their prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine. They have told her that in some cases, it now costs $600 to fill a month’s prescription, dramatically more than what the drug cost even three months ago. For some patients, that prices them out of their medication."
Gloria Steinem on the role of women of color in the suffrage movement,-8.0,48.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/gloria-steinem-on-the-role-of-women-of-color-in-the-suffrage-movement,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,www.pbs.org,"On the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, feminist writer, author and activist Gloria Steinem said that Black, indigenous and other American women of color were essential to the suffrage movement even though their efforts have not historically always been recognized.“It was huge,” Steinem said of American women’s struggle to win the right to vote in the U.S. “And it included people we don’t hear about enough. I mean, it included Black suffragists. It included Native American suffragists.”READ:A century ago, some American women won the right to vote. Here’s what women say todayAlthough women of color were essential to the suffrage movement, they were not always fully welcomed or recognized by some of its most visible leaders,according to historical accountsof events leading up to the passage of the 19th Amendment. And while the amendment itself guaranteed the right to vote to many women,it took several more decadesfor that right to be fully protected by the constitution for Black women, Native American women, Latina women and others.Steinem pointed to the Seneca Falls convention in 1848, which is considered the beginning of the U.S. women’s suffrage movement, as evidence that women of color have not always been included in the narrative. By the time Seneca Falls occurred, Black women had already been active in the American political space. In a recent interview, Stanford University historian Estelle Freedman noted that Black and white northern womenboth participatedin the anti-slavery movement from the 1830s through the 1850s, which eventually gave way to the suffrage movement.“[Women of color] were always more active … yet Seneca Falls, in which there was only one person of color and it was a man — Frederick Douglass — is counted as the beginning of the movement,” Steinem said.Steinem noted that today, “history is repeating itself in the sense that Black women are the single most important and influential group in the Democratic Party, just as women of color were more influential in getting the [right to] vote.”The 19th Amendment did not signal the end of racial oppression in America, nor did it signal an end to the gender pay gap, workplace harassment or gender-based violence. Steinem said the women’s rights movement has “a long way to go” before full equality between men and women is achieved in American society. “We still don’t fully have the right to our own bodies,” said Steinem, referencing the ongoing legislative fights over abortion in the U.S. “I think we have yet to understand the rights that the female half of the human race need as females.”Steinem said she hoped the coronavirus pandemic would result in a “changed consciousness,” given the virus does not discriminate based on race, class, nationality or gender, and this gave her a sort of cautious optimism amid the tragic public health crisis: “I try to be realistic, but hope is a form of planning. So that should not be taken away from us.”"
"A century ago, some American women won the right to vote. Here’s what women say today",-6.0,43.25,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/a-century-ago-some-american-women-won-the-right-to-vote-heres-what-women-say-today,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,www.pbs.org,"Voting matters to American women, who prove it by showing up at the polls. In every general election since 1984,they have turned out at slightly higher ratesthan male voters.But it took hundreds of years before women in the United States gained the right to participate in the democracy they helped to create. If women were married, society viewed them as accessories to their husbands. They had no say in the policies and laws that shaped their lives, denied the right to go to the ballot box.Women from all walks of life rallied, protested and petitioned for change and a chance to be heard for decades. Finally, a century ago on this date, the 19th Amendment was ratified, promising millions but not all American women the right to vote — an incomplete victory.“In many ways, we missed out on the promise of what the 19th Amendment could have been.”White women could vote, but women of color, particularly Black and Native American women, were left vulnerable and unprotected by the same constitutionally enshrined right up until the 1960s.Racial tension splintered the suffragist movement, said Fatima Goss Graves, president and chief executive officer of the National Women’s Law Center. Though the abolition of slavery and the fight for women’s equality had originally been aligned, white suffragists ultimatelysacrificed equal rights for allin order to gain the right to vote for some.A hundred years later, Goss Graves said the U.S. is “having those same conversations” and that the country “is acutely aware of the importance of our democracy and who gets to participate fully.” The rise of voter ID laws, voter suppression efforts and the lapse of the Voting Rights Act bring into sharp focus how fragile suffrage remains, she said.“In many ways, we missed out on the promise of what the 19th Amendment could have been,” she said.After President Trump’s inauguration, 54 percent of women said they disapproved of his performance, according to a February 2017 Marist poll. More than three years later, that perception has remained largely intact, rising to 59 percent. Trump has maintained higher approval ratings among men throughout his time in office. Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourThis week, Sen. Kamala Harris will officially become the Democratic vice presidential nominee, the first Black woman and the first Indian American woman ever to appear on a national ticket. (Despite the historic moment, Harris’ background as a prosecutor has also drawn criticism and claims that she didn’t do enough to combat racial inequity in the criminal justice system.)To C. Nicole Mason, president and chief executive officer of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, Harris’ nomination is a moment to be celebrated. Four years ago, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first woman ever to be named a major political party’s nominee for U.S. president. And while she lost the election to President Donald Trump, there were ripple effects: In the 2018 midterm elections, voters elected the highest number ever of women and people of color to Congress. And there area record number of women running for Congress in 2020— thanks in large part to a growing number of Republican women seeking office.“We’ve come a long way, but there’s much more work to be done in our efforts to secure women’s leadership at the highest level of our government,” Mason said.What does the right to vote mean to women across the U.S.? And what would they say to the women who fought for that right? Eleven female voters shared their perspective about this moment’s significance with the PBS NewsHour, in their own words.These interviews have been edited for length and clarity.Photo courtesy Darrilynne Arnelle-MazyckDarrilynne Arnelle-Mazyck64, Maryland“There’s a picture of myself and my mother, me going to vote in 1972. I turned 18, and that was a big deal. Because I think they had just passed the law that 18-year-olds could vote because of the Vietnam War — that, you know, if you were old enough to fight, then you should be old enough to vote. So that was a momentous occasion for me personally.I wouldn’t be where I am without women fighting for the right to vote. Because 1972 was my first time voting, but I also was getting ready to enter college. And I was entering what had previously been an all-male college. I went on to medical school and, you know, these were very male dominated areas. And I don’t think that there would have been any kind of inclination to allowing women into those spheres without the right to vote. I mean, the right to vote brings pressure and in all sorts of places, not just the political sphere.I really believe that there is a certain segment of women who do not believe that women ought to be in leadership, and it’s their bias. I think that the media has a problem. The way that they speak about women, what things that they give credence to, what things that they will speak about — a woman’s sexual history as opposed to a man’s, how a woman dresses, whether she wears pants, whether she wears a dress. How does her hair look? You know, there are all these things that we would never think about talking about a man, maybe, but we talk about it when it comes to a woman.“The right to vote brings pressure and in all sorts of places, not just the political sphere.”Number one [hurdle to voting] is that it’s not a national holiday. People have jobs, they have to work. People — unless you live in a relatively affluent community — you can count on staying in line for a number of hours and no one wants to do that, you know. So I think that not having it as a national holiday is a big barrier. Number two is, how elections are actually run and who runs them.No one is guaranteed to win. We abide by — or we used to abide by — who wins. And, you know, that it’s majoritarian rule. And that has made us great. It’s made us an example to the rest of the world that a multicultural, multiracial, religiously diverse population can do this, you know, peacefully.”Julie Boyd48, TexasMy thoughts are just as equal as a man’s thoughts. I should be allowed to do just as what my husband is allowed to do. I think women have strong voices, loud voices, and we should be allowed to speak our minds. It really goes to equality. Many men these days don’t want to hear it. That’s their choice.My mom used to work for the League of Women Voters when I was growing up. The diligence and the hard work she put into that and to see the numbers change throughout the years and to see the group of women going out saying, ‘Look, you have a power in you. Let’s use that power in a positive way.’It’s about the right person. But if a woman gets in [the White House], I think that would move mountains. It would be unprecedented for the future of this country. I think we really need something like that. We still get the short end of the stick. I also think that some of the women don’t feel women can, and the big kicker is the emotion. That’s one of the greatest things I love about being a woman. I think that’s a barrier that shouldn’t be there.I know my vote makes a difference, but I feel like when you approach the people you voted for, you’re too small. They’re onto bigger things. What is the hot button? Who’s going to listen to this one little person unless something major were to happen. I do [plan to vote for Trump this November]. I’m not real proud to say that, but I’m scared of the other side. That’s kind of where I am.[To generations of women who were denied the right to vote], I would say I’m sorry that they were treated that way, that they weren’t treated equally. I would try to explain to them that even though they couldn’t vote, they still made a huge difference in our history, and they probably would have never known it, never felt that was what it feels like. I would say, ‘I’m sorry, but you did it. You helped pave the way.’”Photo courtesy Valaria DuckworthValaria Duckworth27, IllinoisIt’s really easy [to vote] in Illinois. I’ve voted in every presidential election since I’ve turned 18. So it’s very much a habit. And it just seems like, you know, with everything going on, it’s pretty important to be heard and vote and be tallied out there.When my father walked me in to vote on my 18th birthday, he had to stand next to me because it turns out that my actual role model who was bringing me in there was a registered felon, and he had never told me that. But he didn’t have the right to vote anymore in Illinois.We had never had the discussion and it never crossed my mind the way he was so politically engaged that he didn’t vote, he couldn’t vote. He’s also a veteran, and our conversation after made me realize how important [the right to vote] was because he had had it taken away. The law wasn’t even on the books anymore that he’d broken — it was the unconstitutional gun ban in Chicago. He’s gotten it straightened out since then, but at the time, he couldn’t vote here.My maternal grandfather is a German immigrant. And my understanding is one of his first ballots was for Eisenhower. My [Black] grandmother on the other hand, didn’t start voting until, like, Kennedy. So it was harder for her to manage to get approval to vote being a southern Arkansas woman. And then even my grandfather — her husband, my paternal grandparents — my grandfather was a veteran, but he didn’t have a proper birth certificate because of where he was born in Mississippi. So the Black side of the family actually started voting later, even though they were here longer.I’ve worked in a couple of municipalities. Those local elections  — that I was working on really early on at 19, 20 years old — told me that [that is] where your vote is more powerful because the margin is so small. It can be less than 1,000 votes — it can be a couple hundred votes — that makes the difference between who’s going to be sitting in that seat. So, you know, when people want to be apathetic about the big presidential election, the local ones still matter, too.[The women that came before me are] why I vote, you know, like it very much is. It’s for all of all the lost potential, all the misspent potential, all the potential that couldn’t be realized at the time for an artificial pyramid scheme. For all the women that couldn’t get their votes counted, like that’s why it’s most important for us to be voting right now.”Photo courtesy Barbara FillionBarbara Fillion66, Ohio“2016 was such a shock.Our group of women chartered a bus from Cincinnati and went to the [Women’s March] and we stayed in touch. We have gotten active in local and state politics. A dear friend of mine was part of the founding board members for a new PAC that was formed in Ohio to help get more women in state and local office. I met the woman running to represent me in the Ohio State House. And she’s younger than my oldest son and is just fabulous. And so I’ve been her campaign mom for two races in a row now.My state rep, two years ago, won her seat by 56 votes. And I got to be one of her observers at the recount because, obviously, that was less than half a percent. And I actually felt better about how our board of election runs having seen how that works.On election night, she was 300 and a few votes behind. But we knew there were still outstanding absentee ballots and a lot of provisional ballots because [of] the scanning machine. And when they were counted, she was ahead by 56 votes. And that triggered an automatic recount. So I went, and it’s a fascinating process to watch.We are the majority gender. And we are the ones who are impacted first when issues like the current pandemic, the current economic downturn and the current issues with education go south. I mean, there aren’t a whole hell of a lot of men who are worried about staying home with their kids and making sure they’re doing their remote learning. It’s moms who are juggling: ‘Did you do your schoolwork? Did I get my project done for work? How many Zoom calls am I on today?’ I love one of the taglines for our Matriots PAC in Ohio, which is, ‘When women lead, Ohio prospers.’ I like the fact that my current state rep. says, ‘I don’t consider myself a politician. I consider myself a public servant.’ And I think that tends to be the type of leadership we need in our legislatures, from city councils to the Oval Office, is people who consider their work public service, not politics. We’re woefully lacking in those in our current political climate.”Photo courtesy Elizabeth GallegosElizabeth Gallegos59, California“It’s hard to say [how my life has been affected by gaining the right to vote] because I’ve always had the right to vote. Even today, I think, I saw a story about how people were beaten and arrested and died — you know, women — for the right to vote. And I think it’s a shame that anybody would not use that right or take advantage of it. It’s not honoring the past, the people who sacrificed to get us here. So I have just done it as a responsibility my whole life.Also, I like to tell people if they don’t vote, they lose the right to complain about the outcome!My grandmother, who was born in 1910 and passed in 2007, was one of my inspirations. She always, even in her 90s, kept up with current events in the country and the world by reading newspapers. She always expressed her opinion and always voted.I have never felt discouraged or that [my vote] didn’t count. I think if I did, I’d probably be less inclined to vote every election. But I truly believe that it does count so that I make it to every polling place, every time, whether it’s just a local or a national vote, it’s always important.I’m trying to make sure that [the women who couldn’t vote in the past are] counted now. Women sacrificed to get me here. So I have an obligation to carry it forward.”Photo courtesy Kaitlyn HanksKaitlyn Hanks18, Kansas“Being a woman and voting to me is very important because it’s something that we weren’t able to do at one point. So I always feel the need to, like, if I have a chance to exercise a right that we fought for, I’m gonna go ahead and do that.My mom is very active. She voted every single year, every single election that she could. And it’s something that is really big in our family, and it means a lot to go out and vote. And it’s really cool that I actually got to do that with my mom this year and be there at the same time that she was voting and knowing I could vote right along with her.Not many people know how easy it is to register to vote. Not many people know where they can vote at, how to vote, things like that. Because it’s not broadcasted to our generation of younger adults. And people that are just now turning 18, at least the people in my community, a lot of our young voters aren’t registered to vote because they don’t know where to go and it’s just not broadcasted to people. Especially, like, our generation uses a lot of social media, and I can’t think of a day where I ever saw someone on social media talking about where to go register to vote, where to vote, who to vote for, candidates, things like that.It’s definitely important to have women in [office] to show our perspectives of what we see and how we feel and how we act.I think it’s really important that we should have a woman president, but I unfortunately don’t think that that’s going to happen anytime soon.There are tons of women who can vote now. And I’m so glad that they fought the way that they did, and they demanded their right to vote the way that they did. I am so incredibly proud of all of them who fought and fought and fought, because they definitely made a change in our society now. There’s a lot more women going to the polls than there was 100 years ago, and there’s a lot more women in political positions than there ever was.”Photo courtesy Jean JohnsonJean Johnson39, Michigan“I generally always vote even in the smallest elections. Voting is a privilege, it’s a right. It’s an honor not only to take the time to research with the smallest elections, but nationally, the presidential election is huge. I worry about the state of the world if Trump were to get reelected. If I can find a way to get out of America, I will leave my stuff here.I wrote [Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer on my birthday, or the day before my birthday, thanking her because I got to celebrate another year because she shut down the state [for the coronavirus].“I’m grateful for the [women] that consistently marched in the streets for me to be able to vote.”I knew more than a dozen people that died. I stopped counting.There’d be days where multiple people I knew died who didn’t know each other. And then seeing people somewhere else in the country being like, ‘Do you know anyone that has COVID?’ Like, posting that. And like, I know people with COVID right now. It was terrifying. It was absolutely terrifying. And I’m glad I got to stay home.Voting for Gretchen Whitmer and seeing her response during the pandemic, keeping me and other people safe after Michigan was hit so hard early on, I’m so grateful I voted for her. I am so grateful people I know voted for her.I’m grateful for the [women] that consistently marched in the streets for me to be able to vote.To them, I would say thank you so much, because I regret the few times I did not vote. And I don’t take it for granted. I’m really grateful for the opportunity to get to have a say in my community and the nation.”Nancy Kemp73, Arkansas“No, I doubt [I will vote this year]. I don’t know. They’ve got this whole United States — we don’t know if we’re coming or going, been there or already back. It’s a different story every time they open their mouths. … But boy, these Democrats and Republicans, all they do is fight and argue, and I don’t know anything about Joe Biden. Nothing. Personally, I think Trump’s done a decent job. So I don’t know if I’m gonna vote or not.I just feel like women should have always had the right to vote. … We’ve never had [a woman as president] and I don’t think we ever will. There’s women a lot smarter than a lot of these men.”Photo courtesy Dawn MountainDawn Mountain36, Montana“Both of my parents were really encouraging when I started to get curious about the news. They didn’t always agree with me, but they would always try and talk about the issues with me and encouraged me to vote my conscience no matter what.I’m a libertarian. So Dr. [Jo] Jorgenson has gone out of her way to be supportive of absolutely every facet of civil rights.We have to be out there every day and be the feet on the ground that are actually spreading the message. I’ve done campaigning for candidates, I’ve been local treasurer for a candidate here in town and I’ve been a state representative for a campaign. And I’ve also been, you know, just the person calling, making those cold calls and asking them if they’ve even heard about the candidate. At that point, we’re fighting against a big media blackout. I think that if we were even to get half the media time share of coverage that Trump and Biden get automatically and for free, that everybody would be aware that they have more options.[Voting Libertarian] meant that I could actually vote for somebody as opposed to voting against somebody, which is what my dad does. He always said that there was somebody to vote against, and that way you can make sure that you essentially voted for the lesser evil. I don’t want to vote for evil. If I don’t have the choice to vote for somebody who I actually agree with and who I actually feel should run this country, then I don’t want to vote at all. And 46 percent of the voting population agreed with me in 2016, they abstained from voting.”Mary F. Parker80, California“I probably won’t be voting Republican this time. I don’t like the way the country is going, and I don’t like Trump. I wish they’d be able to run some other Repubican in the election. I just don’t like the way he handles things. It’s always somebody else’s fault. I don’t think he’s very professional. He’s kind of a bully. [I have been voting Republican] since I started voting at 21.[Voting] makes me feel part of the citizens of the country. Women are valuable. I mean, as far as their opinions and all. I’m not what I would call a feminist. I’m just a regular citizen. I’m from a farming family. Farmers vote Republican in California. My grandparents — they always voted. My parents always voted. It was just something you did when you got to the age of being able to make a statement with your vote.”Photo courtesy Elizabeth TangElizabeth Tang36, California“My parents and I came to America, immigrated here in 2001. And it took us until 2012, I think, to get the citizenship. And so 2012, which was an election year between President Obama and Romney, that was the first election year that we were eligible to vote. It was so neat, such a new concept to us at that time. 2016 was the real official election year, or at least for our family. And on top of that, with Hillary Clinton being one of the candidates, such a historical moment — it made it extra special.In the ‘90s, we heard about Hillary Clinton. And she’s just always been a really admiring figure. So I volunteered, I became a delegate to the convention for her. I went to the AAPI caucus and met Rep. Judy Chu, who is also another role model of mine. She’s the first Chinese American congresswoman. And being from Georgia, I was lucky enough to stand right next to John Lewis when we did the roll call and vote, and I was able to talk to him a little bit. So when he passed, to a lot of us in Georgia, it was a very emotional time.On the day we went to vote, my mom and I went, and then it just so happened only a few days before, my grandma was able to join us from China for the first time. Because she’s like 86 already, so we’re taking care of her here. So it was her first time, like, seeing — obviously, she couldn’t vote — but it was her first time even seeing the voting process. Because in her, you know, 86 years of life, she’s never even seen anybody vote.I don’t know about Americans that are born here that are more familiar with the voting process. But to me, at least, a relatively new citizen, I almost felt like I needed to learn how to vote. Because in 2012, like I said, it was my first voting experience. I didn’t even realize, ‘Oh, there are judges on the ballot’ or there are these things that you should have really looked into beforehand to make a decision. And so for 2016, for that round, I learned to look at the ballots beforehand and do the research. I think it does come with homework.I wish [women in the past] could have been able to vote, because they were all smart people, like my grandma.I wish they were able to vote always, and maybe society would have turned out to be much more different and much more advanced because of the variety of opinions that this whole other gender would have been able to share.”Judy Woodruff recently shared her reflections on the first woman voter in her family, her grandmother.

California legislation bans toxic chemicals in cosmetics,-5.33,49.33,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/california-legislation-bans-toxic-chemicals-in-cosmetics,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-01,www.pbs.org,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday signed legislation banning two dozen toxic chemicals from being used in cosmetics, making the state the first in the nation to prohibit the use of the hazardous ingredients for that purpose.“Children, communities of color and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to these ingredients, which are not actively regulated by the federal government,” Newsom said in a statement following the signing.The Toxic Free Cosmetics Act bans 24 chemicals starting in 2025. It was authored by Democratic Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, who called it a “landmark” bill.The chemicals are known to cause cancer, reproductive harm and hormone disruption, he said. All the chemicals have already been banned by the European Union, but California is the first U.S. state to prohibit their use.Another piece of legislation signed by Newsom requires companies to disclose possibly harmful ingredients being used in personal care products.The ingredients involve some fragrances, flavors and other chemicals linked to allergic reactions, cancer and birth defects, the governor said.“I thank Governor Newsom for signing SB 312 which will ensure that consumers in California know what ingredients are in the beauty and personal care products they bring home to their families and use on their bodies,” said Democratic state Sen.Connie Leyva, who authored the bill.The law will protect professional salon workers, who are disproportionately exposed to toxic chemicals, Leyva said."

Elizabeth Warren’s pledge to protect public lands aims to appeal to Western voters,-1.33,43.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/elizabeth-warrens-pledge-to-protect-public-lands-aims-to-appeal-to-western-voters,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,www.pbs.org,"SALT LAKE CITY — Elizabeth Warren is headed to Utah on Wednesday after promising to restore broader public lands protections for two of the state’s high-profile national monuments if elected president. It’s a move that would not endear her to Utah’s GOP establishment but could appeal to voters across the West angered by President Donald Trump’s decision to shrink the monuments.Any Democrat will face an uphill battle to make serious inroads in the reliably conservative state, even though Utah Republican voters tend to be more wary of Trump than others elsewhere.Warren’s plan is part of a broader energy proposal that puts her among the few Democratic candidates talking about public lands, a hot topic in the region. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, said in a blog post Monday that shrinking the two expansive Southwestern monuments opens up more land to mining and drilling and could cause “irreversible damage.”Republican state leaders have long been deeply frustrated with federal management of the public lands that make up much of the state, and cheered Trump’s December 2017 decision that they said would allow more for local control.Utah voters, though, are divided on shrinking Bears Ears National Monument by about 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly half, said Jason Perry with the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah.“There are passionate feelings on both sides,” he said.Warren’s salvo could also signal a wider slice of the field taking up the issue in the run-up to 2020, he said. Any Democrat will face an uphill battle to make serious inroads in the reliably conservative state, even though Utah Republican voters tend to be more wary of Trump than others elsewhere.Meanwhile, lawmakers’ decision to move the state primary several months earlier, to Super Tuesday in March, will likely bring more attention from candidates looking for boost earlier in the election cycle.Public lands can also resonate far outside the state: Utah leaders’ support for the monuments reduction sparked a major outdoor-industry trade show to leave the state for Colorado, and California-based Patagonia joined Native American tribes to sue over scaling back the monument designations meant to protect resources like ancient cliff dwellings.“Elizabeth Warren is playing to a much larger audience than the state of Utah,” Perry said. Other elements of Warren’s plan, like a ban on new fossil fuel leasing on public lands and free entry to national parks, could also spark debate.There hasn’t been any large-scale drilling or mining on the land cut from the Utah monuments yet, though some companies are in the early stages of the permitting process.Though it hasn’t yet set off an extraction rush, the decision to scale back the monuments sparked anger from left-leaning voters who cheered the original boundaries as bringing more protection, visibility and funding to a unique area, said John Leshy, who served in the Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration and helped create the Grand Staircase National Monument.Though public lands may not be a core issue like health care, many voters believe that wide-open spaces are a “huge part of the quality of life” in the in the region where Democrats have made inroads in recent years, he said.“I’m guessing she’s sort of staking this out there as her issue,” he said. “It’ll be interesting to see where this goes inside the party as well as the national race.”WATCH: What a broad, bipartisan public lands bill means for the American wilderness"

How the attack on the U.S. Capitol unfolded,-4.33,48.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-the-attack-on-the-u-s-capitol-unfolded,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,www.pbs.org,"At first the commotion outside the Senate chamber sounded like a routine disturbance to the members inside, the kind of small-scale protest that often takes place at the Capitol.Then a Senate aide burst through a door into the chamber.As senators seated at their desks watched with surprise, the aide raced down an aisle towards the dais, where Vice President Mike Pence was presiding over objections to Congress accepting President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. In a matter of moments, the vice president gaveled a recess and was whisked away.“That’s when we knew it was a very different situation,” Sen. Jeff Merkeley, D-Ore., said in an interview late Wednesday night.Across the Capitol Building, House lawmakers were in the midst of their floor debate when they first heard reports that the Cannon House Office Building was being evacuated. Then news began spreading of Pence’s evacuation. Shortly after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was ushered out of the chamber.Soon the House chamber was on lockdown as United States Capitol Police officers with guns drawn faced off against a violent mob intent on breaking in.“I could hear them banging on the doors,” Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., told the PBS NewsHour’s Judy Woodruff. “It was a surreal experience.”The deadly clash that unfolded Wednesday was one of the largest security breaches of the United States Capitol in the nation’s history. The assault raised questions about the security of the Capitol Building, as well as the disparate police treatment of white and non-white protesters.It started as an attempt by an angry mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters to stop the Electoral College vote count. It ended, many chaotic hours later, with Congress completing its count after several Republicans dropped their plans to object, a rare statement from Trump in which he came as close as he has yet to conceding he lost, the resignation of senior administration officials in protest over the violence at the Capitol, and calls from Democrats and at least one Republican to have Trump removed from office.President Donald Trump gestures at the end of his speech during a rally to contest the certification of the presidential election results by the U.S. Congress, in Washington on January 6, 2021. REUTERS/Jim BourgWednesday’s historic sequence of events began with a late-morning rally by a defiant president fixated on his failure to win reelection.Trump spent the more than hour-long speech at the Ellipse near the White House repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him through voter fraud. He called on Pence to reject the Electoral College votes from a handful of battleground states, power the vice president does not have, ratcheting up pressure on one of his most loyal aides to stick by his side in a last-ditch attempt to defy Congress and the Constitution.Even as Trump spoke, Pence had arrived at the Capitol with a letter in which he acknowledged he lacked “unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.”Still, Trump urged Pence to “come through for us,” and said supporters would “walk down to the Capitol” to protest against Republicans who refused to back his effort to overturn the election. The president’s son Donald Trump Jr. was more blunt in a speech before Trump took the stage.“We’re coming for you,” he said.The crowd listened.After the president concluded his remarks, a large crowd waving Trump flags began gathering at the Capitol West Front. Clashes soon broke out with Capitol Police, and rioters succeeded in breaking through police barricades guarding entrances on the east side of the building.With the perimeter breached, the mob streamed up the steps on the House and Senate sides of the Capitol and broke into the building. What followed was mayhem on a level not seen inside the Capitol in more than two hundred years.Rioters placed Trump flags in the National Statuary Hall. They ransacked lawmakers’ offices. Photos went viral of a protester with his feet up on a desk in Pelosi’s office suite, and others waving Confederate flags.READ MORE: Trump says there will be an ‘orderly transition’ of power, acknowledges defeatOne of the most dramatic standoffs took place outside of the House chamber. As rioters banged on the doors to get in, Capitol Police issued instructions to House lawmakers to shelter in place as they scrambled to find a safe way to get them out of the chamber.“We were being told by the Capitol Police to get down in the event that there was an active shooter,” Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., told the NewsHour, “and to pull out our gas masks in case there was tear gas that they had to use to disperse” the crowd.For several tense minutes House lawmakers crouched on the ground, waiting for a signal from police to evacuate. “I was with some [House] members that were calling their families, and so then I called my husband to assure him I was Ok,” Sherrill said.Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo.,  and other members take cover as protesters attempt to disrupt the joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College vote on Wednesday, January 6, 2021. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Eventually Capitol Police escorted lawmakers out and down a series of staircases to secure locations where they waited for the mob to be quelled.On the Senate side, most members were sequestered together in a secure room. In the confusion while they were being evacuated from the chamber, some senators did not make it to the secure room and dispersed to other parts of the Capitol complex, leaving Senate staff to search for them to ensure every member was safe and accounted for.Inside the room where they were being held, a debate erupted among Senate Republicans about how to proceed.“The Republican senators were debating among themselves when we were in the secure facility as to whether or not they should continue making objections” to the Electoral College vote, said Merkeley.By that point in the afternoon, it was becoming clear the situation had spiraled out of control and that the assault on the Capitol had overshadowed the Electoral College vote count.Through the late afternoon, a large crowd of Trump supporters remained lodged outside of the Capitol. Rioters attacked crews of journalists who were covering the events. Law enforcement authorities discovered suspected explosive devices outside of the offices of both the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, which are headquartered a few blocks away.Police fatally shot a rioter inside the Capitol. The victim was later identified as Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran with a history of social media posts supporting Trump’s claims that the election was rigged. Three other people died during the insurrection.The national guards for Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia were deployed to the Capitol. At approximately 4 p.m., Biden delivered a brief speech from Wilmington, Delaware, condemning the attack.“This is not dissent, it’s disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition, and it must end now. I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward,” Biden said. He also called on Trump to go on national television and “demand an end to this siege.”Pro-Trump protesters attempt to tear down a police barricade during a rally to contest the certification of the 2020 presidential election results by Congress, at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington on January 6, 2021. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonTrump released a short video from the White House soon after Biden’s speech. But instead of unequivocally condemning the riot, the president offered a mixed message in which he expressed support for his followers.“I know your pain, I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace,” Trump said.The message was dismissed by Democrats, and even appeared to fall short among Trump’s allies in Congress.Two hours later, as police worked to secure the Capitol so that Congress could continue the Electoral College vote count, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., issued a statement saying that she would abandon her plan to object to the count.Other Republicans soon followed suit. A few minutes before 9 p.m., Republican Sens. James Lankford of Oklahoma and Steve Daines of Montana issued a joint statement announcing they would also drop their objections in response to the violence at the Capitol.“We now need the entire Congress to come together and vote to certify the election results,” they said.The tide had turned against pro-Trump Republicans in Congress, and against the president. After a debate that stretched into early Thursday morning, Congress approved the Electoral College vote for Biden at 3:40 a.m.In a statement early Thursday, Trump said, “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.”Even before the voting ended, a debate was already underway about why the police did not do more to stop an overwhelmingly white mob with ties to white supremacist groups from breaching the Capitol.“I think there’s going to be an awful lot of investigation in terms of what broke down here,” Joe Crowley, a former senior House Democrat, said in an interview.By Wednesday, Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Pelosi and other Democrats called for Trump to leave office immediately. As they reflected on the ordeal, lawmakers said they still could not believe what had happened.“This is the scariest time in my lifetime for American democracy,” DeSaulnier said."

We have that delivery of crude from Canada. It comes right into the refining complex here, which provides roughly 30 to 40% of U.S. fuel supply and would help to keep prices affordable as everybody engages in economic recovery,” said Foss.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) also inveighed against the move. Unions and most Democrats — about 62% — opposed the cancelation. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in against the move. Canada is now said to be considering some type ofsanction against the United States. Biden’s move affects workers in both countries; it kills about 12,000 jobs in the United States and another 2,000 in Canada as both countries are still reeling from the COVID pandemic’s destruction of jobs.The United States is our most important ally & trading partner.As friends & allies, we are deeply disturbed that one of@POTUSfirst actions was to rescind the Presidential permit for Keystone XL Pipeline border crossing.That’s not how you treat a friend & ally.My statement:pic.twitter.com/v2vRrs5vPn— Jason Kenney (@jkenney)January 21, 2021It’s how a Democrat president treats not only an ally, but American workers as well.Canceling the Keystone XL also hurts the environment. The pipeline would have moved between 800,000 and 830,000 barrels of oil per day safely, off our roads and rails, from where it’s produced to where it can be refined. That was to be Texas, which leads the world in the clean and safe refining of oil into products the modern economy depends on every single day. So some of the jobs lost were in Texas, about which Biden will not care, as Texas did not vote for him.With the pipeline canceled, Canada will find other customers for its oil. That’s likely to be China and India, two of the world’s fastest-growing and most energy-hungry economies. Instead of being transported safely via the Keystone XL pipeline, the oil will be transported by trucks and ships — both of which emit far more gunk into the atmosphere than pipelines, and both of which are far more prone to accidents and spills. It’s likely to be refined outside the United States, where standards do not match U.S. EPA standards.Joe Biden killed thousands of jobs, hurt relations with a close ally, and hurt the environment on his first day in the job, while also violating his promise to put science first.Bryan Preston served as chief of staff to Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton.

"To Build Stronger Families, Reframe the Fight Over Mayor Pete's Parental Leave",5.33,29.33,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stacey-lennox/2021/10/16/to-build-stronger-families-reframe-the-fight-over-mayor-petes-parental-leave-n1524408,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-16,pjmedia.com,"Recently, the media disclosed that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg took two months of parental leave following the adoption of twins. This news led to arguments online about whether he should have done so during a global supply chain crisis, whether men should take parental leave, and why the privileged class gets so much time. That misses the more significant opportunity. To defend his absence, the left and Democrats had to loudly declare the importance of parents spending time with their children. They had to advocate for families spending time together and note the importance of parent-child bonds.Agree with them wholeheartedly on these points. Then challenge them on the very policies they have pushed for years that discourage family formation by extending adolescence, making housing more expensive, and deemphasizing the role of fathers. It is time for conservatives to change the strategy of screaming “Stop” while standing athwart history and say, “No, we’re not doing that. We are doing something completely different.”Young adults in this country are marrying less and having fewer children. This trend is a feature of a society in decline. Strong families are the building block of a free and prosperous society. You only need to look at the history of any authoritarian regime to know the family is one of the first things they destroy. Mao’s cultural revolution may be the most horrific example when the culture war destroyed the Eastern tradition of honoring your elders. Young revolutionaries reported on, beat, and even murdered older relatives.Our tax and social policies enforce the politically correct view that all family configurations are equally desirable. One could even argue that many of them discourage traditional marriage by imposing monetary penalties when fathers remain in the home. This view ignores decades of research that confirms that children in intact heterosexual marriages are more successful as a population. It is no surprise that the decline in traditional marriage and childbearing accelerated with the passage of legislation purported to wage war on poverty under President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.Related:The Five Most Dangerous Proposals in Biden’s Bloated BudgetIt’s no shock that one of the architects of those programs wasMichael Harrington,founder of the Democratic Socialists and a committed Trotskyist. Trotsky envisioned perpetual revolution on a global scale, which cannot occur when solid families and a prosperous middle class with economic mobility exists. Harrington’s view on the disenfranchised in America and how the state should care for them was notably paternalistic. The government as daddy was the goal.In his bookThe Other America, he asserted that millions of Americans lived in a “culture of poverty.” Harrington argued that this culture rendered the poor incapable of improving their situation. He believed a capitalist society could not provide the poor with opportunities for a more dignified life, and they must be cared for by the state. To put it in a nutshell, Harrington described a system that could only create a permanent underclass. The best expression of Harrington’s worldview is “The Life of Julia,” an Obama campaign video scrubbed from the internet because most Americans, even in 2012, found it horrifying.Now, the “Build Back Better” plan includes a raft of policies to discourage strong families. It encourages putting children in government-funded care shortly after a paid parental leave ends, which is supposed to excite you. It increases the marriage penalty for the Earned Income Tax Credit. It also extends adolescence by paying for 13th and 14th grades. The government-run education of children for 18 years in a pre-K-12 system produces horrible results, so let’s do two more. Even the PRO Act seeks to reduce the freelance and contract opportunities that allow parents to work from home and spend less on childcare and more time with their children.In 2013, the left-leaning Brookings Institute notedthe decline of the traditional family is a class issue:A report from the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia summed up the data well: “Marriage is an emerging dividing line between America’s moderately educated middle and those with college degrees.” The group for whom marriage has largely disappeared now includes not just unskilled blacks but unskilled whites as well. Indeed, for younger women without a college degree, unwed childbearing is the new normal.An additional trend now is having fewer children, period. The birth rate hit anew record low for the sixth consecutive yearin 2021. It remains below replacement rates. Problems include financial barriers to successful family formation created by prolonged adolescence, dependence on two incomes, the cost of childcare, and skyrocketing housing costs.Related:Dems’ Union Bill Would Tax Workers and Cost Jobs, New Study FindsRather than increasing the salaries of childcare providers and expanding childcare subsidies in the “Build Back Better” boondoggle, conservatives should advocate providing tax credits. These credits need to be a substantial percentage of the last year’s W-2 earnings for one parent to stay home and care for their child until they are six. And substantial means 50%. A structure like this is better for families, including the childcare workers who may want to have children of their own.Think about it. Couples could structure their monthly expenses to live within the means of a more substantial portion of the working parent’s salary. Based on average wages on Indeed, a welder and medical office secretary in Pennsylvania could count on an additional tax credit of $13,936 on top of the standard deduction. They would have no childcare expenses and none of the fuel, food, and other costs associated with commuting to work. The average American couple could save and spend in line with the goal of starting a family.Employers would benefit from the planning by having months to recruit, train, promote or transition another employee into the vacant position left by the parent staying home. It would also make returning to the workforce for a stay-at-home parent a common occurrence instead of having an employment gap that can be difficult to overcome. Women arenot returning to the workforceas often post-pandemic. The media assumes they can’t. Perhaps they prefer to stay home with their children.The most important beneficiaries of policies that encourage family formation are the children. Brookings also noted:These differences in family formation are a problem not only for those concerned with “family values” per se, but also for those concerned with upward mobility in a society that values equal opportunity for its children. Because the breakdown of the traditional family is overwhelmingly occurring among working-class Americans of all races, these trends threaten to make the U.S. a much more class-based society over time. The well-educated and upper-middle-class parents who are still forming two-parent families are able to invest time and resources in their children—time and resources that lower- and working-class single mothers, however impressive their efforts to be both good parents and good breadwinners, simply do not have.If we lose economic mobility for the next generation, we lose the American Dream. That’s not a bargain most Americans are willing to make. So let’s make more families at every income level.WATCH “The Life of Julia” that some resourceful user put back on the internet. This is where the “Build Back Better” agenda leads:"

"Alito: Court's 'Preposterous' Trans Ruling Threatens Religion, Speech, Privacy, and Safety",21.0,36.25,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/tyler-o-neil/2020/06/15/alito-courts-preposterous-trans-ruling-threatens-religion-speech-privacy-and-safety-n532217,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-15,pjmedia.com,"On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the case ofBostock v. Clayton County(2020). In a powerful dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito condemned the ruling as “preposterous” and betraying “breathtaking” arrogance. He noted that Congress has tried and repeatedly failed to amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in just this fashion and that no one interpreted the law this way until 2017. In this decision, as inRoe v. Wade(1973) andObergefell v. Hodges(2015), the Supreme Court usurped the power of Congress by creating “legislation.”Perhaps most importantly, however, Alito warns that the decision will have wide-ranging destructive impacts on key freedoms Americans hold dear, and he predicts that “the entire Federal Judiciary will be mired for years in disputes about the reach of the Court’s reasoning.”“As the briefing in these cases has warned, the position that the Court now adopts will threaten freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and personal privacy and safety. No one should think that the Court’s decision represents an unalloyed victory for individual liberty,” Alito warns. His dissent lays out seven different realms of American life that will be affected by this ruling.Naturally, the Supreme Court’s position that a ban on discrimination on the basis of “sex” includes a ban on discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not only a preposterous extension of the 1964 law but a dangerous reading of federal law in general.As Alito warns, “the Court may wish to avoid this subject, but it is a matter of concern to many people who are reticent about disrobing or using toilet facilities in the presence of individuals whom they regard as members of the opposite sex. For some, this may simply be a question of modesty, but for others, there is more at stake. For women who have been victimized by sexual assault or abuse, the experience of seeing an unclothed person with the anatomy of a male in a confined and sensitive location such as a bathroom or locker room can cause serious psychological harm.”Based on broad understandings of “transgender status” that could include those who identify as “gender fluid” and those who have not undergone any surgery to alter their bodies. “A person who has not undertaken any physical transitioning may claim the right to use the bathroom or locker room assigned to the sex with which the individual identifies at that particular time,” Alito reasoned.This is not to say that transgender people are predators, but to note that women have passionately fought for their rights and now their private spaces will be open to biological males. The true concern is not that a male who identifies as a female will abuse women, but that prurient men will abuse this loophole and some women who have experienced sexual assault will be victimized by being forced to share intimate quarters with biological males.Alito also warns that “the right of a transgender individual to participate on a sports team or in an athletic competition previously reserved for members of one biological sex” may arise under Title VII and Title IX due to the Court’s ruling inBostock.“This issue has already arisen under Title IX, where it threatens to undermine one of that law’s major achievements, giving young women an equal opportunity to participate in sports,” Alito notes. “The effect of the Court’s reasoning may be to force young women to compete against students who have a very significant biological advantage, including students who have the size and strength of a male but identify as female and students who are taking male hormones in order to transition from female to male.”Alito also warned that this ruling may affect professional sports, as well.Indeed, women in Connecticut arechallenging a school rulethat forces them to compete with biological males. Even theJournal of Medical Ethics, which has published an article calling for Child Protective Services toremove gender-confused kidsfrom their parents if the parents won’t give them experimental transgender drugs, also published an article condemning the “intolerable unfairness” of the Olympic Committee’s pro-transgender rules.Bostock“may lead to Title IX cases against any college that resists assigning students of the opposite biological sex as roommates,” Alito warns. It may also forcerape crisis centersfor women to admit biological males who claim to identify as women. One such center has already been vandalized with transgender slogans, and some centers have fought long legal battles over the right to allow safe harbor only for women.Alito cites “briefs filed by a wide range of religious groups––Christian, Jewish, and Muslim–– [that] express deep concern that the position now adopted by the Court ‘will trigger open conflict with faith-based employment practices of numerous churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious institutions.’ They argue that ‘[r]eligious organizations need employees who actually live the faith,’ and that compelling a religious organization to employ individuals whose conduct flouts the tenets of the organization’s faith forces the group to communicate an objectionable message.”Alito warns that this problem is “perhaps most acute” in the employment of teachers. “A school’s standards for its faculty ‘communicate a particular way of life to its students,’ and a ‘violation by the faculty of those precepts’ may undermine the school’s ‘moral teaching.’ Thus, if a religious school teaches that sex outside marriage and sex reassignment procedures are immoral, the message may be lost if the school employs a teacher who is in a same-sex relationship or has undergone or is undergoing sex reassignment.”“Healthcare benefits may emerge as an intense battleground under the Court’s holding,” Alito warns. “Transgender employees have brought suit under Title VII to challenge employer-provided health insurance plans that do not cover costly sex reassignment surgery.”“Such claims present difficult religious liberty issues because some employers and healthcare providers have strong religious objections to sex reassignment procedures, and therefore requiring them to pay for or to perform these procedures will have a severe impact on their ability to honor their deeply held religious beliefs,” he explains.Indeed, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)just finalized a rulerightly defining sex as biological sex and reversing the Obama administration on these issues. DoesBostockmake that HHS rule unconstitutional?Alito warns that “the Court’s decision may even affect the way employers address their employees and the way teachers and school officials address students. Under established English usage, two sets of sex-specific singular personal pronouns are used to refer to someone in the third person (he, him, and his for males; she, her, and hers for females). But several different sets of gender-neutral pronouns have now been created and are preferred by some individuals who do not identify as falling into either of the two traditional categories.”“Some jurisdictions, such as New York City, have ordinances making the failure to use an individual’s preferred pronoun a punishable offense, and some colleges have similar rules. After today’s decision, plaintiffs may claim that the failure to use their preferred pronoun violates one of the federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination,” the justice warns.While Title VII cases are different from cases about the Fourteenth Amendment, Alito warns thatBostock“may exert a gravitational pull in constitutional cases. Under our precedents, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex-based discrimination unless a ‘heightened’ standard of review is met. By equating discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity with discrimination because of sex, the Court’s decision will be cited as a ground for subjecting all three forms of discrimination to the same exacting standard of review.”“Under this logic, today’s decision may have effects that extend well beyond the domain of federal antidiscrimination statutes. This potential is illustrated by pending and recent lower court cases in which transgender individuals have challenged a variety of federal, state, and local laws and policies on constitutional grounds,” Alito warns.Although the six justices in the majority onBostocklikely had honorable intentions in redefining the word “sex” and effectively making law in this decision, it was “irresponsible” for them not to consider its wide-ranging consequences, Alito warns.“The updating desire to which the Court succumbs no doubt arises from humane and generous impulses. Today, many Americans know individuals who are gay, lesbian, or transgender and want them to be treated with the dignity, consideration, and fairness that everyone deserves,” he writes. Even so, “The Court’s brusque refusal to consider the consequences of its reasoning is irresponsible.”“If the Court had allowed the legislative process to take its course, Congress would have had the opportunity to consider competing interests and might have found a way of accommodating at least some of them.” Instead, the Supreme Court has made law, just like it did inRoe v. WadeandObergefell v. Hodges.Tyler O’Neil is the author ofMaking Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Follow him on Twitter at@Tyler2ONeil."
"The Morning Briefing: Change All the Names, Nuke All the Statues—Grievance Wusses Will Still Be Whining",26.03,20.42,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stephen-kruiser/2020/07/14/the-morning-briefing-change-all-the-names-nuke-all-the-statues-grievance-wusses-will-still-be-whining-n637246,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-14,pjmedia.com,"No doubt I will catch some grief for this one but that is kind of my role around here, is it not?The grievance mob is picking up steam, using the Year of the Riot to claim more cultural victims. We’ll get into the philosophical discussion about all of this in a moment but, on a personal note, I find it rather exhausting just attempting to keep up with whom or whatever they are mad at during any given moment. At this point, I’m not even certain there are any statues left in America.What we’ve witnessed in recent weeks is truly a descent into madness. Criminals are taking over cities with the backing of the elected officials who run those cities. Those same officials are proudly abandoning their police forces to score points with a bunch of Marxists, then predictably seeing violent crime skyrocket overnight. We are supposed to believe that this is all being done in the name of delivering some long-overdue justice.It’s all bunk.The always-eloquent Thomas Sowell put it very well ina recent conversation with Mark Levin:Right off the bat, Levin asked Sowell about theriotingthat has gone on nightly in America since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. “I’m regarded as pessimistic,” Sowell said, “but I was never pessimistic enough to believe that things would degenerate to the point where they are now, where adult human beings are talking about getting rid of the police … what is frightening is how many people in responsible positions are caving in to every demand that is made, repeating any kind of nonsense that you’re supposed to repeat. I do believe that we may well reach a point of no return. I hope, of course, that will never happen.”Count me among the pessimists.We’re not focusing on riots today but this is all tied together.It’s only Tuesday and the grievance-mongers have been busy. They pulled off the seemingly impossible,making Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder back downafter years of saying that he wouldn’t change the team’s name. Barely pausing to take a breath, the grievance mob thendecided to go after the Texas Rangers.That’s a rather ambitious Monday.But wait, there’s more!Timeran a post yesterday titled “Don’t Stop at Statues. Demand a Reconsideration of Place Names Too.”This grievance slope isn’t just slippery, they’ve now got a free army of people to keep covering it with Vaseline. We’ll be sliding down it forever at this rate.I don’t care if people have hurt feelings. Everybody has hurt feelings at one time or another. The thing is, the lunatics that are becoming a bigger blight on America every day always have hurt feelings. They wake up aggrieved, and the day just becomes one long list of grievances that is updated hourly. Though it may seem impossible, there is an inexhaustible supply of grievances to keep them raging.Back in the Occupy days, I kept saying and writing that the rage was the endgame for them. It’s basically the same now. They keep saying they want change, and I don’t doubt that they would like to affect some political change here and there, but that won’t make them any less angry. There is nothing that will make them less angry simply because angry is what they want to be.The grievance freaks will always find another grievance. They’re addicted to it. What’s disturbing about the last couple of months is the pace at which they’re finding new ones. As we have seen with the destruction of the statues, they are alsonot very discriminateabout focusing their wrath.It’s very aggravating that there are so many Republicans in Washington who don’t understand this. We’re fighting for the soul of America and we’ve got Republicans in Congress going on about statues as if they’re trying to get dates with antifa. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Mitt Romney at the next statue-toppling. He and his ilk are forever convinced that, if they just give the grievance crowd one more concession, everything will be roses and puppies.There is no telling how long we’re going to be subjected to this nonsense that’s largely being fueled by woke white people at theWashington PostandNew York Times, but it will no doubt be a while. We may truly have reached a point of no return.

When asked if we may end up getting to a point where doing so will be recommended, Fauci responded, “It might, if you really want perfect protection of the mucosal surfaces.”“You have mucosa in the nose, mucosa in the mouth, but you also have mucosa in the eye,” he continued. “Theoretically, you should protect all the mucosal surfaces. So if you have goggles or an eye shield you should use it.”Currently, face shields or goggles are “not universally recommended,” but, Fauci explained, “if you really want to be complete, you should probably use it if you can.”Dr. Fauci wore his mask while making his ceremonial first pitch at the Nationals game last week, but when he thought the cameras weren’t on him and his wife and friend as they sat in the stands watching the game, he was either not wearing it, or wearing it incorrectly.Who wants to tell him?pic.twitter.com/oMfmHEUoFg— Matt Margolis 🇺🇸 (@mattmargolis)July 24, 2020Dr. Fauci, age 79, is in a higher-risk group but has never been seen wearing goggles or a face shield for extra protection against COVID-19."
"We're Seeing the Death Rattle of the Revolution, Not Its Birth",29.67,16.0,https://pjmedia.com/columns/sarah-hoyt/2020/07/28/were-seeing-the-death-rattle-of-the-revolution-not-its-birth-n722898,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,pjmedia.com,"I’m not surprised, though I am chagrined, that a lot of people, including people I know and respect, are buying into the idea that what we’re in the midst of is a Marxist revolution in the U.S.Look, I understand, okay? Not as many people have had the experience I had of living under unbridled, unmasked Marxist power, so you don’t understand their myths and how they actually connect with reality. Oh, you’re starting to see it, as the left drops its masks, but it’s not the same as seeing them running around, showing their behinds and expounding the craziest theories during your formative years, when your eye is unsparing. There is a reason it was a little boy who cried “the king goes naked.”Let’s start with what the left thinks they are doing:They think they’re bringing about their utopia, their heaven on Earth.They have been programmed – indoctrinated, really – from birth via the media, education, entertainment, and – heaven have mercy – even churches and synagogues into believing what amounts to a heretical Christian sect.There are many variations of the Communist mythos, mostly Marx, but with its roots firmly in Rosseau. They range from racial ones (one to each race) to feminist ones. There are probably others I haven’t even heard about.The myth goes like this: in the beginning, there was no capitalism (the cult’s quaint name for any free buying and selling or trade. (This is why they call monarchies capitalism or private property.) This was the dawn of man, the perfect state of humanity. Because there was no property there was no envy and no crime. Man (and particularly woman) lived in a time of innocence. In this perfect utopia – feminist version – women ruled, sex was free, babies were brought up communally, and every woman could do as she pleased. In the racial version, the poor now-oppressed race were the rulers, and therefore there was no property, etc., etc. No crime.But then theserpentevil white race showed up. Or males rebelled. Whatever. Because, you know they didn’t like paradise. And they instituted private property and “capitalism” and since then there’s been this great struggle by the good to overturn the evil. In the end, the good prevails, they confiscate and redistribute all private property and reeducate the people maimed by living under the unjust capitalist system and we go back to living in a utopia.The liniments of the story should sound familiar if you come from a Judeo-Christian background. It’s the story of creation, fall, and eventual world-redemption, only stripped of a creator, any power superior to the Kommissars and the idea of personal redemption. In fact, in this heresy the individual doesn’t matter at all, only the group he belongs to.I doubt any Marxist has been told this story as such, but I promise you it is in the background of a lot of their books, from “non-fiction” to novels. The idea, bonkers as it is and as easy to dismantle as it is, is in the background of their thoughts.These ideas have been in circulation for a long time, and I guarantee if you read your kids’ school books and look for hints of this you will find it. Particularly in history. I was fortunate (?) to have relatives from many professional backgrounds and to be a compulsive reader. For instance, my sister-in-law in Portugal is an M.D. and studied from American books. Her psychiatric manuals were full of the idea that mental illness was brought about by the unnatural state of “capitalism” and therefore if you abolish capitalism, there will be no mental illness. This, incidentally, was a lot of the idea behind the scenes of the de-institutionalization movement, which closed madhouses and filled our streets with mentally ill homeless. These books, in the seventies, suggested very strongly that America kept as many political prisoners in madhouses as the USSR because capitalism caused madness, which only proved the mad people were sane, since they were rejecting capitalism.The origins of this devil’s brew go back all the way to the crazy theories of noble savages, overlaid with Marx and then weaponized against healthy societies by the USSR agitprop (agitation and propaganda, the only thing they ever did well).Now that you have the decoder ring, it is probably starting to make sense why Black Lives Matter immediately jumps to “abolish capitalism”; why feminism jumps to “abolish capitalism”; and why Hollywood has a love affair with making the homeless the repositories of wisdom.Once your eyes are open you’ll see it everywhere. Which is good, because this stupid mythos, this tissue of half-baked wishful thinking and the toddler’s scream of “it’s not fair,” has permeated society to such an extent that you’re looking at the current spastic insanity from the left as they are.Yes, I know, a lot of what they’re doing echoes revolutions from the French to the Russian, to a lot of other revolutions throughout the 20thcentury. I know. I lived through one of the later ones (though this being Portugal – basically the D&D alignment of chaotic neutral with borders – it was the international socialists rebelling against the national socialists). And all of them have the same “touch-feel” and the same incidents. For a long time now I’ve been telling people to watch for a pregnant woman being shot and becoming a martyr of the revolution. If they can manage it, she’ll be black and Latin too. It’s one of the touchstones of the kabuki theater revolutions of the left.What you should ask yourself, actually, and give an honest answer to, is how these revolutions can all be so similar to each other, step by step and touch by touch in completely different times and societies.And if you answer honestly, you’ll realize it’s because these events are being staged. In the cargo-cult religion of the left, if they do these things this way, the power will devolve to them, utopia will be installed, and everyone will be happy, even the evil bad rightists after they are re-educated.That pregnant woman who will get shot “by federal forces” any day now? That is universal, because – I think – if the law officers don’t provide her, her comrades will. (If you have a pregnant daughter stupid enough to gambol withProAntifa, warn her. She won’t believe you, but your conscience will be clean if she’s the chosen victim.) As are other things, like the evil, mean authorities putting down the “peaceful” protesters and sparking the final rebellion.There are only two things standing in the way of their sparking their revolution. They’re blind to them, but we should not be.The first is that there isn’t a vast mass of the “dispossessed” who are natural communists and will “ignite” into violent revolution and take over, given the slightest encouragement.No, I’m serious, Obama believed in this with all his heart (that poor man is an echo-boomer and a red-diaper baby and so his head is full of excrement to an extent no sane person can believe). Hence his telling bankers he was standing between them and the mob (that Obama was sure was just ready to ignite). Hence, the crazy stupidity of Fast And Furious, which posited that if American guns were found at the site of Mexican cartel crimes, the (oppressed, natch) people of America would rise up and demand gun control in solidarity with their oppressed brethren. And if you look closely, you’ll see the links between Obama and Occupy Wall Street, which they believed was the spark that would send the 99% up in revolution. Only… it failed because the 99% are not “natural communists” wishing to throw off the yoke of capitalism. You need to be exquisitely indoctrinated to believe they are.The second thing they have wrong, and what I urge you to realize as soon as you can:They are not the “oppressed.” No, I don’t mean by that that there is no oppression in our society. Any human society has people with more power than others. It’s just that the groups and ideas that the left and their violent lap-wolves Antifa have cast as victims aren’t the victims.In fact, their philosophy—the Marxist ideology they propound and the craziness behind it—has been in control of society, on top, since at least the seventies.Being a leftist is a mark of being “good” and also well educated. The same way that in Elizabethan England poor mad Christopher Marlowe wrote his stage directions in Latin, to show that he had had an excellent education and deserved respect, so too the leftists of today pepper their works, from movies to TV to books to art, with odes to the oppressed and paeans to the coming revolution. It’s how you show you’re high-class and exquisitely educated.All the old families, all the rich, all the captains of industry and power brokers signal left as hard as they can, because that’s where the power is—and in my field, the awards, the professorships, and the acclaim. Heck, remember what Trump signaled just to be allowed to do business.And that’s why I’ve been watching in amusement the left going through the motions of kabuki theater revolution against a society… they control.If you go read the history of the French Revolution and probably the Russian (it’s been a long time since I actually read on it) you’ll find this is a typical move of the out-of-touch “ruling” and “powerful” class as they start to lose control.They will proclaim themselves the defenders of the poor, fighting on behalf of the oppressed, their only defense, etc.It never works. It. Never. Works.Louis XVI putting a revolutionary coquade atop his powdered wig didn’t save his head from falling to the guillotine.Real revolutions, not the left’s pretend theater, are not “and the people rose up.” That’s usually the last stage. Real revolutions are caused by living conditions/ways of making a living changing so dramatically that ideology must follow.Communism and socialism were – though heads-on-pants insane – well suited to the mentality of mass production and mass movements.They’re fish out of water in the 21stcentury. Which is why every move they make turns against them. Their heads are full of a society that no longer exists.I’m not saying they’re not a danger, particularly in the areas – geographic and social – they control. What I’m saying is that they’re losing that control.The ramping-up insanity you see is partly their desperate need to keep control and partly the fact that their prophecy has failed twice in two different flavors right before their eyes.Obama was supposed to usher in a non-white utopia. Well… that didn’t happen. And then when the feminists were about to usher in their feminist utopia, it was snatched from their aching hands.Their art works and entertainment filled with their gospel truth bring less and less money/acclaim/etc.Their only chance, as they see it, is to bring about utopia now.But they’re looking at it backwards. And if they keep on destroying and burning and looting in the hopes the vast “oppressed” hordes who want communism will rise up, this will all end in “Aristo, aristo a la lanterne.”Stay aware. Stay calm. Don’t get caught up in their play. This is their last push.And if history is any guide, it will fail. The only question now is how high a butcher’s bill will we have to pay."
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Introduces Bill Banning Biological Men From Competing in Women's Sports,23.0,28.75,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2020/12/11/rep-tulsi-gabbard-introduces-bill-that-would-allow-only-biological-females-to-compete-in-womens-sports-n1205154,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,pjmedia.com,"Hawaii’s Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ran for president as something of a moderate Democrat in a field full of prominent radicals. It’s hard trying to be moderate when so many of your fellows have gone off the deep end.That’s much of the Democratic Party, especially on issues relating to transgender athletes. To believe that boys thinking they’re girls should be allowed to compete against females in sports is illogical and delusional.This means it’s just fine with many Democrats.Rep. Gabbard, along with Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin, has introduced legislation that would bring some much-needed sanity to the transgender issue by clarifying that Title IX protections for women athletes are to be based on biological sex — no boys allowed.Daily Caller:“Title IX was a historic provision championed by Hawaii’s own Congresswoman Patsy Mink in order to provide equal opportunity for women and girls in high school and college sports,” Gabbard said in the statement. “It led to a generational shift that impacted countless women, creating life-changing opportunities for girls and women that never existed before.”“However, Title IX is being weakened by some states who are misinterpreting Title IX, creating uncertainty, undue hardship and lost opportunities for female athletes. Our legislation protects Title IX’s original intent which was based on the general biological distinction between men and women athletes based on sex.”For his part, Rep. Mullin has a personal stake in the issue.“Title IX was designed to give women and girls an equal chance to succeed, including in sports,” Mullin said. “Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports diminishes that equality and takes away from the original intent of Title IX.”“As the father of three girls involved in athletics, I want them to be able to compete on a level playing field. I am proud to lead this bill that will safeguard the integrity of women’s sports and ensure female athletes can compete fairly,” he continued.There are 17 states that allow school districts to accept transgender boys in girls’ sports. Many states are considering bans on the practice.Idaho has already bannedtransgender boys from competing with girls and the Department of Education has ruled that allowing biological boys to compete with girls is a violation of a woman’s civil rights under Title IX.But Gabbard is coming under fire from trans activists for being a traitor to the cause. She said she was a friend of transgender people but she’s now considered a bigot.Huffpo headlined its pieceon the bill, “Tulsi Gabbard Introduces Anti-Transgender Bill After Claiming To Be LGBTQ-Friendly.”“Tulsi Gabbard is now introducing a blatantly transphobic piece of legislation aimed at trans and non-binary young people,” civil rights activist Charlotte Clymerwrote on Twitterof the bill.“Remember when Tulsi Gabbard tried to convince us she was an LGBTQ ally? We knew she was a liar, a fraud,”wroteZeke Stokes, former chief programs officer of LGBTQ rights organization GLAAD.I’m one who believes that if you’re a biological male and you want to believe you’re a woman, that’s fine with me. It’s none of my business what goes on in your head. But looking to impose your beliefs on the rest of us and force us to accept you for who you say you are, not who you really are, is wrong intellectually and morally. We don’t accept white people who claim to be black, even if they want to think that way in their own lives. You don’t get to alter reality for the rest of us just because you don’t like our version of reality.Transgender activists will continue to bully states to get their way and judges, ignorant of biology and athletics, will continue to agree with them. Ultimately, it will be up to the Supreme Court to protect girls from being forced to participate in a social experiment where the biological deck is stacked against them."

Cringeworthy Study Debunked: There Was No 'Sturgis Superspreader' COVID-19 Event,20.33,36.33,https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2020/09/09/cringeworthy-study-debunked-there-was-no-sturgis-superspreader-covid-19-event-n910325?fbclid=IwAR16sSqqRo-mx3DUDqGasj80NckwyEiDFon3MoN6Y6XmGPdXLxJooPOKvhw,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-09,pjmedia.com,"There was not a “Sturgis superspreader” event infecting hundreds of thousands with COVID-19 at a cost of billions to American taxpayers.A recent study claimed that the annual motorcycle rally held last month in Sturgis, South Dakota was a “superspreader event” infecting more than half of the 460,000 attendees at a cost of $12 billion to our public health institutions.The Sturgis event happened, in that same wonderfully crazy way that the Sturgis rally always happens.The “Sturgis superspreader” event did not happen.Not even a little.In areporttitled “IZA DP No. 13670: The Contagion Externality of a Superspreading Event: The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and COVID-19,” claimed that “large crowds, coupled with minimal mask-wearing and social distancing by attendees” turned the rally into a “superspreader” infecting 260,000 people.Authors Dhaval M. Dave, Andrew I. Friedson, Drew McNichols, and Joseph J. Sabia concluded that “the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally generated public health costs of approximately $12.2 billion.”The public health risks of Sturgis were so rigorously studied by the authors that “no medical journal would touch it,” as bestselling author and public health writer Alex Berensonnotedon Tuesday. Instead, the report was posted on the website of the obscure Insitute of Labor Economics, a leftwing German thinktank.Our infotainment industry — formerly known as “the mainstream media,” and prior to that as “the news business” — went bonkers over the claim.The Hill— formerly a respectable Washington-based publication — breathlessly ran the study’s claims as though they were undisputed by anyone without a political agenda. Reporter J. Edward Moreno briefly quoted South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) at the end of the piece, but that was it for “balance.” Instead, we got steno-pool quality reporting likethis:Based on the increase in case count, the researchers group, estimated that cases connected to the gathering resulted in $12 billion in public health costs, not including the costs associated with any deaths that might be tied to cases from the event. That dollar amount is based on another estimation that an average of $46,000 is spent on each patient who tests positive for COVID-19.If you’re a reporter reporting on health issues and you didn’t take those claims with a grain of salt, or without at least quoting actual experts in the fields of infectious disease and public health, maybe you ought not to report on health issues.For starters, the authors of the study made outrageous claims about the cost to treat a typical COVID-19 case, particularly asymptomatic cases.The typical cost for an asymptomatic case is probably close to zero, since most asymptomatic COVID-19 sufferers have no idea that they’re sick.How many people actually suffered a death attributed to COVID-19 following Sturgis?One.Other infotainment outlets that fell for this rotten study include the usual suspects, and to date not one has issued a retraction or correction that I could find.Here’s a partial list:Yes, even Kaiser Health News. They really ought to know better.Plus Fox News,The Washington Post,New York Times…I could go on, but I’m on a deadline. Also, I’d just like to add that it’s always the major infotainment outlets and the left-wing trolls in PJ Media’s comments section who accuse bloggers of writing nothing but clickbait.In reality, the media prefers to spread COVID-19 panic and disinformation.That’s why for the most part they didn’t apply a critical eye to a study that was ridiculous on the face of it.AsReason’s Elizabeth Nolan Brownnotedearlier on Wednesday:According to South Dakota health officials, 124 new cases in the state—including one fatal case—were directly linked to the rally. Overall, COVID-19 cases linked to the Sturgis rally were reported in 11 states as of September 2, to a tune of at least 260 new cases, according toThe Washington Post.If I’ve done my math right — and I have — the breathlessly repeated, non-medical, non-factual “study” was off by three orders of magnitude.That is what actual scientists call “a whole lot of wrong.”Editor’s Note: Want to support PJ Media so we can continue telling the truth about the China virus?Join PJ Media VIP TODAYand use the promo code WUHAN to get 25% off yourVIP membership."

They shouted into microphones and beat piñatas designed to look like Kroll and Collins.John Thompson, whorecently wonthe Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party primary for State House District 67A, appears to have led the mob, along with CAIR and civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong.“I’m a black man being terrorized,” Thompson declares in a video captured by Alpha News. “Don’t run now, don’t run now, racist white people, I’m here.”He condemned the “Blue Lives Matter” slogan, saying, “Blue lives ain’t s**t.” Then the candidate condemned the city of Hugo, Minnesota, because Kroll and Collins live there.John Thompson, who recently won his Primary for 67A in St. Paul, goes off and screams at neighborhood children, residents, and neighbors of Police Union Leader Bob Kroll.""F*CK, Hugo Minnesota!""BLM protesters gathered today outside Kroll's home.pic.twitter.com/1vTaiTQsML— Alpha News MN (@AlphaNewsMN)August 15, 2020He told a man holding a “Blue Lives Matter” sign to “take that sign” and “stick it in your a**,”Alpha News reported.“These cowards in these blue uniforms, they can take that s**t off and go back to being regular people, shopping in our stores, making money off of our g*dd**n tax dollars,” Thompson added. “I’m glad y’all are making them uncomfortable here in Hugo, Minnesota.”The videos show a group of teenage girls terrified by the massive crowd.More from John Thompson who recently won his Primary for 67A in St. Paul as he yells profanities & anti-police rhetoric w neighborhood children & residents nearby.""We sick of yo' white a*s!""Thompson lead BLM protesters to the home of Police Union President Bob Kroll in Hugopic.twitter.com/kTWfaER7B7— Alpha News MN (@AlphaNewsMN)August 16, 2020Photojournalist Rebecca Brannon captured footage of the crowd marching through Kroll’s neighborhood.The group is now proceeding to march through Police Union Leader Bob Kroll's neighborhood in Hugo Minnesota.pic.twitter.com/3HsAi8y2LE— Rebecca Brannon (@RebsBrannon)August 15, 2020Signs read “Black Lives Matter” and “No Justice, No Peace.” Many in the mob carried signs reading, “KKKroll Must Go” with an image of the police union leader’s head crossed out.A left-leaning pastor, Nathan Irons Roberts, announced that “hundreds of [Black Lives Matter] protesters drove to Trump Supporting Minneapolis Police Union leader Bob Kroll & [Liz Collins]’ house.” He said Armstrong, Thompson, and CAIR leaders led the mob. He further claimed that police and “Trump supporting neighbors” surrounded the mob and “flashed guns” at them. CAIR has not responded to PJ Media’s request for comment about the harassment.Roberts also shared a video of the mob smashing piñatas shaped like Kroll and Collins. “Bob and Liz weren’t home because they are cowards. So we left some candy and signs for them,” he tweeted ironically.Bob and Liz weren't home because they are cowards. So we left some candy and signs for them.pic.twitter.com/nG1u4tdpH0— Nathan Irons Roberts (@Nathaniroberts)August 15, 2020Thompson later offered a dubiously sincere apology for his disgusting actions.“I became an activist and ran for the Legislature to make a difference, to work diligently to fix our broken criminal justice system, dismantle institutional racism, and honor my friend, Philando Castile and become a symbolism of hope within our community,”he said. “I want to make a positive difference, and my comments on Saturday were not helpful. Inflammatory rhetoric is not how I want to address the important issues we’re facing, and I apologize.”Yet he also insisted he had received death threats for “speaking truth.”The DFL Party had endorsed Thompson, but DFL Party Chairman Ken Martin condemned the candidate’s violent rhetoric. Martin cited Thompson’s apology, however, as a reason to continue the party’s endorsement.“The Minnesota DFL does not condone any rhetoric which is violent, hateful, or inflammatory.  We expect our candidates and elected officials to live up to our highest values when they represent our DFL Party,” Martin said.“I cannot speak to or imagine the pain and anguish that John Thompson feels at the loss of his friend, Philando Castile, and the pain that so many Black Minnesotans feel after witnessing the murder of George Floyd. I’m grateful for the work John is doing to combat systemic racism, and I’m glad that he recognizes yesterday’s rhetoric was inflammatory, hurtful, and does not help move our state forward in the fight for justice,” the Democratic leader added.Attorney General Keith Ellison, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), and Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.) have also endorsed Thompson but have yet to address the harassment this weekend.Kroll, a longtime police officer and former member of the Minneapolis SWAT team, has been involved in three officer shootings, has faced 20 internal affairs complaints, and became the subject of multiple lawsuits. After the killing of George Floyd,Kroll notedFloyd’s “violent criminal history” and condemned the five days of violent, destructive, and deadly George Floyd riots in Minneapolis as spurred on by a “terrorist movement.” The state’s teachers union and others called for Kroll’s resignation following these comments.Kroll’s comments were defensible, and they do not make him a racist or a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This horrific mob attack was beyond the pale, and Thompson needs to do more than simply say, “I apologize.”Tyler O’Neil is the author ofMaking Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Not the Onion: The DNC Includes Elizabeth Warren in Native American Caucus,19.67,30.33,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/tyler-o-neil/2020/08/18/not-the-onion-the-dnc-includes-elizabeth-warren-in-native-american-caucus-n807359,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,pjmedia.com,"On Tuesday, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) apparently included Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in its Native American Caucus meeting. While Warren has apologized for claiming a Native American identity after her disastrous DNA test flop and President Donald Trump has repeatedly mocked her as “Pocahontas,” it seems the DNC decided it would be a good idea to highlight the controversy.“I’m excited for the DNC Native American Caucus meeting today. Please join [Deb Haaland (D-N.M.)], [Sharice Davids (D-Kan.)], [Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass)], and me (and whole bunch of other good folks) today!” Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan (D-Minn.) tweeted on Tuesday.

She has repeatedly apologized for her false claim of Cherokee status. Last December, she admitted, “I shouldn’t have done it. I am not a person of color, I am not a citizen of a tribe and I have apologized for the confusion I have caused on tribal citizenship, tribal sovereignty, and for any harm that I have caused.” She has claimed that the false identity “never had anything to do with any job I ever got or any benefit.”Americans might be forgiven for responding with skepticism.In 1984, Warren submitted five recipes for the bookPow Wow Chow:A Collection of Recipes from Families of the Five Civilized Tribes: Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole. Each recipe listed her as “Elizabeth Warren, Cherokee.” Radio host Howie Carr alleged that herrecipes were forgeries.Warren’s claim that her Native-American lie never got her a job seems rather suspect, but the statement that she never received any “benefit” from the lie is demonstrably false. Any proceeds fromPow Wow Chowarguably fall into that category.When Warren had a DNA test to “prove” her Cherokee status, the Cherokee Nation condemned this insult to their tribe.Perhaps in an attempt to smooth over her relations with Native-American tribes, she later released a$10 billion planto address America’s broken promises.Warren seems to want to put this scandal behind her, but by taking part in the DNC’s Native American Caucus, she is dredging it up once again. Flanagan, Stearns, Haaland, and Davids belong in that caucus, but “Pocahontas” does not. Don’t take my word for it — she herself said, “I am not a person of color, I am not a citizen of a tribe.”Tyler O’Neil is the author ofMaking Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

'A Win for Sanity' -- Trader Joe's Now Denies Being Racist,11.33,31.67,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/jim-treacher/2020/07/30/a-win-for-sanity-trader-joes-now-denies-being-racist-n732691,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,pjmedia.com,"Last weekI told you about the Trader Joe’s grocery chain capitulating to an utterly insane petition started by a California high school student. It accused the store of racism for labeling its ethnic foods “Trader Jose’s” and “Trader Ming’s” and whatnot.From the ridiculous petition:We demand that Trader Joe’s remove racist branding and packaging from its stores. The grocery chain labels some of its ethnic foods with modifications of “Joe” that belies a narrative of exoticism that perpetuates harmful stereotypes. For example, “Trader Ming’s” is used to brand the chain’s Chinese food, “Arabian Joe” brands Middle Eastern foods, “Trader José” brands Mexican foods, “Trader Giotto’s” is for Italian food, and “Trader Joe San” brands their Japanese cuisine. Furthermore, the Trader Joe’s company takes pride in the fact that the founder, Joe Coulombe, took inspiration in building the Trader Joe’s brand from a racist book and a controversial theme park attraction, both of which have received criticism for romanticizing Western Imperialism and fetishizing non-Western peoples…TJ’s put outthis statementin response to this idiocy:While this approach to product naming may have been rooted in a lighthearted attempt at inclusiveness, we recognize that it may now have the opposite effect — one that is contrary to the welcoming, rewarding customer experience we strive to create every day.Speaking as a loyal Trader Joe’s customer, I thought the company was wrong to cave to these stupid demands. Apparently a lot of their other customers agree with me, because now TJ’s is reversing course.From their site:To Our Valued Customers:In light of recent feedback and attention we’ve received about our product naming, we have some things we’d like to say to clarify our approach.A few weeks ago, an online petition was launched calling on us to “remove racist packaging from [our] products.” Following were inaccurate reports that the petition prompted us to take action. We want to be clear: we disagree that any of these labels are racist. We do not make decisions based on petitions…Recently we have heard from many customers reaffirming that these name variations are largely viewed in exactly the way they were intended­—as an attempt to have fun with our product marketing. We continue our ongoing evaluation, and those products that resonate with our customers and sell well will remain on our shelves.I’m not sure I buy their denial that they bowed to the petition. It sure looked that way to me. But I’m glad they hit the brakes. They should be listening to their paying customers, not some busybody Greta Thunberg wannabe with nothing better to do.Speaking of whom, you know what this means: another petition! Briones Bedell, the schoolchild who started this whole thing,isn’t happy about her wokeness being thwarted:Hello everyone. Thank you for your continued support in asking Trader Joe’s to remove racist branding and packaging from their stores.Trader Joe’s has issued a new statement as of July 24, 2020 that appears to be a reversal of a previous statement issued on July 17, 2020. The latest statement is a departure from the company’s commitment to removing products that they have recognized have not been inclusive or conducive to creating a welcoming, rewarding customer experience. Further, this recent statement adds confusion as to how – and whether – Trader Joe’s will proceed with the repackaging of their ethnic foods.There’s no confusion at all, of course. Trader Joe’s panicked because somebody put up a silly petition calling them racists because they label their burritos “Trader Jose’s.” Actual Trader Joe’s customers, the people who keep the store in business, let them know how crazy it was to give in to such ludicrous demands. Now the company has decided to just keep doing what they’re doing. Good for them.I’m with Stuart Varney on this one:STU: ""This is a win for sanity.""#TraderJoes#Food#Racism#CancelCulture#MyTake#VarneyCopic.twitter.com/OskaPXCklH— Varney & Co.

He is either the evilest man ever to hold the office of president or the dumbest. He is either a Machiavellian genius manipulating the media and his hypnotized followers or a bumbling know-nothing idiot.Trump is being accused of sabotaging the November elections because he won’t give the postal unions and incompetent managers in the postal service $25 billion to play with. The money will stave off catastrophe for about a year at the rate the USPS is burning through cash. Without that money, we’re informed by those in the know, thousands — no, tens of thousands — no,millionsof voters who wait until the last minute to mail in an absentee ballot might not have their votes counted because, well, Trump.The procrastinators in America are up in arms and plan a demonstration to show their outrage. But it probably won’t happen until after the election since that’s when they’ll eventually get around to it.The “crisis” in postal delivery presupposes that, prior to Trump’s shenanigans, the USPS was doing fine — nothing that a few tens of billions of taxpayer dollars couldn’t fix. In fact, that’s what the postal unions are saying. In a statement released on Saturday, the letter carriers and postal workers’ unions assure the public that even without the money, they can do the job.“The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) and the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) know the truth; the members of these unions are the people who actually process and deliver the mail. Postal Workers and Letter Carriers both say, unequivocally, that no matter how much the administration tries to undermine trust in the postal system,the system remains fully capable of delivering every single ballot cast by mail in a secure and timely manner.“Indeed, the NALC assures that even if every single vote in the November 2020 election were cast by mail, the U.S. Postal Service would have no problem delivering the ballots,whether or not Congress provides the funding included in the HEROES Act.“The U.S. Postal Service has an entire structure in place to coordinate with state and local election boards to facilitate secure and timely delivery of mail ballots.So what’s all the hubbub about? The letter carriers say they can deliver the ballots on time. The postal employees claim they don’t need the extra cash. Where, pray tell, is there a “crisis”?Nancy Pelosi knows. In fact, she’s about to call the members of the House of Representatives off the campaign trail and back to Washington to deal with the “crisis.”Politico:Nothing says “crisis” in Washington quite like pulling politicians away from their campaigns for a political stunt like holding an “emergency” session of Congress.So now Democrats want to become experts at mail delivery and dictate to management how the mail is to be delivered? Sheesh.The media is doing their part in fanning the flames of crisis. Some of the headlines are choice.That Reuters headline is hysterical. UPS and FedEx are not supposed to carry ballots. They aren’t the U.S. Postal Service. There would have to be an act of Congress before they could carry ballots.But if it gins up fear and outrage, all the better."

Trump Raises Question About Election 'Delay',6.62,34.88,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2020/07/30/trump-raises-question-about-news-and-politics-delay-n731957,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,pjmedia.com,"Did Donald Trump really suggest delaying the election because people couldn’t vote in person?With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)July 30, 2020Note the question marks after the suggestion to delay the vote. The White House says Trump was just “asking a question,” but unless Trump is a total idiot, he had to know the firestorm that this would let loose.And that’s apparently just fine with him.Fox News:A senior administration official told Fox News that “the President is simply raising a question, whereas Democrats are proposing an entirely new system (of massive mail in voting) that will result in enormous delays in the election results.”And Trump re-election campaign national press secretary Hogan Gidley – responding to the president’s tweet – said in a statement that “the President is just raising a question about the chaos Democrats have created with their insistence on all mail-in voting.”Focusing on reality would be helpful. The election will not be delayed. It would take an act of Congress — including the Democratic-controlled House — for a proposal to delay the election to succeed. No bookie in the world would give you decent odds on that.Associated Press:The act is getting old. Trump trolling the media may entertain Donald Trump but most of the rest of us are not amused. For an incumbent president to even ask a question about delaying the election is dangerous.The rest of the world is responding.Markets and moneyare down all over the world and the stock market took a nosedive.So if Trump knew the chaos his suggestion would cause, why make it? Because he’s losing the election, he knows he’s losing, and unless he connects with a hail mary pass to pull the game out, it’s over?Trump’s hail Mary is chaos and distraction. Note that the media is talking about his tweet to delay the election, not his response to the coronavirus, not the death toll, not Russia, not even foreign interference in the election. Even the bad economic news has taken second place to the president’s tweet.As always, Democrats and the media are playing into Trump’s game plan. The question is, will it still matter? We’re less than 100 days out from the election and it’s usually about this time that American voters begin to make up their minds about who they will vote for. The 15 percent of voters who are “persuadable” will drop to less than half that number in a month. Time is becoming a critical factor and with Biden still hiding from a cooperating media, the chances of a Biden gaffe changing the momentum of the election are receding.Trump can rail all he wants to against an “inaccurate and fraudulent” election, but the bottom line is that a vote will happen in November and nobody is going to stop it."

But this little rant and Gates’ better-than-thou attitude have both been brewing for a very, very long time.But our takeaway from what Gates said is that the First Amendment applies only to those with noble entitlements, you see.The rest of us — and that means you, bub — are supposed to sit down and shut up while our betters discuss important things.Your job is to nod along in agreement when the Great Men speak, and if one Great Man sometimes says something outside the party line, well isn’t that just adorable?Insanity Wrap would like to remind you that Bill Gates earned billions selling softwarenotbecause he was a brilliant software developer. Rather, Gates had a genius for licensing, for lock-in strategies like his dubious “embrace and extend” effort to hijack open web standards, and for sometimes unconscionable anticompetitive practices.So Insanity Wrap would like to say one thing to Bill Gates: You, sir, are a second-rate programmer and a third-rate American, and no amount of money can disguise those facts.Thus endeth the rant.#BLMTerroristsHarass Couple For Removing BLM Signs From Their Business & threaten to shut their business down !pic.twitter.com/wW9WiJx4fz— ❌🇺🇸Steve🇺🇸🇺🇸America First🇺🇸🇮🇹MAGA🇺🇸KAG (@SJPFISH)July 29, 2020In which BLM bully-boys threaten small business owners to toe their political line, or else.“We’ll be back, we’ll be back 200 deep.”All because Mr. and Mrs. Small Business Owners had the temerity to remove the BLM propaganda that had been posted on their property.Bring RICO down on these postmodern mobsters.ESPN investigation finds coaches at NBA China academies complained of player abuse, lack of schooling.The details:American coaches at three NBA training academies in China told league officials their Chinese partners were physically abusing young players and failing to provide schooling, even though commissioner Adam Silver had said that education would be central to the program, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the complaints.The NBA ran into myriad problems by opening one of the academies in Xinjiang, a police state in western China where more than a million Uighur Muslims are now held in barbed-wire camps. American coaches were frequently harassed and surveilled in Xinjiang, the sources said. One American coach was detained three times without cause; he and others were unable to obtain housing because of their status as foreigners.A former league employee compared the atmosphere when he worked in Xinjiang to “World War II Germany.”Plus: “One American coach who worked for the NBA in China described the project as ‘a sweat camp for athletes,'”NBA refused to comment on the report.Insanity Wrap believes one of the biggest mistakes this country has made in recent decades was allowing our news and entertainment industries to grow dependent on Communist Chinese dollars, because, asBen Thompsonwrote earlier this month, “China is not simply resisting Western ideals of freedom, but seeking to impose their own.”Once you hear it, you can't unhear it…pic.twitter.com/5MJ6CuQegT— M3thods (@M2Madness)July 28, 2020Insanity Wrap has been unable to unhear this for the last three hours, which is why we choose to so generously inflict it on you, too, gentle reader.You’re, um, welcome.Face masks are breaking facial recognition algorithms, says new government study.Takethat, surveillance state!Actually, it’s the other way around from the headline, but the correct way around was less shocking than it was completely blasé.Insanity Wrap takes no position on what people should or should not wear during their free time. During our San Francisco days, we knew more than one drag queen, and they were fun, lovely people—one of whom was actually a very attractive young lady who enjoyed dressing and making herself up so that she might be mistaken for a drag queen.Good times, good times.But then it got so political to the point where we have communist agitators working very hard to look like white supremacists because apparently America doesn’t produce enough of them to keep up with left-wing demand.Andy Ngo has again put together an invaluable Twitter thread exposing these communists for who they really are — a real rogues gallery of America’s least wanted, starting with one Madeleine “Molly” Conger.We thought Ms. Conger’s red bandana was an especially nice touch since it’s straight out of the Party uniform worn by Julia in1984.Did Ms. Conger everreadthat book?Insanity Wrap is afraid she has, instruction-manual style.Do not plant.Docontact the USDA.Or, hell, if you have some rivals or enemies you need to dispose of, go ahead and plant all the seeds you want.Just don’t come to us when things go awry.And that’s a Wrap for today.Come back tomorrow for another Insanity Wrap……assuming we make it that long."
Lincoln Project Finds Way to Become Even Bigger Bottom-Feeders Than They Already Were,21.33,25.33,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stephen-kruiser/2020/08/18/lincoln-project-finds-way-to-become-even-bigger-bottom-feeders-than-they-already-were-n806028,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,pjmedia.com,"On its most noble and wholesome days, American politics is a business full of petty, back-stabbing grifters. The kind of people you shouldn’t entrust with the care of a pet goldfish, let alone running the political machinery of the greatest country on Earth.I have been in the entertainment industry my entire adult life. I’ve also been a conservative political activist for decades, so I thought I had an idea of just how bad politics really was.Oops.It wasn’t until I started a side hustle writing and speaking at political events that I got a real good look at the aforementioned machinery. After a couple of years of that, I told my best friend in stand-up that showbiz is exceedingly sane compared to the extreme dysfunction of the political world.Washington, D.C., has been called “Hollywood for ugly people,” which is true for the most part, although I have met some attractive people there. The real ugly in D.C. is on the inside of people.Enter the Lincoln Project, a snot-bubbling Never-Trump toddler tantrum founded mostly by political consultants and strategists who hail from a grifter class I’ve long derided.As we are all painfully aware, the Never-Trump crowd has laughably been blathering on and on about their principles since 2016. If milking as much money as you can while crapping all over 9/10ths of the people you sided with for most of your career is a “principle,” then they have a case. I’m not opposed to anyone making money legally, but I will shoot your high horse if you’re a petty sellout pretending to occupy a position of moral superiority.The Lincoln Project has rapidly distinguished itself as the worst of the worst. Sure, they bark about principles like all the Nevers do, but they’re so transparently awful that I doubt even they believe their own b.s. Over in Never-Trump Grifterland, the Lincoln Project makes the writers at The Bulwark look like the American Conservative Union.The Lincoln Project has been getting worse by the week. Earlier in the month in his “Insanity Wrap,” our own VodkaPundit described how the Lincoln Project “retroactively” endorsed His High Holiness the Lightbringer, Barack Obama.You know, like principled conservatives do.Lincoln Project co-founder Steve Schmidt seems to have decided that the group just isn’t sleazy enough and decided to up its game. I discovered this tweet in a postwritten by David Harsanyi for National Review:Rubio is the type of man who would have stayed in Cuba 🇨🇺 in 59. He is the type of ambitious young man who would have sensed new opportunities. He is the type of man who would have gladly held Castro’s coat if it helped him rise, just a little.@ProjectLincoln— Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES)August 18, 2020More from Harsanyi’s post:As someone whose parents defected from the Soviet bloc, I find this kind of slander especially indefensible because it belittles the horrors of tyranny for cheap political points, and because it’s impossible to defend against. It would be tantamount to Rubio saying, “Steve Schmidt is the type of guy who would have been leading the mob in Kristallnacht because it might mean a few extra Reichsmarks in his pocket.”Schmidt’s dig is the kind of low-t thing that only a weak man who’s tired of watching George Conway steal and eat all of his French fries does.Rubio did hit back though:Schmidt is the type of man who turns to political prostitution. The type of washed up man who sensed new opportunities to make some $. The type of man who gladly supports a party with prominent members who sympathize with Castro because it helps him be relevant, just a little.https://t.co/2Hp6qykLT1— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio)August 18, 2020Allow me to digress for a moment to engage in some pedantry, which I usually eschew.Political strategists and consultants are already political whores, so Schmidt didn’t really turn to political prostitution. In fact, if I were to write a musical parody about the Lincoln Project, I’d call itThe Worst Little Whorehouse in D.C.I’d have Ana Navarro play George Conway in that, by the way.The major players in the Lincoln Project continue to portray themselves as principled anti-Trump Republicans or — in Schmidt’s case — independents. In reality, they are all advocates for the Democrats now. It’s not just Trump who they want to defeat, it’s any Republican currently running who didn’t disavow Trump and join their pathetic little reindeer games.For example, here in Arizona we Republicans are desperately hoping that Sen. Martha McSally can defeat the gun-grabbing carpetbagger Mark Kelly. This is one of — if not the — key races that the GOP needs to win to keep control of the Senate. With stakes that high, you might think that the principled Republicans at the Lincoln Project could at least look the other way.Nah.They’ve been targeting McSally since the beginning of the year (I won’t dignify it with a link) with an ad claiming that she is a “Trump hack.”The Lincoln Project is gleefully willing to tip the balance of power in the United States to the party that has been cheering on anti-cop rioters all summer. All because they were embarrassed about being so wrong about everything in 2016. Hell, I was wrong about a lot in 2016 too but I didn’t soil my diaper and throw myself on the ground to scream and kick about it for four years.The Lincoln Project and Vitriolic Grift Society charter members only want to make money for themselves right now. They know deep down that if this fantasy of theirs about deposing Trump and those who support him comes true that their Democratic masters will toss them aside like the trash that they’ve become. The useful idiots will be useful no more.I’m going to go marvel at my principles now. Unlike the Lincoln Project, I still have more of them than I do money in the bank.And I’m at peace with that.Kruiser TwitterKruiser FacebookPJ Media Senior Columnist and Associate Editor Stephen Kruiser is the author of“Don’t Let the Hippies Shower”and“Straight Outta Feelings: Political Zen in the Age of Outrage,”both of which address serious subjects in a humorous way.

Democrats look to crush states’ highway habit,-1.33,43.67,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/18/democrats-states-highways-transportation-499906,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.politico.com,"House Democrats are trying to use a massive climate and infrastructure bill to change how Americans get around — by breaking states’ decades-old fondness for building highways.Legislation the House passed this month is the biggest advance yet in Democrats’ efforts to bake climate policies into transportation, addressing the largest single contributor to the United States’ greenhouse gas output. It would also represent an historic shift away from the roads-first approach to federal transportation spending that has reigned since Dwight Eisenhower created the Interstate Highway System.But the bill is riling up opposition from two potential allies of the Democrats’ big-spending infrastructure initiatives: state transportation departments and the road-building lobby. That creates an awkward dynamic for supporters of the House bill, which faces a perilous path through the evenly divided Senate.Critics say the five-year, $549 billion bill would represent one-size-fits-all Washington meddling at its worst.“There are 50 different states with 50 different sets of transportation challenges. What is right for one may not be right for another,” said Dave Bauer, CEO of the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, which supports many of the bill’s provisions and principles. “It’s really hard to determine that five years at a time from Washington, D.C.”The bill’s supporters say the old system is unsustainable.“We have to begin to look at alternatives,” House Transportation Chair and bill sponsor Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) told POLITICO in the run-up to the bill’s passage in June. “You can’t pave over the whole country.”The bill, H.R. 3684 (117), would erect new bureaucratic hurdles for states seeking to spend federal money on laying asphalt, while steering them to more climate-friendly options like transit. It also would give cities more power over selecting and funding transportation projects — boosting the leverage of Democratic-led enclaves in red states such as Texas, where Houston is engaged in a high-profile fight with the state’s DOT over a highway expansion local pols don’t want.The bill is, for now, is separate from a compromise infrastructure bill backed by the Biden administration and key GOP senators, which would provide $579 billion in new spending, as well as a $3.5 trillion go-it-alone proposal that Democrats hope to approve by party-line votes. These chess pieces are separate for now, but portions of all three could end up blended together into whatever Congress ends up enacting.DeFazio said state DOTs have reflexively built highways instead of looking at other alternatives — a habit that needs to change. As a rare exception, he pointed to Virginia’s efforts toexpand passenger rail serviceto combat perennially snarled traffic on Interstate 95.“I’m not saying you can’t ever add [highway] capacity. But I’m saying first you have to look at the range of alternatives,” DeFazio said.States have tended to use one primary strategy to tackle congestion: adding new highways or expanding existing ones.From 1993 to 2017, states laid down 30,511 new miles of freeway lanes in the hundred largest urbanized areas — a 42 percent increase in highway capacity. Typically when it comes to federal transportation funding, about 80 percent of federal transportation goes to highways, and 20 percent to transit.Urban planners and transportation researchers say it’s impossible to pave the way to free-flowing traffic. In fact, they say new lanes often increase congestion, a phenomenon that economists call induced demand, in which creating a greater supply of something just makes people want to use it more. And more traffic brings more pollution. Arecent study by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a sustainability research organization, found that Colorado’s plans to add 200 new lane-miles over the next decade would have the same impact on carbon emissions as adding 70,000 cars to the roads.The Democrats’ bill won’t be able to undo decades of feverish highway building overnight, but its backers say it represents a huge shift in mindset.The bill, called the INVEST in America Act, would set limits on how states use money from one of the biggest pots of federal highway cash, the National Highway Performance Program, by requiring them to consider whether an “operational improvement or transit project” would be more cost-effective than expanding capacity for single-occupancy vehicles.As part of that analysis, states would also have to consider the cost to maintain a project that would increase highway capacity, and prove that their modeling of travel demand has a documented record of accuracy.It would also give more money and power to cities by granting them more authority over project selection and access to funds previously reserved for states. For example, the bill would require states to give local governments more money through an existing block grant fund than is the case at present, and create a new pot of money to go directly to Metropolitan Planning Organizations.“These changes represent a long-needed shift to ensure that the federal transportation program enhances, rather than undermines, safety and sustainability efforts at the local level,” said Corinne Kisner, executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials.It would also force states to spend a higher proportion of their federal funds on bridges, intended as another way of ensuring they repair existing infrastructure before building anew.The bill would probably force the greatest changes in red states, which spend proportionally more than blue states do on building new highway capacity, according to datatabulated by the pro-transit group Transportation for Americafrom 2009 to 2014, the most recent available. Mississippi topped the list.Exceptions exist, though: Republican-led Nebraska spent vastly more on repairs than new highways in those same years. And some Democrat-led states, such as Washington, have oftenshunned critical highway repairs, contributing to the wear that lawmakers say they want to fix.The trade group that represents state DOTs in Washington responded to the bill with a carefully worded statement that praised the legislation’s policy goals but said the best way to meet them is by giving states more, not less, flexibility.“We very much appreciate that the House bill addresses so many important priorities —including equity, greenhouse gas reduction, resilience, [electric vehicle] charging, and more,” said the statement from Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “We firmly believe that if the federal program can provide maximum flexibility rather than prescriptive requirements, states can deliver the policy outcomes envisioned by the House while also advancing each state’s own unique priorities.”The group Associated General Contractors of America took a harder tone, warning in a letter last week that “restrictions on states to build new highway capacity would have a negative economic effect on the roadway construction industry,” particularly small firms.But some policy veterans, such as former Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation Jim Aloisi, the effort doesn’t go far enough.“Federal largesse has been responsible in large part for the automobility-centric society that we have today that most of us understand is not sustainable,” Aloisi said in an interview. “And what Congress giveth, Congress can reduce or take away. For me, the House bill represents, to be perfectly candid, a modest effort, almost a timid effort in the right direction.”The House bill’s odds for success become more fraught in the Senate, where lawmakers will have to combine it with either its Senate committee counterpart or with the massive bipartisan infrastructure package that President Joe Biden supports.Both the Senate bill and the larger infrastructure proposal would pump money into state DOTs with minimal restrictions on what they do with it — largely maintaining a highway-friendly status quo.Even if the House proposal becomes law, state transportation agencies are probably already figuring out how to continue funding their traditional priorities as if nothing had changed, Aloisi said.“State DOTs across the board will be very good, and their private allies and supporters, at figuring out how to navigate their way through the language that the House passed,” he said, adding that there are likely already “consultants working overtime.”But he said changing the states’ ways is a necessary goal and praised Congress for starting to try.“I think the federal government has every right to say look, it’s our money, and we are now in the process of redirecting and transitioning from a 1950s approach to something that more clearly reflects not just the moment, but the future,” Aloisi said."
Jenner insists she's leading California recall field despite polling,-1.33,39.33,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/07/09/jenner-insists-shes-leading-california-recall-field-despite-polling-1388190,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,www.politico.com,"SACRAMENTO — Reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner said Friday that she’s leading all contenders in the Gov. Gavin Newsom recall despite polling and fundraising totals that suggest otherwise, addressing California political reporters in her first campaign press conference.Jenner said she plans a statewide bus tour in the month before the Sept. 14 recall and dismissed amajor May pollshowing that she was fourth among GOP hopefuls with only 6 percent support.“Honestly, I’m not concerned about the polling,” she said, dismissing the survey as outdated. “I guarantee you that I am in the lead.”Jenner said she has no plans to drop out of the race ahead of a filing deadline next week and will provide five years of tax returns as required by California’s elections chief under a new law.“I have a tremendous advantage, obviously because of name recognition,” Jenner said in her first trip to Sacramento some 10 weeks after declaring her candidacy.Jenner said she came to Sacramento to discuss her intervention ina lawsuit that Newsom filedto get his party affiliation listed on the recall ballot. Arguments were heard several blocks away Friday in a Sacramento courtroom after Newsom missed a deadline to include his Democratic affiliation — an option that only exists because Newsom signed a 2019 law that allows recall targets to list their party preference. The judge is expected to announce his decision Monday.Republicans have seized on the lawsuit as an example of Newsom trying to skirt his own laws and rules, a theme they’ve hammered after the governor’s dinner at the French Laundry restaurant as he implored residents to stay home. In a Fox News interview earlier Friday, Jenner argued that “Gavin Newsom keeps changing the rules ... he’s like a dictator out here,” she said.Jenner on Friday charged that Newsom is trying to sidestep the law and that Secretary of State Shirley Weber, a fellow Democrat appointed by Newsom, may cave in. “I want to make sure she does her job,” Jenner said, “and I want to be involved in that process.”Given her intervention on elections law, Jenner was asked about her own sparse voting experience, asPOLITICO found she missed nearly two-thirds of elections dating back to 2000.“I voted when I needed to, depending on what the issues are ... so no I have no regrets on something like that,” she said. “I’m actually very proud of my voting record.”The former Olympian and “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star made the comments in a 13-minute press conference at the Hyatt hotel that marked her first media appearance in Sacramento during the recall campaign. She has not held a public campaign event or rally yet in Northern California, and she left Sacramento without doing other events, according to her team.Jenner said she was heading next to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas — a bastion of right-leaning activists and supporters of former President Donald Trump — where she said she plans to do media. Trump isexpected to be the headlinerthis weekend.Trump’s former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, is advising Jenner. Asked if she wants Trump’s endorsement in the recall, Jenner demurred. “No, I honestly, I’m not looking for [it],” she said.“I’m an inclusive Republican,” she added. “To be honest with you, I don’t fit in that box.” She said has not met with Trump or discussed her campaign with him.Jenner’s appearance underscored the unorthodox nature of the reality TV star’s gubernatorial campaign, which has flagged in fundraising and so far failed to post any major endorsements. There’s also been little evidence of traditional campaign infrastructure such as volunteers and county chairs. Members of Jenner’s famed Kardashian family —whose joint wealth is estimated by Forbes at $2 billion— have so far not written checks or publicly backed her bid.Jenner is competing with a growing list of GOP candidates who include former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, businessman John Cox, former Rep. Doug Ose and Assemblymember Kevin Kiley. Sources say conservative talk show host Larry Elder is also expected to announce his run next week.Faulconer’s campaign on Friday issued a release on homelessness that called him “the leading candidate to recall Gavin Newsom.” The May poll by the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies showed Faulconer and Cox tied at 22 percent support from voters, followed by Ose with 14 percent and Jenner with 6 percent.“Mayor Faulconer is leading the movement to recall Gavin Newsom because Californians know he is the only candidate with the experience to lead on day one,” said Faulconer spokesperson John Burke. “He is committed to holding Newsom accountable for his failures while laying out a positive vision to bring real change for families across our state.”Camryn Dadey contributed to this report."
Top Biden ally pleads with him to scrap filibuster for election reform,-3.33,42.67,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/10/clyburn-biden-filibuster-election-reform-499051,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.politico.com,"After months of setbacks and gridlock on voting rights, one of President Joe Biden’s top allies in Congress is calling for him to support amending the Senate filibuster.House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) told POLITICO Biden “should endorse” the idea of creating a carveout to the legislative filibuster in the Senate for legislation that applies to the Constitution. In effect, the reform would make it possible for Democrats to pass their sweeping elections reform bill and another bill reauthorizing key sections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act with just Democratic support.It’s a sentiment the congressman says he’s shared with White House counselor Steve Ricchetti and Office of Public Engagement Director Cedric Richmond as well. “I’ve even told that to the vice president,” Clyburn said.Biden could “pick up the phone and tell [Sen.] Joe Manchin, ‘Hey, we should do a carve out.’” Clyburn said, referring to the centrist West Virginia Democrat who has resisted filibuster reform. “I don’t care whether he does it in a microphone or on the telephone — just do it.”Clyburn’s comments are the latest attempt by senior Democrats to find a way around Republican opposition to their election reform legislation. Biden himself is set to embark on a more aggressive campaign to try and move public opinion behind those bills. He is headed to Philadelphia on Tuesday to deliver a speech on his administration’s “actions to protect the sacred, constitutional right to vote,” the White House said. His remarks will come days after the president met with the leaders of national civil rights organizations at the White House, who called on Biden to use his voice, influence and power in this moment.But thepresident’s ability to directly combatrestrictive voting laws being considered or passed by Republican-led states across the country is limited. His party runs an evenly split, 50-50, Senate, and enjoys a slim House majority. Biden himself has so far expressed little desire to change the legislative filibuster to the degree likely needed to pass more of his agenda. Adding to the hurdles are recent Supreme Court rulings that weakened the Justice Department’s ability to sue states for election laws deemed racially discriminatory.If the two voting rights bills before Congress don’t reach Biden’s desk soon, Clyburn said, “Democrats can kiss the majority goodbye.”“I can see in a state like Georgia — where people stepped up in January in a way nobody thought they ever would — I can see the disappointment in the voters to the extent that [Sen. Rafael] Warnock would not be back,” he added.In response to Clyburn’s comments, a White House official noted Biden’s respect and admiration for the congressman and the president’s support for a talking filibuster, which requires a senator or group of senators to physically be on the floor to stall a bill. But Biden has dodged questions about whether he believes filibustered legislation should no longer have to meet a 60-vote threshold to pass.Anxiety and frustration around the failure to move voting rights legislation are not just building among progressive activists but among civil rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers as well. Democrats who spoke to POLITICO said they believed failure on this front would result not only in electoral losses but would have a tangible impact on the country’s democracy if more Republican-led states pass restrictions on voting access.Adding to that frustration is the recent Supreme Court decision that delivered another major blow to the Voting Rights Act.Lawyers and civil rights advocatesbelieve the decision will make it harder to bring lawsuits against new election laws passed by Republican-led states that limit access to the ballot.“I hope that the president gets a little more aggressive,” said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), who could lose his seat ifRepublicans decide to gerrymanderthe districts in Kentucky during redistricting. “Obviously they have a very full plate and they’re trying to deal with a lot of things [but] there are many of us who believe that particularly after the Supreme Court decision that we really are at a critical juncture in terms of protecting Democracy.”Yarmuth added that Democrats have a “deep fear” about “what happens to our democracy period. Not who wins in 2022, what happens to democracy.”Democrats’ signature election reform bill would expand early voting, ban partisan gerrymandering, among other changes that touch nearly every aspect of the election system. The second bill, named after the late Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) would restore key sections of the 1965 landmark Voting Rights Act, which mandated jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination get pre-approval for election law changes from the federal government.“We have to have a federal legislative fix and we have to figure out politically how we get around the filibuster,” said Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), vice-chair of the House Judiciary Committee. In Dean’s home state of Pennsylvania Republican state legislators are now calling for an Arizona-style audit of the 2020 election results.Dean also said she hopes Biden will endorse a carveout to the filibuster for bills related to election reform.“I hope the President will do that -- as I said I think the filibuster should be removed unless it was actually used for debate that furthers conversation about things,” said Dean. “But I hope the president will lead on this.”A White House official said Biden is actively pushing for the two pieces of legislation and has deployed multiple agencies, the White House legislative team, and senior staff to lobby for passage. On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced the Democratic National Committee would invest $25 million to register, educate and turn out voters.On Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki cited the Justice Department’s recent action to increase funding and personnel for its Civil Rights Division and Biden’s decision to nominate “two civil rights activists” to prominent roles at the DOJ as evidence of the administration’s dedication to the issue.Psaki said Biden’s speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday will not be about the legislative process but a “moral obligation” to defend the right to vote.But to many Democrats on and off the Hill, the entire ballgame is the legislative process.“If he is serious about voting rights being passed, then he has got to support at least modifying the filibuster,” said Cliff Allbright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a group that helped mobilize voters in Georgia and across the southern states in 2020. “If he’s not willing to support that ... he just needs to not tweet anymore about voting rights -- just shut up.”There are only two ways Democrats get the voting bills passed, said Rep. Clyburn: Either Manchin finds 10 Republicans to support a revised elections bill and the Lewis bill, or Democrats get rid of the filibuster.Clyburn said he held a one-on-one meeting with Manchin and their staff around the time thatManchin was crafting changesto Democrats’ election reform bill. Clyburn told him “I’m not asking you to eliminate the filibuster. ... But what I’m saying to you is that nobody ought to have the right to filibuster my constitutional rights.”In the absence of an embrace of filibuster reform, Democrats said they hoped to see more hardball legislative tactics and political arm-twisting by Biden to move the election bills forward.“This is an existential crisis for democracy and the party that is defending democracy,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee.“When you read Robert Caro’s biography of LBJ, you see how the Voting Rights Act of 1965 would not have passed without his direct personal muscular intervention with particular recalcitrant Democratic senators,” Raskin said. “That is the historical template for getting this thing done. And as a longtime senator, and student of the Senate, I am sure that this analogy is in Joe Biden’s mind.”"
Biden under pressure to respond to escalating attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria,-1.67,42.33,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/10/biden-iraq-syria-response-498976,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.politico.com,"A series of Iranian-backed militia attacks against Americans in Iraq and Syria is piling new pressure on President Joe Biden, with some Republicans criticizing his approach as insufficient and ineffective.U.S. troops and diplomats in Iraq and Syria were targeted insix rocket and drone attacks this week alone, including whenat least 14 rockets hit a base in Iraqon Wednesday, injuring two U.S. service members. The development is the latest in an escalating back-and-forth between the U.S. and Iranian-backed militia groups, which have stepped up attacks on U.S. troops in recent months despite Biden’s stated goal of deterrence through retaliatory airstrikes.The conflict is once again testing Biden’s resolve to pivot away from America’s decades of war in the Middle East so his administration can focus on ending the pandemic and navigating adversarial relations with Russia and China. And it could threaten Congress’ work this year on scaling back the president’s authority to strike in the region.Biden’s growing headache is also a familiar one for the former longtime senator and vice president, who has watched three successive American presidents before him continue to fight seemingly endless wars in the region using open-ended congressional authorizations.Republicans this week criticized Biden’s “bare minimum” approach, noting that his two retaliatory strikes have failed to deter the Iranian proxies.“Iran-backed militias’ continued assault on U.S. personnel in Iraq cannot be tolerated,” Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement to POLITICO. “President Biden must put forward a real strategy for deterring and ending these attacks, rather than continuing his bare-minimum, tit-for-tat approach that is failing to deter Iran or its militias and puts American lives at increased risk.”While they acknowledge that the current situation is unsustainable, Biden’s Democratic allies counter that the president does not have the authority to launch offensive strikes against the Iran-backed militia groups without first seeking congressional approval. The president, they say, is acting within his Article II powers under the Constitution to defend U.S. service members by retaliating.“These are very fact-specific determinations,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a Foreign Relations Committee member, said in an interview.“These actions within Iraq [are] very different than any kind of attack on Iran,” Van Hollen added. “The president has no authority to attack Iran, and in that circumstance would clearly have to come to the Congress to seek authorization.”Other Democrats have compared the situation to a low-scale war that could reasonably be considered “hostilities” as defined by the War Powers Act. They are urging Biden to consider asking Congress for approval to continue striking the Iranian proxies — but only if he believes that will truly deter the militias.But Van Hollen noted that the U.S. under Biden has yet to initiate hostilities against the Iranian proxies, and “that is obviously a line that cannot be crossed” without approval from Congress.Meanwhile, former defense officials called on the president to “be consistent” in responding to the attacks. Mick Mulroy, who oversaw the Pentagon’s Middle East policy during the Trump administration, noted that “Iran needs to know they can’t hide behind their proxy forces.”But Biden has limited options to contain the situation. He has already twice directed targeted airstrikes on facilities used by the militia groups in Iraq and Syria — once in February and again in late June in response to a spate of drone attacks — to little effect, even as his administration asserts that the strikes were intended to deter future attacks. And he risks further exacerbating tensions with Iraq, whichcondemned the June airstrikeon Iraqi soil as a “blatant” violation of national sovereignty.The past week has seen a string of attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.Pentagon Spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said the United States reserves the right to respond “at a time and place of our choosing to protect and defend our people.”“What we will not do is telegraph our potential actions — seen or unseen,” she said.On Monday, three rockets were fired at Ain al-Asad air base, and then a drone was shot down near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Then on Tuesday, anexplosive-laden drone attackedU.S. troops at Erbil air base in Iraq. Three attacks targeted troops in Iraq and Syria on Wednesday:at least 14 rockets hit al-Asad, injuring two U.S. service members; two rockets were fired at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad’s Green Zone; and a drone attacked the Al Omar oilfield in eastern Syria, where U.S. troops were hit werehit with multiple rocketson June 28.At the same time, the military is batting down misinformation about additional attacks on U.S. forces in Syria, and rumors that Washington is facing pressure from the Iraqi government to withdraw from the country — both of which officials have attributed to Iranian propaganda.Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Thursday that the department is “deeply concerned” about the attacks, and hinted that the president could choose to retaliate again.“We take the security and safety of our people overseas extremely seriously,” Kirby said. “And you’ve seen us retaliate appropriately when that safety and security has been threatened.”The escalation is also complicating bipartisan efforts on Capitol Hill torein in the president’s war powers.Next week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to approve a bill to repeal two authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq. On Monday, the panel will receive a briefing from top administration officials on how the repeals might affect current military operations, with a focus on the escalating conflict with the Iran-backed militias.Biden supports scrapping the outdated authorizations, and the House has already approved similar efforts.But some Senate Republicans are already promising to make the process difficult, arguing that repealing the 2002 and 1991 Iraq War authorizations would send a dangerous message as the Iran-backed militia groups that continue to strike American positions in Iraq. They also contend that it would unnecessarily hamstring the commander in chief — though the 2002 authorization was intended to topple Saddam Hussein’s government, and the 1991 authorization is effectively obsolete as it dealt with the Gulf War.“Any justification for the 2002 AUMF has long since passed,” Van Hollen said. “U.S. forces are currently in Iraq with the approval of the Iraqi government. So you don’t need a 2002 AUMF to justify that presence of American forces in Iraq.”Still, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told POLITICO that he is introducing an amendment to the repeal measures next week that would preserve the president’s ability to attack Iran and its proxies. It’s a top priority for GOP lawmakers including Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the House Armed Services panel, who urged Biden to “show strength in the face of these attacks.”“It needs to be made clear that if our troops are attacked in any part of the world that we will not only respond, but we will respond quickly and forcefully,” Rogers told POLITICO.Connor O’Brien contributed to this report."
Plugging Obamacare’s biggest hole poses dilemma for Democrats,-4.67,44.33,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/10/obamacare-medicaid-coverage-gap-democrats-499013,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.politico.com,"Democratic lawmakers are grappling with how to extend health insurance to millions of poor Americans in states that have refused Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, believing their upcoming party-line “human infrastructure” package represents the best chance to plug the health law’s biggest gap.After months of behind-the-scenes discussions, Democrats are coalescing around three options for closing the coverage gap in the Medicaid expansion holdout states, according to nine sources on and off the Hill. These approaches, which would leverage the existing Obamacare insurance marketplaces or require the Biden administration to create a new coverage program, each carry risks. And lawmakers still don’t see a clear path forward as they face a narrowing window to assemble a massive package of Democratic priorities.“The question has always been how to do it. It’s a pretty challenging question,” said House Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.), whose tax-writing panel is helping craft a fix.Tackling the Medicaid gap would fulfill President Joe Biden’s pledge to extend coverage to the 2.2 million low-income adults in the 12 states where Republican officials have resisted the program for nearly a decade. It would also give Democratic lawmakers from those holdout states — like Raphael Warnock of Georgia, who’s leading efforts in the Senate to close the Medicaid gap — an achievement to campaign on, with control of both chambers up for grabs in next year’s midterms and health care remaining an important issue for voters.The costly effort faces competition from other Democratic health care priorities that are jostling for position in infrastructure legislation, including an expansion of Medicare’s benefits and permanently increasing financial aid to people who purchase coverage on the ACA’s health insurance marketplaces.The debate over how best to spend limited health care dollars could force Democrats to choose between leveraging their control of Washington to shore up the ACA, or making a play for swing voters by adding coverage of dental, vision and hearing to Medicare. Closing the Medicaid coverage gap polls high with Democratic supporters, though independents and Republicans in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll said expanding Medicare benefits is abigger priority.“I’m very keenly aware that poor people are the first to get squeezed out when there’s a budget problem,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), whose home state has the nation’s highest uninsured rate. “I’m really pushing to say: At least do something for people who’ve been left out for more than a decade and have nothing to show for the Affordable Care Act. But it’s a challenging sell.”Yet, momentum for plugging the coverage gap has grown in recent weeks, after key Democratic leaders have embraced the effort. Congressional staff are still hashing out thorny policy questions over how to expand coverage to poor adults in the Medicaid expansion holdout states, but no clear preferred policy has emerged amid concerns over potential drawbacks. Some approaches could take years to set up, cost more than leaders want to spend or inadvertently penalize states that already expanded Medicaid.Advocates and Democratic lawmakers from Medicaid expansion holdout states say this month marks the first critical deadline in the effort, as congressional budget writers seek to finalize the parameters for infrastructure legislation the party can pass through reconciliation without Republican votes. While that budget resolution won’t include the details of which health policies make the final cut, it could provide the first sign of whether lawmakers are working with enough money to fund a Medicaid gap fix.The House is largely leading efforts to craft the policy, sources said. Options under consideration include:— Allowing low-income adults to get free private coverage through Obamacare’s insurance marketplaces. Financial assistance for the marketplaces has been closed off to people earning below the poverty line, about $13,000 for an individual, because Obamacare’s drafters expected they would be covered by Medicaid expansion. However, a 2012 Supreme Court decision made the expansion optional for states, creating the coverage gap Democrats are trying to close.— Directing the Department of Health and Human Services to stand up a new Medicaid-like program for people who would otherwise be covered by Medicaid expansion in the holdout states. Warnock, whose election helped secure Democratic control of the Senate and faces voters again next year, plans to introduce legislation as soon as next week that would back this approach and substantially boost financial incentives for holdout states to expand Medicaid, according to a draft bill obtained by POLITICO.— A hybrid model that could address concerns about either of the two approaches, according to a senior Democratic aide. People could quickly receive free coverage on the marketplaces until federal officials can create a new program that would likely provide better benefits.A White House spokesperson didn’t comment on whether Biden is pushing lawmakers to address Medicaid expansion in the human infrastructure package, which is expected to also include investments in child care, education and combating climate change. The spokesperson referred POLITICO to arecent tweetfrom domestic policy chief Susan Rice that said Biden “is ready to work with Congress this year to close the coverage gap.”Biden’s budget called for creating a federal-run health insurance option to cover people in the Medicaid expansion gap, but the White House hasn’t publicly weighed in on the approaches Congress is considering. Policymakers see complications with each idea.For instance, relying on the Obamacare markets could give the new enrollees skimpier benefits than what they would receive through Medicaid. It could also require the government to provide costly subsidies to private insurers to cover out-of-pocket health costs that Medicaid would typically cover. But creating a new federal program would take time to set up.Those drafting the legislation are trying to ensure they don’t inadvertently reward states that refused expansion or incentivize expansion states to drop coverage so that the federal government will foot the entire bill.“To the extent you give more incentives and benefits to irresponsible states, then some of the responsible states will say: ‘I want that, too,’ which adds to the cost,” Doggett said. “How do you justify excluding states from a federal Medicaid program?”Matthew Fiedler, a fellow at the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy whose research focuses on the Medicaid coverage gap, and other experts said they’re not concerned about states dropping Medicaid expansion, given that the federal government picks up 90 percent of the cost. Still, Medicaid experts believe policymakers must provide the right balance of “carrots and sticks” to discourage states from dropping out.Whatever approach lawmakers choose will have to pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian, who interprets whether policies satisfy strict reconciliation rules. However, lawmakers and outside experts are optimistic any policy would survive because changes to the Obamacare markets and Medicaid expansion have previously been pushed through the fast-track budget process.The effort recently received a major boost from the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus — as well as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. The groups argue that closing the coverage gap would be “one of the single most important steps” toward reducing the stark racial inequities in America’s health care system.It would also give red state Democrats a concrete win to take to their voters.“By this time next year, by the time you guys run for re-election next year, you’ll be able to run on Medicaid expansion,” Clyburn recently told lawmakers in Alabama’s statehouse. “I think we [can] get that done — I know I’m gonna raise hell to get it done.”"
More suspects arrested in assassination of Haitian president,-0.33,46.0,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/09/us-colombia-soldiers-haiti-assassination-498928,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,www.politico.com,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haitian authorities have made more arrests in the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, raiding Taiwan’s Embassy where several suspects are believed to have sought refuge, while also detaining two Haitian-Americans and several former Colombian soldiers allegedly tied to the plot.In all, 17 suspects have been detained and another eight are being sought, according to National Police Chief Léon Charles.“We are going to bring them to justice,” the police chief said, as the 17 handcuffed suspects sat on the floor during a news conference Thursday.Investigative Judge Clément Noël told the French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste that the Haitian-Americans arrested, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noël said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday.Moïse’s brazen killing at his home in an attack before dawn Wednesday that also seriously wounded his wife stunned a nation already reeling from poverty, widespread violence and political instability.Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military, declared a two-week “state of siege,” and asked people to return to work and reopen businesses that were shut down in normally bustling Port-au-Prince. He also ordered the international airport to reopen.Colombia’s government said it had been asked by Haiti about six of the suspects, including two of the three killed, and had determined they were retired members of its army. It offered its full cooperation.“A team was formed with the best investigators,” said Gen. Jorge Luis Vargas, the head of Colombia’s police. “They are going to send dates, flight times, financial information that is already being collected to be sent to Port-au-Prince.”U.S.-trained Colombian soldiers are heavily recruited by private security firms in global conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and powerful drug cartels.The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports that Haitian-Americans were in custody but would not comment.Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his home town of Jacmel, on Haiti’s southern coast.Solages also said he had worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Haiti, and on his Facebook page, which was also taken down after news of his arrest, he showcased photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag.Canada’s foreign relation department released a statement that did not refer to Solages by name but said one of the men detained for his alleged role in the killing had been “briefly employed as a reserve bodyguard” at its embassy by a private contractor. He gave no other details.Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates at the charity went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages doesn’t have any military training and he doesn’t believe he was involved in the assassination.“I feel like my son killed my brother because I love my president and I love James Solages,” Schubert Dorisme, whose wife is Solages’ aunt, told WPLG in Miami.Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Embassy in Port-au-Prince said Haitian police had arrested 11 individuals who tried to break into the Taiwanese Embassy in Port-au-Prince early Thursday. It gave no details of their identities or a reason for the break-in butin a statementreferred to the men as “mercenaries” and strongly condemned the “cruel and barbaric assassination” of Moïse.“As for whether the suspects were involved in the assassination of the president of Haiti, that will need to be investigated by the Haitian police,” Foreign Affairs spokesperson Joanne Ou told The Associated Press in Taipei.Police were alerted by embassy security guards while Taiwanese diplomats were working from home. The Taiwanese foreign ministry said some doors and windows were broken but there was no other damage.Haiti is one of a handful of countries worldwide that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan instead of the rival mainland Chinese government in Beijing.Elsewhere in Port-au-Prince, witnesses said a crowd discovered two suspects hiding in bushes, and some people grabbed the men by their shirts and pants, pushed and occasionally slapped them. An AP journalist saw officers put them in the back of a pickup and drive away as the crowd ran after them to a police station.“They killed the president! Give them to us! We’re going to burn them,” people chanted.The crowd later set fire to several abandoned cars riddled with bullet holes that they believed belonged to the suspects. The cars didn’t have license plates, and inside one was an empty box of bullets and some water.Charles urged people to stay calm and let his officers do their work. He cautioned that authorities needed evidence that was being destroyed, including the burned cars.Officials have given out little information on the killing, other than to say the attack was carried out by “a highly trained and heavily armed group.”Not everyone believed government’s account of the attack. When Haitian journalist Robenson Geffrard tweeted a report on comments by the police chief, he drew a flood of skeptical responses. Many wondered how what authorities described as sophisticated attackers be caught so easily.Judge Carl Henry Destin, who is involved in the investigation, said Moïse was shot a dozen times and his office and bedroom were ransacked, according to the Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste.Moïse’s daughter, Jomarlie Jovenel, hid in her brother’s bedroom during the attack, and a maid and another worker were tied up by the attackers, the judge said.Haiti had grown increasingly unstable under Moïse, who had been ruling by decree for more than a year and faced violent protests as critics accused him of trying to amass more power while the opposition demanded he step down.The U.N. Security Council met privately Thursday to discuss the situation in Haiti, and U.N. special envoy Helen La Lime said afterward that Haitian officials had asked for additional security assistance.Gunfire rang out intermittently across the city hours after the killing, a grim reminder of the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.Marco Destin ventured onto the streets to buy bread for his family because they had not left their home since the president’s killing.“Everyone at home is sleeping with one eye open and one eye closed,” he said. “If the head of state is not protected, I don’t have any protection whatsoever.”Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia, said gangs were a force to contend with and it isn’t certain Haiti’s security forces can enforce a state of siege.“It’s a really explosive situation,” he said."
Opinion | What the White House Doesn't Get About Misinformation,-10.67,34.0,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/17/vaccine-misinfo-tucker-carlson-jen-psaki-facebook-joe-biden-499895,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,www.politico.com,"The Biden administration recently escalated its campaign against thedeath-bringingCovid misinformation that’s propagated on social media and on cable news and advanced by Republican scaremongers.Abandoning its previous, more passive strategy, the administration haswrapped its criticsin a clinch and commenced counterpunching. White House press secretary Jen Psaki lecturedFacebookthis week for allowing false claims about Covid and vaccines to run wild on the service and announced that the White House was “flagging problematic posts” for the company’sattention. Last Sunday, chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci hat-tricked the misinformation topic by appearing on ABC’sThis Week, CNN’sState of the Union, and CBS’sFace the Nationto mute the conspiracy theory popular at Fox News and on Twitter that Biden intends to send federal agents door-to-door to forcibly dose Americans.Psakidid some of thesameby lighting into Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Covid fantasies while the White House Covid coordinator grappled with the Missouri governor on the other side of the ring and the surgeon generaldescribedCovid misinformation as “a serious threat to public health.”But Biden outdid his aides with this Friday statement about Facebook. “They’re killing people,” the presidentsaid.It’s despair-making that misinformation about Covid and other topics takes root so easily and demands constant monitoring and refutation. Misinformation—false and fake stories—has always been with us, but it didn’t really begin to flood our political debates until the 2016 presidential campaign, as Donald Trump used it on social media and TV appearances as his prime political strategy. Trump’s exile from Facebook and Twitter hastemperedbut not tamed the production and consumption of misinformation as his inheritors have taken up some of his slack to subvert and confuse.The new White House strategy of directing Facebook to put a crimp on misinformers might prompt a few spectacular headlines. It might persuade Facebook to throttle Covid misinformation. It might earn a few attaboys from public health types. But so far, the effort seems to be backfiring, especially among conservatives and social media users who have criticized the government for censoring Covid- and vaccine-related information it opposes.There’s no precedent in the Internet era of the U.S. government forcibly shoving back into the bottle an idea that has escaped, so Psaki and the White House would be wise to recall their campaign and rely more on what several recent academic studies have taught us about battling misinformation. Evidence exists that suggests we can manage misinformation without resorting to direct censorship by encouraging social media users to be more mindful of accuracy when posting.No critique of misinformation is complete without a passage detailing how journalists have, at times, been the greatest purveyors of the stuff. Reporters—and not just the ones from supermarket tabloids—havefaked storiesand deliberately hoodwinked readers with hoaxes. They have advanced as news various whispering campaigns alleging unproven malfeasance and conspiracies by presidents, corporate leaders and celebrities. At the turn of the last century, yellow journalism’s excesses contaminated our media. As Brent Staples justwrotein theNew York Times, until recent decades, American newspapers routinely ran scurrilous fake news about Black people, depicting them as subhuman, congenitally criminal, rapists and dope fiends. And it wasn’t just Southern papers, Staples points out, but nearly every newspaper. The coverage of Black people was as dishonest and corrupt as any modern-day misinformation campaign, and it took multiple generations to reform. The hundred-year campaign against marijuana provides another example of the press peddling misinformation.Traditionally, the mainstream press worked with the government, industry, labor and other leading institutions as an agent of social control, using shame, restraint and persuasion to advance a national political consensus. This gateway function began to falter in the 1960s when thinkers like Rachel Carson, Betty Friedan, Ralph Nader, Martin Luther King Jr., Jane Jacobs, the Vietnam War critics and others attacked and eroded the consensus. Dynamiting the consensus machine was a great thing, but there was an unwanted side-effect. The forces that blocked inconvenient truths had also helped control the spread of nutbaggery. As the Web and social media knocked down the gatekeepers, more inconvenient truths gained currency. But so too did the nutbaggery.For example, in pre-Web years, believers in the tenets of the John Birch Society had no idea of how many people agreed with them that President Dwight Eisenhower was an agent of the international communistconspiracy. They existed in a state of “pluralistic ignorance,” which inhibited them from fully voicing their opinions. But the Web shattered this ignorance, encouraging their modern-day equivalents, QAnon believers, to unite and circulate their misinformation. Anti-vaxxers likeRobert Kennedy Jr., and broadcasterTucker Carlsonwould have never gotten a chance to churn their fetid wake of lies and deceptions about Covid in the days before the Web and cable news.The most sobering thing about the misinformation of our age is how fast and how far it moves compared to earlier years. A 2018MIT studyshows that fake and false news (characterized as such by six well-known fact-checking organizations) spreads faster on Twitter than true stories, it’s retweeted more often, and it spreads farther. Fake news is 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than real news and people, not bots, are doing the primary spreading. The MIT researchers—Soroush Vosoughi, Sinan Aral and Deb Roy—attribute fake news’ superspreading powers to the novelty and excitement that sharing hogwash brings. Nobody gets—or expects to get—a jolt from sharing a news story about community organizers who are sharing pointers about where residents can get vaccinated. But the vision of G-man thugs force-injecting you on the front porch, espoused this week by Marjorie Taylor Greene in atweet? That’s enough to stimulate fight-or-flight in anybody. (She got 11,525 replies to that tweet, 5,852 retweets, and 14,826 likes.)What’s the appeal of tweeting misinformation? “People who share novel information are seen as being in the know,” Aral toldSciencemagazine, and who doesn’t like to be thought of as ahead of the curve? “People respond to false news more with surprise and disgust,” Vosoughi says, while true news elicits sadness, anticipation and trust. The appeal of the bogus is so grand that a BuzzFeed Newsinvestigationfound that in the last three months of the 2016 presidential campaign, “the top-performing fake election news stories on Facebook generated more engagement than the top stories from major news outlets such as theNew York Times,Washington Post,Huffington Post, NBC News, and others.”A March study published inNatureexplains that most social media users don’t deliberately set out to share fake news. The researchers contacted more than 5,000 Twitters users who had shared links to two right-wing sites rated by fact-checkers as unreliable. They made no effort to correct the tweeters’ tweet but instead asked their opinion about the accuracy of an unrelated, non-political headline. The researchers didn’t expect an answer; they merely wanted to remind the respondents that accuracy mattered. This single subtle reminder appears to have increased the “quality” of the news that they later shared. “People are often distracted from considering the accuracy of the content,” researchers David Rand and Gordon Pennycook wrote. “Therefore, shifting attention to the concept of accuracy can cause people to improve the quality of the news that they share.” It would be great if everybody consulted a cheat sheet of misinformation to avoid before tweeting, but that’s not the case. Another group of researchers found that fact-checker takedowns of false articles almostneverreach the people who share the false articles.The good news is that over80 percentof respondents in theNaturestudy said it was important to share accurate information on social media. Also, the respondents were actually shrewd about separating true from false accounts when they put their minds to it; when people share false accounts, the researchers found, it’s often due to not paying adequate attention before clicking send. Who falls the hardest for fake news? People who are “more willing to overclaim knowledge,” Rand and Pennycookwriteelsewhere.When a user shares something, it doesn’t necessarily mean he believes it, Rand and Pennycook note. It seems that he’s mostly trying to impress his followers and entertain them. Social media is, of course, optimized for engagement, not truth, and the impulse to be the first to tweet or retweet an item prevents many users from judging its accuracy beforehand. These findings counter the common view that we’ve entered a “post-truth” vortex in which people don’t care whether something is true or not. Most people do care, but tweet garbage anyway. Many of us have been known to commit this sin. Raise your hand if you’ve ever tweeted a bit of fakery that you shouldn’t have.If people are sincere about wanting to share accurate information—and if nudging them toward accuracy puts them on a course to share more quality information—we might be inspired to think that the struggle against misinformation isn’t hopeless. BothTwitterandFacebooknow label and suppress what they consider to be misleading messages, actually booting Trump from their services. But the labeling has only met with amodicumofsuccess. One unintended consequence of warning labels is that some users have come to interpret messageswithoutlabels asendorsed as trueby the social media outlet. Sometimes you can’t win for losing.Instead of jawboning Facebook or accusing it of murder, the White House could consider asking, not commanding, social media companies to prod users into thinking before posting. Whatever strategies the White House ends up promoting to marginalize fake news—banning, “prebunking,”suspending,blocking,labeling, nudging, tweaking thealgorithms—we’ve got to accept that there will always be a contingent who delight in writing, reading and sharing blatantly untrue material. To varying degrees, we all seem to be as attracted to the outrageously false as we are disappointed by the dullness and predictability of the true. Our psyches tend to burn brighter when stoked with the fantastic and astonishing. This can pose an insurmountable problem for reality-based journalists who learn how difficult it can be to compete with the fake stuff. Back in the 1920s and 1930s, a slang term arose to describe this kind of thinking. It was called “thobbery,” and was defined as the confident reasoning of a person who is not curious about verifying his results.It will always take mental energy to stand up against the fake and the spurious, and nobody will ever devise a magic formula to extinguish misinformation. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t think before we retweet, and ask our family, friends and neighbors to do the same. The best guideline would seem to be this: If you stumble across an incendiary tweet that could easily be translated into a Day-Glo circus poster, leave it alone. Thobbery is for chumps.******Why is there so little fake sports news? Is it because sports fans are knowledgeable about the subject and ignore hype? Send your speculations to[email protected].

Frustrated industry groups see Biden’s Covid czar as obstacle to reopening travel,0.33,44.67,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/17/biden-covid-czar-obstacle-499908,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,www.politico.com,"The White House is resisting lifting U.S. travel bans on a broad swath of foreign countries, despite a rising chorus of voices both inside and outside the administration questioning whether they are still necessary in the fight against Covid-19.Critics of the bans point to Jeff Zients, the coordinator of the White House’s coronavirus pandemic response, as the main obstacle standing in the way of easing the longstanding restrictions, according to five people familiar with the matter. And some of them have grown so frustrated with Zients that they said they have begun discussing ways to go around him and take their case to other top administration officials instead.President Joe Biden is under intense pressure from members of Congress, European governments, the travel industry and stranded individuals to lift the restrictions — particularly on Canada and much of Europe, where vaccine rates are relatively high. They argue that the bans are costing billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of jobs, andseparating families.Just last month, Europe eased restrictions for vaccinated American travelers, and Canada announced this week that itcould open its border to fully vaccinated Americansfor nonessential travel as early as mid-August.“I think the American people are owed an explanation: What the hell happened?” said Rep. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.), one of 75 lawmakers whosent a letter to Biden last weekurging him “to begin taking science-based, data-driven steps to safely reopen international travel to the United States.” Sens. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are preparing to send a letter to Biden as well, according to a Senate Democratic aide.Some senior officials in the Biden administration, including Cabinet secretaries and doctors, have expressed support for easing the restrictions as long as travelers coming into the U.S. can prove they have received vaccinations or provide a negative Covid test. But the administration remains resistant to asking businesses, including airlines, to require proof of vaccination, according to two senior administration officials familiar with the deliberations.The White House has repeatedly ruled out a so-called national vaccine passport in the face of pushback among conservatives who have raised concerns about government overreach and discrimination against Americans who opt not to get vaccinated.A doctor in touch with the White House said physicians at the White House are generally supportive of vaccination proof. “Jeff Zients is the holdup of the proof of vaccination,” the person said. “He thinks there are real political consequences to the Biden team looking like they are pro-vaccine passports. He’s thinking politically, but scientifically proof of vaccination is everything.”“I do think ultimately, yeah, Zients is the decision maker,” an airline lobbyist agreed. “He’s certainly been the one [airline] CEOs have met with and talked to.”The White House did not directly address the criticisms of Zients. But it countered that it’s focused on restarting international travel safely.“It is mission-critical that we are making a decision on travel restrictions with the best available data and incredible precision,” Kevin Munoz, a White House spokespereson, said in a statement. “We take incredibly seriously these decisions and the interagency working groups are united behind and steadfastly focused on getting this right.”Last month, the administration set up four working groups with representatives from different U.S. agencies and officials from Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the United Kingdom to find a way to lift restrictions. The groups — led by the White House Covid response team and the National Security Council — include representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Departments of State, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and Transportation. They have yet to outline a plan and publicly, White House officials have said only that they are “following the science” andlistening to public health officials.Zients gave reporters a little more information Friday morning, saying that any decision on travel bans would be guided by “many variables, including case rates, vaccination rates and the prevalence of any variants, including the Delta variant.” But the administration has not announced what benchmarks will need to be met before the restrictions will be lifted, frustrating those lobbying on the issue.“They just don’t have an answer. It feels to me like this is an, ‘We’ll know it when we see it,’ and they don’t want to be tied to any certain criteria,” the airline lobbyist said.Earlier this week, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo — who isn’t a member of the working groups — said that she is pressing for the easing of the restrictions but that U.S. health officials remain concerned about the possibility of more outbreaks.“I’m pushing really hard,” Raimondo toldReuters. “The CDC is nervous, and it’s hard to know if people are vaccinated. There’s no vaccine passport that’s reliable, and that’s kind of a big hurdle.”But on Thursday, a Commerce Department official sidestepped questions on Raimondo’s support.“We recognize the importance of international travel,” the official said. “The best step to reopening travel is getting more people vaccinated in the U.S. and across the globe. Any decisions about reopening international travel will be guided by our public health and medical experts.”The deliberations come at a time when Covid-19 infection rates attributable to the highly transmissible Delta variant are surging in states across the Midwest and the South, where vaccination rates remain below the national average. Top health officials are increasingly concerned about the rate of transmission in the unvaccinated communities and the possibility that the Delta variant could cause big new outbreaks ahead of school reopenings. Those public health concerns, one White House official said, trump any worries about the economic impact of the restrictions.At a news conference Thursday, alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Biden pledged to provide more information about when the restrictions will be lifted in the coming days. He said he brought in Zients when Merkel raised the question during their bilateral talks earlier in the day.“I’ll be able to answer that question to you within the next several days, when it’s likely to happen,” Biden said. “I’m waiting to hear from our folks, our Covid team, as to when that should be done.”Critics of the bans say it’s not just economic concerns driving their opposition — there’s also no scientific rationale to restricting foreigners who’ve received a Covid vaccine from entering the country.“The travel bans and which countries are affected don’t make sense. They don’t make scientific sense, or frankly common sense,” said Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University. “It seems to be because of the Biden administration’s … squeamishness over vaccine verification. It’s time they get over it and see that vaccination is our pathway out of this pandemic.”The bans date back to last year, when former President Donald Trump sealed off the U.S. to most Europeans as well as travelers from other countries, including China, Brazil, India, South Africa and Iran. Trumpliftedsome bans as he was leaving office, but Bidenreinstatedthem and has kept them in place.Some travelers can receive exemptions, including U.S. citizens, green-card holders, their spouses and children, as well as diplomats, students, journalists and those who work in the areas involving “critical infrastructure” or “significant economic activity.”But several other classes of visa holders are out of luck, as are casual tourists. So are bi-national couples who are not married, thousands of whom have banded together to form an online movement called #LoveIsNotTourism to try and pressure the Biden administration to drop the restrictions. They’ve shared thousands upon thousands of tweets, videos and images on social media calling for the administration to lift the ban or at least give them more information.A top executive at a major U.S. airline said the industry has shown the administration how they could provide self-administered tests when travel is booked as well as how they can attach testing results to boarding passes and vaccination status to frequent flier numbers.“We’ve seen this sort of caution from the CDC throughout the COVID crisis,” the executive said. “I don’t want to second-guess the science but a lot of the science would certainly indicate that the protection that is afforded by the vaccines should be a path for opening up international travel.”But oversight of international travel is spread across a number of different federal agencies, making it harder for any single Cabinet member to take the lead on pushing to move faster.“There’s not a clear Cabinet agency that can kind of push something in the face of White House slowness,” said Stewart Verdery, a lobbyist working on the issue and a former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary during President George W. Bush’s administration.German officials raised the issue of the U.S. travel ban directly with Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his visit to the country at the end of June, according to two senior officials with knowledge of the matter. Though the U.S. had been expected to announce it would lift the restrictions, the officials said Blinken relayed at the time that the administration was still considering its options and had not made a final decision. Those same officials told POLITICO that German officials have since pressed the administration for a specific answer on the issue.“Our travel policy not only lacks rationality, but also is hurting America a great deal,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown health law professor who’s informally advised the Biden administration.Gostin praised Zients’ work to combat the pandemic over the past six months but said continuing to restrict international travel was a blind spot.“He’s smart,” Gostin said. “He’s followed the evidence. But in this case I think he’s more focused on the political optics, because I don’t think that there’s any good evidence that our current travel policy keeps us safe.”Erin Banco, Eugene Daniels, Daniel Lippman and Kathryn A. Wolfe contributed to this report."
Hunter Biden’s prosecutor rejected moves that would have revealed probe earlier,0.33,46.67,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/16/hunter-biden-probe-prosecutor-499782,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,www.politico.com,"Last summer, federal officials in Delaware investigating Hunter Biden faced a dilemma. The probe had reached a point where prosecutors could have sought search warrants and issued a flurry of grand jury subpoenas. Some officials involved in the case wanted to do just that. Others urged caution. They advised Delaware’s U.S. Attorney, David Weiss, to avoid taking any actions that could alert the public to the existence of the case in the middle of a presidential election.“To his credit, he listened,” said a person involved in the discussions, reported here for the first time. Weiss decided to wait, averting the possibility that the investigation would become a months-long campaign issue.Since taking office, President Joe Biden has left Weiss — a Republican appointed by Donald Trump on the recommendation of Delaware’s two Democratic senators — in place. That puts him in one of the most sensitive positions in the Justice Department, deciding how to proceed with an investigation of the president’s son that has proven politically fraught on several fronts.The probe, which is focused on possible tax law violations, has alsoexaminedHunter Biden’s business dealings with foreign interests — a topic that has animated Biden detractors — and its existence first came to light amid a controversy about the leak of Hunter Biden’s laptop files. Since then, the case has become a political football: Some critics have suggested that the Trump administration’s political agenda influenced aparallel federal probethat scrutinized Hunter Biden in Pittsburgh, while some Republicans havecalled forthe appointment of a special prosecutor to shield Weiss’s investigation from the influence of the Biden administration.Weiss declined to comment. But as the 65-year-old U.S. attorney navigates this hazardous terrain, interviews with members of Delaware’s small legal community and an examination of his career reveal two salient qualities.One is a bipartisan reputation for professionalism. One longtime pillar of the Delaware defense bar, Dan Lyons, recounted his sense of relief upon hearing that Weiss was in charge of the Hunter Biden probe. “I remember thinking he’s a straight shooter, and he’s the perfect one to have it,” said Lyons, whose history with the U.S. attorney dates back to the 1980s, when he defended one of the first cases Weiss ever prosecuted. “He would just go where the evidence led him.”The other is a long track record of taking on the Delaware establishment. While Biden has held up “the Delaware Way,” the nickname for the state’s cozy political culture, as a positive model for bipartisan cooperation, Weiss has spent three decades confronting its excesses.Early in his career, Weiss served as a special prosecutor during a federal crackdown on bribery and extortion among Delaware politicians of both parties. Later, he helped nab a former Delaware deputy attorney general who murdered his girlfriend. A decade ago, Weiss even investigated Biden’s presidential campaign fundraising, enlisting a beer distributor to wear a wire for the FBI and record conversations with Biden’s associates.Now, that record may hold clues to Weiss’s approach as he weighs whether to seek charges against a president’s son who has intermingled his business dealings with the Biden family’s political connections. Weiss’s decision to avoid revealing the investigation in a highly charged political atmosphere — a move that might have boosted Donald Trump’s campaign, even at the cost of politicizing the probe — was consistent with his sober-minded approach to his job, said people familiar with Weiss’s career. But so too, they said, is the fact that the probe continues, with most expecting that Weiss will not drop the case until making a full assessment of Hunter Biden’s culpability.“He’s got an appreciation,” said a former prosecutor who has worked closely with Weiss, “that there are times when the Delaware Way can turn into something more nefarious.”Weiss grew up in a middle-class home in northeast Philadelphia in the 1960s and went on to attend Washington University in St. Louis. He returned to the Philadelphia area to attend Widener University School of Law, where, in his final year, he met with a round of rejections after applying for jobs at several law firms.Instead, he got a gig clerking for the Delaware Supreme Court in 1984, then went on to take a job with the U.S. Attorney’s office in Wilmington, Del. One former colleague recalled a joke around the office that Weiss — who played third base for Wash U.’s baseball team — was hired to improve the office softball team. While there, he got his first up-close look at the underbelly of the Delaware Way.Weiss’s big break came when Louis Capano Jr., a member of a family of prominent Delaware developers, brought a complaint to the state’s then-attorney general, Charles Oberly, as the two watched a Little League game. Capano was being forced to pay protection money to a member of the New Castle County Council, the body that oversees the Wilmington area and on which Biden had begun his political career.Oberly referred Capano to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. With Weiss’s participation the Justice Department set up a sting targeting the councilman, Democrat Ronald Aiello.In June of 1989, Weiss resigned his post as an assistant U.S. Attorney and was appointed special prosecutor to oversee Aiello’s case. Aiello went on to plead guilty to extortion.Weiss entered private practice at the firm Duane Morris, one of the places he had applied to out of law school, where he worked primarily on commercial litigation. In his office there, he displayed the years-old letter rejecting him from the firm, framed alongside the announcement of his elevation to partner.The Aiello case, meanwhile, spurred the FBI to pursue an expansive probe of political corruption in Delaware, Operation New Clean. It relied on an undercover FBI agent and the cooperation of Louis Capano’s cousin, Mario Capano, according to the Delaware New Journal.The investigation ensnared the state transportation secretary, Republican Kermit Justice, in another sting, in which he sought to solicit bribes from the undercover FBI agent.In 1992, Justice, whose family has long been close with the Bidens, hired Weiss as his defense attorney. But Weiss was disqualified from the case on account of his previous government work on the corruption probe, and Justice was convicted of extortion.Weiss was drawn back into the world of Delaware’s leading families in 1996, when Anne Marie Fahey, a young secretary in the office of Delaware’s then-governor, Tom Carper, went missing.Fahey’s brother, Robert Fahey, hired Weiss to help her family get to the bottom of her fate. Weiss convinced his former colleagues at the U.S. Attorney’s office to investigate the disappearance aggressively.The trail soon led to Thomas Capano, the state’s former deputy attorney general and the brother of Louis Capano. Though married, he had been dating Fahey, and he was enraged when he discovered she had found a younger boyfriend.But investigators were unable to find a body, and the investigation dragged on for months without a conclusion. Eventually, the feds leaned on a third Capano brother, Gerry Capano, who had helped dispose of Fahey’s body. He turned state’s evidence, and Thomas Capano was convicted of murder. It was the most sensational trial in the state in living memory, spawning several books and a made-for-television movie.Tom Ostrander, the Duane Morris partner who hired Weiss and introduced him to Fahey’s family, credits Weiss with the success of the prosecution.Ostrander argued that if it were not for Weiss’s intervention, the investigation of Fahey’s disappearance would have fallen to Delaware authorities, who, he said, did not have the same capabilities as federal investigators to pursue difficult cases.“I don’t think the state had the resources to do the investigation of a very powerful family,” Ostrander said. “If David Weiss had not pressed the U.S. Attorney’s office to investigate, Thomas Capano would have literally gotten away with murder.”Speaking 25 years to the day after he first contacted Weiss about his sister’s disappearance, Robert Fahey said that the Capano case demonstrated the prosecutor’s willingness to stand up to the handful of closely intertwined families that dominate the small state’s affairs. “I don’t think he would buy into the notion that these dozen families can get away with anything,” Robert Fahey said.In 2007, Weiss left private practice to work under George W. Bush’s U.S. attorney Colm Connolly.In contrast to Weiss, Connolly had earned a reputation for having a conservative agenda in addition to being an aggressive prosecutor. “Colm was a little more outspoken about things,” said Oberly, the former Delaware attorney general, who was later appointed by Barack Obama to succeed Connolly as U.S. attorney.Connolly also clashed with Biden, who as a senator effectively blocked the prosecutor from a federal judgeship when Bush nominated him in 2008. Instead, in 2009, Connolly entered private practice, and Weiss stepped in as acting U.S. attorney. Connolly, who is now a federal judge for the District of Delaware after being renominated by Trump, did not respond to a request for comment left with his chambers.Weiss and Connolly remain close. One Wilmington lawyer spotted them having drinks together at Tonic, a restaurant in downtown Wilmington, earlier this year.While acting as the interim head of the Justice Department’s Delaware office, Weiss oversaw the prosecution of Christopher Tigani.Tigani, whose family owns a valuable beer distributorship in the state and maintained longstanding ties to the Bidens, served as a bundler for Biden’s presidential primary campaign in 2007, soliciting contributions from his employees and their partners and delivering the checks in bulk to campaign staff. In the course of his bundling, he engaged in a “straw donor” scheme, reimbursing employees for their contributions as a way of evading the cap on how much he could personally give.After the FBI confronted Tigani with evidence of his illegal contributions in 2010, Weiss recruited the beer distributor to cooperate in a wide-ranging probe of Delaware’s politics.As POLITICOfirst reportedlast summer, Tigani, under Weiss’s supervision, wore a wire and recorded conversations with Biden’s former finance chief as well as a former Biden Senate staffer and a Delaware businessman close to Biden.Tigani said that at the beginning of his attempted cooperation, he met with Weiss and several other officials. He said that Weiss laid out the government’s theory that politicians in Delaware were complicit in straw donor schemes.The investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and, in the end, only Tigani was indicted on federal charges, to which he pleaded guilty. Tigani also later pleaded guilty to state charges of making straw-donor contributions to the campaigns of several Delaware politicians, including Beau Biden.Looking back on his downfall, Tigani holds grudges against just about everybody involved, from the Bidens, to the News Journal, which first brought attention to his political influence, to the federal judge who oversaw his case, to his own father, with whom he remains embroiled in long-running litigation related to the family business. The rare exception is Weiss. “He was a straight shooter,” Tigani said of the man who sent him to prison.When Tigani’s case became public a decade ago, it set off a wave of hand-wringing about the state’s political culture. Biden has nonetheless continued totoutthe Delaware Way as an approach worth emulating. “We need a little more of the Delaware way,” he said just before launching his 2020 campaign. “We got to make it more the American way and it’s lost. Our politics has become so mean, so petty, so vicious that we can’t govern ourselves, in many cases, even talk to one another.”In a filing in Tigani’s case, Weiss and a deputy, Robert “Rocky” Kravetz, took a darker view of the Delaware Way. They defined it as “a form of soft corruption, intersecting business and political interests, which has existed in this state for years.”For his part, Weiss delights in following the machinations of the state’s power players, according to longtime friend William Manning, a partner at the Wilmington office at the law firm of Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr. “He loves knowing everything,” and “who’s doing what to whom,” Manning said.But Weiss has mostly stayed clear of participating in the Delaware scene himself. For much of the time that he has worked as a federal prosecutor in Delaware, he actually lived in nearby Pennsylvania, only moving into the tiny state in 2016.“It’s very difficult to be a high-quality prosecutor and at the same time have clubby relationships with virtually everybody in town,” Manning said. “There’s a detachment to the job that suits David just fine.”“He’s a very private person,” Oberly said. Friends and colleagues describe him as devoted to his wife, Deborah, also an attorney, and two adult daughters. He is also a devoted fan of the Grateful Dead and plays golf on occasion (“admittedly poorly,” conceded Kim Reeves, spokeswoman for his office, who declined to make Weiss available for an interview, but agreed to confirm biographical facts about him).After the Tigani case, Oberly, a political ally of the Bidens, succeeded Weiss as Delaware’s U.S. attorney. But Oberly, who lacked experience trying federal cases, kept Weiss on as his assistant, and praised Weiss’s work in an interview. “He was loyal,” Oberly said. “He did a nice job for me.”In 2017, Trump nominated Weiss to serve as U.S. attorney on a permanent basis on the recommendation of Delaware’s two Democratic senators, who bothpraisedthe choice.By late 2018, Weiss’s office was investigating Hunter Biden’s activities in response to a number of leads, including some related to his dealings with Chinese business associates.While investigators pursued suspicions of possible money laundering and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the criminal investigation eventually came to focus on whether he had paid taxes on all of his income, according to a person familiar with it. Hunter Biden has maintained that he acted appropriately.By last summer, the probe had reached a point at which investigators could have issued grand jury subpoenas and sought search warrants that might have revealed its existence at a time when many of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters were seeking to draw attention to Hunter Biden’s actions.Weiss, however, decided to delay taking any actions that were likely to make the existence of the Hunter Biden probe public. Concerns about affecting the presidential election loomed large when Weiss entertained arguments about advancing the probe, according to the person involved in the discussions. No matter what he did, the decision was sure to come under scrutiny for signs of politicization.“It was a close call,” said the person, who believes Weiss was right to hold off. “That case has way more credibility now,” the person said.Even as Weiss took the more cautious route, his office still had to contend with complications posed by parallel investigative efforts being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh.Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, had tasked the U.S. attorney there, Scott Brady, with vetting information from Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani claimed to have information implicating the Bidens in corruption, but his relationship with Trump andreportsthat he had met with a Russian agent as he sought dirt on the Bidens, cast doubts on his claims.Investigators in Delaware worried that the Giuliani material in Pittsburgh could taint their own investigation. It did not help, one person familiar with the investigation said, that Brady’s office seemed intent on taking aggressive steps in pursuit of its inquiry.“Pittsburgh was out of control,” said the person, who worried that the Western Pennsylvania probe would be seen as politically motivated and would undermine the preexisting Hunter Biden investigation.A former official involved with the investigative efforts out of Pittsburgh contested that characterization, saying the officials involved acted “scrupulously and with high ethical standards.”Relatively few details of the Hunter Biden probe leaked ahead of the election, in part because the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office is small, and information is tightly guarded. In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Barr also took steps to prevent its public disclosure,accordingto the Wall Street Journal.The probe did not gain widespread attention outside of the conservative media sphere until several weeks after the presidential election, when Hunter Biden released a statement saying Weiss’s office had notified him of it.Some Republicans called for the appointment of a special prosecutor, but Barr called that step unnecessary.In December, Hunter Biden hired Chris Clark, a partner at the national firm of Latham & Watkins, as his defense attorney.In January, upon taking office, Biden appointed Nicholas McQuaid to be the interim head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department. Until his appointment, McQuaid had also been a partner at Latham, where he had worked on somecaseswith Clark. Justice Department conflict of interestruleswould require McQuaid to receive a waiver to participate in oversight of the Hunter Biden probe. A DOJ spokesman, Joshua Stueve, declined to say whether McQuaid had received a waiver or recused himself from the case. Clark did not respond to a request for comment.Last month, POLITICOreportedthat Weiss’s office is also involved in an investigation of Blue Star Strategies, a Democratic lobbying firm, that includes a focus on potential FARA violations. The investigation relates to work Blue Star performed on behalf of the same Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, that hired Hunter Biden to its board as its founder faced allegations of corruption. Blue Star’s CEO, Karen Tramontano, did not respond to a request for comment.As the probes continue, Weiss’s handling of them will be closely watched by partisans on both sides. Those who know him argue that his work will stand up to the scrutiny.“David is the type of lawyer who follows the facts and whatever the facts may lead to,” Ostrander said. “It doesn’t matter who the person is he’s looking into.”"
Haiti faces uncertain future as mourning first lady returns,0.0,45.33,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/18/haiti-uncertain-future-mourning-first-lady-returns-500057,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.politico.com,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti’s political future on Sunday grew murkier after the surprise return of first lady Martine Moïse, who was released from a hospital in Miami where she was treated for injuries following an attack in which the president was assassinated.Martine Moïse did not make any public statements after she descended a private jet wearing a black dress, a black bulletproof vest, a black face mask and her right arm in a black sling as she mourned for President Jovenel Moïse, who was killed July 7 at their private home.Some experts — like many in this country of more than 11 million people — were surprised at how quickly she reappeared in Haiti and questioned whether she plans to become involved in the country’s politics.“The fact that she returned could suggest she intends to play some role,” said Laurent Dubois, a Haiti expert and Duke University professor. “She may intervene in one way or another.”Martine Moïse arrived just hours after a prominent group of international diplomats issued a statement that appeared to shun interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, the man currently running the country with the backing of police and the military.Joseph’s name was never mentioned in the statement made by the Core Group, composed of ambassadors from Germany, Brazil, Canada, Spain, the U.S., France, the European Union and representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of American States.The group called for the creation of “a consensual and inclusive government,” adding, “To this end, it strongly encourages the designated Prime Minister Ariel Henry to continue the mission entrusted to him to form such a government.”Henry was designated prime minister a day before Jovenel Moïse was killed. He did not respond to requests for comment.The U.N., OAS and U.S. State Department did not offer further explanation when contacted.Given the current state of Haitian politics, Dubois said he believes the arrival of Martine Moïse could have an impact.“She’s obviously in a position to play a role ... given how wide open things are,” he said, adding that the Core Group’s statement is striking because it makes no reference to Joseph. “One has to wonder whether the developments in the investigation have anything to do with this. They’re all these puzzle pieces that are just changing moment to moment. Right now it seems very hard to figure out how to put these together.”Authorities in Haiti and Colombia say at least 18 suspects directly linked to the killing have been arrested, the majority of them former Colombian soldiers. At least three suspects were killed and police say they are looking for numerous others. Colombian officials have said that the majority of former soldiers were duped and did not know of the assassination plot.Police in Haiti on Sunday identified another suspect in the case: Pierre Joseph Ashkard. Online records show he is a Canadian-based businessman who runs a medical business in Texas with Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a Haitian physician and pastor whom local authorities recently arrested and consider a key suspect.A day after the killing, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price had said Joseph was the incumbent in the position and was serving as acting prime minister before the assassination: “We continue to work with Claude Joseph as such,” he said.On July 11, a delegation of representatives from various U.S. agencies traveled to Haiti to review critical infrastructure, talk with Haitian National Police and meet with Joseph, Henry and Haitian Senate President Joseph Lambert in a joint meeting.The deepening political turmoil has prompted dozens of Haitians to visit the U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince in recent days to seek a visa or political asylum.“We can’t stay anymore in the country,” said Jim Kenneth, a 19-year-old who would like to study medicine in the U.S. “We feel very insecure.”"
Democrats launch immigration reform Hail Mary,-3.67,44.33,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/15/immigration-backdoor-499778,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,www.politico.com,"Exhausted by years of sputtering immigration talks with Republicans, Democrats plan to try their luck with the Senate’s byzantine rulebook instead.Top Democrats, with the support of the White House, are planning to tuck a handful of immigration measures into their forthcoming $3.5 trillion spending bill. The tactic — which just months ago seemed like a long shot even to liberals — is now widely seen as President Joe Biden’s best shot at confronting one of Washington’s policy leviathans and delivering on a decades-long party promise.“It’s very, very difficult to get Republicans right now. Even those who were around showing leadership in 2013 are very hesitant to step up,” said Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the No. 4 Democratic leader. “Unfortunately, in the world we are in, with Sen. McConnell trying to slow down and stop everything, this is our best option.”Taking that backdoor approach to immigration, which wouldn’t require a single GOP vote, could cast a chill over any future attempts at bipartisan reform. But those bipartisan talks have stalled out in the Senate after nearly a dozen meetings, and Democrats have perhaps their only opportunity at going around Republicans on the issue.Though a long way short of a comprehensive overhaul, Congress’s fiercest immigration advocates are embracing it.“We have had an every-which-way approach to immigration reform,” said Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.), who leads the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and began pushing for the idea in January. “This is currently our best effort.”Some Democrats are more blunt in private, saying they believe the current strategy is their only chance to enact meaningful immigration changes this Congress. But there’s no guarantee it will work, and there’s some skepticism in the Senate about what can actually be done.The plan, still in the draft stage, would create a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented groups, such as Dreamers who were brought to the U.S. as children and farmworkers already living here. Many Democrats, including the Hispanic Caucus, are also pushing for “essential workers,” including health workers during the pandemic, to receive green cards under the bill.Success is still far from certain: Democrats don’t know whether the measure can survive the Senate’s obscure budget rules that would allow the bill to pass without GOP support. Democrats say they will go back and forth with the Senate parliamentarian, its nonpartisan rules referee, to push the breadth of immigration reform as far as it will go.The parliamentarian vets whether provisions of a bill passed using the legislative power known as budget reconciliation can evade a GOP filibuster and pass with a simple majority. While immigration provisions have survived past parliamentary scrutiny, they did so while commanding significant bipartisan support. This will be different, with a strong partisan challenge from Senate Republicans. (The current parliamentarian,a former immigration lawyer, stripped out Democrats’ minimum wage hike in a coronavirus aid bill earlier this year.)Already, Senate Republicans’ campaign arm is set to hammer Democrats if they go along with seeking a path to citizenship. And the Senate GOP is vowing to adamantly contest the tactic.“It’s something that we would challenge,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who has been involved in the bipartisan talks. “There’s a legitimate question to be asked about whether it’s eligible for reconciliation.”A powerful coalition of House Democrats has recently backed the gambit of tackling immigration through the budget, including leaders of the Progressive Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus and the Black Caucus. In the Senate, Majority Whip Dick Durbin, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are among the strongest proponents.Durbin confirmed this week that the party aims to put citizenship for some immigrants into the sprawling spending bill but cautioned that the “decision has not been made” concerning how many immigrants who fall under the Dreamers, farm workers and essential workers designations would get a pathway to citizenship.While Democratic leaders haven’t revealed details about their precise plans, several lawmakers said the party will take a trial-and-error approach. One Democratic lawmaker involved said negotiators are still looking at which mix of policy changes would raise enough money to pay for other unrelated priorities in the sprawling spending package.“I’m pretty confident,” Ruiz said, citing several studies about the policy’s economic impact, but he stressed that the goal was a measured approach that can satisfy the Senate budget rules. “We will be flexible and continue to push throughout the entire process and get as far as we can get.”So far, the idea is attracting little resistance from Democrats, even with their threadbare margins in both chambers. House Democrats, which have struggled on broader immigration bills, have already unanimously backed a pathway to citizenship for those Dreamers, farmworkers and immigrants previously granted Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS. Another option is extending a path to citizenship for all TPS recipients.But several Democrats caution that it will be trickier to reach consensus on the other group: “essential workers,” a label already spurring complex discussions about which employees count. One bill from Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) would open the door to citizenship for more than 5 million front-line workers across nearly 20 sectors, including janitors, nurses and farmworkers.The bipartisan Senate group is “still at it, but if that doesn’t work then I think there is a strong demand by several of us to see immigration in reconciliation,” Menendez said.Democrats argue there’s another reason to be more optimistic: This Congress wouldn’t be the first time lawmakers have tacked on immigration to a budget bill. Several lawmakers have pointed to a massive GOP-led bill in 2005 that included a measure to address a backlog of immigrant visas — which was allowed under the same arcane budget process but had much broader support from both parties.“I do think the precedent is one thing we can look at to feel good,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Jayapal, along with other progressive leaders, recently met with Schumer, Durbin and Menendez to help prep their party’s case on the issue.Jayapal and others also argue that the Congressional Budget Office itself has shown thatmany of their preferred immigration changeswill have a measurable impact on the budget.But trying to add immigration to their budget bill is a big political risk for Democrats, who months ago watched their minimum wage hike fall to a rules judgment in the Senate. This time around lawmakers and advocates said they are taking a gentler lobbying approach, making sure not to look as if they are personally attacking the parliamentarian as they push for immigration reform to be included.The outside pressure is undoubtedly high. Immigrant advocates argued this week that if Democrats do not succeed in passing a pathway to citizenship this year, they cannot depend on key Latino constituencies to turn out in 2022.Sen. Mark Kelly’s (D-Ariz.) “reelection depends on” delivering a pathway to citizenship, said Lorella Praeli, co-president of Community Change Action, a progressive grassroots group.Many young Latino voters who supported Democrats in high numbers in 2020 have undocumented family members, said Praeli, warning that “they have been hearing, ‘We’re going to get it done, you just got to vote for us!’ cycle after cycle. ... And so at some point, that argument loses its potency.”Kelly said on Thursday that the Senate needs to support young immigrants and farm workers but that he’d need to “look at the details” of whatever is proposed.Heather Caygle and Anthony Adragna contributed."
House Republicans close money gap with majority at stake,0.0,39.0,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/16/house-republicans-close-money-gap-499902,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,www.politico.com,"House Republicans spent the last four years drowning under an avalanche of Democratic campaign cash. Now they’re staging a fundraising comeback — just in time for a run at the majority.Over the past three months, GOP incumbents have largely matched Democrats in the money race. The winning formula: a full embrace of digital fundraising, the maturation of their fledgling WinRed platform and donor optimism after a successful showing down-ballot in 2020. All that combined has allowed them to begin erasing the massive financial advantage that Democrats have enjoyed since the rise of former President Donald Trump.At least 49 Democrats and 43 Republicans each raised more than $500,000 in the second quarter of 2021 — a fairly even split — according to a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance reports filed this week. That’s a stark contrast with the second quarter of 2019, when roughly 50 Democratic candidates cleared that threshold, but only some 30 Republicans reached that mark.“Our leaders are setting records. And our members — especially these freshmen — you’ve got these $500,000 to $1 million reports that are coming out just a couple years after a big report for Republicans was typically around $250,000,” said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee.The GOP had some prolific fundraisers last quarter: Reps. Young Kim (R-Calif.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) both cleared $1 million. Reps. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa) raised over $850,000. All but Fitzpatrick are members of the 2020 freshman class.To be sure, House Democrats are still posting massive quarterly totals. And the redistricting process makes it more difficult to know which incumbents will need large war chests. But Republicans are seeing a new groundswell of financial support in the off-year and, as Democrats realized in 2018, that’s often one of the earliest signs of base enthusiasm and a successful drive for the majority.“In 2018 we put a significant emphasis on candidate development, candidate money and giving candidates the ability to go out and tell their stories,” said Dan Sena, the former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “It was a central reason we were able to win back the House.”“What should be of note to Democratic strategists and the Democratic campaigns going forward is that it now seems the Republicans are doing the same thing,” Sena added.Another sign of GOP momentum: The National Republican Congressional Committee has lapped the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in fundraising, outraising the DCCC by $8 million in the first six months of 2021. At this point the 2020 cycle, House Democrats had outraised Republicans by over $17 million.The NRCC credits that success, in part, to their painstaking and long-running efforts to build a digital operation.In interviews, Emmer often recalls a moment in early 2019, when a top digital strategist at the committee wrote him a memo, urging a heavy investment in small-dollar fundraising. That strategist, Lyman Munschauer, predicted the NRCC would suffer a net loss on that investment of 3 to 5 percent after one year before reaping gains.But the benefits came even more quickly: The NRCC began making money within a year, and it has continued to flow in.In the second quarter of 2019, the NRCC raised $3.3 million online. Over the same period this year, it raised more than $14.1 million.“This time, we’re being even more aggressive,” Emmer said. “Yes, that investment is paying off.”Meanwhile, WinRed, the GOP online fundraising platform created as a counter to the Democrats’ ActBlue, has taken off at a similar clip, bringing in $2.3 billion since its created in 2019.“Your average Democrat who runs is now all about digital money,” said WinRed president Gerrit Lansing, noting ActBlue was founded in 2004. “We’re just having to complete that 15-year cultural shift and just condense it down into a couple cycles to try to catch up.”For the GOP, this windfall comes at a crucial moment. When corporate PACs announced they would scale back their donations after the Jan. 6 insurrection, there was some concern that would disproportionately impact Republicans, who sometimes rely more heavily on those gifts.“We’re all online-based now,” Lansing said of his party. The shift happened years ago, but the “fruits of that labor are really coming to fruition now. And it just so happened to coincide with this huge corporate PAC sort-of cage-rattling situation. So it’s ironic.”Perhaps more importantly, WinRed has helped Republicans redirect the wealth toward new candidates, particularly downballot. Of the $131 million raised on the platform in the second quarter, almost 40 percent of that came from first-time donors to a single campaign.Some of the party’s most adept fundraisers are able to nudge their supporters toward other candidates. For example, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who has raised over $1 million every quarter since she shot to prominence during the first Trump impeachment trial, has shared 150,000 donors since the start of the 2020 cycle.All of this has spurred a digital-first mentality among Republicans that has long been prevalent in the Democratic political ecosystem, which some in the GOP attribute to their current freshman class, which is younger, more tech-savvy and less accustomed to in-person fundraising than longer-term incumbents.“We started building our digital program early,” said Hinson, who was a TV news anchor in Cedar Rapids before flipping a seat in 2020. “I do enjoy doing digital fundraising. I’m a direct-to-camera person.”Filming online ads has helped her connect with constituents and donors, Hinson said. “We use Facebook ads a lot for our digital fundraising, and we have great feedback from the comment sections of those ads.”And like the NRCC, GOP campaigns appear to be becoming more comfortable with the idea of spending money to make it. Hinson, along with some of the party’s biggest fundraisers like Kim, Steel and Mace, spent well over $300,000 last quarter — a higher sum than is typical a year-and-a-half before the election.All made significant investments in fundraising consulting, digital marketing and web ads, according to their FEC reports.Still, Democratic incumbents retain a significant cash-on-hand advantage, especially those like Reps. Josh Harder (D-Calif.), Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) and Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.), who did not face particularly competitive reelections in 2020 and have well over $4 million in the bank. Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) has a staggering $12.9 million stashed.And some operatives were privately relieved at the small hauls of some highly touted Republican challengers. GOP state Sen. Jen Kiggans of Virginia only raised $286,000 for her run against Rep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.). And Marine veteran Tyler Kistner raised just $279,000 for his rematch with Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) Though those challengers didn’t launch until mid-April, both incumbents raised well over twice as much.Yet some of the money has also begun to trickle down to GOP challengers. Republican Derrick Van Orden outraised incumbent Rep. Ron Kind in Wisconsin, $754,000 to $409,000.In the coming quarters, however, Republicans are facing an additional roadblock: enticing prospective challengers who are dragging their feet, waiting for the delayed redistricting process to start.“I hope more candidates jump in soon and not wait for new district lines,” said Dan Conston, the president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a top GOP super PAC. “Because that compressed calendar is going to present a significant challenge for them for online fundraising and for big-dollar fundraising.”"

"House sends shutdown patch, debt fix to Senate demise",-1.33,44.0,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/21/democrats-funding-shutdown-debt-limit-513407,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-21,www.politico.com,"The House passed a fiscal rescue package Tuesday night intended to prevent a government shutdown at month’s end and a U.S. debt default in the coming weeks — if only Senate Republicans would go along.Succeeding in a 220-211 vote, the stopgap funding bill now heads to the Senate, where GOP leaders say their ranks will sink the plan because it includes a waiver of the nation’s borrowing cap. If Senate Republicans stick to their threat, top Democrats will be forced to scrap the debt remedy or risk a federal funding lapse in less than 10 days.Unlinking the two issues would ease passage of the funding patch, but Democrats are so far unwilling toforfeit the leveragethat comes from tying a government shutdown to the economic fallout next month, as the Treasury Department nears its breaking point on the debt limit.In the Senate, the package “is going to go down like a fat guy on a seesaw,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) predicted this week.Kennedy and a few other GOP senators are likely to vote in favor of the bill. But the funding bundle needs support from at least 10 Republicans to make it through the upper chamber, and it’s expected to fall far short.Immediately following House passage, Senate Republican leaders rolled out an alternative spending patch without any waiver of the debt limit. That proposal from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) would provide disaster aid and Afghan assistance, just like Democrats’ plan, and extend government funding for the same duration.“Members on both sides of the aisle can support this measure, and I urge them to do so with haste,” Shelby said in a statement upon releasing the Republican alternative.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted on the floor Tuesday evening that Democrats and Republicans have consistently come together in years past to waive or raise the debt limit, voting to avoid default 25 times over the last three decades.“This has always been bipartisan,” Pelosi said. “Not everybody on either side of the aisle would vote for it, but nobody would let it fail.”Besides waiving the debt limit until late next year, the House-passed package would keep the government funded at current levels through Dec. 3, presenting a typical pre-holidays spending deadline. It also includes $28.6 billion in disaster aid — including for storm-battered red states — as well as $6.3 billion in funding for Afghan refugees.GOP senators are expected to block the bill with a legislative filibuster, preventing it from coming up for a final passage vote.Last month, all but four Senate Republicans signed a letter promising to oppose action to raise the debt ceiling. Those four were Kennedy, as well as Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelby of Alabama.Of those, Kennedy is the only GOP senator who has said definitely that he will back the short-term spending bill even if it includes debt limit suspension, citing the inclusion of disaster aid for his state. Shelby has said he would oppose the package, while Collins and Murkowski have not said how they will vote. Sen. Bill Cassidy, another Republican from the hurricane-battered state of Louisiana, is also undecided.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said this week that he is prepared to reject disaster relief and government funding while Democrats force a vote on the debt ceiling and pursue multitrillion-dollar spending plans without GOP votes. Tillis conceded, however, that some trillions of dollars in federal debt has been racked up on a bipartisan basis over coronavirus relief funding.“I think it’s valid to say that some of the debt ceiling would be associated with the Covid relief spending,” he said.The House vote came Tuesday night, after Democratic leaders yanked $1 billion for Israeli missile defense from the government funding package at the last minute amid objections from a group of House progressives.Instead, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday night that he plans to call for a vote later in the week on a bill to fully fund the Iron Dome system, which Israel views as critical for its protection from rocket attacks. “I was for that. I’m still for it, we ought to do it,” he said.“There is no interruption in funding for the Iron Dome,” Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said. “We are trying to make this seamless.”But the episode resurfaced the long-simmering internal tension among Democrats over supporting a longtime U.S. ally in the Middle East. And it comes as Republicans have already sought to portray the majority party as anti-Israel due to progressives’ long-standing skepticism of the U.S.-Israel security relationship.Two people familiar with the matter said that the group of objectors to the Iron Dome language included the Democrats who pushed earlier this year to cancel an arms sale to Israel amid its shooting war with Hamas militants in Gaza. The funding would have made good on a pledge by the Biden administration to help Israel replace hundreds of interceptors used to knock down rockets Hamas launched from Gaza in the spring.A number of moderate members tweeted their displeasure with leadership’s decision to punt the money to a year-end appropriations package, which isn’t guaranteed to materialize.“Iron Dome is a purely *defensive* system — it protects civilians when hundreds of rockets are shot at population centers,” tweeted Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.). “Whatever your views on the Israeli-Pal conflict, using a system that just saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives as a political chit is problematic.”Of the $6.3 billion in emergency aid for Afghan allies and partners that House Democrats want to provide, the Pentagon would receive more than $2 billion. About $1.7 billion would go to the Administration for Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services to provide emergency housing, English language classes, job training and more.More than $21 million would go to the CDC for medical support and screening for Afghan arrivals and refugees, while $193 million would be spent on Operation Allies Welcome, which is aimed at helping vulnerable Afghans resettle in the U.S.The short-term funding bill calls for an accounting of U.S. equipment in Afghanistan, including what was left behind in Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrew troops and effectively ceded the country to Taliban control.The stopgap doesn’t provide a short-term extension for certain transportation programs, which are set to expire along with government funding on Sept. 30. An extension likely won’t be necessary if House Democratic leaders stick to their pledge to pass the Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill by Sept. 27, although timing is now in flux as progressives push for action on Biden’s massive social spending bill.Democrats are proposing a debt limit suspension that would last through Dec. 16, 2022. Failure to pass such a measure before the Treasury Department runs out of money — as soon as next month — would lead to “economic catastrophe,” DeLauro said.Indeed, a failure of Congress to address the limit on how much money the government can borrow would have significant consequences, roiling financial markets, tanking the government’s credit rating and raising interest rates.Both parties have backed a bipartisan debt ceiling suspension in recent years, including in August 2019, when the Trump administration struck a deal with congressional leaders to waive the borrowing limit for two years.Connor O’Brien, Tanya Snyder, Burgess Everett, Nicholas Wu and Heather Caygle contributed to this report."
Jenner campaign in debt as California recall hits homestretch,-7.0,42.67,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/08/02/jenner-campaign-in-debt-as-california-recall-hits-homestretch-9426996,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-02,www.politico.com,"OAKLAND — Caitlyn Jenner’s gubernatorial campaign has piled up debt, filings show, as the celebrity and former Olympian struggles to make headway in California’s recall race.From the launch of Jenner’s candidacy through the end of July, the campaign raised about $747,000 and spent some $910,000, leaving her campaign with about $156,000 in unpaid bills and roughly $21,000 on hand for the race’s critical final stretch.More than a quarter of that money has flowed to fundraising platform WinRed and to enlist the services of former Trump campaign hand Brad Parscale and former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer.Jenner’s fundraising lags behindformer San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and radio host Larry Elder. All of the replacement candidates are well behind Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has raised more than $40 million to fight the recall and can collect donations without contribution limits.More details:Jenner’s campaign has paid about $182,000 to WinRed, a fundraising platform that former President Donald Trump used and remains popular among conservative candidates. Like Trump, Jenner’s campaign augmented its haul through WinRed byauto-checking a box that signs supporters up for recurring donations.That cut would be high for contributions, but Jenner is alsousing WinRed to sell merchandise, from T-shirts to dog leashes.The campaign has sent about $67,000 to Parscale Strategy, LLC, the firm run by former Trump campaign strategist Parscale. It spent $25,000 on Fleischer’s media strategy company Ari Fleischer Communications.Among Parscale Strategy’s reported spending was a $1,800 “staff meeting” at Nobu, a fancy Malibu restaurant, and $1,300 for a limousine service that ferried Jenner to Los Angeles meetings.Jenner response:Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said Monday the campaign has a “robust house file” of donors and supporters and vowed that “the campaign will be fully funded to enter the final stretch of the election with the necessary resources to end Gavin Newsom’s time as governor.”Cheung added that “Caitlyn has widespread name recognition, to the tune of 99%, while other candidates need to spend large amounts of money to increase their name identification.”The bigger picture:While Jenner burst into the race with ample name recognition and has drawn national media coverage, she hasn’t yet been able to translate attention into political momentum. Polls have consistently shown the political neophyte in the single digits, behind other Republican candidates.ABerkeley Institute of Governmental Studies/Los Angeles Times polllast week showed Jenner tied for fifth place with 3 percent support.A lack of financial resources means Jenner has a steeper mountain to climb. It costs millions of dollars to run a statewide campaign that spans California’s media markets. And time is running out: Ballots will hit the mail in mid-August ahead of a September 14 vote.Carla Marinucci contributed to this report."
Opinion | The Justice Department Is Turning a Blind Eye to White-Collar Crime,-7.33,36.67,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/07/23/justice-department-financial-crime-prosecution-500650,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.politico.com,"Progressives were thrilled this week when President Joe Biden picked Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Along withother recent nominations, the choice of someonewhohas foughtGoogle, Apple and Amazon in the courts on antitrust issues shows that the administration is interested in pushing back on the runaway power of Big Tech.But antitrust is just one part of the much broader landscape of corporate and white-collar law enforcement. And in almost every other respect, after four years of the Trump administration rolling back scrutiny on everything from consumer fraud to corporate tax evasion, there is little indication that Merrick Garland’s Justice Department is moving to put teeth back into Washington’s approach. Indeed, six months into Biden’s presidency, the DOJ seems to be paying virtually no attention to one of our country’s most pressing and persistent law enforcement problems.Data fromacross thefederalgovernmentindicated that financial fraud and corporate misconduct were at all-time highs when Biden took office, and since then,the FBI,the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauandthe Federal Trade Commissionall released data that showed things had gotten only worse in areas of misconduct under their respective purviews.Underthe Trump administration, the number of white-collar criminal prosecutions — which had already been steadily declining — repeatedly hitall-time lows, according to data maintained by Syracuse University that covers everything from complex securities and tax fraud cases to crude but effective consumer fraud schemes. There was a further and significant dip during the pandemic and although there has been an uptick as the country has slowly returned to normalcy, we arestill belowthe average, record-low pre-pandemic level.Prosecutions have not just been fewer but also less successful: The Wall Street Journal recently produced adata analysisconfirmingwhatseemedapparentanecdotally— that the DOJ has been losing a disproportionate number of its highest-profile white-collar criminal cases since the Obama administration.It is difficult to quantify the exact impact of these trends. By someestimates, white-collar crime costs Americans $300 billion to $800 billion per year. Although that wide an estimate merits some skepticism, the uncertainty is due in part to the fact that the federal government does not collect data on the national prevalence of financial crime in the way that it does forother crimes. This is to say nothing of the personal impact on the millions of people who are victimized every year by financial fraud — anotoriouslyunderreportedcrime because people are embarrassed to admit they have been victimized and are skeptical the government will actually do anything to help them, which, given the enforcement trends, is a depressingly rational concern.Aslewofacademicsover the past year has raised increasingly loud alarms about this state of affairs and have offered a range of proposals to counter these trends, but there is no indication the Biden administration or anyone in a leadership position in the Justice Department has taken any interest outside of the antitrust context.At the moment, like most ofthe department’s work, its efforts in this area are largely being run by holdover, acting and career officials, but a new president and attorney general can signal their law enforcement priorities when they appoint new and high-profile leaders — in much the way that Biden followed through on hiscampaignpromisesto prioritize civil rights enforcement and policing reform when he nominatedVanita GuptaandKristen Clarketo senior positions in the department. The administration’s commitment to those areas and to antitrust policy is clear, but at the moment, Biden has not nominated anyone to run the DOJ’sTax Divisionor a single new prosecutor at the U.S. attorney level — including in the jurisdictions where a substantial amount of the country’s most important white-collar criminal work takes place (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C.).The nominee for the head of the Criminal Division, which oversees the D.C.-based white-collar enforcement efforts, wasrecently confirmed, but neither he nor the Biden administration’schosen interim headof the division have shown any meaningful interest in this area — through plaintiff-side litigation like the work Kanter, Gupta and Clarke did in their areas of expertise, or in public speaking or writing —much less offered an agenda of any sort. The same is true for the people whose names have been floated in the press as likely nominees for the major U.S. Attorneys’ offices.The pandemic has made matters even more pressing. Major areas of pandemic-related fraud — in particular,consumer fraudandunemployment fraud— were largely ignored by the Trump DOJ, even though these wereobviousproblemsin real time. The Biden DOJ itself seems to be struggling to wrap its head around the issue, having issued a surreal, back-pattingnews releaseon pandemic fraud enforcement in March, only to set upa task forceon pandemic fraud months later; the belated change in posture was welcome notwithstanding the DOJ’s failure to provide any insight into what had changed about its assessment in the interim. More broadly under the Trump DOJ, everything from the department’s approach tocorporatecriminalinvestigations to specificenforcementinitiativesgrew increasingly disconnected from pressing, real-world problems, and there is no sign so far that the Biden DOJ will prioritize reversing that trend.There is no shortage of recommendations, as Iandothershavewritten. Among other things, the department should seek additional funding for this work, initiate a uniform federal effort to collect data on the national prevalence of financial crime, direct U.S. Attorneys’ offices to make white-collar crime a key priority for enforcement, revisit its corporate criminal enforcement guidelines, and work to improve stateside coordination between the DOJ and our regulatory agencies as well as global coordination between the department and its international law enforcement partners.Needless to say, this is all much easier said than done, but before any of it could possibly happen, the Biden-Garland DOJ must actually take a concerted interest in the area and back it up with the commitment of high-level personnel and a considerable amount of time and energy. Every day that this does not happen, Americans are paying the price."

House Freedom Caucus asks McCarthy to try to remove Pelosi as speaker,-3.0,44.67,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/23/house-freedom-caucus-mccarthy-remove-pelosi-500647,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.politico.com,"The conservative House Freedom Caucus is urging Kevin McCarthy to try to boot Nancy Pelosi from her position as speaker, a sign of further escalating tensions after the California Democrat vetoed two of the House Minority Leader’s GOP picks from the Jan. 6 select committee.In a letter Friday, the far-right group asked McCarthy to file and bring up a privileged motion by July 31 “to vacate the chair and end Nancy Pelosi’s authoritarian reign as Speaker of the House.”“Speaker Pelosi’s tenure is destroying the House of Representatives and our ability to faithfully represent the people we are here to serve,” they write. “Republicans, under your leadership, must show the American people that we will act to protect our ability to represent their interests.”The motion is all but guaranteed to fail in the Democratic House, but it signals a stewing anger on the right towards the speaker. The Freedom Caucus’ letter indicates that McCarthy would need to initiate the motion, and if he were to do so, it would further escalate partisan acrimony in the House that has remained high, and occasionally gotten personal, since Jan. 6.They argue that Pelosi’s decision to reject Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) from the panel was “intolerable.” Pelosi, meanwhile, says she made the right call blocking the two Trump allies because of their “antics” in the months following the deadly insurrection.Banks and Jordan “made statements and took actions that just would have been ridiculous to put them on a committee seeking the truth,” Pelosi told reporters.A spokesperson for Pelosi did not immediately respond to request for comment.The group, which signed the letter simply as “House Freedom Caucus,” cited a series of other grievances against Pelosi that they argue represent “unconstitutional changes,” such as proxy voting, “insulting security measures like metal detectors,” and her decision to kick a member of the minority — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) — off her committees over dangerous conspiracy remarks and social media posts she made before serving in Congress.A spokesperson for McCarthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Heather Caygle contributed reporting."
Biden yokes Youngkin to Trump at McAuliffe campaign stop,-1.33,43.33,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/23/biden-youngkin-trump-mcauliffe-campaign-500713,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.politico.com,"For six months, Joe Biden managed to mostly ignore his predecessor, viewing Donald Trump’s lies and conspiracies as a distraction. But returning to the campaign trail Friday in Northern Virginia, the president rolled Trump into his emerging pitch for down-ballot Democrats.“I ran against Donald Trump, and so is Terry,” Biden said at a rally for former Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s comeback bid, joining in comparing his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, to the former president. “I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia, and so will Terry.”Biden, continuing his riff, suggested Youngkin was “an acolyte for Donald Trump — for real.”Biden also alluded to Trump’s embrace of the Jan. 6 insurrection crowd, adding, “I was told there were a lot of peaceful, wonderful people?”Biden’s broader remarks focused on his administration’s work to end the pandemic and turn around the economy, pass trillions of dollars in infrastructure and social programs like the child tax credit, reduce drug prices and raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for it.But his centering of Trump in the off-year Virginia race offered a preview for how he and leading Democrats plan to approach the long shadow Trump has cast over Republicans. In Virginia, Trump has endorsed Youngkin on three separate occasions, and Democrats are crossing their fingers that Biden’s appearance would draw Trump to holding an event for the GOP nominee.“As Democrats, we have to show we do understand, and we’re delivering for them, and we’re keeping our promises,” he continued. “We just have to keep making the case, just as the Republican Party today offers nothing but fears and lies and broken promises.”The rally, before a mostly maskless crowd of nearly 3,000 people in Arlington, comes just over 100 days before the election in Virginia, which will pit McAuliffe in his comeback bid against Youngkin, a first-time candidate and former Carlyle Group executive.Biden’s speech opened with a focus on the pandemic and the rising coronavirus cases across the country. “What we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” he said, saying “a lot of our conservative friends” had “seen the Lord” on embracing vaccinations. He cited Alabama GOP Gov. Kay Ivey’sfrustration with “unvaccinated folks” in her state.The gubernatorial election in the commonwealth has nearly always cut against the party in power. For the last 40 years, just one candidate won the governorship while his party controlled the White House: McAuliffe, who secured a narrow victory in 2013.“This off-year election, the country’s looking,” Biden said.Biden and his aides are eager to use the race to show that the president will becommitted to party building, hoping to avert down-ballot wipeouts. The rally came on the heels of the Democratic National Committee announcing it would spend at least $5 million in Virginia ahead of the election, which the party called its “biggest investment in the commonwealth in history.”Public polling in the race has been sparse, but it is expected to be closer than Biden’s 10-point victory over Trump — and outgoing Gov. Ralph Northam’s runaway win in 2017 — with McAuliffe as a slight favorite.And publicly, McAuliffe and his team have maintained this race is neck and neck. “I need your help,” he told the crowd. “I need you to work every single day and night. Sleep is way overrated.”McAuliffe and other Virginia Democrats have also sought to tie Youngkin to Trump.“Why is it that Glenn Youngkin and Donald Trump are so close?” McAuliffe said at the rally.Youngkin’s camp insists that McAuliffe is the one with Trump ties. A truck with a digital billboard playing anad from the campaignhighlighting that Trump has donated to McAuliffe’s previous campaign circled the rally venue.“It’s totally dishonest for Terry McAuliffe to use President Trump’s endorsement to smear Glenn Youngkin, when McAuliffe is actually friends with Trump and took thousands of dollars from Trump to fund his campaign,” Youngkin spokesperson Matt Wolking said, invoking the Clintons as well.McAuliffe’s message also focused heavily on the economy during his tenure in Richmond. He, too, praised the coronavirus recovery package. “The American Rescue Plan has injected new life into our economy,’ McAuliffe said.The rally also comes a day after McAuliffe released his first general election TV ad. AdImpact, an ad tracking firm, traced at least $525,000 in TV ad spending from McAuliffe that started on Thursday and runs through next Wednesday. In the ad, McAuliffe calls Youngkin “a loyalist to Donald Trump.”Youngkin, meanwhile, has been on the air nearly uninterrupted since the early June Democratic primary — and uncontested until this week."
Senate Democrats defied Biden in their vote to boost Pentagon spending. And it wasn't even close,-0.33,43.67,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/23/senate-democrats-boost-pentagon-spending-500705,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.politico.com,"The Senate Armed Services Committee’s surprise decision to endorse a $25 billion increase to the Pentagon’s budget this week was an utter blowout — and the clearest sign yet that Democrats are more than willing to back sizable increases to President Joe Biden’s military spending plan.The committee adopted a proposal to boost the budget in a whopping 25 to 1 vote Wednesday during a closed door markup of its version of annual defense policy legislation, according to four Senate aides with knowledge of the deliberations.The vote, which boosted the recommended Pentagon budget from $715 billion to over $740 billion, aligned Republican defense hawks with Democrats from across the political spectrum in a bipartisan rebuke of the White House’s proposal. The budget increase was offered by the panel’s top Republican, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma.Only progressive Democrat Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) opposed the effort, according to a pair of aides. Warren is a vocal advocate for cutting defense spending from its historically high levels and has often voted against the policy bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act.The dozen Democrats backing the defense spending spike included Armed Services Chair Jack Reed of Rhode Island, centrists such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Mark Kelly of Arizona and progressive Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.Though some Democrats have appeared amenable to some sort of budget increase in recent weeks, their near-unity on the issue was unexpected and upends an already tumultuous partisan debate over federal spending that already includes multi-trillion talks over infrastructure spending and the debt limit.Still, some insiders saw a defense budget hike as a inevitable with Democrats needing Republican votes to pass defense legislation in both the House and Senate. A $25 billion increase, they note, pales in comparison to Democrats’ high-priority spending plans for infrastructure and other domestic priorities.The decision puts pressure on the Democratic-led House Armed Services Committee to endorse a similar spending hike in its version of the NDAA. That also goes for the Senate Appropriations Committee, which, unlike the Armed Services committees, actually allocates funding. A wider deal on spending legislation, not just the NDAA, is needed for a budget increase to become a reality.Boosting the defense budget was largely a GOP talking point up to this week. Republicans have hammered Biden’s $715 billion defense request as something that, although it is above the current year’s level, wouldn’t keep up with the expected rate of inflation. Instead, GOP lawmakers have called for a 3 to 5 percent increase above inflation, a range the bill achieved with this week’s increase.Reed, for his part, had not said what budget topline his bill would endorse. His office did not respond to a request for comment.Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, another senior Armed Services Democrat who represents a military and shipbuilding heavy state, argued in hearings that the Pentagon would still have more buying power under the administration’s proposed level because Biden halted the Trump administration’s effort to shunt billions from military construction projects toward a border wall.Kelly, a former naval aviator and astronaut who is up for reelection in 2022, said the budget buildup was needed to meet military requirements that didn’t make the spending request.“This bipartisan increase in defense spending was necessary to support a number of unfunded requirements from the military branches and combatant commanders critical to getting our servicemembers the tools, training, and resources they need,” Kelly said in a statement. “It also funds the development of new technologies to maintain our competitive edge, while also addressing a broader scope of national security priorities.”On Thursday, senators from both parties touted the investments the bill makes in weapons programs and installations in their states. The final bill, which authorizes $778 billion in total for national defense programs and boosts funding for major weapons such as the F-35 fighter and funds an extra Navy destroyer, resembles previous bills approved by a Republican-led committee.While Democrats’ move to override Biden’s military blueprint made waves in the nation’s capital, the Senate’s makeup likely made the budget boost a matter of when, not if.Despite being in the minority, Republicans have considerable leverage. With the Senate split 50-50 between the two parties and committees equally divided, Democrats need GOP votes to advance legislation on the floor. That means Republicans can extract concessions on must-pass bills such as the NDAA.“This is precisely the midpoint of what we’ve been suggesting is possible,” Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst with Cowen, said in a note to investors Thursday. “We think it reflects the political reality of passing appropriations with bipartisan support this year.”Higher defense spending is also a relatively small concession for Democrats compared to the trillions in spending advocated by Biden and congressional Democrats — including coronavirus relief, infrastructure and jobs legislation and spending hikes for domestic federal agencies.“Biden’s budget is enormous everywhere,” said one defense lobbyist who asked not to be named. “So are you going to fight over $25 billion for defense? It’s nothing. It’s a rounding error at this point.”Arnold Punaro, a former staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the increase was “no surprise to me.” Lawmakers often close ranks to override large swaths of an administration’s budget regardless of party, he said.“Congress changes the budget all the time,” Punaro said. “We were adding money to the defense budget when Carter was president and you had 65 Democratic senators.”Still, the vote is a blow for progressive Democrats who saw Biden’s presidency and Democratic majorities in both chambers as an opportunity to curb military spending that skyrocketed under former President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.“One has to wonder what is even the point of a Senate Democratic majority if they’re going to not only continue Trump policies but work with Senate Republicans to undermine [Biden’s] priorities,” Stephen Miles, executive director of Win Without War, wrote on Twitter. “Utterly pathetic.”"
Californians tired of doing their part during triple-digit heat,2.0,43.0,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/07/23/california-show-conservation-fatigue-in-the-face-of-power-cut-threat-1388946,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.politico.com,"SACRAMENTO — Californians are tired of turning off their appliances in the summer heat.For years, state officials have counted on residents to rescue the electric grid from collapse by sparing their energy use on the most blistering of days. But during a brutal July heat wave, Californians largely ignored repeat calls for conservation.Many things go wrong for the system when temperatures soar, heightening the risk of rolling blackouts in the weeks before Gov. Gavin Newsom’s September recall election. And state officials,under crushing pressure to keep the lights onin the meantime, now worry they have lost a key arrow in their quiver as heat waves continue to hammer Western states.“I think we’re not taking it that seriously,” said Severin Borenstein, a member of the California grid operator’s board of governors. “This is not a mechanism that we can rely on as a primary mechanism for dealing with the bad situation that we’re in.”California’s awkward transition to renewable energy points to the kinds of challenges that could complicate President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate agenda. As states add more solar energy, for example, they rely more heavily on fossil fuels in the evening after the sun sets and demand comes back on the system.Until just recently, the state had success with its “Flex Alert” system, which asks residents on extremely hot days to stop running appliances and crank up their thermostats. Conservation helped spare the grid during an especially tough stretch last Labor Day weekend, along with the days after two nights of rolling blackouts last August. Demand dropped to such a low level on Aug. 17 that it had the same effect as taking more than 3.7 million homes offline.But there is a growing sense that the state is overusing Flex Alert, asking too frequently — and on days when easing air conditioner usage is most uncomfortable. The tool was once used sparingly, just 21 times between 2009 and 2019, but state officials called 10 alerts last year alone, and five so far this summer.By July, residents appeared to show signs of fatigue. Demand did not drop at all on July 9 or 10, despite two Flex Alerts, though it did dip on July 12, when temperatures were slightly cooler.California Independent System Operator CEO Elliot Mainzer put it politely to reporters when expressing his disappointment with the negligible conservation July 9. “I think that we are going to need more response than we saw last night,” Mainzer said the following day.State officials are looking hard at behavioral patterns, incentives and messaging — and “the appropriate pairing of economic signals and economic benefits,” Mainzer said in an interview this month, when asked what can be done to increase conservation.That’s a wonky way of saying that residents might have to be paid to reduce their energy usage.A 2018 study in the American Economic Journal found that extending payments to the residential sector is more effective at achieving conservation than “moral suasion.” One of the researchers, University of Chicago public policy professor Koichiro Ito, described the psychological concept of habituation, when there is less response to repeated stimuli — such as calls for conservation — over time.Earlier this month, New York City sent a rare emergency alert to all residents asking for conservation, which did deliver. But it might not be as effective again next time, Ito said.Some companies like OhmConnect are testing alternatives. The Oakland-based firm is giving out a million free smart thermostats that it can remotely control during Flex Alert days to set at higher temperatures. Customers are paid for their conservation, up to $450 annually, from funds that the company receives from California’s grid operator for converting their demand into what’s known as a virtual power plant.“I think we’ve reached the end of people’s casual ability or willingness to just help,” CEO Cisco DeVries said.If those incentives aren’t enough, higher electricity prices during heat waves will be necessary, said Stanford University law professor Michael Wara, who directs the Climate and Energy Policy Program at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.Higher prices would likely spark an outcry, as it did in Texas when customers received four- and five-figure energy bills after a winter storm earlier this year. The Lone Star State, however, has a largely unregulated system that lacks California’s consumer protections and market designs.But those discussions are for future years. In the coming months, the state is likely to find itself, yet again, at the mercy of its residents. “We are where we are for this summer, and we are going to use [Flex Alerts] and hope that people will help out,” Borenstein said. “I’ve been beating this drum for 20 years.”Two decades ago, Borenstein testified at the California State Senate after the Enron-caused electricity crisis that led to the recall of former Gov. Gray Davis. Wearing a short-sleeved shirt with no tie, the University of California, Berkeley professor recounted, he stressed the importance of lighter dress and energy conservation.This month, Borenstein and his colleagues did the same thing during the California grid operator’s board meeting — this time, in Hawaiian shirts. “By changing air conditioning settings substantially and declaring a Hawaiian shirt summer,” he said, “we hope you’ll join us.”"
Virus resurgence menaces economy just as rescue programs unravel,0.0,45.33,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/24/covid-delta-economy-benefits-evictions-expiration-500701,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.politico.com,"The resurgence of the coronavirus is threatening to undercut the U.S. economic recovery and upend Americans’ plans to return to work just as the sweeping social safety net that Congress built during the pandemic is unraveling.That one-two punch — a new wave of cases followed by the looming expiration of enhanced jobless benefits, a ban on evictions and other rescue programs — is sparking concern among lawmakers and economists who say that while widespread business shutdowns are unlikely, renewed fears of the virus alone can slow the economy just as it’s getting back on track.That could dampen hiring and keep some workers on the sidelines of the job market — stalling or even reversing the labor recovery, the centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda. New unemployment claims jumped last week to 419,000, well above expectations and the highest since mid-May, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.Biden — whoseGallup approval ratingdropped to 50 percent this week, its lowest yet — is already drawing attacks from Republicans over the issue. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top GOP tax writer in Congress, said the president has focused too much on pushing his “$4 trillion spending binge” and not enough on the virus.Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is close to the current White House economic team, said the West Wing is very aware of the risks to the economy from the spike in Covid cases.“Any problem that has a 5 to 10 percent chance to derail the economic recovery you are looking at very closely and are worried about,” Furman said.He said that concern isn’t especially high, however, because even under “the most plausible worst-case scenario,” the risk is that the Delta variant “takes what was a very fast recovery and turns it into just a fast recovery.”Another person familiar with the economic team’s discussions confirmed that the White House is paying close attention but doesn’t consider the virus a significant threat. Biden has been calling on Americans to get vaccinated, mainly out of concern for people’s safety but also with an eye out for the economy, the person said.Biden, speaking on Monday after the stock market tumbled as investors braced for a potential rebound of the virus, said, “We can’t let up, especially because of the Delta variant, which is more transmissible and more dangerous.”Coronavirus cases have been rising nationwide and are back to their highest level since early May as the highly contagious variant spreads across the country. The sharp uptick has reignited fears of the pandemic, particularly as cases rise among young children who are unable to get a vaccine and even among those who have been fully vaccinated.“If people don’t feel safe, they’re going to close schools. If people don’t feel safe, they’re not going to go back to work,” said Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist. “The recovery — it’s going, but it’s still vulnerable.”While it’s far too early to gauge the fallout from the increase in cases, any Delta-driven jobs slowdown is likely to be most pronounced in blue states, where higher percentages of residents are vaccinated but where people are also less willing to take risks as coronavirus cases rise. ACBS News poll this weekshowed that nearly 3 in 4 fully vaccinated Americans are worried about the Delta variant, compared to less than half of those who are not fully vaccinated or who have not received any shots at all.Those same Democratic-led states also have the most jobs left to recover since they had stricter shutdown orders in place initially and then reopened more slowly. Roughly 8 million of the 10 million jobs that are still missing in the economy from before the pandemic are in blue states, said Arindrajit Dube, a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.The slowdown in jobs growth, then, is likely to be most acute in the states where the need is greatest. And given how much economic activity those states generate, the ripple effects on the macroeconomy will be more severe.“If you have highly populous parts of the country who have taken Covid seriously the entire time, and those people get afraid, then you have at least a noticeable slowing in the recovery,” said Sahm, now a senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute.If Delta continues to spread, the economic shock would come as huge swaths of Americans are still struggling to get back on their feet.While wages have been rising, particularly for low-income workers in leisure and hospitality, those gains have been outpaced by inflation. And more than 1 in 3 American adults have less in emergency savings now than before the pandemic, despite the more than $5 trillion Congress has pumped into the economy since March 2020 in stimulus and relief funds, according to a Bankrate.com survey released on Wednesday.“That really underscores how much we need to restore jobs,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “All of those issues that really plague low-income households have not gone away. We bought some time, but the clock is expiring.”The end of various social safety net programs will affect tens of millions of Americans.Survey data from the Census Bureaushows 3.6 million households say they are somewhat or very likely to face eviction in the next two months as the nationwide moratorium expires at the end of July.More than 12 million Americans continue to receivesome form of jobless benefits, which will be slashed or cut entirely by Labor Day.And some 42 million student loan borrowers will need to resume payments in October unless the Biden administration acts — and 2 in 3 say it will be difficult for them to pay the bill, according to aPew Charitable Trusts survey this month.The ultimate risk is if those and other programs run out at the same time that a major coronavirus outbreak leads to a pullback in economic spending, a slowdown in hiring or an increased hesitancy to find work for fear of catching the virus.“If we are to see a significant wave in the end of summer, early fall, then we are likely to see an environment where the economic impact will be much greater if there isn’t additional fiscal support,” said Gregory Daco, the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.Congress has been preoccupied in recent months not with short-term stimulus but longer-term initiatives, namely a bipartisan infrastructure plan and a multitrillion-dollar spending package for child care, health care, education and climate, Daco said. In short order, too, lawmakers will also have to take action on urgent items including the budget and the debt ceiling.“Those are likely to be the key focus,” he said. “So there might be a significant disconnect between the potential need for additional fiscal stimulus and Congress’ focus on more medium-term plans.”In the meantime, the Delta variant is giving Republicans fresh ammunition to rail against the multitrillion spending package they have long slammed as an expensive Democratic wishlist. Brady, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday he’s hopeful the president will now “turn away from his distraction on another $4 trillion spending binge” to focus on coronavirus and the economy.“I’m worried that almost since Day One, six months ago, [Biden] took his eye off defeating the virus and rebuilding the economy,” Brady said. “The president is scrambling now to make up for that lack of attention, but I worry that it’s too late.”"
Christine Blasey Ford lawyers call Kavanaugh investigation a 'sham' after new details emerge,-5.0,44.33,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/23/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-investigation-new-details-500652,https://adfontesmedia.com/politico-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.politico.com,"Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct before he was confirmed in 2018 as a Supreme Court justice, said Thursday that the FBI’s investigation into her allegations was a “sham and a major institutional failure.”The attorneys’ comments came after the FBI sent a letter to Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.), who wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray two years ago with questions about how the investigation into Kavanaugh was conducted. On June 30, the FBI responded to the senators, revealing new information about the investigation.Notably, the letter said that the tip line for Kavanaugh’s investigation received over 4,500 tips — and that this was the first time the bureau had set up such a line. In the letter, Assistant FBI Director Jill Tyson said the tips were provided to the Office of White House Counsel, prompting concern that those tips may have been dismissed or underinvestigated by the Trump administration as it sought to install Kavanaugh on the court.“The letter from the Department of Justice, released by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse’s office today, confirms what we knew: The FBI’s investigation into Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s serious allegations about Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s sexual misconduct was a sham and a major institutional failure,” Blasey Ford’s lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, said in the Thursday statement. “Not only did the FBI refuse to interview Dr. Ford or the corroborators listed in our letter to FBI Director Wray, it failed to act on the over 4,500 tips it received about then-nominee Kavanaugh. Instead, it handed the information over to the White House, allowing those who supported Kavanaugh to falsely claim that the FBI found no wrongdoing.”Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court in October 2018, after Blasey Ford and two other women accused him of sexual misconduct, which he denied. The Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh on a 50-48 vote.On Thursday, Whitehouse’s office said that a group ofseven Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Wray, asking for additional information on the FBI’s 2018 background investigation into Kavanaugh.“The admissions in your letter corroborate and explain numerous credible accounts by individuals and firms that they had contacted the FBI with information ‘highly relevant to ... allegations’ of sexual misconduct by Justice Kavanaugh, only to be ignored,” the senators wrote in the letter. “If the FBI was not authorized to or did not follow up on any of the tips that it received from the tip line, it is difficult to understand the point of having a tip line at all.”Blasey Ford’s attorneys said in their statement that the investigation into Kavanaugh “never should have been an ordinary background check,” adding that the FBI and Trump administration “hid the ball on this” with regard to the 4,500 tips about the now-Supreme Court justice.The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the statements."

Jared Kushner created a shell company and paid the Trump family $617 million.Business Insider reported:President Donald Trump’s most powerful advisor, Jared Kushner, approved the creation of a campaign shell company that secretly paid the president’s family members and spent almost half of the campaign’s $1.26 billion war chest, a person familiar with the operation told Insider.…..The shell company — incorporated as American Made Media Consultants Corp. and American Made Media Consultants LLC — allowed Trump’s campaign to skirt federally mandated disclosures. The tactic could attract scrutiny from federal election regulators.The Trump family appears to have violated campaign finance laws by creating a shell company, and then paying themselves funds that were not disclosed and odds are properly documented. The problem could much deeper than campaign finance violations.There is the possibility of potential money laundering and conspiracy charges if investigators find that the Trump family wasn’t just trying to skirt campaign finance laws, but were engaging in even more serious criminal activity.Trump was so confident that he would beat JoeBidenthat he spent half of the money that his campaign raised paying himself and his family. If Trump and Kushner thought that what they were doing was above board, they would not have created a shell company to hide their activities.Donald Trump will stay in politics,because bilking his followersand the taxpayers is his main source of revenue.The Trump campaign was a con, and all of those red hat wearing believers who donating money were lining Trump’s pockets.For more discussion about this story join ourRachel Maddow and MSNBC group.Follow and Like PoliticusUSA on Facebook"

And so it is,America, that we are about to learn even more aboutDonald Trump.ThisDonald Trump– who is holdingAmericahostage by refusing President ElectJoeBidenthe access and funding he needs to be prepared to defend this country – this is just his first move.After all, harmingAmericawhen they lose anelectionisn’t new for theRepublicans, even though the press is pretending like it is.SenatorMitchMcConnellpaved this path in 2009, plotting how to obstruct every single thing PresidentBarack Obamadid before he even took office. Out of spite. Out of an inability to accept the duty to work with the opposition to strengthen this country.McConnellcontinued his assault all throughTrump‘s four-year attack ondemocracy, and he’s back at it again plotting to undermineBidenin his position as the senate gatekeeper.If the press had called outMcConnell‘s behavior for what it was back then instead of he said/she saiding themselves into accomplices of his heist, we probably wouldn’t be here right now.But we are here, and everyone needs to buckle up. You see, the point ofTrump‘s behavior right now – the fear he’s trying to instill in you, the doubt he’s casting over our legitimate and resounding rejection of him in anelectoral processthat has made us the envy of countries around the world – this is all meant to get you to back down.This is the beginning of the real abuse, the purpose of which is to control you. To control your thoughts and behaviors and get you to back down because you can’t standTrump‘s behavior.But we will not do that.Joe Bidenwon thiselectionfair and square. Theelectionwas clean, other than theRepublicanvoter fraud andRepublicanattempts to intimidate, harass, and createelectionfraud via undermining the U.S.P.S. If anything, those attacks on theelectiononly strengthenBiden‘s lead.For reference, on MondayJoe Bidenled by a combined 277,436 votes across several states, and yetRepublicansare insisting it’s not over. The “f*ck your feelings” crowd now say we need to giveTrumptime to get over his hurt.

Their behavior now nearing closer to sedition as they refuse to acknowledge anelectionover excuses that didn’t even fly whenRudy Giulianipressed his case across from the porn shop at Four Seasons Total Landscaping.It’s all over but the shouting and the shouting is going to be ugly and if it’s ignored, it will get threatening.Republicansare basically a two year old having a tantrum, holding the country they swore to protect hostage for the feelings of a man who didn’t even show up to do the actual job of president one single day.They will rant, open baseless “probes,” throw themselves all over Fox News tossing (literal? it seems so) crap at the wall hoping it will enrage their base enough to turn out to vote in Georgia in the runoff soMcConnellcan keep his death grip on the country and make sure none of us have affordable healthcare.Republicanshave taken their usual level of pearl-clutching hysteria to new heights to appease this “president,” and as of yet, they are still getting away with it due to a press that is far too often incapable of being rude enough to say the actual truth to their faces.DonaldTrumpis showing you why you broke up with him. This is the part where he reminds you of every horrible thing he did while president, and then you realize on an even deeper level that it wasn’t a misunderstanding or an ideological disagreement; he actually doesn’t care about this country even a little bit.Trumpwill empty the bank accounts and hide all of the assets while leaving the country vulnerable to attack from hostile powers becauseRepublicanslet him. We will need to be alert at every turn to shut down the false allegations and continue to assert the fact thatJoe Bidenwon and a peaceful transition of power is happening, whetherTrumpandRepublicansfeel okay about it or not.Donald TrumpandRepublicansare holding theUnited Stateshostage, putting it into literal danger, and that is nothing new for them. This is the party they have become – unwilling to accept defeat, unable to govern democratically, an assault on and a threat todemocracy.Just remember, this sameDonald Trumpusing theDoJas a mafia hit man is also the man whose legal team booked the Four Seasons Total Landscaping parking lot to push their baseless claims ofelectionproblems and even the witnesses they brought didn’t manage to make any actual claims of fraud.All of the real lawyers have fled.Trumpis being propped up byRudy Giuliani, who has a lot at stake personally, Bill Barr, whose critical failures under this president are so momentous they will hog up warning spots in history books for centuries to come, and his usual entourage ofelectedRepublicanswhose patriotism was long ago eclipsed by their fear of this president.Trumphas always operated beneath the blustery cloak of pretend wealth combined with ruthless thuggery but underneath it all he’s an older man in poor health, facing likely criminal probes, huge debt, and potentially $100 million in IRS fines when he leaves office. This is his first real go at reality as an adult, and he’s way too emotionally incapable of making this transition. It won’t be easy for him.Of course,Trumpisn’t going to go silently. But go he will."

Let’s do it!”Pelosi’s response came afterTrumpreleased a bizarre video in which he blasted the COVID relief bill that his ownWhite Househelped negotiate and called onCongresstoincrease the stimulus payment amount.Trump said that if Congress didn’t fix his concerns with the relief package, it would be up to the next administration – whichhe hinted would be him– to come up with a new bill.Most folks recognize that a one-time $600 stimulus check is nowhere near enough to keep millions of struggling Americans afloat in the midst of a public health and economic crisis.But given the fact that Republicans were fiercely opposed toanyadditional stimulus payments, it was a big win for Democrats that they managed to get direct payments included in the compromise relief package at all.Asmembers of Congresshave spent months negotiating, it’s clear that Trump didn’t take the time to even examine the proposals. If he had, he would have seen that Democrats already passed COVID relief legislation back in May that included stimulus checks for twice the amount that are included in the current bill.Regardless,Nancy Pelosiis calling Donald Trump’s bluff on Tuesday by telling him thatHouse Democrats are ready to immediately increase stimulus payments to $2,000.

There’s nothing to worry about. I’m looking forward to the second shot, so is Jill. She had her shot earlier today. She loves shots, I know. But I’ve had so many.But the important thing is that it’s worth stating that, you know, this is just the beginning.

In the meantime, I know I don’t want to sound like a sour note here, but I hope people listen to all of the experts, the Dr. Faucis on, talking about the need to wear masks during the Christmas and new year’s holidays, wear masks and socially distance. If you don’t have to travel, don’t travel. Don’t travel.It’s really important because we’re still in the thick of this. It’s one thing to have the vaccine show up at a hospital. It’s another thing to get the vaccine from that vial into a needle, into an arm, and there’s millions of people out there that are going to need this, and frontline workers first. I just want to thank everyone for all that they have done. Some real heroes. Real heroes. And you’re among them. Thank you.Biden did what a president is supposed to do.

He even helped the president prepare to debateJoeBiden.But while palling around with Trump, Christie caught a serious case of COVID-19. And since then, he hasn’t held his tongue while talking about the soon to be ex-president and his actions.During a recent radio interview with Sirius XM’s Joel Pollack, the formerNew Jerseygovernorsaidof Trump:“I think he’s hurting himself, and I think he’s hurting the country by keeping it going. I mean, the fact is, listen, I’m a big supporter of the president. I was the first one of his 2016 opponents to endorse him. We’ve been friends for 20 years. I prepared him for his debates in 2016, headed his transition in 2016, prepared him for his debates in 2020. But there’s no evidence that I’ve seen that there was fraud that occurred in thiselectionthat would change the result, nor have courts all across this country found any such evidence, either. We’ve continued to hear from people like Sidney Powell that, any day now, we’re going to hear about this evidence that’s going to blow this whole thing up, and we haven’t gotten it.

Donald Trump’s loss, of course, was due to cheating. There was no irregularity, though, in places where Republicans won their races.But how can the GOP push the conspiracy theory that Trump was cheated in 2020 and expect their constituents to continue voting. According to a newpollfrom Fox News, they may not be able to.Respondents were asked whether the events of the 2020 election made them more likely or less likely to vote. Democrats, clearly, were excited about what went down in 2020.When asked that question, 84% of Liberals said they would be more likely to vote in future elections. Only 69% of Republicans, though, said they were more likely to vote in future elections.And when the numbers were focused specifically on Trump supporters, the numbers were even worse. A total of 19%, or around 1 in 5 Trump supporters, said they were less likely to vote in future presidential elections.Of course, the question was focused only on presidential elections. But Americans are more likely to vote in presidential elections than they are in mid-term races.And one of the big advantages for Donald Trump was that he was able toturn outnon-voters in ways previously unheard of.The question of whether or not the 2020 election will depress Republican turnout is soon to be answered. Polls are showing a tight race in the Georgia senate runoffs. Even if only a small percentage of GOP voters fail to show up, that could flip the race in Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock’s favor."

MUST ACT NOW!”This isn’t the first time Trump has made this demand of Kemp. Earlier this month, toldlawmakers that he will not call a special session to overturn election results despite Trump’s insistence that he appoint Republican electors who would support him despite having lost the state.Kemp has been firm that Georgia’s election was free and fair.“Any attempt by the legislature to retroactively change that process for the Nov. 3rd election would be unconstitutional and immediately enjoined by the courts, resulting in a long legal dispute and no short-term resolution,” Kemp and Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncansaidin a statement addressing calls for him to convene a special session.Trump has often asserted that Georgia’s recount efforts are “fake” and claimed without evidence thatstate election officials are unable to verify signatures on absentee ballots.His claim is incorrect. The Associated Press already conducted afact checkthat showed “There is nothingin the consent decree that prevents Georgia election clerks from scrutinizing signatures.”“The legal settlement signed in March addresses accusations about a lack of statewide standards for judging signatures on absentee ballot envelopes,” the AP continues, noting that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has said that verifying signatures is both possible and required by the state."

If not, he needs to go. I’ll be fighting to strengthen the USPS in the meantime.”Manchin added, “For rural communities across the country our U.S. Postal Service provides an irreplaceable service. West Virginians depend on USPS to deliver medicines and bills or support their small businesses. The delays in service over the course of the last year have had serious impacts on rural communities, and it’s a travesty that the Postmaster General wants to double down on that poor service by making it the standard going forward. We should be striving for excellence, not codifying mediocrity. The DeJoy Act would ensure West Virginians can rely on USPS again by requiring delivery standards for first-class mail to be met. I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me to ensure USPS is delivering on time again.”SenateDemocratsunderstand the urgency of the situation and are not going to wait for USPS to get its newBidenchosen members situated and then get around to firing DeJoy.The Postmaster General does not have unilateral power.

In some cases, Mr. Gaetz asked women to help find others who might be interested in having sex with him and his friends, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Should anyone inquire about their relationships, one person said, Mr. Gaetz told the women to say that he had paid for hotel rooms and dinners as part of their dates.….It is not illegal to provide adults with free hotel stays, meals, and other gifts, but if prosecutors think they can prove that the payments to the women were for sex, they could accuse Mr. Gaetz of trafficking the women under “force, fraud or coercion.” For example, prosecutors have filed trafficking charges against people suspected of providing drugs in exchange for sex because feeding another person’s drug habit could be seen as a form of coercion.Matt Gaetzcontinues to issue weak denials and push his extortion distraction, but the reality is that theinvestigationintoRep.

Trump, on the other hand, has seen his approval rating drop 12 points since he lost theelection.More via Gallup:The 34% job approval rating for Trump in Gallup’s Jan. 4-15 poll is one point lower than his prior lowest single rating, registered on several occasions in late 2017. The first of these came in August 2017, as Trump was facing intense criticism over his unvarnished threats against North Korean aggression and his response to deadly violence by a white nationalist at a protest inCharlottesville, Virginia.…Trump is the only president not to register a 50% job approval rating at any point in his presidency since Gallup began measuring presidential job approval in 1938. Likewise, he is the only president who did not have a honeymoon period of above-average ratings upon taking office. His initial 45% job approval rating proved to be his high point for his first year as president.It’s almost impossible to argue that this presidency was anything other than a fluke, a Donald Trump reality TV stunt that went horribly wrong both for the country and for Trump himself.The good news for the country is thatJoeBidenwill be taking over in less than two days and immediately begin to reverse the damage of the past four years.

She announced recently that she plans on stepping down in 2021 after serving around a year.Psaki made the comments during an podcast appearance withCNN‘s David Axelrod. Shetoldthe host, “I think it’s going to be time for somebody else to have this job, in a year from now or about a year from now.”The Press Secretary also answered others questions about the challenges of her job. As for access, sheexplained, “We’re never going to satisfy theWhite House press corpsand their desires for access. And I think there have been mistakes made in the past of trying to do that.”Psaki alsoaddressedcritics of Biden who say he should be doing more at theUSborder. “We’re often asked, ‘Why doesn’t he go to the border?’ Important issue. We’re focused on it. What percentage of the public is focused on the border? A much smaller percentage than who’s focused on the pandemic and the economy. So that may be maddening, but, you know, that’s what we try to do.”"

As a result, theNorth CarolinaRepublican stepped down as Chairman of theSenateIntelligence Committee in May of 2020.The Department of Justice also opened an investigation into Burr around the same time. And today, the last day of DonaldTrump‘s term, Burr announced that the investigation has closed with no charges filed.“Tonight, the Department of Justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year. The case is now closed,”saidBurr. “I’m glad to hear it. My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.”In addition, none of the other lawmakers who made sketchy trades will be charged,CNN‘s Manu Rajutweeted, “Justice closed all four Senate insider trading probes launched in the wake of the pandemic: Perdue,Feinstein, Loeffler and Burr.

Presidential Historian Calls Trump’s Presidency A ‘Near-Death Experience’ For American Democracy,-13.67,32.67,https://www.politicususa.com/2021/01/19/presidential-historian-calls-trumps-presidency-a-near-death-experience-for-american-democracy.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/politicus-usa-bias-reliability/,2021-01-19,www.politicususa.com,"Presidentialhistorian Michael Beschloss said on Tuesday night that even thoughJoe Bidenwill be sworn in as president tomorrow, theAmericanpeople shouldn’t forget about the “near-death experience” thatDonald Trumpjust put the country though.Beschloss said that Biden is right to focus hisinaugurationon “unity and reconciliation,” but that it’s also important to remember just how close Trump came to topplingU.S.democracy.“We have been through four years of a daily, hourly assault on our democracy, a president who hates democracy, has a lust for power, and topped it all off on the 6th of January by trying to take down ourCongress, overturn a free presidential election, and take down our democracy,” Beschloss said.“That was a near-death experience,” he added.Video:Beschloss said:I think it will be more meaningful because it takes account of the moment. If we tried to imitate a normal inauguration with a big crowd, pretending that there was not a pandemic, or if we tried to take chances with security of pretending that there was not a domestic terrorist attack on theCapitoland the Congress on the 6th of January, that would be counterfeit. So if we’re going to have a ceremony of unity and reconciliation, which I am sure tomorrow will be, you have to have one that’s a little bit in tune with the moment. We Americans, just as our friend Valerie was just saying, we have been through four years of a daily, hourly assault on our democracy, a president who hates democracy, has a lust for power, and topped it all off on the 6th of January by trying to take down our Congress, overturn a free presidentialelection, and take down our democracy. That was a near-death experience. We can’t just pretend that this is just a day like any other.On Tuesday night inWashington D.C.,Joe Biden told the countrythat remembering is part of the healing process.“It’s hard sometimes to remember, but that’s how we heal,” he said. “It’s important to do that as a nation.”Bidenwas speaking in the context of the pandemic, but his words also apply to the last four years more broadly.In order for the country to heal after four traumatic years of Donald Trump, it’s important that we recognize just how close American democracy came to crumbling.FollowSean ColarossionFacebookandTwitter"

Coming to play golf is not what I would consider an essential purpose.”Speculation has been running wild that Donald Trump will literally leave theUnited Statesbefore JoeBidentakes office. If Trump does decide to flee the country,Scotlandwould be the logical choice. Trump has a golf course there, and he can literally hideout on the other side of the Earth to avoid the reality that he is the first incumbent president in almost thirty years to lose his reelection bid.If Trump does ignore the warnings not to come to Scotland, will the Scottish government deny him entry into their country? Technically, if Trump arrives in Scotland on the 19th, he would still be president, and the taxpayers would be paying for his trip.Would Scotland deny the world’s biggest COVID superspreader entry into their country due to Trump being a public health threat? It is possible, which is why the First Minister issued a preemptive warning for Trump to stay away.Scotland wants nothing to do with Donald Trump.For more discussion about this story join ourRachel Maddow and MSNBC group.Follow and Like PoliticusUSA on Facebook"

He said among other things yesterday, “I promise you we will have our day incongress.” He said, “We will hear the objections, we will hear the evidence.” But he didn’t go further than that, which is to say that it appears at least from what we’re hearing that he wants the process to play out but given the opportunity to decide between his boss and the constitution, in the words of one close to him, he is going to follow the constitution while still sort of affording the House andSenatethis opportunity to air these grievances and address these matters.Mike Penceis only interested in looking out for himself right now. It is not in his interest to blow up the Constitution to try to keepDonald Trumpin power with a scheme that won’t work. Mike Pence wants to run for president in 2024 and another four years as Donald Trump’s marginalized stooge would not be the best thing for his political ambitions.Pence doesn’t have the power to reject electors. TheVice Presidentcould stand there looking concerned while House and Senate Republicans object to the Electoral College results in five swing states.The Vice President isn’t going to do down for Trump and some harebrained coupthat is destined to fail.

GOP tweet misfires in linking crime trends to Democratic policies,-4.33,41.33,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/09/republican-national-committee-republican/gop-tweet-misfires-linking-crime-trends-democratic/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,www.politifact.com,"Republicans see a winning issue in linking crime to Democratic policies.When homicides spiked in the second half of 2020, President Donald Trump wielded it as a campaign issue, saying Republicans would restore order to crime-ridden Democratic-led cities.He lost his race, but the GOP attacks continue. In a recent tweet, the Republican National Committee blamed rising crime on Democrats.""Crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies,"" Republicanstweeted June 29.Crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.We asked the RNC for the data behind the claims in the tweet. Their response included nothing on the link to police defunding. On the open border part, they pointed to news coverage about an increase infentanyl seizuresat the border,high-speed chasesin South Texas, and FBI directorChristopher Wraytalking about an epidemic of drug smuggling and other illegal activity at the border.The RNC tweet is rife with inaccuracies. But its biggest flaw is the unfounded assertion that crime rate trends were a ""direct result"" of Democratic policies.Homicides increased in 2020. It’s possible that the toll could have topped 19,000 last year.But the RNC tweet is not narrowly about rising homicides. It encompasses several other claims that are flawed:Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah noted that when murders began to increase rapidly in mid-2020, immigration was stable or declining.""And, obviously, Democrats did not control immigration policy in May 2020,"" Cassell said. ""So any linkage between the 2020 homicide increase and immigration policies seems quite dubious.""Some Democratic-led cities did cut police budgets last year, but not many. Among the50 largest cities, police spending as a percentage of general expenditures went up an average of 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021.The RNC tweet speaks of crime broadly, but it’s homicides in particular that have caused alarm since a sharp rise in the summer of 2020. That coincided with the anti-police-violence protests that spread across the country in June following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The calls to defund the police gained prominence the same month.One problem in talking about crime at this moment is that no one yet has a national picture of crime for 2020, let alone the first half of 2021. The FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report is the most comprehensive data set, and the FBI hasn’t published the 2020 edition yet.Other data sets lack the scope of the FBI’s full assessment, but they all point in the same direction: Homicides are up.Apreliminary FBI crime reportfor 154 cities says murders rose 10% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. TheMajor Cities Chiefs Associationfound a 29% rise in homicides for 63 cities in the first quarter of 2021. And the latest report fromCouncil on Criminal Justice, an independent source of crime data, looked at 24 cities and found homicides rose by 24% in the first quarter.The topline numbers don’t tell the whole story, however.For example, in the first-quarter FBI release on 154 cities, the increase in homicides was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same. As for violent crime generally — including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault — the number remained just about the same across the full group of cities, undercutting the RNC’s broad-brush claim about escalating crime.The Council on Criminal Justice’s data on weekly police reports found that homicide rates generally fell after October 2020 — from a bit over 5 deaths per 100,000 to about 3 per 100,000 by March 2021.That could reflect seasonal changes; homicides tend to fall in the cooler months. But the report’s authors say other unknown factors could be at work.The RNC’s claim that rising crime was a ""direct result"" of Democratic policies lacks evidence, and experts say it ignores some of the major events of 2020 that also likely had an effect on crime.""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,"" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. ""Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.""Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the economic downturn also mattered.""Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,"" Ahlin said. ""Last year we saw both at play.""On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the death of George Floyd.Cassell at the University of Utah said that played a role, because it made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.""Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressive steps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,"" Cassell said.Cassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect. Regardless, Cassell called the GOP link between crime and a defund policy ""dubious.""Even the pandemic and the protests might not fully explain the trend in homicides. As the Council on Criminal Justice report noted, the ""homicide increase actually began in 2019, prior to the pandemic and well before protests against police violence spread across the country.""Looking at the first three months of 2020, murders rose 20% from a year earlier. The pandemic shutdown didn’t take place until mid-March, and the protests didn’t begin until late May.The Republican National Committee tweeted that ""crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.""It’s not true that crime is rising to a level we haven’t seen in decades.Homicides are up, but there’s no evidence that the trend is tied to a police defunding policy or Democrats’ border policies, let alone that it’s a ""direct result.""Experts say many other factors may have played a role, including racial-justice protests and disruptions caused by the pandemic.We rate this claim False."

Then the image lists what it says are the prices in April 2020 vs April 2021, Biden’s third month as president, attributing the figures to Markets Insider:1,000 feet of lumber board: $304 to $1,500Gallon of gas: $1.95 to $3.05Ton of wheat: $183 to $251Ton of coal: $39 to $80Bushel of corn: $3.43 to $6.86One Facebook user who shared the image added this in a post: ""No explanation needed… ruining America 2.0….""The price increases claimed are roughly accurate.We examined the threat of inflation inan articlein mid-May.Economists said that most of the current rise in consumer prices stems from supply chains having to adjust quickly to greater economic activity after increased vaccination has eased the pandemic. Recent price trends for some basic commodities illustrate the ripple effect of the widespread business shutdowns that hit just a little over a year ago, and the resurgence of demand as vaccinations and declining COVID-19 case numbers promise a return to normal business activity.For example, in the case of gasoline, experts said, tight supplies drove prices up from January, when Biden took office, to April (before a May hacker attack shut down a key pipeline). In general, a president haslimited controlover the weekly and monthly shifts in gasoline prices.And for plywood, mills that shut down or reduced production during the throes of the pandemic in 2020 still haven’t caught up to increased demand.All in all, the peculiar transition to a post-pandemic economy has produced mismatches in supply and demand that are now driving the sharpest inflation. Economists expect these price increases to reverse once supply chains iron out delays and shortages.The only Biden policy that has affected prices is the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 reliefbillhe signed March 11, said Abdur Chowdhury, an emeritus economics professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee. ""Consumers have ample cash in hand. As the economy reopens, consumer spending on leisure, travel, entertainment and other service-related activities will increase,"" he said.Blaming Biden for the inflation ""seems an exaggeration at best,"" said Jeffrey Miron, a senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University and  director of economics studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It likely reflects recovery from the recession/pandemic, concerns about monetary policy being too accommodating, as well as concerns that fiscal stimuli, including several adopted pre-Biden, are increasing aggregate demand and pushing up prices.""An image widely shared on Facebook claimed that lumber, gas, wheat, coal and corn cost more ""in Joe Biden's America.""The specific price increases claimed are roughly accurate, but they compared April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic had all but shut down the economy and driven down prices, with April 2021, as the nation’s recovery from the pandemic was in swing.Economists say that post-pandemic mismatches in supply and demand are to blame for higher prices in April 2021. While presidents often get blamed for inflation, in this case the sharp contrast in prices from a year earlier is due mainly to the economy having hit a low in April 2020.For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True."

Ron DeSantis lauded a new state law he championed as ""the strongest anti-rioting, pro-law enforcement piece of legislation in the country.""Thenew lawincreased the criminal penalties for offenses committed ""in furtherance of a riot or an aggravated riot."" It also allows state attorneys or city council members to appeal budget proposals that seek to reduce police operating budgets to the state’s Administration Commission. The commission, made up of thegovernor and Cabinet, has the final say.""This bill actually prevents against local governments defunding law enforcement,""DeSantis saidafter signing the bill April 19. ""We’ll be able to stop it at the state level. And if you look at some of these places that have done this, they’ve already seen crime go up.""DeSantis’ office pointed to news reports about increased crime in six places: New York City, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis and Philadelphia. The types of crimes and time periods used to measure those increases varied per city.Those cities did reduce or redistribute some police funding as they grappled with the coronavirus pandemic andactivists’ callsto spend less on policing and more on mental health services and anti-crime programs.However, criminologists disputed DeSantis’ link between budget cuts and worsened crime.Experts said the limited data and selective time frames disregard key points:Murder and gun violence were already up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets. (Some of the six cities are still in the process of shifting money from the police.)Cities that did not cut police budgets also saw murder go up in 2020.""These comparisons of crime increases with reductions in police budget or personnel are strictly anecdotal. In the first instance, they should be compared with crime changes in cities that have not altered policing,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri, St. Louis expert on crime trends. ""Moreover, they are at best correlations between crime changes and policing. They say nothing about whether or how the changes to policing caused the crime changes.""A proper evaluation of budget changes and their impact on crime should control for multiple factors that influence criminal activity, said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminologist at the University of California, Irvine. Those factors include poverty, joblessness, drugs, gangs, guns, housing insecurity and demographic shifts, she said.AfterGeorge Floyd’s killing by a police officer in May 2020,activists protesting racial discrimination and excessive use of force by police called on cities to""defund the police.""While some protesters want to eliminate police departments entirely, others want to revisit the functions of police departments and reroute some police funding toward other services.The six cities flagged by DeSantis did not abolish police departments or cancel their budgets. But they approved less funding for police departments for fiscal 2021. Some responded by transferring police duties to other city departments, eliminating funding earmarked for overtime pay, imposed hiring freezes, among other measures.The cities made budget changes to fiscal years that started as early as July 1, 2020, and as late as Jan. 1, 2021.PolitiFact reached out to each of the six cities to learn more about their budget changes and how significant they were in relation to the overall police budget. We heard back from most, but got limited information.In Philadelphia, a $33 million cut to the police budget represents about 4.5% of the department’s adopted general fund budget of $727 million.New York City officials last yearsaidthey agreed to remove $1 billion from the police department’s spending. (The Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said the net reduction to the police budget so far has been about $477 million.) The department’stotal budget for 2021was $10.2 billion.Los Angeles cut $150 million from the police operating budget. The department’s 2021budgetis more than $1.7 billion.Minneapolis officials in Decembersaidthey shifted $7.8 million from the proposed police budget to other city departments. Overall, the city approved$164 millionfor the police department. (The city’s fiscal year runs concurrently with the calendar year.)The Austin American-Statesmanreportedon a $150 million cut to the police budget, which represents about one-third of the police budget. But city spokesperson Jaquarry Wilson disputed the characterization of funds being cut, saying $121.7 million ""was simply moved into two transition funds"" while city staff determines which services can be offered by other city departments. Another $31.5 million was reinvested in other community safety initiatives in other departments, Wilson said.DeSantis’ claim did not take into consideration how crime manifested nationally in 2020.Many cities saw spikes in homicides in 2020, regardless of changes to their police budgets.Crime increases are likely the result of the ""social disorganization"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic, said Samuel Walker, an emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.Social disorganization involves a weakening of the basic bonds of social control, such as good employment and stable families.Nationwide, murder went up every quarter of 2020 compared with the respective quarters in 2019, according topreliminary FBI data.The number of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses increased 14.8% nationwide in the first half of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, according topreliminary datareported to the FBI by more than 12,000 U.S. law enforcement agencies.At the same time, the FBI said there were overall declines in the number of violent crimes and property crimes.""The complicated drivers of 2020's large murder increase were clearly already well established before budget cuts for 2021 were passed,"" said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics.Some of the local news reports offered by DeSantis’ office also compared homicides in 2021 with 2020.One reportfocused on New York City murders over the first 10 days of 2021 versus the first 10 days of 2020;anotherlooked at Philadelphia homicides from the beginning of 2021 through mid-March, compared with the same period in 2020.Short-term homicide data can be ""notoriously unreliable,"" said Michael Campbell, a criminologist at the University of Denver. Homicides are relatively rare compared with other crimes, leading to large fluctuations in the homicide rates.""However, everything points to a broad uptick in homicide, domestic violence, gun crimes and other serious offenses,"" Campbell said. ""Things are bad everywhere and it’s easy to point at these big cities but it’s impossible to determine any clear relationship and I’d be surprised if one ever emerges.""Cuts in police funding don’t automatically mean the department will make a decision that puts public safety at risk.When police departments have a reduced budget, they try to make adjustments that spare services for citizens or affect their perception of safety, said Kevin Robinson, a lecturer at Arizona State University's School of Criminology & Criminal Justice.Departments, for example, could opt to replace a patrol vehicle every five years instead of four, said Robinson, who served in the Phoenix Police Department for nearly 40 years.Bloomberg CityLabanalyzedthe 2021 police budgets of the 50 largest U.S. cities in January. On the whole, the cities’ police budgets were reduced by 5.2%. But spending on police as a share of general expenditures rose slightly to 13.7%.At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021,Tampaamong them, Bloomberg reported. Tampa city officials in September voted to increase the police department’s budget by $13 million for fiscal 2021, to $176 million.The Tampa Bay Times around mid-Novemberreportedthat Tampa, like other cities nationwide, saw an uptick in murders in 2020 compared with 2019.DeSantis said, ""If you look at some of these places that (cut police funding), they’ve already seen crime go up.""An element of truth in DeSantis’ claim is that crime went up in six major cities. But he said it was because of budget cuts, when murder and gun violence were already trending up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets.None of the budget changes have been in place for a whole year, so it’s too early to tell the extent of their impact on crime, if any. A proper assessment would control for many factors that influence criminal activity, experts said.We rate DeSantis’ claim Mostly False."
Why randomized controlled trials on mask wearing and the coronavirus are scant,-0.67,47.67,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/mar/12/why-randomized-controlled-trials-mask-wearing-and-/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-12,www.politifact.com,"Nearly ayearsince the CDC first started recommending wearing face coverings in public, social media users are still denying their efficacy.""Every real world, randomized controlled trial on mask effectiveness demonstrates that masks are not effective in reducing the spread of viral infections,"" says author Shawn Stevenson in an Instagramvideo.The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnershipwith Facebook.)A randomized controlled trial is a scientific study that randomly sorts participants into an experimental group and a control group to study the effect of a particular variable on the outcome. Randomized controlled trials are time-consuming and expensive, but well-designed ones are more effective at minimizing bias than most other types of studies.So is Stevenson correct in saying that there are no randomized controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of mask use in blunting viral infections? No, he’s not. Multiple randomized controlled trials have shown that mask-wearing effectively blunts the spread of othercoronavirusesandinfluenza-likediseases.And Stevenson’s assertion that no randomized controlled trials have conclusively proven that masks prevent the spread specifically of Sars-CoV-2 ignores that there is no lack of scientific proof establishing the efficacy of mask wearing. It also very notably misleads by leaving out the reason why randomized controlled trials have not been used for this purpose: in the midst of a pandemic, employing these methods to study the question wouldwidely be considered unethical.We reached out to four public health experts and asked them to sum up the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of mask use. They provided scores of systematic reviews, ecological studies and laboratory studies showing that masks play an important role in reducing the spread of the coronavirus and play a critical role in interrupting viral transmission.Stevenson did not return a request for comment.To conduct a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of masks, researchers would have to randomly assign some members of a community not to wear a face mask for a long period of time to see whether they got sick at higher rates than a control group.Practically there is no way that scientists could run a study like this during a global pandemic without endangering trial participants and other people they encountered out in the world.""Randomized controlled trials are pretty much the gold standard, but they’re not always ethical,"" said Mary Kathryn Grabowski, an assistant professor in epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. ""We can’t just send people out without masks in the middle of a pandemic in the same way we can’t randomize people to not use a parachute when they jump out of a plane.""According to Babak Javid, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, only onerandomized controlled trialof mask use has been conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. This studyattempted to showwhether volunteers who were given and taught to wear surgical masks were more protected from the coronavirus than those who weren’t. However, the study didn’t analyze source control –  the ability of masks to prevent infected wearers from spreading the virus to other people – which is the primary reason why scientists believe masks are effective at interrupting transmission.This study, known asDANMASK-19, adhered to ethical guidelines because it was conducted in Denmark early in the pandemic while community spread of the coronavirus was at only 2%. However, that also limited its scope and precision, said Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Nikolas Wada.Beyond the fact that the study was underpowered, it had other limitations, said Wada. Huge numbers of trial participants did not comply with their directions, with less than half the people in the masked group reporting that they wore face coverings as instructed. In addition, the study was conducted at a time when other public health guidelines such as social distancing were being implemented, making it difficult to tell what protection came from the masks and what came from these other measures.Despite these imperfections, the study found that those who wore masks were 18% less likely to be infected than those who did not. However, since the study was only designed to detect a large effect greater than 50%, the 18% difference was statistically insignificant, meaning that it could have happened by chance.Some social media users such as Stevenson cite the DANMASK-19 study asevidence that masks don’t work. However, Wada said, this is actually a common misinterpretation of the study.""Basically, you couldn't draw up a better design to show no mask benefit, but there appears to have been a benefit anyway. And that's just to protect the wearer, without any measurement of source control,"" said Wada.No scientific study is perfect. Instead of basing their opinions off individual trials, public health experts look beyond isolated articles to see whether thetotality of researchpoints in one direction or the other.""I think taking individual studies on masks and using them to make a point without considering the totality of the literature is a really bad idea,"" said Grabowski. ""It’s important to consider all of the data and all of the research on this topic.""Building off that principle, Grabowski and her colleagues at Johns Hopkins have compiled a list ofsignificant scientific studieson COVID-19 and analyze the findings and limitations of each.Due to the lack of randomized controlled trials on mask use’s effectiveness against COVID-19, public health experts have based their guidance on a variety of other scientific studies: systematic reviews, ecological studies and laboratory studies.Systematic reviews are papers that pool existing studies and try to answer a narrowly defined question using a larger data set than any of the studies had individually. According toscientific hierarchies of evidence, systematic reviews are generally thought to produce the most reliable evidence.Asystematic reviewon mask-use published in the Lancet analyzed 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents and found that ""Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection … with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar."" However, many of the studies included in the review took place in healthcare settings rather than in community settings.Anothersystematic reviewon the ability of mask-use to interrupt the spread of respiratory illnesses, which included 67 randomized controlled trials and observational studies, found that ""overall masks were the best performing intervention across populations, settings and threats.""There have also been a wealth ofecologicalstudieson masks and COVID-19. These studies analyze the effect that specific localized public health measures have on coronavirus case rates after they’re implemented. These papers have consistently found that mask mandates cause sharp declines in coronavirus case rates.One of thesepapers, which analyzed 15 U.S. states found that daily infection rates decreased significantly after mask mandates were introduced. In seven of the 15 states, researchers from UC San Diego and Texas A&M found that the number of new infections per day increased steadily only to fall after face-mask requirements were implemented. In the six states the researchers analyzed that never implemented mask mandates, infections continued to increase on the same upward line. They estimated that mask mandates had prevented a total of 252,000 infections on May 18, equivalent to nearly 17% of infections in the nation at that point in time.Finally, scientists have studied thespreadofcoronavirus particlesin laboratory settings and found that masks are effective at stopping them from dispersing into the air, suggesting that they also function that way in real world settings.It’s important to note, said Javid, that mask-wearing shouldn’t be viewed as a panacea for COVID-19 control. Some people who wear masks will get sick or spread the virus to others. The best scientific evidence shows that masks help to prevent viral spread, but that their effectiveness varies based on the quality of the mask worn and the strictness with which people adhere to mask-wearing guidelines.""Unless one wears a properly fitted respirator mask for all interactions​ outside of the household, masks cannot, by themselves, completely interrupt transmission,"" he said. ""Nonetheless, from what we know about the biology of the disease, and the biophysics of droplet and aerosol production, there is a strong rationale for why masks can have some effect in both protecting the wearer and as source control."" ​"

The results were certified by state officials and accepted by Congress.But the audit could have a broader impact on the democratic process.

Maricopa County conducted ahand count auditof a sample of ballots as required by state law and hired independent firms to conduct aforensic auditof tabulation equipment.

Doug Ducey, who stoked Trump’s ire by certifying the results, was not involved.)""When you have got half the people that do not trust the electoral system anymore — rightly or wrongly so — if they have questions, who is responsible for answering these questions? How do we put election integrity back into our system,""Senate President Karen Fann told KTAR News.

DeRose, a former clerk of the Superior Court for Maricopa County, wrote that no good can come of the audit.""How could anyone expect a partisan process to yield a result more accurate and trusted than the one administered by professionals of all parties following established rules?"" DeRose wrote.

""After all, the count is likely to vary because of the lack of rules, training and transparency. So how could anyone feel confident in its finding?""And if the numbers vary, some may conclude that they simply can't trust an election outcome — even though the inconsistency is entirely the fault of an ill-conceived and poorly executed audit.""The audit is expected to break in mid-May to accommodate graduation ceremonies at the coliseum.

Biden said July 2. ""As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today’s job news brought us something else to celebrate: This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs.""Biden went on to say, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.""Presidents’ claims about job creation on their watch can be troublesome. So how did Biden do?Biden was right on the numbers, we found, but he glossed over some important context.Theofficial government datashows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and June, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 145.8 million, or a gain of just over 3 million.In numerical terms, that’s a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.)The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs.Biden’s claim leaves out at least four important bits of context.A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by the starting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Biden scores well, but he’s not No. 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 2.2%, compared with Biden’s 2.1%.Put another way, if the gains from June can be replicated each month, it would take until February 2022 for all pre-pandemic jobs to be recovered (setting aside subsequent increases in population).Given the severity of the pandemic recession, that would be a significant bounceback — but it hasn’t happened yet.Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during a spiraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy. But the precise timing of their inauguration can play a big role in how a president’s first few months go, so Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples.That said, experts say that Biden does deserve some credit for the job gains on his watch, given the gains in coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief.The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Biden said, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history.""Biden is right on the numbers and on how they compare with his recent predecessors in the Oval Office.However, this talking point glosses over the reality that the U.S. economy remains almost 6.8 million jobs under its pre-pandemic peak. Meanwhile, comparing presidents as Biden did is highly sensitive to the economic conditions around the time of their inauguration; Biden entered office during a deep recession, but he took over on the upswing, a situation that not all presidents have benefited from.We rate the statement Half True."

Fact-checking Kayleigh McEnany’s claim that ‘all of our main Founding Fathers were against slavery’,-4.33,45.67,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/09/kayleigh-mcenany/fact-checking-kayleigh-mcenanys-claim-all-our-main/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,www.politifact.com,"Fox News host and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany accused others of ""getting the facts wrong"" about the Founding Fathers and slavery — all while getting some facts wrong herself.""The haters never take a day off from hating. That is clear. And they never take a day off from getting the facts wrong,"" McEnanysaid on ""Outnumbered"" July 6. ""We know most of our forefathers, all of our main Founding Fathers were against slavery, recognized the evils of it.""Five historians who spoke with PolitiFact agreed that McEnany’s claim was an inaccurate oversimplification.""I think the most charitable thing you could say about her statement is that it reflects an utter ignorance of American history,"" said Paul Finkelman, the president of Gratz College in greater Philadelphia, who haswrittenseveralbookson American slavery.Some of the most celebrated Founders were more tolerant of slavery than McEnany claimed, and themajorityof the signers of the Declaration of Independenceowned enslaved people.""The Father of the country, the Father of the Declaration, and the Father of the Constitution all remained lifelong enslavers,"" said Lorri Glover, a professor of history at Saint Louis University, in reference to Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.This undated engraving shows the scene on July 4, 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was approved. (AP)The term ""Founding Fathers"" is typically used to refer to the revolutionary leaders who united the colonies, led the American effort for independence and structured the U.S. government.Most discussions include Washington, Jefferson, Madison, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin. ""After these big six, the list gets complicated,"" Glover said.There were leaders who supported the revolution and fought in the war, those who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and those who backed the Constitution in 1787. The historians PolitiFact consulted listed dozens of figures who could qualify as Founders.""It's an ever-shifting group,"" said Todd Estes, professor of history at Oakland University.A list of enslaved people at Mount Vernon written by George Washington around 1799 is seen on May 19, 2016. (AP)McEnany did not specify who she saw as the ""main Founding Fathers,"" but in the Fox News segment, she citedan articlefrom the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.The article said the Founders ""unambiguously saw slavery as evil."" It specifically named John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, James Madison, and Thomas Jefferson.Among those, Adams was the most opposed to slavery. He never owned people and was ""staunchly antislavery,"" said Sean Wilentz, a Princeton University historian.Franklin owned a few enslaved people but freed them later and became president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society.Morris referred to slavery at the Constitutional Convention as the ""curse of heaven"" and pushed for emancipation in New York.And Jay, who helped write the Federalist Papers and became the first chief justice, signed a law to gradually end slavery in New York.But there was a struggle over slavery at the nation’s founding, Wilentz said. Other Founders had more complicated records — to the point that aBritish essayistwrotein 1775, ""How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?""Hamilton, for example,was a founderof the New York Manumission Society, an anti-slavery group. But he married into a slave-owning family and may have owned at least two people himself. He also supported several Federalist Party slaveholders as presidential candidates.Three other prominent Founders — Washington, Madison and Jefferson — all wrote at some point of their lament for the institution of slavery, Glover said. But they also enslaved people.The article McEnany cited ""cherry-pick(ed) quotations ripped out of context"" and distorted the Founding Fathers’ complex lives and writings, Glover said.Washington, the nation’s first president, ownedhundredsof enslaved people, though he ultimately freed them in his will. Thanks in large part to his friend the Marquis de Lafayette, Washington came to oppose slavery. He once said that he wished to see a plan for the abolition of the institution.Madison, the principal author of the Constitution and fourth president,ownedmore than 100 people, and he also proposed to amend theNorthwest Ordinanceto allow slavery in the Indiana Territory, Finkelman said.A statue of former President James Madison is shown in front of a mural of the Constitution in the education center at Montpelier, Madison's home, in Orange, Va., on Aug. 13, 2008. (AP)The Constitution protected the institution of slavery, Finkelman argued. It allowed slaveholders to capture runaways. It also required that a constitutional amendment be ratified by three-fourths of states to end slavery — a tall task for a nation with several slave states, and one that was achieved only after many of those states seceded.Then, there was Jefferson.The nation’s third president ""said more antislavery things publicly than any of the other founders by 1787,"" but he also ""did more to spread and defend slavery than any other during the ensuing decades,"" said David Waldstreicher, a historian at the City University of New York.As the chief architect of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson wrote that ""all men are created equal,"" and hecondemned slaveryand blamed the king for the slave trade in a separate passage that was eventually cut from the document. Hebackedsome legislation that chipped away at the institution of slavery andlikenedit to forcing tyranny on both the slaveholder and the enslaved.At the same time, Jeffersonenslavedover 600 people. He described Black people as racially inferior. He often sold people to punish them, Finkelman said, and when asked to speak against allowing Missouri to become a slave state, Jefferson refused. He and many other southern Founders were ""committed to the institution of slavery,"" Finkelman said.Thomas Jefferson's home Monticello is seen in Charlottesville, Va., on April 22, 2009. (AP)Overall, McEnany’s claim about the Founding Fathers is ""contradicted by the lack of substantive action on the part of the Founders to end slavery,"" said Estes, from Oakland University.""Many slaveholders claimed to hate the institution of slavery and the slave trade and decried their dependence on slave labor,"" Estes said. ""Yet, (they) did little or nothing to abolish the institution or even to reduce their and others’ dependence on slavery.""""In other words,"" Waldstreicher added, ""they tried to have it both ways.""Other men who could be considered Founders were more adamantly pro-slavery, including southerners from Georgia or the Carolinas like Charles Pinckney, who signed andcontributed clausesto the Constitution and later became South Carolina’s governor. During the Constitutional Convention,Pinckney saidslavery was ""justified by the example of all the world.""Finkelman said, ""If the Founding Fathers thought slavery was wrong and was evil, why didn’t they end it?""McEnany said, ""We know most of our forefathers, all of our main Founding Fathers were against slavery, recognized the evils of it.""Historians said that’s an oversimplification that ignores the lack of action among the Founders to get rid of slavery.Of the most eminent Founding Fathers, a few were against slavery. Others were lifelong slaveholders who showed some distaste for the practice in their lives and writings.Of the broader group of people who could be considered Founders, there were also southerners who were vehemently pro-slavery. The majority of the signers of the Declaration of Independence owned enslaved people.We rate McEnany’s statement Mostly False."
Rick Scott blames Democrats for expanding the debt. But it was a bipartisan feat,-2.67,47.67,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/sep/27/rick-scott/rick-scott-blames-democrats-expanding-debt-it-was-/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-27,www.politifact.com,"The U.S. is again facing a reckoning on the size of the national debt, which is approaching its legal limit. Without an increase in the debt ceiling, the country will not be able to borrow money to cover its bills. That wouldaffectSocial Security recipients, veterans and the people, banks and foreign nations that hold U.S. Treasury bonds.Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott said it should be up to Democrats to solve this problem on their own.""We won’t vote to bail them out and cut them more blank checks to bury us in debt,"" Scott wroteSept. 23in the Orlando Sentinel. ""Democrats are responsible for the massive spending and debt growth, they alone need to take responsibility for raising the debt limit.""Are Democrats alone responsible for the growth in the debt?No. It has been a decades-long, bipartisan effort.The national debt is the accumulated total of all the money the government has borrowed over the decades to cover its deficits and fund its operations, but hasn’t yet paid back. With a temporary suspension of the debt ceiling having expired on Aug. 1, the U.S. is now subject to a $28.4 trillion cap on its debt load, unless Congress finds a way to agree on a new increase or suspension.The day President Joe Biden took office, the national debt stood at$27.7 trillion. Eight months later, it is approaching that $28.4 trillion limit. But Scott’s finger-pointing ignores how the debt got as big as it is. Thanks to spending for wars, crises and mandatory government programs, along with a series of tax cuts, the debt continued expanding throughout the post-World War II period, regardless of which party controlled the White House or Congress.In nominal dollars, since World War II, just over 60% of the growth in the debt took place under Republican presidents, and about 40% under Democratic presidents.Biden championed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act to help the country control and recover from the pandemic. Most of that spending takes place over two years, but it has already added to the running tally of the national debt. The bill passed without a singleRepublican vote. So that’s on the Democrats.Now, the Democrats are seekingto pass a measurethat could spend trillions more on infrastructure and social programs. How much it would ultimately contribute to the debt depends on the tax increases in the final package. But since none of it has been enacted yet, it hasn’t added a penny to the debt.Scott didn’t mention the recent Republican record on adding to the debt, so we looked it up. What we found is that from the day President Donald Trump took office to his last day, the national debt grew $7.8 trillion.About half of that —$3.6 trillion— came from dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. That spending was backed by both Republicans and Democrats. It included the $2.1 trillion CARES Act, and another dose of relief of about $950 billion in late December 2020. Democrats and Republicans also approved spending bills thatincreased defenseandsocial programspending.But a good chunk of the debt increase came from initiatives backed solely by Trump and the then-GOP-controlled Congress. The2017 Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which slashed personal and corporate taxes, was supposed to spur enough economic growth to make up for lower tax rates. But after two years — even before the pandemic pummeled the economy — government revenues were down by abouthalf a trillion dollarsfrom what they would have been without the tax cuts. Not a single Democratic voted for that law, and among Republicans, only a dozen House members voted against it.All told, before the pandemic struck, the debt had increased $3.3 trillion on Trump’s watch.To be sure, no president has been totally responsible for the debt that accumulated during his administration. Congress writes the spending and tax bills that a president signs, and control of Congress has shifted back and forth between the parties for the past three decades.Plus, each president’s debt record reflects laws and spending plans passed before he took office. Major commitments, such as Social Security payments, shape the country’s fiscal picture regardless of who sits in the Oval Office.Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that promotes deficit reduction, said both parties own the current debt.""It has been produced by Democrats and Republicans, on both a partisan and bipartisan basis,"" Goldwein said.We reached out to Scott’s office and didn’t hear back.Scott said that ""Democrats are responsible for the massive spending and debt growth.""The bottom line is both Democrats and Republicans are responsible for growth of the national debt. The debt grew by $7.8 trillion during the Trump years, in part because of bipartisan votes on COVID-19 relief and other spending, but also because of measures like the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which was backed only by Republicans.We rate this claim Mostly False."
Fact-checking Joe Biden on U.S. credibility as military withdraws from Afghanistan,0.67,45.67,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/26/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-biden-us-credibility-military-wi/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-26,www.politifact.com,"Under fire over the plight of Afghans and Americans trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, President Joe Biden has defended the U.S. military’s withdrawal and pushed back against assertions that U.S. credibility is damaged.On Aug. 20, a reporter asked Biden: ""What is your message to America’s partners around the world who have criticized not the withdrawal, but the conduct of that withdrawal and made them question America’s credibility on the world stage?""Biden replied: ""I have seen no question of our credibility from our allies around the world. I've spoken with our NATO allies. … The fact of the matter is I have not seen that. As a matter of fact, the exact opposite I've gotten. The exact opposite thing is we're acting with dispatch. We're committing to what we said we would do.""We can’t fact-check what Biden has seen, but we wondered if his main point is accurate: Is it true that no allies have questioned U.S. credibility in light of the chaos in Afghanistan?Biden’s claim is partly right, but leaves out important details.PolitiFact looked through statements on Afghanistan issued by leaders of NATO members, including those that an expert said contributed most to the International Security Assistance Force mission in the country: Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France.The current leaders of those four NATO members have not publicly condemned the U.S. response or questioned its credibility. But some members of foreign governments have challenged the U.S. and NATO on the withdrawal and said that outcomes in Afghanistan weakened the West.And a day after Biden’s claim, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, an ardent defender of U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan,wrote: ""The world is now uncertain of where the West stands because it is so obvious that the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan in this way was driven not by grand strategy but by politics.""The White House press office did not comment on the record for this fact-check.On-the-ground reporting has shown chaotic scenes in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, as people try to leave the country, fearing Taliban reprisals against those who worked with allied forces and the U.S.-backed government. The U.S. and other countries have scrambled to arrange evacuation flights on military and commercial planes.The U.S.’ withdrawal came after nearly two decades of war against the Taliban, which ruled in Kabul from 1996 to 2001 and harbored al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, who planned the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the U.S.A coalition of U.S. and allied forces drove out the Taliban in 2001, but the group swiftly regained power in Afghanistan as U.S. troops began withdrawing from the country under the February 2020agreementbetween the Taliban and the Trump administration.When examining the reaction among allies, the most relevant ones to focus on are the biggest NATO contributors to the mission in Afghanistan, said Teresa Eder, a program associate at the Global Europe Program at the Wilson Center.""Obviously, we have not heard from prime ministers, chancellors, or presidents openly questioning the way this withdrawal was and is being conducted,"" Eder said.But some members of parliament from governing parties, and not just opposition leaders, have spoken up.The criticism hasn’t been targeted just at the United States. Some criticism has also been aimed at NATO and the West in general. The scope also has varied: Some have criticized the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, others have condemned the aftermath, and others have broadly said the outcome in Afghanistan was a failure and proposed re-examining their own approaches to foreign policy. In their criticism, some have referenced their own governments’ accountability.Eder said there is ""some weight"" tocomments from Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Germany’s national parliament and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling party.""I say this with a heavy heart and with horror over what is happening, but the early withdrawal was a serious and far-reaching miscalculation by the current administration,""saidRöttgen, according to Politico. ""This does fundamental damage to the political and moral credibility of the West.""On Aug. 15, the day the Afghan president fled the country and Taliban fighters entered Kabul, Röttgentweetedin German: ""Today is an immeasurable catastrophe. It is the result of the fatal wrong decision by the U.S. to rush to leave Afghanistan & our inactivity following this decision. A failure of the West with dramatic consequences for (Afghanistan) & our credibility.""On Aug. 18, Röttgen alsotweetedthat German and European Union foreign policy can no longer consist of ""just trailing behind the Americans.""Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the U.K. Parliament’s foreign affairs committee,tweeted: ""Afghanistan is the biggest foreign policy disaster sinceSuez. We need to think again about how we handle friends, who matters and how we defend our interests. In Kabul we’ve failed our friends and ourselves. We need to think again, fast.""In aspeech, Tugendhat also called for ""reinvigorating our European NATO partners to make sure that we are not dependent on a single ally, on the decision of a single leader.""Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defense committee in the British Parliament, has questioned the sincerity of Biden’s foreign policy messaging.""People are bewildered that after two decades of this big, high-tech power intervening, they are withdrawing and effectively handing the country back to the people we went in to defeat,""Ellwood told the Washington Post. ""This is the irony. How can you say America is back when we're being defeated by an insurgency armed with no more than (rocket-propelled grenades), land mines and AK-47s?""Latvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a radio interview that ""this kind of troop withdrawal caused chaos,"" and that ""unfortunately, the West, and Europe in particular, are showing they are weaker globally,"" the Postreported.Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief,calledthe developments a ""catastrophe for the Afghan people, for the Western values and credibility and for the developing of international relations.""Among current leaders of NATO countries, Czech President Milos Zeman took direct aim at the U.S. ""I think that by leaving Afghanistan, the Americans have lost the prestige of a global leader and NATO itself has raised doubts about the legitimacy of its existence,"" Zeman said,according to a Times of India report thatcited Czech media.Public statements fromMerkel,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson,French President Emmanuel MacronandItaly’s prime minister Mario Draghihave emphasized the need to evacuate from Afghanistan their citizens and Afghans who have helped the allied mission, as well as a commitment to the protection of human rights and freedoms in Afghanistan.After the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, Merkelsaidthe developments were ""bitter, dramatic and appalling, especially for the people in Afghanistan."" She also praised international cooperation on evacuations and said that the ""allies and of course the Federal Armed Forces along with numerous civilian organisations had accomplished an enormous amount.""Foreign policy experts told us that it’s important to put some of the criticism in context. There may be a political agenda behind them, or an effort to protect a leader’s legacy, said Sara Bjerg Moller, an assistant professor at the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University.In Germany, for example, ruling-party leaderArmin Laschet, who called the allied withdrawal a ""debacle,"" is running in a close election to succeed Merkel as chancellor, Moller noted.In Europe, ""politicians are having to answer to their own publics about the role their governments played in Afghanistan over the years,"" Moller said, ""as well as trying to head off criticism regarding ​challenges they are facing getting their own people and ​local partners out by shifting attention and blaming Washington.""Zeman’s comments are primarily geared toward a domestic audience and ""have no larger consequences for NATO or the United States,"" Eder said. Zeman, who is head of state, but not head of government, is known for his Russian-friendly stance, experts said.NATO allies have known about the U.S. withdrawal, and many got their own forces out in advance, precisely because they knew Biden's timetable, Moller said.""Telling the media now they are shaken by Biden's withdrawal timetable and would have preferred to maintain the status quo — which wasn't a status quo — is hypocrisy at best and a bald face lie, at worst,"" Moller said.Some members of foreign governments who are speaking out may be using the moment to push for concessions from the United States in future policy discussions, said Joshua Shifrinson, an associate professor of international relations at Boston University.""The fact that we haven’t seen the castigation of U.S. credibility in an overt, dramatic way is a more telling indicator,"" said Shifrinson.Experts said that the U.S. withdrawal in Afghanistan and ensuing events aren’t being interpreted as an indicator that the U.S. won’t live up to its commitments to allies, such ascollective defense obligationsunder NATO principles.""I think we can certainly say that we overrated the U.S. planning to withdraw from Afghanistan in an orderly fashion,"" Eder said, ""but I don’t think we can draw any larger conclusions from this and say the United States would not come to the aid of NATO allies in the event of a Russian military attack.""Said Moller: ""I am dubious of the claim that the U.S. departure from Afghanistan has shaken our allies' confidence about U.S. security guarantees elsewhere in the world.""European leaders have emphasized that they want to continue coordinating and working with the United States on evacuations, humanitarian issues and the future stability of the region, Eder said.She said that European leaders also have an interest in waiting to see how things unfold over the next several weeks rather than risking upsetting trans-Atlantic ties on another front.""Some analysts argue that far from diminishing U.S. credibility, the withdrawal from Afghanistan will free up U.S. resources and capabilities that could enhance deterrence vis-à-vis Russia or China,"" Eder said.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Aug. 20saidthat ""NATO remains a strong alliance"" and that North America and Europe must continue to stand together.""The unfolding events in Afghanistan do not change this,"" Stoltenberg said. ""The shifting global balance of power, Russia’s aggressive actions, and the rise of China, make it even more important that we keep a strong trans-Atlantic bond.""Biden said there has been ""no question of our credibility from our allies around the world"" regarding how the U.S. is withdrawing from Afghanistan.Some foreign officials have challenged the U.S. and NATO on the withdrawal from Afghanistan and how it was executed. But experts said that the top leaders of NATO members that most contributed to the NATO mission in Afghanistan have not publicly questioned U.S. credibility. We did not find such criticism from those leaders, either.We rate Biden’s claim Half True."
What was the Contingency and Crisis Response bureau? Examining the Trump-era proposal,-3.67,40.67,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/aug/25/what-was-contingency-and-crisis-response-bureau-ex/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-25,www.politifact.com,"Shortly after the Taliban seized control in Afghanistan, Fox News hosts and other media claimed that President Joe Biden hamstrung U.S. ability to evacuate Americans from crises overseas by dismantling a Trump-era program.The Biden administration said the Contingency and Crisis Response bureau, as the relatively obscure program was called, never existed in a functioning capacity — only that there were plans for it drawn up in the final months of the Trump presidency, and that the Biden team scrapped those plans because the agency already had the same capabilities.Little is known outside the government about the proposed bureau. But thenarrative that emerged on Fox Newsand other media outlets left a misleading impression: that Biden’s State Department had axed a unique, fully operational program meant to oversee all evacuations just weeks before the Taliban’s takeover.""As the Taliban's gaining ground, Biden's team of incompetence killed the Trump-era program to oversee the evacuation of Americans from crisis zones around the world,"" Fox News host Laura Ingrahamsaid Aug. 18.Fox News analyst K.T. McFarland said, ""They got rid of the one group that was poised to help with this great tragedy."" And in astatementto the National Pulse, Trump accused the Biden administration of canceling his ""successful"" program.But how settled the new bureau was — and how helpful it may have been to the evacuation effort in Afghanistan — is not as clear-cut as Ingraham, Trump and others made it seem.The narrative surrounding the Contingency and Crisis Response bureau appeared to originate with anAug. 18 reportfrom the Washington Free Beacon.The website reported that an internal State Department memo from June, a copy of which PolitiFact obtained, approved the ""termination"" and ""discontinuation of the establishment"" of the proposed bureau.Other outletsquickly followed suit with similar reports.But the on-air commentary broadcast to Fox News viewers left out the nuance that early online reports included — namely, that the State Department had said the proposed bureau was redundant and never fully operational.""Not only would the proposed bureau not have introduced any new capabilities to the department, it was never formally established,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to PolitiFact and other outlets. ""Some administrative steps were taken before its establishment was paused, but the day-to-day operations of the team have not changed.""The U.S. military has been evacuating Americans and Afghans from Afghanistan on its flights, and the Pentagon recentlyorderedU.S. airlines to supply commercial planes to help. The U.S. has evacuated 70,700 people from Afghanistan since Aug. 14, Bidensaid. Secretary of State Antony Blinkensaid Aug. 25that about 4,500 Americans have been evacuated since the airlift began, and that an estimated 1,500 remain in Afghanistan.People evacuated from Afghanistan arrive at a temporary housing center in Chantilly, Va., on Aug. 22, 2021, after arriving on a flight at Dulles International Airport. (AP)State Department spokesperson Ned Pricerejected the ideathat it was ever fully functional.""We didn’t get rid of any bureau,"" Pricesaid Aug. 19. ""The bureau was never created. The bureau was proposed by the previous administration in its final days.""Price continued:""Importantly, when it was conceived, it was not proposed to introduce any new capabilities whatsoever. And that may have been the cause for concern on a bipartisan basis on Capitol Hill. As you know, there were holds on this idea on a bipartisan basis. Republicans and Democrats opposed this. In fact, the memo that explains what this proposal was to do actually was explicit in saying that it would not bring any new capabilities on board. So when this administration came in, we studied the issue. And we determined, just as lawmakers on a bipartisan basis had determined, that a new bureau, a whole new structure, was not the right way to go.""Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress of his plan to create the Contingency and Crisis Response bureau in October 2020, weeks before the presidential election.The intent was to avoid a repeat of the 2012 Benghazi attack, Pompeotold the National Review. The notification he sent Congress said the bureau would provide ""aviation, logistics, and medical support capabilities for the department's operational bureaus,"" the Washington Free Beacon reported.But when the notification reached the lawmakers in charge of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, they stalled action on it, placing the notification on a hold while they sought more information.A congressional aide to Democratic leadership told PolitiFact that the committees wanted to know more in part because the proposal came weeks before the election, and in part because it would have involved a rapid realignment of millions of dollars of resources.Leslie Shedd, a spokesperson forRepublicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the party’s committee leadership lifted their hold after Pompeo answered their questions.The holds of the committees’ Democrats remained in place. Pompeo moved forward with the proposal anyway, a State Department spokesperson told PolitiFact.Some paperwork was signed and filed, according to the House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans. And the State Department’sForeign Affairs Manual, an organizational guide to the agency, lists the bureau as effective as of Jan. 3, when Trump was still in office.But the State Department said only one staff appointment had been made: Dr. William Walters, who had headed up the Directorate of Operational Medicine within the agency’s Bureau of Medical Services, had been assigned as the new bureau’s coordinator.When Biden took office, Blinken put a freeze on the establishment of the bureau for the purpose of reviewing it. Ultimately, he resolved to discontinue it.Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks about Afghanistan during a briefing at the State Department on  Aug. 25, 2021, in Washington. (AP)""CCR has never been in operation, so it would not have been relevant for the current situation (involving Afghanistan),"" said Joseph DeThomas, aprofessorof international affairs at Penn State University, using an acronym for the Trump-era bureau. DeThomas spent 32 years with the State Department and served as the U.S. ambassador to Estonia from 2001 to 2004.""The Department of State can do a lot, especially in conjunction with the U.S. military, without a new bureaucratic structure,"" DeThomas said.Some of the duties of the proposed bureau fall under the purview of the Directorate of Operational Medicine, or OpMed.""OpMed provides the platform and personnel to save American lives around the world, especially in times of crisis,"" Blinken told a Vanity Fair reporter who spent weeks shadowing the team for aMay report. The unit, established in 2013, helped evacuate 100,000 Americans during the early stages of the pandemic, Blinken said.OpMed is responsible for planning and executing medical contingency plans for ""the security of chief-of-mission personnel engaged in high-risk environments worldwide,"" according to the State Department’sForeign Affairs Manual.The OpMed team also maintains standing aviation capability for medical evacuations, the rapid deployment of teams and equipment in emergency situations, and the evacuation of personnel and cargo from posts in crisis, themanual says.Today, OpMed remains under the Bureau of Medical Services and has the same capabilities it had throughout the pandemic, the State Department told PolitiFact.It is ledby the same Dr. William Walters who was to lead the Contingency and Crisis Response bureau.When a crisis like Afghanistan escalates, the State Department will generally create a task force roping together a number of bureaus, DeThomas said. The military and other agencies also get involved.All that makes it misleading for Ingraham and others to suggest that the Biden administration got rid of its only resources for evacuating Americans by hitting cancel on the proposed bureau, said Camille Mackler, a senior visiting fellow on immigration at the Truman Center for National Policy.""This effort is a massive cross-agency, cross-departmental effort,"" Mackler said. ""It wouldn’t have been owned by any one specific department, much less by one sub-bureau."""
Joe Biden is wrong when he says car prices are back to pre-pandemic levels,0.0,43.0,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/23/joe-biden/joe-biden-wrong-when-he-says-prices-new-used-cars-/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.politifact.com,"During a recent CNN town hall, a questioner pressed President Joe Biden about price increases during the economic recovery, including higher prices for cars.""First of all, the good news is the economy is picking up significantly,"" Biden said during theJuly 21town hall in Cincinnati. ""It's rational, when you think about it. The cost of an automobile is kind of back to what it was before the pandemic.""That’s not correct, by any metric we could find.A shortage in microchips has slowed new-car production, and a decreased supply of new cars has pushed more potential purchasers into the used car market. That, in turn, has prompted prices of used cars to skyrocket. Meanwhile, there’sno immediate end in sightfor the microchip shortage, so the higher prices could be with us for a while.The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Federal data shows the comparison clearly. Every month, the federal government computes the increase in prices for a wide variety of consumer goods, including new and used cars.Fornew and used cars, prices were stable for years but began to increase in the summer of 2020. By June 2021, prices were up almost 21% over their level right before the pandemic hit.Most of this increase was driven by prices for used cars.New carsrose by 5.3% over that period, butused carsrose by 43.3%.This trend is echoed by data compiled by private-sector companies that track auto sales.Kelley Blue Book found that the average transaction price for a new light vehicle hit a record in June 2021, at $42,258. ""In June, for the first time in a decade, vehicle buyers were essentially paying sticker price – the manufacturer's suggested retail price – for new vehicles,""saidKayla Reynolds, an industry intelligence analyst at Cox Automotive, which owns Kelley Blue Book.Edmunds, which tracks automobile prices,foundthat even well-worn vehicles are flying off sales lots with big premiums. The average transaction price for vehicles with mileage between 100,000 and 110,000 climbed 31% to a record $16,489 in June 2021, compared with $12,626 a year earlier.And J.D. Powerfoundthat wholesale auction prices for used cars, which help determine the prices that consumers face downstream, are 39% above their level in December 2020.We should note that the chip shortage is not the only factor in the price rise. Consumer preferences — mainly for bigger, more tricked-out vehicles — have driven price increases for several years.Americans have been ""opting to purchase more expensive and larger vehicles, even during the pandemic,"" said Talia James-Armand, an associate director for communications with Edmunds. She shared Edmunds data showing that passenger cars are relatively affordable, whereas SUVs and trucks are doing the most to push up average vehicle prices.In any case, none of the data shows that prices are headed down to where they were before the pandemic, as Biden said.Biden said that ""the cost of an automobile, it's kind of back to what it was before the pandemic.""It’s not back to where it was, or even close. Federal and private-sector data agrees: New and used car prices are on an upward trajectory, smashing records along the way.We rate the statement False."

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has been an outspoken critic of vaccines and masks to stop the spread of COVID-19. After she tweeted that the disease was a threat only to people who are obese or over 65 — very inaccurate medical guidance — Twitter banned her for 12 hours.Greene held a news conference and was promptly asked if she herself was vaccinated.""Your first question is a violation of my HIPAA rights,"" Greene saidJuly 20. ""You see, with HIPAA rights, we don’t have to reveal our medical records, and that also involves our vaccine records.""HIPAA is theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and it contains rules governing the privacy of medical information.But the law has no bearing on whether Greene can be asked about her medical history, according to both legal experts and official HIPAA guidelines. Whether she answers is a matter of personal choice, not the law.TheU.S. Health and Human Service Departmentsummarizes HIPAA as setting ""rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information."" This mainly targets insurance companies and health care providers, which are among the parties the law calls ""covered entities."" These entities can’t share your health records without your permission. If they do, they face stiff penalties.Notably, employers are not on the list of covered entities.Greene described HIPAA as though it conferred a special protection against being asked about her medical history. Mark Rothstein, a University of Louisville law professor specializing in HIPAA, said Greene is mistaken.""It is not a general shield that permits individuals to avoid disclosing their own health information,"" Rothstein said.""Individuals often must disclose their health information, or authorize the disclosure by a HIPAA covered entity, when applying for employment, life insurance, etc.,"" Rothstein said. ""The individual does not have to release the health information, but then they may not be hired or offered insurance.""On the specific matter of vaccination status, employers arefree to askworkers if they have gotten the shot. That means any member of the public, including the media, can ask the question of a government official who works for them.""That is not a HIPAA violation, and employees may decide whether to provide that information to their employer,"" theHHS said.Greene’s director of communications, Nick Dyer, told us, ""Congresswoman Greene’s medical records, including her vaccination status, are none of the media’s business.""Greene said questions from reporters about whether she’s been vaccinated violate her HIPAA rights.That’s not true. HIPAA gives people the right to control how hospitals and insurance companies share their medical records, but it gives no blanket protection against being asked health questions, or having to answer them.Employers may ask employees if they are vaccinated, without running afoul of HIPAA, according to federal guidelines.Greene can sidestep the question as a matter of personal choice, but not because of HIPAA.We rate this claim False."
Are high lumber prices 'tied' to the Trump administration?,0.0,43.67,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/23/alma-adams/are-high-lumber-prices-tied-trump-administration/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.politifact.com,"A North Carolina congresswoman says former President Donald Trump is partly to blame for an increase in lumber prices.U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Charlotte area Democrat, raised the issue when questioning Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about inflation during acommittee meetingon July 14.Adams wanted to know why Powell believes the recent inflation trends are temporary. And while winding up for her question, she said a rise in lumber prices ""can be tied to the previous administration’s actions.""""My local housing partnership had to pause construction of an affordable housing site because of a funding gap caused by the spike in lumber prices. And while lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions, I know that many are still concerned about the rise in core prices.""""So I’m hoping you can help us put some of these concerns to bed. So would you tell us why you believe the recent inflation trends are temporary as the economy reopens and what other factors are playing into the upward pressure on prices?""Later that day, a Twitter user challenged Adams’ explanation. She responded by elaborating on her comments in a tweet.""The Trump Administration's high tariffs on Canadian lumber drove prices higher. Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic compounded the problem and drove prices even higher,"" shetweetedon July 14.Is she right about that?Trump did place a tariff on Canadian lumber and it’s fair for Adams to point out that it caused lumber prices to rise, experts told us. However, experts say lumber prices are more complicated than her statement suggests.There are a number of reasons why the recent rise in lumber prices isn’t entirely — or even primarily a result of — Trump’s tariffs.By the time Trump imposed tariffs on lumber in 2017, prices were already on the rise because of uncertainty surrounding an expiredtrade agreement. The U.S. and Canada had a 10-year trade pact that expired at the end of 2016.David Logan, director of tax and trade analysis for the National Association of Home Builders,wrote in March 2017that ""failure to reach a new (trade) agreement is the primary catalyst of market-wide price increases.""A month later, theTrump administration announcedtariffs of 20% on Canadian lumber and up to 24% on specific lumber companies.Lumber prices have a history of being volatile, experts told PolitiFact. They can range from $300 to $600 per thousand board feet when in stable economic times.The price hovered just below $400 per thousand board feet inearly 2017, and then rose to $600 by summer 2018.It’s fair to say Trump’s tariffs contributed to that rise, experts told PolitiFact. Other factors played a role too. Lumber market expert Paul F. Jannke, a principal at Forest Economic Advisors, told theNew York Timesthat a reduction in the supply of Canadian lumber also contributed to the rise in prices.Fast forward to 2020. When the pandemic takes hold, some saw mills shut down or cut production as they anticipate decreased demand. But their predictions were wrong.More Americans started to work from home and decided to undertake home renovation projects. Demand for lumber rises and prices reach $950 per thousand board feet in September,according to the NAHB.In the meantime, theWorld Trade Organization ruledin August that the Trump administration’s justification for the 2017 lumber tariff was off-base. And late last year, the U.S. Commerce Department slashed the softwood lumber tariff to 9%.Last year’s rise in prices was just the start. Lumber prices hit an all-time high of $1,670 per thousand board feet this May as demand rose for a limited supply,CNBC reported.The lumber industry’s struggle to keep up with demand has been well-documented in American media, fromVoxandCNNtoFortuneandBloomberg. Experts told PolitiFact there are many factors that determine the price of lumber. Trump’s tariff is one of those factors but isn’t the leading cause of the spike.The price increases ""can be traced back to mill closures and a massive reduction of output upon reopening based on the incorrect assumption that the housing market would indefinitely tank,"" Logan, the NAHB expert,told PolitiFact in April.Sam Spencer, a spokesperson for Adams, said the Congresswoman’s tweet accurately summarized the effect of tariffs.""The price of lumber can be tied to the tariffs: if there is a supply crunch, the fact that we’re artificially elevating the price of that specific commodity’s importation by default contributes to the rise in prices,"" Spencer said in an email.While the tariffs certainly helped cause lumber prices to jump in 2018, ""that second round increase isn’t related to the Trump tariff,"" saidVincent Smith, an expert in agricultural policy at the American Enterprise Institute. ""That was a demand side driven surge.""Adams is ""not wrong about the impact of the Trump tariffs in 2017,"" Smith said, adding: ""that doesn’t explain the surge in prices subsequently.""The softwood lumber tariff ""doesn't help,"" said Thomas A. Firey, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and managing editor of itsRegulation Magazine.""However, the tariff is set and adjusted by statute, and it's unfair for the congresswoman to blame Trump for initiating it (or Biden, whose administration is obligated to raise it),"" Firey told PolitiFact in an email.Fact-checkers atUSA Todayreached a similar conclusion.Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Cato Institute, says the fluctuating cost of lumber in the U.S. is a result of a trade system that’soverdue for reform. The regulations affecting how much lumber is made available, who’s allowed to produce it, and how it’s taxed -- are designed to benefit the American lumber industry, sometimes at the expense of the consumer. The system’s drawbacks are exacerbated during seasons of high demand.""It's factually true that the Trump administration’s Commerce Department applied the tariffs, but beyond that casting the blame is pretty nonsensical,"" Lincicome said.Experts pointed out too that Biden was in office as lumber prices peaked, and hasn’t acted to reduce the tariffs. The Commerce Department is now proposing to double the lumber tariff to 18%.CNNandFortune Magazinereport that Biden, for his part, has yet to take a stance on the proposal.Adams, referencing Trump’s time as president, said ""lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions."" She later tweeted an assertion that Trump’s tariffs were a cause.Trump increased the tariff on Canadian lumber in 2017 and prices rose in the following year. However, prices skyrocketed even higher in the last year as a result of pandemic-era market changes. Economists say that’s largely the result of unforeseen issues of supply and demand.While Trump’s tariffs contributed to the record-high lumber prices, economists say it’s misleading to blame them entirely.Adams’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True."
Kamala Harris exaggerates food and water laws for voters,0.0,48.0,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/15/kamala-harris/fact-checking-kamala-harris-claim-food-water-hando/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,www.politifact.com,"Vice President Kamala Harris said that state lawmakers have proposed hundreds of laws that will suppress or make it difficult for people to vote, and that one way state lawmakers have sought to curtail access to the ballot is to cut off food or water to voters in line.""They are punishing people for standing in line to vote,"" Harris told Soledad O’Brien during aninterview on BET. ""They are saying ‘Well, if you are going to be standing in that line for all those hours, you can’t have any water or any food.’""A White House spokesperson said Harris was referring to a bill that passed inGeorgiaearlier this year, arestriction passed a few years ago in Montanaand aproposed billin Florida.We found that Harris’s comments have some basis in fact, but she also exaggerates how restrictive some of the laws are.Nationwide, we found laws that expressly ban distributing food and water to voters are scarce. And of course, voters are always free to bring their own food or water.Giveaways of food and water to voters waiting in line are fairly common where allowed, though. Voting rights advocates have long organized efforts to give away bottles of water or food near polling sites where residents wait in line for hours to vote, especially inBlack-majority neighborhoods. Activists call this ""line warming"" and say that it helps voters withstand the wait to cast a ballot, sometimes in hot weather or during lunch or dinner time.But states also commonly ban bribing voters or ban electioneering within a certain distance of polling places, to prevent undue influence on voters. States routinely set up perimeters at polling sites to allow voters to stand in line to vote without campaign workers handing them literature on behalf of candidates.The most restrictive law we could find about food and water for voters is in Georgia. The statepassed a law in 2021that says, in part, no one shall give ""any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink"" within 25 feet of voters standing in line.Violations of this law are a misdemeanor and punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.The bill also states that poll workers can make available ""self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote."" But nothing in the law requires poll workers to make water easily available to voters in line.A previous statelawalready made it a felony to give gifts ""for the purpose of registering as a voter, voting, or voting for a particular candidate."" That provision doesn’t mention food or water specifically, but in 2020Secretary of State Brad Raffenspergerinterpreted it to include food or water.Laws in Montana, New York and Florida are not as stringent as GeorgiaMontana’s 2015 law, signed by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock,  bans candidates and individuals working on their behalf from distributing food or drinks to voters at or near a polling place. A Montana court used an earlier statute to remove a sheriff from office following the1938 electionbecause he handed out ""large quantities of beer, by the bottle and by the keg.""The White House pointed to aproposed bill in Floridathat initially banned giving ""any item"" to voters. But thelawthat ultimately passed instead expands the pre-existing solicitation ban to include zones around dropboxes and ""engaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter."" While that law doesn’t mention food or water, critics of the law fear it could be interpreted that way.We found thatNew York’s lawbans giving ""meat, drink, tobacco, refreshment or provision"" to voters unless it has a value of less than $1 and is given without any identification of the person or group supplying it. The law has been on the books fordecades, with the $1 cap being added in 1992. New York’s law would allow someone to buy bottles of water or cheap snacks in bulk and hand them out anonymously to voters. Georgia’s law makes no such exceptions.It is possible for a court to interpret an electioneering ban to include food handouts to voters at the polls, but it doesn’t happen often.Snopesfound that the Supreme Court of Kentucky in 1997ruledthat an alderman running for election wrongly handed out food at voting precincts that was intended for poll workers, although the alderman acknowledged that anyone at the sites could take the food. The court ruled that the candidate handing out free boxes of chicken while speaking to voters amounted to electioneering near the building.Harris said new or proposed state laws on voting mean ""if you are going to be standing in that line for hours, you can’t have any water or any food.""This is an exaggeration. People voting in line can still eat or drink. In some places, they may have to bring their own food and water.What Harris is talking about are laws aimed at stopping organized food and water giveaways. Georgia passed a law this year that bans handing out food and water to voters in line. Montana passed a law in 2015 that bans candidates or people on their behalf from distributing food and water to voters in line. A law that passed in Florida this year bans engaging in any activity to influence a voter, but it doesn’t specifically mention handing out food or water.It’s important to note that these laws are rare. And, they don’t literally ban eating or drinking in line; rather, they ban organized giveaways that violate anti-electioneering rules spelled out in state law.We rate this statement Mostly False.PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this fact-check."

Henry McMaster, whocharacterized the effortas ""enticing, coercing, intimidating, mandating, or pressuring"" people to take the vaccine.

(Read more about ourpartnership with Facebook.)First, there’s no evidence that the door-to-door effort involves coercion — the use of force or threats to persuade the unwilling — to get people vaccinated. Second, the White House says the program does not involve federal employees or government members.  Third, while COVID-19 vaccines are being used in the U.S. under emergency authorization, calling them ""experimental"" ignores the fact that they have been fully tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. They have been found to be safe, effective and potentially life-saving, keeping people from getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. We rated a similar claim calling the vaccines ""experimental""Mostly False.Biden’s Press Secretary Jen Psakisaid in a press briefing thatthe people knocking on doors aren’t federal employees or members of the government. ""They are volunteers. They are clergy. They are trusted voices in communities who are playing this role and door knocking.""The door-to-door campaigns have been organized mostly at the local level and are in the vein of otheron-the-groundeffortsthat have been a staple of public healthoutreachfor years. Cities likeDetroit,Washington,MilwaukeeandChicagoall run programs that send people door to door to help inform unvaccinated people about the COVID-19 vaccines.There is also no evidence that these efforts involve ""coercion."" In Louisiana, for example, where such an effort hasbeen underway for months, health officials say canvassers are given ""motivational interviewing"" training which starts an open dialogue with residents about their thoughts around COVID-19 vaccines.""The decision to be vaccinated is a personal one, and the canvassers provide educational information,"" said Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for Louisiana’s Department of Health. If a resident is not interested in receiving vaccine information, ""the canvasser offers materials that the resident can review on their own and then moves on to the next house,"" Litten said.In North Carolina’sMecklenburg County, health officials recently started sending out a health department vehicle staffed by medical professionals who can provide on-site vaccinations if people want them. This ""doses to the door"" program followed weeks of door knocking to sign people up, especially inneighborhoods with lower vaccination ratesthat have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.""It’s not confrontational,"" said community organizer Robert Dawkinsin an interviewwith WCNC in Charlotte. ""It's not like you've got to get the shot, but it’s our job to dispel those rumors.""Dawkins leads Action NC, one of the organizing groups involved in that canvassing effort. He said the complication with door-to-door outreach has been follow-up, so the addition of the mobile unit is helpful. ""We get people that will say ‘Yes I’ll get the shot,’ but the follow-up has always been the issue. Will they go? How can we get people to go out and go?""According to Psaki, the Biden administration has funded door-knocking programs like this since April, and this is just one tactic that's been used to increase vaccination rates in June.She said the results have been measurable. ""Alabama: The adult vaccination rate increased by 3.9%; 149,000 additional adults got their first dose in June,"" Psaki said, with the adult vaccination rate increasing by 4.4% in Florida and 3.5% in Georgia.""In our view, this is a way to engage and empower local activists, trusted members of the community,"" Psaki said.The term ""experimental"" is often used by vaccine skeptics. But, as we havereported before, the phrase is subjective and ignores the amount of research that is required before the vaccines are authorized for distribution. Researchers have been studying and working with the mRNA technology that is at work in the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shotsdating back to the 1990s. The viral vector platform used in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was approved for use for other health emergencies such as Ebola.The mRNA vaccines, such as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines ""are a new type of vaccine, but are not unknown,"" a spokesperson with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.The mRNA vaccines work by teaching cells how to make a protein, or just a piece of a protein, which triggers the body to produce antibodies that prevent infection.Viral vector vaccines such as Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, were created in the 1970s. They use a modified, but harmless version of a different virus, called a vector, to make the body produce antibodies.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for all three COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the United States. The vaccines are pending full approval by the FDA, but they have been found safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.Before they were authorized for emergency use, COVID-19 vaccines were subjected to clinical trials conducted with tens of thousands of participants to collect scientific data. After three trial phases with varying levels of complexity, the FDA determined that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccines.An Instagram post claimed that federal agents were going door-to-door ""coercing people to be injected with experimental drugs.""Door-to-door canvassing efforts to get people vaccinated have been underway at the local level for months, as part of a push to increase vaccination rates. But the people involved are not federal employees or government members, according to the White House. They have been community organizers and volunteers. Some communities have augmented the effort with on-site mobile vaccination clinics for those who want the shot.But there is no indication that the door-to-door tactics involve coercion — the use of force or threats to compel someone to do something they are unwilling to do.What’s more, the COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. are not ""experimental drugs."" They were subjected to clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people before being given emergency use authorization.We rate this claim Mostly False."
Are state legislators really seeking power to overrule the voters?,-5.33,43.67,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jul/14/are-state-legislators-really-seeking-power-overrul/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,www.politifact.com,"In aspeechon voting rights in Philadelphia, President Joe Biden vowed that his administration would fight back against new voting restrictions pushed by allies of former President Donald Trump.State legislators are now engaged in a ""broad assault against voting,"" Biden said July 13. Among the threats he cited were efforts to move power away from independent election administrators and toward partisan actors with the power to overturn election results.""This is election subversion,"" Biden said. ""It’s the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history. Never before have they decided who gets to count ... what votes count.""Some state legislators want to make it harder for you to vote,"" he added. ""And if you vote, they want to be able to tell you your vote doesn’t count for any reason they make up. They want the ability to reject the final count and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate loses.""(The video suggests that Biden said ""legislators,"" even though the official White Housetranscriptshowed ""legislatures."" We are checking what we heard him say.)Biden’s charge is extremely serious: Having votes counted fairly and accurately is at the heart of the process of democracy. But when we looked into the specifics, Biden's claim about legislators wanting to be able to overturn the voters' will wasn’t as clear cut as he made it sound.Much of the attention on this issue has focused on the Republican-backed law passed earlier this year inGeorgia. A provision in the law gives power to the state election board to suspend local election officials. Some Democrats have predicted Republicans will use that power to overturn results, but that’s speculative rather than a certainty.A White House spokesperson told PolitiFact that Biden was referring not to Georgia but to Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the White House provided specifics about the actions that have been taken in each state.In Arizona, a Republican legislator offered a bill this year that would allow a majority of the Legislature to revoke the certification of an election by the secretary of state. However, the bill has not passed.Arizona did pass legislation that would strip authority for handling election-related litigation from the secretary of state (who is currently a Democrat) and hand it to the attorney general (who is currently a Republican).As for Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the actions cited by the White House weren’t new legislative efforts, but rather efforts by individual legislators last year to overturn Trump’s losses in those states.Meanwhile, Arkansas and Kansas have passed laws that critics warn could be used to overturn elections, but the text of the laws doesn’t clearly spell out those powers.Ultimately, we decided that Biden’s statement is too speculative for us to render a Truth-O-Meter rating. However, we did take a closer look at the evidence the White House cited and examples from other states.The White House pointed tonews coverageof a bill proposed by a Republican lawmaker that would have given the Legislature power to take away the secretary of state’s power in certifying the presidential election.State Rep. Shawnna Bolick, a Republican representing Phoenix, introducedHouse Bill 2720in January to allow amajority vote of the Legislatureto ""revoke the secretary of state’s issuance or certification of a presidential elector’s certificate of the election."" The bill didn’t require that the Legislature hold any hearings, be in session, or cite a reason.Bolick argued in a February op-ed in theWashington Examinerthat the bill would distribute power to certify electors among ""90 elected members of the House and Senate,"" instead of just one official — the secretary of state.Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat elected in 2018,tweetedin response to the bill: ""So really, we should just get rid of the presidential election altogether? In reality, that’s what this bill would do.""While the bill drew a lot of media attention, it didn’t reach a vote before the legislative session ended.  (Bolick announced thatshe is running for secretary of state. Hobbs is running for governor.)So this bill cited by the White House is an example of a legislator proposing a route to reject the final count, but it didn’t gain traction.However, Arizona Republicans did successfullypass legislationthat stripped Hobbs of the power to defend election lawsuits and handed it to the attorney general, currently Republican Mark Brnovich. The law applies through Jan. 2, 2023, the end of Hobbs’ term. It would expire before the next presidential election.The White House did not cite this legislation, and the law does not hand power to legislators, but it does effectively hand more power to the Republicans currently in office.The White House pointed tonews coverageof a December 2020 resolution proposed by some Republicans in the PennsylvaniaHouseandSenate. The resolutioncalled forwithdrawing certification of Biden’s win and having the GOP-controlled Legislature appoint the presidential electors instead.The Legislature’s top Republicans — Senate President Jake Corman, House Speaker Bryan Cutler, Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward and House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff — collectivelysaidthey would not go along with the resolution, and Pennsylvania’s electoral votes were ultimately cast for Biden.So the Pennsylvania example showed an appetite among some Republicans for claiming the power to overturn election results, but it was short-circuited by Republican legislative leaders, and did not involve an effort to enshrine the power in future elections, other than possibly setting a precedent for it.The White House pointed us tonews coverageof the decision by two Republican members of Wisconsin’s state Assembly — Jeff Mursau and David Steffen — to join afederal lawsuitby the Wisconsin Voter Alliance seeking to keep Congress from certifying the Electoral College results. The plaintiffs asked the court to give state legislatures final approval over election results.Steffentold Wisconsin Public Radioafter joining the suit that ""powers assigned to legislators in either the state or United States Constitution, such as voting, district map design or elector determinations, are not transferable to a bureaucracy, organization or other third party.""This argument didn’t hold water in court, however. On Jan. 4, 2021, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg ruled against the plaintiffs,writingthat ""the suit rests on a fundamental and obvious misreading of the Constitution. It would be risible were its target not so grave: the undermining of a democratic election for president of the United States.""After the ruling, the legislatorswithdrewtheir suit. Boasberg later asked a judicial committee to consider sanctioning their attorney for bringing the case.Like the Pennsylvania example the White House cited, the Wisconsin example showed that at least some Republican legislators sought to have legislatures granted the power to overturn election results. But this effort was also shut down, this time in the courts, and it did not involve an effort to enshrine the power in future elections.We found two other states where legislation already passed this year could arguably shift the power to decide elections, but in both cases, as with the Georgia law, the impacts are speculative.In Arkansas, the Legislature passedH.B. 1803, and Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson allowed it to become law without his signature.The billprovidesgreater power for the existing State Board of Election Commissioners, which is largely filled by political appointees, to investigate violations of election laws and ""institute corrective actions."" The law permits the board to probe ""certification of election results, administration of an election, election processes, (and) conduct of an election,"" and some criticsarguethat this language could enable the board to overturn elections. But that remedy is not spelled out in the law, so that interpretation is uncertain.In Kansas,H.B. 2332was passed by the state’s Republican Legislature and enacted despite a veto by the Democratic governor, Laura Kelly. The impact of this bill for certifying election results is even less clear.A portion of the bill says that ""the secretary of state shall not enter into any consent decree or other agreement with any state or federal court regarding the enforcement of any election law or the alteration of any election procedure without specific approval of such consent decree by the legislative coordinating council.""RELATED:All fact-checks about elections"
"Suspended from social media, Donald Trump turns to traditional media avenues to push falsehoods",-7.33,44.67,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jul/14/suspended-social-media-donald-trump-turns-traditio/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,www.politifact.com,"Donald Trump’s social media posts in the aftermath of the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol got him suspended from Facebook and Twitter amid concerns that his false claims about a stolen election would provoke more violence.HisFacebookorTwitteraccounts have been off limits to him for more than six months.But he hasn’t been silent.Since his exit from the White House, Trump hasheadlined political conferences,hosted rallies,held a press conference,given media interviews,made appearances with political allies, andissued written statements(often several a day).More than that, these outlets have afforded him the same privilege that he once enjoyed on Twitter and Facebook: the ability tospread falsehoodswithout much pushback or restraint. Trump has exploited these opportunities to advance false and misleading claims about, among other things, the 2020 election and Jan. 6, when his supporters stormed the Capitol to block Congress’ constitutional certification of the election results showing he lost to Joe Biden.In recent weeks, for example, Trump has joined a chorus of Republican lawmakers seeking to downplay the events of Jan. 6 and portray the riot as more or less a peaceful protest, even though demonstrators broke windows and attacked law enforcement officers with weapons.In one of Trump’s latest Fox News interviews, he made severalbaseless claimsthat wentunchallenged, and were even encouragedby host Maria Bartiromo.Trump claimed that ""we had a corrupt election. We had a rigged election. We had a stolen election.""None of that is true. No legitimate evidence has emerged to prove widespread fraud or stolen votes that would change the outcome of the election.At one point, Bartiromo said that according to a conservative website, The Federalist, ""new evidence indicates enough illegal votes in Georgia to tip the 2020 results."" That disregards the fact that Georgia’s top elections official, a Republican, has stood by the state’s election procedures anddismissed claimsabout fraud.At Bartiromo’s nudging, Trump claimed that ""there were no guns whatsoever"" during the riot at the Capitol.That’s false. Some people brought guns onto Capitol grounds, according to charging documents for crimes related to the insurrection. Many people used other weapons, such as clubs and flagpoles.Trump described Jan. 6 as ""a lovefest between the police, the Capitol Police, and the people that walked down to the Capitol."" That’s contradicted by the facts, including abipartisan Senate report,video evidenceand acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman, whosaidnearly 150 law enforcement officers were injured. Policefatally shotone woman who was with a group of rioters near the entrance to the House chamber in the Capitol.During his first campaign and his time in office, cable networks routinely aired Trump’s daily movements and speeches live, misinformation and all. Some have since limited their coverage of Trump.""They are paying attention to the news value, if there is one,"" said Aly Colón, a media ethics professor at Washington and Lee University and a former Poynter Institute faculty member. ""If there is not a news value, they see no reason to be a megaphone for someone who may not be advancing anything or advancing things that are not accurate, possibly untrue.""That has opened them up to charges of biased coverage or censorship of a major political leader.That’s why media outlets have to do a better job of explaining to the public how they determine newsworthiness and why certain events are or are not covered, said Laura Castañeda, a professor of professional practice at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.""That could help mitigate charges of bias from the public,"" she said. ""Transparency is key.""Other networks, like Newsmax and One America News Network, cater to an audience of Trump supporters, and they remain all in on Trump news.By airing Trump’s events in full and live, they give their viewers what they want, experts said.""Trump's hardcore supporters will turn to the outlet that carries what they want,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. ""And at the moment, that is all Trump, all the time,""After Trump’s first post-presidency rally,Newsmax saidthat his ""super-charged return to the political stage over the weekend was a ratings smash for Newsmax, which trounced Fox News in key ratings.""Experts said news networks and journalists do a disservice to the public by not treating such events and one-on-one interviews with more scrutiny.""Being complicit in lies is not the proper role of the news media, and journalists should push back against falsehoods and unsubstantiated statements,"" Kirtley said.It’s also journalists' responsibility to bring context and additional information that will help the public understand what is going on, Colón said.""While the former president has sought to use every communication outlet that he can, it doesn't mean that every outlet has to be either a recording or repetition or megaphone for whatever it is that he is asserting,"" Colón said.Where the pro-Trump networks have been more cautious in recent months is in countering claims from Trump and his allies about manipulation of voting machines used in the 2020 election — claims that are the subject of ongoing litigation.Fox News Network is facinga $1.6 billion defamation suitfiled in March by Dominion Voting Systems, alleging that it ""endorsed, repeated and broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies about Dominion.""Fox News is seeking to have the lawsuitdismissedon First Amendment grounds.But on July 11, as it aired live coverage of Trump’s speech at a conservative conference in Dallas, Fox News had an on-screen caption that said: ""The voting system companies have denied the various allegations made by President Trump and his counsel regarding the 2020 election."" According to atweetby Oliver Darcy, a senior media reporter at CNN, the disclaimer appeared on screen for about 40 seconds.Fox News and Newsmax also madeon-air clarificationsin December to disavow unsubstantiated claims that were aired on their shows, in response tocomplaintsfrom Smartmatic, an elections technology and software company.Smartmatic in February filed a $2.7 billiondefamation lawsuitagainst Fox News, some of its on-air hosts and its parent company. They have alsosought to dismissSmartmatic's lawsuit on First Amendment grounds.In addition to the claim about guns at the Capitol, PolitiFact has evaluated several statements Trump has made in TV interviews, speeches and statements about the election and the riot since he left office:In a July 7 press conference to announce that he was filing a lawsuit against several social media platforms: ""The person that shot Ashli Babbitt — boom — right through the head — just boom — there was no reason for that.""False.In a June 27 statement: ""Facts have now come out to show conclusively"" that the 2020 presidential election wasn’t legitimate.Pants on Fire!In a video statement shown June 26 to Wisconsin Republican Party convention delegates: ""In 2020 we won (Wisconsin).""Pants on Fire!In a June 25 statement: Claimed that Republican leaders ""are working hard to cover up election corruption in Wisconsin.""Pants on Fire!In a June 22 statement: Claims that Georgia didn’t update its voter rolls prior to the 2020 presidential election; ""this means we (you!) won the presidential election in Georgia.""Pants on Fire!In a June 5 speech to the North Carolina Republican Convention: ""Republican state senators"" who started an audit of 2020 election results in Arizona’s Maricopa County are ""exposing this fraud.""False.In a May 15 statement: ""The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED!""False.In a Feb. 28 interview with Fox News host Steve Hilton: Claimed he requested ""10,000 National Guardsmen"" for his Jan. 6 rally, but Nancy Pelosi ""rejected it.""False.Trump has also made questionable claims about his own administration’s record and the Biden administration:In an April 19 Fox News interview: ""Human trafficking and drugs"" at the Mexico border have ""doubled, tripled and quadrupled"" since Joe Biden became president.False.In a March 29 statement: Claimed that Deborah Birx ""traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving, only to have them call the police and turn her in. She then ... resigned.""Half True.In a March 21 statement: ""We proudly handed the Biden administration the most secure border in history. All they had to do was keep this smooth-running system on autopilot.""Mostly False.In a Feb. 28 speech at a political conference: Claimed that the voting-rights bill H.R. 1 ""automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote.""Mostly False.In a Feb. 28 speech at a political conference: Claimed that Joe Biden ""has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations, everyone, murderers, everybody, no more.""False."
Murders spiked in 2020. Why?,-2.33,45.33,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jul/14/murders-spiked-2020-why/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,www.politifact.com,"Completely apart from the bipartisan blame game over crime, there is the stark reality that in most American cities, murders have gone up.One survey of America’s larger citiesfound that between 2019 and 2020, homicide deaths rose more than 30%.An analysisof 34 cities found a ""historic increase.""Some Republicans say rising homicides are due to the ""defund the police"" movement and the failures of Democratic urban leaders. Some Democrats point the finger at the wide availability of guns and Republican resistance to police reform.Those are the talking points. The real causes, experts say, are not so clear.No one debates that last year was unique. There was the pandemic and the havoc it wreaked. There were the racial justice protests and, in some cities, periods of vandalism and looting.What all that has to do with rising homicide rates is what mayors, citizens and criminologists are trying to figure out.There are many possible explanations, but it will be months before we have enough hard data to bring the outlines of the driving forces into sharper relief.In the meantime, the numbers we have show that beneath the national trend lines, there’s wide variation among cities, making it even more difficult to pinpoint causes.Apreliminary FBI crime reportfor 154 cities shows that murders rose 10% across the group in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. But look closer and you find that the increase was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same.As far as Ben Frazier can tell, the problem predates 2020. Frazier, an activist in Jacksonville, Fla., heads up the Northside Coalition, a community group focused on stopping the shootings in the handful of neighborhoods where about two-thirds of the city’s murders take place. One ZIP code in that area has been dubbed ""the killing fields.""""For us, 2019 was the pivotal year,"" Frazier said. ""I can’t see a difference due to the pandemic. Because what we saw happen in 2020, started before.""In 2019, murders in Jacksonville went up 21%. The following year, 2020, the increase was less than half as much — 8%.Frazier said he is hard pressed to find an explanation that doesn’t include the area’s extreme poverty.""Half of the people are living below the federal poverty line,"" Frazier said.""We have double-digit unemployment. The kids walk the streets in roving bands. It’s a very disappointing, depressing picture, to see so many young Black men with nothing to do.""And, Frazier said, there was ready access to weapons.""I have nothing to point to as far as statistics, but I can only tell you that there were far too many guns in the hands of people who should not have them,"" he said.A careful analysis of trends in 34 cities by theCouncil on Criminal Justice, an independent source of crime data, lends support to Frazier’s broader themes, but suggests that in many places, the mix of factors was more complicated.""More disadvantaged cities — those with higher poverty and unemployment rates — experienced greater increases in homicide in 2020,"" the report said.Guns have been readily available for some time, the report said, and there’s no clear evidence yet of a shift there that would explain a rise in murders in 2020.The council’s study of 34 cities found a 24% increase in homicides in the first quarter of 2021, but it notes that three cities in its sample — New York, Chicago and Los Angeles — accounted for 40% of the increase.With great circumspection, the report’s authors concluded that ""while it is impossible to be certain, it is probable that the pandemic, protests, and other factors all combined to create a perfect storm of circumstances pushing homicide rates to record levels.""The hunt for an explanation turns on finding the shifts that incrementally made murder more likely.COVID-19 caused a disproportionate number of deaths in Hispanic and Black communities. TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionnoted the tight association between higher health risks and the markers of economic stress, such as lower incomes and higher unemployment.""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,"" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. ""Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.""Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the pandemic-driven economic downturn also mattered.""Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,"" Ahlin said. ""Last year we saw both at play.""There are signs that work-at-home policies added to domestic homicides.By one count, shooting deaths related to domestic violence rose 4% in 2020.""Women were stuck at home with abusive spouses,"" McCoy said.But as with homicides in general, trends varied widely from place to place, with some cities seeing decreases, and others reporting spikes in the range of 70% or higher, with no clear explanation for the differences.On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the murder of George Floyd. Going back to the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., there has been a running debate over whether such protests over police violence lead to less policing and more crime.Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah said the confrontations between police and protesters played a role in 2020, because they made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.""Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressive steps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,"" Cassell said.Cassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities.This line of thinking often melds with accusations that cities cut police budgets in response to protests.That holds little water. Even as local governments struggled to balance their budgets in the midst of the pandemic,police spending went up, sometimes as a fraction of a city’s budget, but also in absolute terms.Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect in causing police to pull back from everyday enforcement actions. It’s too early to know about 2020, buta detailed study of the so-called Ferguson Effectfound no connection between protests, policing and crime.Researchers Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and Joel Wallman at the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation counted arrests to measure police activity, and compared that with homicide rates. If the Ferguson Effect was real, they argued, homicide rates should go up in places where arrest rates went down.They wrote that while there’s ample evidence that targeted policing does reduce crime, ""we have found little evidence that the 2015 rise in big-city homicide rates resulted from declining arrest rates for violent, property, drug, weapon, and minor crimes.""At the same time, Rosenfeld and Wallman said greater mistrust of police might be a key driver. If people of color don’t think the police will treat them fairly, having more police might not help. Also, residents might hesitate to call police. Homicides could rise as people take matters into their own hands, they suggested.Firearms are far and away the weapon of choice for murder, and sales of guns are up, so it might seem reasonable to link the two. In his response to rising crime, President Joe Biden focused oncracking down on illegal gun sales.But there’s not a reliable correlation between the legal purchases of guns and increases in homicides.Between 2006 and 2014,gun sales doubled, while thehomicide rate fell by 25%.While purchases skyrocketed during the pandemic, criminologist Aaron Chalfin at the University of Pennsylvania told us that guns used in crimes tend to be several years old. A surge in sales in 2020, or even 2019, wouldn’t necessarily translate into more killings last year.""Guns and poverty are the conditions that create fertile ground, but they don't really help us out with the ‘why now?’ part of this phenomenon,"" Chalfin said.Still, Chalfin thinks that the combination of the pandemic and racial justice unrest might have increased gun purchases in certain neighborhoods as residents acted to provide their own protection. He thinks it’s reasonable to infer that the police pulled back to some extent. The mix might explain the rise in homicides.Except that murders began to rise in January and February, before either the pandemic or the protests started.""There are limits to what we can infer,"" Chalfin said. ""It's really hard to understand the world and all of its variations."""
Fact-checking Joe Biden’s figure on unvaccinated COVID-19 deaths,0.0,44.0,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/22/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-bidens-figure-unvaccinated-covid/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,www.politifact.com,"During a CNN town hall, President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated for the coronavirus.""We have a pandemic for those who haven’t gotten a vaccination. It’s that basic, that simple,"" Biden said during theJuly 21town hall in Cincinnati, Ohio. ""Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn’t been vaccinated.""That works out to 99.5% of recent COVID-19 deaths occurring among the unvaccinated population.This statistic has been cited frequently by health officials, though its sourcing is a little opaque.When we asked the White House for a database or peer-reviewed paper to support the statistic, they did not provide one. Instead, they pointed us tocommentsmade at the White House by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.During aJuly 1 White House press briefing, Walensky said the country has made ""incredible progress towards ending the pandemic"" but added that it’s ""clear that communities where people remain unvaccinated are communities that remain vulnerable. This is all true as we monitor the continued spread of the hyper-transmissible delta variant.""Thedelta variantis able to spread faster than previous strains of the novel coronavirus, and now accounts for more thanfour of every fivenew infections in the United States.Specifically, Walensky said, ""preliminary data from a collection of states over the last six months suggest 99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in these states have occurred in unvaccinated people.""Walensky repeated that figure during congressional testimony onJuly 20, suggesting it was still the most recent CDC data available on this question.During a hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., asked Walensky for data on the percentage of deaths involving people who were not vaccinated. She responded, ""In a five-month study from January to May in numerous states, five to six states, it was 99.5%.""Then, during the July 22 White House briefing, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy repeated the 99.5% figure.Journalists at theAssociated Pressconducted an analysis of raw data from the CDC to answer the same question. The analysis, published on June 29, found that 150 of the more than 18,000 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people. That’s about 0.8%, which is very close to the figure Walensky cited.The AP analysis also found that hospitalizations among fully vaccinated people accounted for fewer than 1,200 of more than 107,000 total hospitalizations for the coronavirus, or about 1.1%. Both data points suggested that increased vaccination rates would cut down the total number of hospitalizations and deaths.The CDC did not respond to our inquiry for a database or other evidence in support of the 99.5% figure.That said, medical experts told us that they have a high degree of confidence in Walensky’s statements.""This sounds true,"" said Dr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco. ""The CDC is able to track deaths quite closely based on hospital records and coding.""Dr. Babak Javid, another professor of medicine at UCSF, agreed. ""I haven't seen any peer-reviewed, or even pre-print, data to support this statement, but I would be surprised if it was made up,"" he said.Even from Walensky’s limited description, however, we do know that the data has limitations. Walensky said it is ""preliminary,"" said it included only a half dozen or so states, and added that it runs through May, which makes it about six weeks old.Looking ahead, Javid said that the percentage of deaths occurring in the unvaccinated population may not stay at 99.5% or thereabouts indefinitely, just based on mathematics.""I expect pretty much everyone who isn't fully vaccinated to be infected by delta, or whatever variant supplants it around the corner, in the next year or two, but large numbers of the fully vaccinated will also be infected,"" he said. ""These infections will skew milder, but in the elderly and vulnerable, that doesn't guarantee that 100% of cases won't be serious.""Biden said, ""Ten thousand people have recently died. 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn’t been vaccinated.""Biden is citing a figure that has been offered publicly on at least two occasions by the director of the CDC, Walensky. She cautioned that the data it is ""preliminary,"" is based on only a half dozen or so states, and is now about six weeks old. The CDC has not made public any detailed data or methodology.That said, experts told PolitiFact that they don’t doubt the figure’s accuracy. The figure is also in line with a separate analysis by journalists at the Associated Press.The statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate the statement Mostly True."

It was never physical because we both knew that going so far would invite the wrath of our small yet vicious Haitian-born mom, but we threw verbal jabs at one another like we wanted them to cut into flesh and render each other bloody. After every screaming match, my mother would tell us that we were sisters, and because of that unchangeable bond, we had to get over our differences and unite against outside forces that would happily harm us. Eventually, we'd patch each other up, let go of our qualms, and bond over our mutual hatred of Lucas and Peyton's relationship onOne Tree Hill.I offer this cutesy retelling of my sister's semitraumatic bullying during our adolescence because that's an example of a relationship where it makes sense to work through differences and make amends. Other examples would be your roommate who keeps leaving their towel on the bathroom floor, your coworker who forgets to return your pens, or your neighbor who plays their Spotify Daily Mix a little too loudly in the mornings. One relationship that is decidedly not on this list is the one between you and the far-right extremist who believes so fervently in the mockery of a man who promised to make their bigoted dreams come true thatthey besieged the US Capitol on Jan. 6.The moment Joe Biden and Kamala Harris wereprojected as the winners of the 2020 Electionon Nov. 7, political pundits on both sides began to sow seeds of ""unification"" in listeners' ears. The idea thatBiden voters should show empathy for Trump supportershas become a topic of discussion, as if those supporters are owed some solace for losing the election. Even celebrity figures are getting in on the action, with Dave Chappelle using his opening monologue forSaturday Night Live's Nov. 7 episode to ask Biden voters to be ""humble"" in their victory.To that I say,""No 💙.""Over the last four years, the only thing the Trump presidency has done efficiently is embolden racists, white nationalists, and QAnon believers. Whether they voted for him in 2016 or 2020, they did so for policies bred from hatred. They voted for a man who accepted endorsements from neo-Nazi groups, pledged to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, called forrollbacks of federal healthcare protections,initiated the ""Deploy or Get Out"" policy, tried to start a ""Muslim ban,"" attacked Roe v. Wade, rolled backexisting LGBTQ+ protections, anddid everything wrongwhen COVID-19 hit.Everything the Trump presidency has ever stood for has been to keep marginalized communities under the boot of oppression. Though Trump's base is wealthy white people whoknowwhat he's doing, his supporters tend to be (largely) white masses who believe everything wrong is the fault of those who are different from them. The people who see immigrants as invaders, Black people as mindless thugs who need to be put down, and everyone else as obstacles to their battle to ""make America great again."" The insurgents whoinvaded the Capitol with no fear for their livesdidn't do so because they were worried about the economy or the state of the world. They did so because they were throwing a tantrum ata threat to theirpower. A video from the insurrection by Robert Moore, ITV News Washington correspondent, shows peopletalking about going into ""their"" building, where the people there work for them, and demanding that their election be put right because the country stole it from them.There are a lot of reasons to be angry about the uprising and even worried about what will happen next (becausesomethingwillhappen next). What I won't abide is any call for forgiveness or the talking point that the left should extend compassion to those who stormed the capitols in DC,Georgia, andKansas. What compassion should I have for the people who fly the flags of white supremacy? Why should I try to understand people who think the best version of our country is during the Jim Crow era or people whoreenact the murder of an innocent manfor sh*ts and giggles? Why do they deserve grace when they've done nothing but do their best to violently ensure their power remains intact?Image Source:Getty / Andrew Caballero-ReynoldsFor so long, the narrative has been that those who support the Republican party and have supported Trump are afraid.Economic anxiety, they called it. But if his supporters were truly concerned about the future of their economic prospects, they wouldn't trust the manwho hasn't delivered a majority of his promisesand can't even provide them with financial security during a pandemic! At the root of it all,racism got Trump elected, and it's what fueled his followers to do their best to overthrow the results of a free and fair election in a fascist attempted coup. Just as Trump's election was a response to Barack Obama's presidential run, this insurrection was a response to those supporters' perceived threat to white supremacy with the election of Joe Biden, his multiracial cabinet, anda Democrat-controlled Senate.What do I have to say to people whoequate the Black Lives Matter movementto white power tantrums because oflost elections? Am I supposed to give mercy tothe Republicans who backed Trump's claims that the election was stolenand the results should be contested? Are we supposed to forget that they spent four yearsstoking the flames of his madness? Just pat Mitch McConnell on the head like he didn't do his damnedest tokeep us from receiving substantial aidduring a pandemic?I do not doubt that after Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn into office, the major talking point will be that this is a time to ""heal together"" and ""move forward as one nation."" Hell,it's already happening. But the truth of the matter is, this has never beenonenation. We have always been divided, and we will continue to be so as long as we haveone set of laws for Black peopleand another for white people, a law system bolstered by our radicalized two-party system.It's a system where one side casually slips into a full-blown fascist cult that blithely startsseparating children from their parentswith no chances ofreuniting them, stripping people of their reproductive rightsthrough mass sterilizationandother policies, and generally does its best to f*ck over the American people while pointing the finger at everyone else. Then, the other side plays the part of progressive politics while stalling on making any actual decisions until it's too late and their hands are forced or there's nothing to be done. A party that continues to pander to the people who hate them, rather than focus onthose who continue to vote in their favor.Image Source:Getty / Joseph PreziosoI don't have the solution to fix the foundational rot this country was built on or the corrupt roots that make our system what it hasalwaysbeen — though there are plenty ofpeople who have great ideas— but I do know that I will not go into this new year and presidency as if the past four years haven't happened. I will not indulge the idea that there is some accord to reach with people who continue to fight for white supremacy on every possible level. I can't believe that there's a common view to be had with people who villainize those fighting for their humanity and defend those who would rather oust democracy than lose their power.Why is it that the price of unity has always been at the cost of our freedom? Why is it the job of those who are constantly denied their humanity to compromise? When the far right loses an election, they don'tactuallylose anything. When the left loses or ""gives in"" a little, it's at the cost of our healthcare, our wages, our education, and our actual lives. Why doesn't the message of compassion lead to positive change in the lives of those who need it? Why does it always serve those who have been at the top the entire time? Why isn't the message to change directed at the people who keep voting for white supremacy, transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia, climate change denial, and misogyny? People who continually vote againsttheir owninterests because they continue to put white power over the country every day? But I'm supposed to be the bigger person to establish a cordial relationship? I think the f*ck not.Stop asking how Democrats will ""bridge the divide."" Making the losers feel like they won is not how Democracy works. It's not our job to fabricate a soft spot for whiteness to land after they tried to drop kick us in the face.They're the ones born with parachutes.Fuck.Them.— michaelharriot (@michaelharriot)November 9, 2020Until the day comes when we can ""come together"" to figure out how we can all get what we need from our government and each other, do you know who can talk to them?Other white people. Talk to your friends, family members, church members. Extendthe hand of ""get it together""instead of silently seething and then telling us about how awkward your Thanksgiving dinner was.People have joked that civil war is imminent, but I don't think it's ever been more clear that this country is a failed state and Joe Biden's presidency isn't a quick fix for that. If anything, this siege has proven that change won't come peacefully. At this point,we can't go back to the way it wasor we'll be repeating ourselves in another 10 years. And I'm not going to do that."

Turns out,Ponsetto's lawyer suggested she remove her ""Daddy"" baseball capbefore the exclusive interview. ""We asked her to wear professional attire,"" attorney Sharen Ghatan told The Daily Beast. ""I specifically asked her to remove it before the interview."" But Ghatan described Ponsetto as ""defiant,"" ""insistent,"" and a ""very challenging client,"" so the cap stayed on. Notice the lawyer neglected to use the word ""racist,"" yet Ponsetto's attitude, actions, and, by extension, her outfit are charged with supposed superiority. There's privilege at work here.Ponsetto wasarrested on Friday in Californiaafter allegedly physically assaulting 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. on Dec. 26 at the Arlo Hotel in New York City. Onlookers (including Harrold Jr.'s father, renowned jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold Sr.)caught Ponsetto's tirade against the Black teen on camera, as she falsely accused him of stealing her cell phone and threw him to the ground. After the attack, the internet labeled Ponsetto as ""SoHo Karen"" when video of her aggression went viral.You'd hope that Ponsetto would've used her time with King on Friday to apologize and show remorse for her actions. You'd be disappointed. Ponsetto appeared on camera in a puzzlingly casual outfit, wearing a $16 Urban Outfitters baseball cap. If an outfit makes a first impression, one could assume Ponsetto was aware the message her indifference would send to King and to the world watching. ""[The hat] was important to her,"" Ghatan said, although she couldn't explain why. The lawyer admitted she's concerned for Ponsetto's mental health.Clearly, Ponsetto's obstinance indicated what was to come. She gaslit Harrold Jr. with insincere apologies, only acknowledging ""if I insulted him or hurt his feelings."" She danced around questions and leaned heavily on excuses in an attempt to spin the story as a victim. She ignored her lawyer's attempts at intervention. In an especially improbable exchange, she snapped at King. The seasoned interviewer tried to hold Ponsetto accountable by telling her, ""You're 22 years old, but you are old enough to know better."" Ponsetto responded with a wave of her hand, and said, ""All right, Gayle, enough.""Every second of Ponsetto's six-minute interview further emphasizes her immense privilege. She described herself as ""super sweet"" and then, in nearly the same breath, shushed an acclaimed journalist — and Black woman — on national TV. She treated the interaction as if it were barely worth her time, seemingly undaunted by the consequences of her actions. In fact, she appeared blind to her own actions entirely. ""I'm a 22-year-old girl. . . . How is a girl accusing a guy about a phone a crime? Where is the context in that?"" she asked.Despite Ponsetto's insistence, she's not a girl, she's a woman. A full-grown adult, actually. Harrold Jr., on the other hand, isn't a ""guy"" — especially in comparison to Ponsetto. He's at the beginning of his teen years, closer to childhood than whatever innocence Ponsetto tried to claim for herself. And for the record, making a false accusation is a crime if it's reported to the police.Privilege and assumed power like Ponsetto's are engrained over time. Society consistently reaffirms that just looking a certain way will fill in the gaps for any shortcomings. Frighteningly, Ponsetto's privilege acts as the same supposed ""shield"" that emboldens people likethe Donald Trump-supporting mobwho attacked the nation's Capitol. A MAGA hat and a ""Daddy"" cap never felt so eerily similar.Hours after Ponsetto acted invincible in her conversation with King, she got her mugshot taken. Much like Amy Cooper,the white woman who falsely claimed a Black birder was threatening her, Ponsetto will face charges, although it's unclear what they will be. Ponsetto still doesn't see her actions as racially charged, despite singling out the Black teen and refusing to relent. For the record, the hotel had her phone.Although Ghatan canceled her client's future interviews, there's still a chance Ponsetto could resurface to spin the same lies. Perhaps she would do well to heed her own advice: ""Alright, Miya, enough."" In the meantime, someone please pour Gayle King a glass of something strong and give her a raise. There isn't a paycheck big enough to cover the audacity she dealt with this week."
There's a Lot of Talk About Joe Biden's First 100 Days — Here's Why They're Important,0.0,43.67,https://www.popsugar.com/news/why-are-first-100-days-important-for-president-48070657,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-11,www.popsugar.com,"President-elect Joe Biden'sinauguration day is just a few days away, which means everyone's eyes will be on the first 100 days of his presidency. We took a look at the mythos around the first 100 days of a presidency andwhat we can expect to see from Biden's.The idea comes from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd US president, who passed15 major pieces of legislation and 76 lawsduring the first 100 days of his presidency in 1933. By today's standards, the efficiency is almost unbelievable. It's mostly due to the extenuating circumstances of his term: Roosevelt was dealing with the Great Depression when he was inaugurated, and the nationwide sense of emergency allowed him to take action swiftly. And while the circumstances for following presidents were less dire, the term stuck.The term wasfirst used by FDR himself. It refers to thefirst session of the 73rd Congress, which began just days after FDR's inauguration and was the period over which he was able to pass so much legislation. It lasted, you guessed it, 100 days and included some of the most recognizable components of FDR's New Deal, such as the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps and Public Works Administration.For better or for worse, they've become a benchmark of a president's efficacy in office.Some argue that it's an arbitrary and unfair standard, based on the extenuating circumstances FDR was governing in. Others raise the point thatwhen a president first takes office, their halo of victory lingersand their leadership style is fresh and new, which can positively affect their impact on Congress.Regardless of which side is correct, the myth of the 100 days becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: a new president knows that people's eyes will be on their first 100 days and therefore works to make them memorable. It can be seen as a time to take definitive action and set the tone of the next four years.After FDR, several other presidents made notable decisions within the first 100 days of their presidency. John F. Kennedy called for theBay of Pigs invasion— an infamously failed attempt to overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Gerald Fordpardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan was said to have ""established his goals faster, communicated a greater sense of economic urgency and come forward with more comprehensive proposals than any new President since the first 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt,"" according toThe New York Times. And Barack Obama passed a$787 million stimulus package, theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, in his first month.Judging a president's effectiveness during his first 100 days isn't as simple as it sounds. After all, the quantity, quality, and effectiveness of laws passed are all very different things, and their ramifications aren't immediately visible. But regardless of the results of past presidents' actions during their first 100 days, there has been a trend of taking bold, swift action when they first arrive in office, perhaps to capitalize on the national energy that put them there.Biden will begin his presidency in a situation not unlike Roosevelt's — in a time of massive and unprecedented crisis. While he's said that, essentially,Trump's fate lies in Congress's hands, he plans to tackle COVID-19 and the economy when he enters office. He intends tosign an executive order to require masks(where he legally can) and to get ""at least 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of the American people in the first 100 days."" Additionally, Biden will prioritizepassing a coronavirus aid packageandreopening most of the nation's schools.Outside of COVID-19, he's proposedover a dozen policies on immigrationfor his first 100 days and promised to immediatelyreverse Trump's corporate tax cut and re-enter the US into the landmark Paris climate accord of 2015."

"Dear Allies, It's Time to Get Proximate to Your Black Friends",-18.0,26.33,https://www.popsugar.com/news/what-it-really-means-to-support-your-black-friends-47982892,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-02,www.popsugar.com,"One of greatest lessons to be learned from 2020 is that our humanity is inextricably related, intertwined, and dependent upon each other for survival. In what has proven to be an unexpected year for all of us, it should be no surprise that nothing surprises us anymore. In case you haven't noticed, your Black friends are exhausted, depleted, and simply worn out. Your Black friends need more than your support via a social media post or the stereotypical ""I have a Black friend, so I'm exempt from racism"" trope. Your Black friends need you to be present, showing up for them, even when #BlackLivesMatter is no longer trending.Your Black friends began the year processingthe tragic death of Kobe Bryant, followed by the news of a global pandemic, in which we sawCOVID-19 disproportionately impact our community, resulting in Black bodies as casualties of systemic racism. While the country was ordered to observe mandatory social distancing, many of us couldn't because, again, due to systemic racism, we were on the front lines serving as essential workers and caregivers. When the world erupted in fire illuminating centuries of racial injustice and state-sanctioned violence with the senseless murders ofAhmaud ArberyandGeorge Floyd, we were devastated by the reality that we, too, could become another hashtag simply because of the skin that we live in. Adding to the list of continual blows our community faced wasthe untimely death of our Black superhero, both on and off screen, Chadwick Boseman. The devastating loss of Boseman, our beloved Black Panther, has us in a perpetual state of mourning the death of another Black man.We watched in disbelief that after all of these years, our white friends, colleagues, and sometimes family members finally came to a realization of what we had been screaming since 2013 afterthe murder of Trayvon Martin: Black Lives Matter. Fast-forward months later with racial injustice in the lexicon, however, we are still crying out ""Protect Black Women"" with the miscarriage of justice given the outcome ofthe Breonna Taylor case, in which to date justice hasn't been served, with no one held responsible for her death. The wall of the neighboring apartment received more justice than Breonna's life.With just over a month left in 2020, we've been to the mountaintop and back surviving what was arguably the most important presidential election of our lifetime, whereBlack voter suppressionwas as palpable as it was during the civil rights movement. To date, Black voter suppression continues with the concerted efforts of politicians in Michigan refusing to certify the ballots of counties with predominantly Black voters. Your Black friends have been tested, and we have no more patience to give or grace to extend.So, you have a Black friend; now what?We know that being silent and complicit will not ignite change, so how willyour activism and supportmove beyond your comfort zone of the black square on Instagram? How will you view this movement as an opportunity to get involved in what's happening, holding yourself accountable? No more standing on the sidelines; we need you to get proximate to your Black friends.This means getting up close and personal with theissues that are impacting the Black communityand working diligently in your sphere of influence to dismantle systems that hoard power and continually perpetuate racial hierarchies and dominance. Put down the reading lists and begin inward, examining your biases and what influences your decision making. It means doing the real work — a commitment, an action, a choice — to disrupt and interrupt the axis of power and privilege. It means holding yourself accountable so you don't revert back to norms, behaviors, and ideas that are cyclical and counter intuitive to justice. Change isn't silent, and if true change is to happen, it will mean white people will have to view racism as a problemthey have ownership in fixingas opposed to an issue Black people experience.As we continue to navigate such unprecedented and challenging times, we must remember thatour humanity is a shared experience. How will you show up for Black people? Things will only change if you act with a sense of urgency and fervor. What will we do differently that lays the foundation for our future and the future of the next generation who are watching to see how we face the challenge of dismantling racism beginning by extending proximity? Proximity benevolently demands us to create space, opportunity, and time to be close to each other in an effort to build relationships and community with each other.In order to achieve this, you have to get close. Proximity won't be easy. It will be uncomfortable, messy, emotional, and hard. But we can no longer accept being complicit as normal. We are in need of a new system that is rooted in justice, where we all can thrive, not in spite of but because of who we are. It begins by getting proximate to stories, narratives, and experiences that differ from our own.No better time than the present for us to lean into discomfort, get proximate, and build the capacity to reimagine a humanity that empowers each of us to fight for the justice and liberation of others. None of us is free until we all are free. Our collective humanity hangs in the balance as we deepen our understanding of what it means to extend care, dignity, and humanity to your Black friends.Get proximate. We are who've been waiting for. It's about time we show up and show out!"
Deb Haaland's Appointment as Interior Secretary Signals a Profound Win For Indigenous People,-17.67,35.0,https://www.popsugar.com/news/joe-biden-appoints-deb-haaland-as-secretary-of-the-interior-48068796,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,www.popsugar.com,"With nearly a month until Inauguration Day, President-elect Joe Biden continues to make historic appointments: on Dec. 17, the future leaderannounced Deb Haaland as his pick to oversee the Interior Department. Haaland was most recently therepresentative for New Mexico's first congressional districtafter being elected in 2018, and she previously served as the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of New Mexico. As a member of the Laguna Pueblo, Haaland will be the first Indigenous person to hold a presidential cabinet position.Biden famously saidhis presidency would offer ""time to heal""in his acceptance speech. This recent appointment similarly signals a collective healing following the government's history of broken treaties and violence toward Indigenous people. As interior secretary, Haaland will be responsible for managing and conserving tribal lands, as well as national parks and natural resources. She will also work to undo the Trump administration'sdesecration of public landsand help carry out Biden'scomprehensive climate plan, among many other duties.""It would be an honor to move the Biden-Harris climate agenda forward, help repair the government to government relationship with Tribes that the Trump Administration has ruined, and serve as the first Native American cabinet secretary in our nation's history,"" Haaland said in a statement shared withThe New York Times.The news was celebrated by congresspeople and celebrities alike. ""Much love to all our relatives for which this moment is long overdue,""Ava DuVernay tweeted, whileRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, ""This is a big deal. Historic appointment. A visionary Native woman in charge of federal lands. Unequivocally progressive. Green New Deal champion. Exquisitely experienced . . . Sister, you are going to do such a great job. I am so proud of you and the movement.""The nomination is a momentous win for representation, and its significance to Indigenous communities cannot be underplayed. In a press statement, Nikki Pitre, the executive director of theCenter for Native American Youth, described the moment as ""historic"" and ""groundbreaking."" Pitre said, ""Native youth look to her as more than a role model, but as an Aunty, because we trust her and are continually inspired by her leadership."" Crystal Echo Hawk, the founder and executive director ofIllumiNative, also described feeling a sense of trust in Haaland's leadership. ""She is the visionary and powerhouse leader needed to safeguard our lands and our future,"" Hawk said, adding, ""This appointment is a victory in our collective fight against systemic racism and discrimination. However, the fight is far from over. Native peoples must be represented in all departments and all levels of the US government.""Just two years ago, back when she was running for Congress, Haaland spoke to POPSUGAR about theimportance of representation in government. ""I think that diversity is the most important thing right now for elected offices, because we need everyone at the table. We need everybody's input on how to solve the issues that are plaguing our society,"" she said. ""It's been evident to me that having a first Native woman would help to move the conversation forward in maybe a different way than it has.""Now that she has been formally selected by Biden, Haaland will have to be confirmed by the Senate. Theupcoming Georgia runoff electionson Jan. 5 will determine which party controls the Senate."
We Can't Let Yesterday's Violence Overshadow Our Forward Progress,-10.33,33.33,https://www.popsugar.com/news/personal-essay-on-race-riots-at-capitol-building-48096266,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,www.popsugar.com,"After everything that happened in 2020, I still can't get myself to believe that what I witnessed on the news and social media yesterday is real.On Wednesday, Jan. 6,Trump supporters breached the Capitol buildingas Congress debated President-elect Joe Biden's victory. On the same day, we learnedJon Ossoff would be joining  Rev. Raphael Warnockin the Senate to represent Georgia, giving Democrats control over the chamber. This election makes Warnock Georgia's first Black senator.The irony I see in this country is that whenever we take one step toward change and equality, we take five steps back when it comes to embracing other people's needs and voices who are a part of this country, as well.After the 2020 election, I felt exhausted still being in a pandemic, let alone bearing witness to continuous acts of police brutality, even after the killing of George Floyd. Then came the uproar of racial reckoning and the election itself. Now this?Even after the voter count drama, Biden's victory was confirmed. I thought my civic duties could take a rest and I could get into my New Year's resolutions — but I was mistaken.As I watched and looked at the photos and video footage of the pro-Trump mob, I laughed to myself about the unfairness and privilege I continue to see white men have over anyone else.I wasn't mad at first. But then I thought about all the peaceful protests that have taken place with Black Lives Matter over the years, which only became violent when Black men were murdered and action wasn't taken swiftly and seriously.How is it that BLM protests don't take place without what seems like a billion cops with their rifles ready, with us on our knees, begging for change — but a mob of Trump supporters breaking into the Capitol, shattering windows, roaming through the Capitol grounds, screaming ""USA!"" and ""We want our country back,"" is taken so lightly?I even saw a picture of a white man hanging from a balcony inside the Capitol. This is what we in the Black community mean when we say ""privilege.""This could never be a BLM protest. In fact, no BLM protest has ever resulted in treason. What we see on the news right now is not a form of protesting. This is simply white men fearful of the change we desperately seek and need in this country. In our nation's history, white men haven't been discriminated against or subjected to extrajudicial, unlawful murder like the Black men and women in this country.These are the true thugs of our society: white men who have continuously been given space to do and take what they want when they don't get their way — not even a slap on the wrist.Yesterday, I watched a news report on CNN. Van Jones reported live as the footage rolled on the screen. It wasn't until he said ""possible civil war"" that it all sounded like something out of the history books.Are people really that fearful of change? Why do white men feel so entitled to speak over and solely be the ones to make decisions over this country? Because they were the ones to steal it first? How is that justifiable?I don't want to have a reason to be mad at the world. And I think that's where the world doesn't understand Black Americans. We don't want to be divided. We don't want to be at war. We just want to be ourselves and exist; to be given the same opportunities and respect. And I am convinced we can achieve those things when Black people vote. In the history of this country, my ancestors and I have taken loss after loss, beginning with our existence here. I want Trump supporters to just take their L and face the reality that they aren't the only ones in this country and the only people who want things.I don't want to be pulled back in time. I'm not a slave anymore. I don't want to live in a country of backward ideologies, continually being told through the actions of white men that I'm part of the most hated race in this country. I want to be able to reflect back on Biden taking office as a new day for my community and how I operate in the world — and I'm not letting the violent actions of a group of rioters take that away from me.Erianna Jiles is currently studying creative writing at Metropolitan State and will graduate in 2021.

Trump Supporters Are Making It Impossible For Americans Like Me to Heal,-12.33,29.33,https://www.popsugar.com/news/what-does-political-trauma-mean-48059971,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,www.popsugar.com,"On election night 2020, I accepted a friend's invitation to watch a movie over Zoom. AfterAustenlandand in between episodes ofSchitt's Creek, we checked Twitter. We remained calm asthe ""red mirage""that news outlets had predicted would appear before mail-in ballots were counted indeed materialized. She's a former field organizer for the Obama campaign, and her lack of anxiety kept my mind from racing. I even got a few hours of sleep.It was a stark contrast from election night four years earlier when I spent the night on social media alone, increasingly terrified as each state's winner was projected. I'm liberal, part Latinx, a wheelchair user, and a journalist. So whenDonald Trumpmocked a disabled reporteron the 2016 campaign trail, it was as personal an attack as when he casually mentionedgrabbing women by the genitals.Trump himself never scared me as much as what his ascent to power meant. Millions of Americans voted for the prejudiced, discriminatory, and hateful behavior and practices he represents. So, alone and unable to sleep that night in November 2016, I cried and felt real fear for the first time in my life. I distinctly remember wondering, ""Why do so many people in my country hate me?""New York is one of the most reliably Democratic states in the country, but I live in one of its red counties. I'd seen plenty of Trump signs and flags while driving down main roads, but their meaning hit me differently when the election results came in. In the days and weeks following one of the loneliest nights of my life, I grieved feeling safe in my country. My anxiety got so bad, I decided to treat it with medication so I could talk to people without needing to know who they voted for to feel safe.Disability-rights activist and creator of the viral hashtags #DisTheOscars, #AbledsAreWeird, and #ThingsDisabledPeopleKnowImani Barbarindecided to leave the country after Trump's win in 2016. ""I woke up at 4 in the morning and saw he had won, I threw up, and then I bought a ticket for Paris to study abroad,"" she told POPSUGAR. She had been deferring her acceptance to the American University of Paris and decided it was time to go.While I stayed put in America, medication was the right choice for me, and I've been thriving in my professional life and managing well enough during the pandemic and Trump's nearly four years in office. But even though Barbarin was away for about two years, as a Black disabled woman, shecan'ttune out the news as easily as I can when I need a break. It's partly because a suitable mental health professional is difficult for her to find. Being a member of two different marginalized groups means she has two different identities they must understand. ""I've met great psychologists that were great about talking [about] Black identity and Black issues,"" Barbarin said. But she ran into issues explaining to them why she claims disability as part of her identity. ""It was like starting at phase one with them, which is kind of disheartening when we think about how often mental health issues occur [for] Black and brown people with disabilities.""In the days following this election, I felt the intense fear of four years ago creep back into my bones. The weekendJoe Bidenwas declared president-elect, I had a Champagne toast over Zoom with anyone who would indulge me. But even asBiden's victory speechcalled for healing, I felt a new kind of anxiety when Trump refused to concede and filed lawsuits casting doubt on our whole election process. (Per a CNBC/Change Research pollconducted in mid-November, only three percent of Trump voters believe Biden legitimately won the election.) As I followed the postelection news on TV, I heard a new (to me) term to describe what I have felt nearly every day of Trump's presidency: political trauma. I can think of no better term for what I have experienced since he's taken office. Political trauma is not a mental health diagnosis, but it's a legitimate concept, so I wanted to learn more about it from a mental health professional with a unique understanding of what marginalization feels like. Someone who could give me (and everyone else) tips on how to heal, even as we experience the stress that comes with a begrudged transition of power unlike any other in our nation's history.Dr. Zamira Castrois a Latinx psychologist in private practice and at Florida Atlantic University who identifies as queer. ""[Political trauma] is the outcome of traumatic events that have happened at the social level with political consequences and ramifications for certain groups of people based on their group membership,"" Dr. Castro told POPSUGAR. It impacts our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.People who did not vote for Trump are more likely members of marginalized communities, so we are more likely to experience this. ""These past four years have been a bombardment of traumatic stress for many marginalized folk,"" Dr. Castro said. She explained that over the past four years, we may have been experiencing chronic trauma, which happens over a longer period of time.This trauma is often felt on an individual level in the form of discrimination and hate crimes. According to an FBI report,hate crimes increased by about 20 percent from 2016 to 2019. Such crimes included assault, destruction or vandalism of property, and theft or robbery. Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE) at California State University, where the FBI's data was analyzed, reported that there were 51 hate-related murders in 2019. That's the most this country has seen since the 1990s.For a social media influencer like Barbarin, behavior like this often comes in the form of death threats. I was struck by how casually she said, ""That's not exactly unheard of for Black women. So, I'm not really all that alarmed.""Dr. Castro also cited viral videos featuring marginalized people being harassed and bullied as examples of the current administration's negative influence being felt on a personal level. ""You're not even able to quite process or heal from one injury before you're being assaulted with another,"" she said. ""And I think that that then also complicates the process of being able to make sense of what's happening and then be able to move on from it somehow.""Inhis victory speech, President-electBiden spoke about healingfrom the negativity and political divisiveness that the nation has experienced under the Trump administration. But on an individual level, how do we recover from the political trauma that we are still being subjected to?Dr. Castro spoke about the importance of naming experiences, which she does for her clients whenever possible. Providing language for others ""empowers someone to be able to speak about their story and be able to locate the damage where it is."" She said we have a tendency to blame ourselves for the effects of our trauma. So, for example, the fact that I prefer not to leave my home immediately after elections isn't a personal problem I should beat myself up about. It's a symptom of living under an oppressive administration for so long.Dr. Castro also emphasized the importance of listening and said one of the best things she can do for her patients is to help them feel validated. ""So much of what hurts when we're suffering emotionally, psychologically is feeling that we're alone and feeling that our pain is ours alone to bear or that it doesn't matter to others — that it's too insignificant to matter to others,"" she said. ""One of the more powerful things that I could offer someone else is sitting with them. And sitting with them intently.""I think this is why I gravitate toward people with our same beliefs: because it's necessary to confirm that with so many people in the country willing to allow Trump's hate-fueled power trip to continue, I'm at least surrounded by people who also believe that anyone who spits such rhetoric is unfit to lead.Dr. Castro said that ""when you have something like your humanity being under assault for years upon years, and in more explicit fashion than ever with this current administration,"" being validated by other like-minded and caring folks can be a meaningful salve.Listening to Barbarin, I realized that while my anxiety and trauma are valid, I need to be a better ally for Black disabled women like her. ""The reason why we never take a break on these issues is because the minute we rest, [less marginalized people] slack,"" she said.We can also heal by continuing to practice self-care, maintaining our personal boundaries, and not socializing with people who make us feel unsafe — because Trump supporters aren't leaving the country when he leaves the White House. Dr. Castro called ""being the bigger person"" an ""incomplete"" piece of advice that we don't have to follow in every situation. In that case, I will not be empathizing with Trump supporters. Ever.If you journal, Dr. Castro suggests asking yourself specific questions to prompt an examination of feelings. Or spend five minutes with your eyes closed examining how you feel and where you are feeling it in your body as an effective way to slow down and check in with yourself.For Barbarin to be able to consciously and regularly practice self-care, she needs to be able to trust that the people who are stepping in for her understand the urgency of the change that still needs to happen in the country. ""It's all fine and good that people tell Black women and tell the marginalized that they should rest, but unless we can feel comfortable leaving the movement for a couple of minutes to take a break without it completely falling apart without our constant vigilance . . . it doesn't work."" Barbarin does try to lie down and literally stop thinking when she's reached a personal limit but said it's very hard for her to do.As a nation, Dr. Castro said we need a ""cooldown."" Some of us have been in a threatening situation for so long under this administration that the biological alarms in our bodies that help us deal with threats don't function properly. ""We've been so activated, and this election and transition, I don't think it's done much to soothe our worries and soothe our overactive nervous systems,"" she said. ""I think we're still very much on edge and on alert and activated.""President-elect Biden is aware of the stress the country has been under and demonstrated a willingness to help the country heal through his actions. Along with choosingKamala Harristo be the first Black, Asian, and woman vice president, he's assembled one of themost diverse cabinetsin US history, including appointingan all-women communications team. This tells me he knows whose voices have been silenced the most since 2016 and is committed to making sure they're heard not only in his administration but also hopefully for many years to come.But the work is far from over, and the most dangerous thing we can do as a nation is become too complacent with a Biden administration, Barbarin said. ""We're at the edge of a cliff right now, on so many different political issues,"" she said. ""Every single issue that you can think of is in dire straits as we're speaking."" So while Americans do need a leader whose core beliefs don't cause vulnerable communities more trauma, Biden won't help those who need it most if he sees himself as a president whose job is just to ""stop the bleeding,"" as Barbarin described it. We need an administration that will begin trying to heal the root cause of the trauma, which involves fixing 400 years of flawed systems.""What would really make me feel like I could sleep at night is if we did a truth and reconciliation commission not just for the Trump administration but for the, for this entire country, like from the birth of this country, until now we need a truth and reconciliation [commission],"" Barbarin said.Speaking with Dr. Castro and Barbarin taught me that healing from political trauma starts on a personal level. I'm the only one who knows how I can best move forward and heal the damage Trump's administration has done to me, just as you are the only one who can know what will work for you. But with a leader like Biden committed to moving the nation forward, hopefully I'll never have to experience fear as I did on the night of the 2016 election — and the chronic anxiety of the Trump administration — ever again. I hope the next time Barbarin goes to Paris, it'll be because she needs a vacation, not to escape the traumatic behavior she knows to expect from the president and their supporters."
Why Political Activism Can't — and Shouldn't — Stop After the Inauguration,-20.33,36.67,https://www.popsugar.com/news/why-political-activism-cant-stop-after-inauguration-48072874,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,www.popsugar.com,"Image Source:Getty / Pacific PressAfter thelong, stressful haulofthe 2020 election cycle, it's easy to want to take a break, butit's more important than ever that activism continuesbeyond the presidential election. While news cycles may focus most on politics during major federal election years,real change also happensin the times in between. It's why we can't tune out and stop doing the necessary work during the times that get less attention:success comes from steady effortsand long-term organizing, not all-at-once rushes.""Off years are a figment of our imagination!""Run for Somethingcofounder Amanda Litman told POPSUGAR, noting that, in 2019, there were 85,000 elections across the country, and approximately the same number of state, local, and municipal races are happening in 2021. Plus, she says, ""the outcome of the 2022 federal elections are dependent on the organizing we do in 2021."" Her organization, Run for Something, provides resources and support toprogressive candidates across the country, especially in down-ballot races, to build a more robust progressive base and build more awareness within individual communities. One of their signature events, National Run for Office Day, is actually scheduled for Jan. 19 in 2021 — the day before the inauguration!Activism in years like 2021 is also about reworking strategy — something which, Run for Something cofounder Ross Morales Rocketto notes, has met with a mixed reaction among the establishment. ""Some people really get it and really want our help, [but] there are some folks who want to keep doing things the way they have been. Folks are trying to do the best they can with what they've got, and so many of these organizations have been existing with a scarcity mindset for so long."" Getting involved in these organizations at the local level is one of the most effective ways we can collectively make change: start with the small fights andget in it for the long haul. ""Power building takes a long time,"" Rocketto reminds us. ""It's not linear, you're always going to have setbacks, but it's the only way to win long-term power . . . the way we do it is by building power and infrastructure on the ground."" Last year was one of enormous activism, particularly regarding the experiences of Black Americans and other BIPOC, and keepingtopics of justice and equalityat the forefront issomething that has to happen consistently, not just around federal elections. ""You're not going to hear me say Democrats lost [an] election because of 'defund the police,'"" Rocketto says. ""This is something candidates are going to have to talk about, especially on the local level —'defund the police' is largely a state and local issue. We're going to have to come to terms with that, and we can't ignore it, because if we ignore it, we're letting Republicans define what 'defund the police' means and what all of these issues mean. We need to be out there having these conversations with voters.""Image Source:Getty / OLIVIER DOULIERYIt's not just about the people phone-banking, fundraising, and running for office, either —change and activism happen in everyday life. The nonprofitDefine Americanfocuses on immigrant experiences in the entertainment industry, where it works to change perceptions — and, by extension, political behavior — byimpacting the media we experience. In September 2020, they released a Norman Lear Center study entitled ""Change the Narrative, Change the World,"" which used qualitative and quantitative research to prove how three immigrant storylines studied had a positive impact on perception, feelings, and behaviors among viewers — and that's the kind of work that can (and must) continue away from elections.""The work to ensure that immigrants are recognized in this country as fully human persists. Inclusive, accurate portrayals of immigrants in popular culture can move the needle toward that type of humanization,"" Adrián Escárate, communications coordinator at Define American, told POPSUGAR. Charlene Jimenez, director of entertainment partnerships and advocacy, explains further. ""We're always working to humanize the immigrant experience through media and we believe, and have proven through our research, that accurate portrayals of these communities have the power to propel audiences to real-life action. We try to celebrate every single inch of progress we see even as we keep our eyes and momentum on the big picture.""These kinds of stories are just one piece of the puzzle, as the entertainment industry as a whole reckons with the calls for racial justice that have reached a peak in 2020, particularly with the year'sBlack Lives Matterprotests and an increasing focus onelevating BIPOC voices in all corners. This isn't something new, though; it's part of an ongoing struggle to get more authentic storytelling andstories that lead to real change. ""The best thing people can do is to stay in the fight and continue to support work that represents the diversity of America. This year has been a lesson on the importance of being vocal when an injustice occurs or when the status quo is challenged and just how powerful that can be,"" says Escárate.Continued activism isn't just about donating to political causes and calling your reps — it's also about supporting projects that lead to change. ""Responsibility and wanting to 'do better' can sometimes feel abstract and overwhelming. An immediate action you can take to support BIPOC representation in media is to simply watch and support movies and TV shows from creators who belong to those groups,"" Jimenez reminds us. ""Your viewership, your movie tickets, your downloads, your clicks — they all translate into measurable success. It sends a message to gatekeepers that there is a strong appetite out there for authentic stories and thatthose stories need to be seen and supported.""And for those who want to get involved more directly? ""It's not too late to run in 2021 and 2022 races!"" Litman says. ""It is critical that we have good people running, because those people are going to be in the forefront of rebuilding."" It's equally important, she explains, toavoid burnoutin order to really have a long-term impact. ""What does a sustainable political environment for you look like? For a lot of people, paying attention to national politics day in and day out is f*cking exhausting and demoralizing! There's a reason that people who stay in this work long-term often stay in it locally. One, you can feel the impact because it's where you live, but, two, you're going to get wins more often, and the wins are going to directly make your life better. Pick the issue or the community that you feel can get you energized, then get to know the people who are doing the work and find out what they need."" More than ever, if we want progress that lasts, we can't just participate in the trends and movements of the moment — we have to stay committed and put in the work even when no one is watching."
"Women Were the Primary Targets of Nearly 3,800 Reported Anti-Asian Hate Crimes in the Last Year",-4.67,45.0,https://www.popsugar.com/news/aapi-anti-asian-hate-crime-report-statistics-48222291,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,www.popsugar.com,"On Tuesday, March 16 — just hours before the fatalAtlanta spa shootings that killed eight people in Georgia— the Stop AAPI Hate coalition releaseda report disclosing the statistics behind anti-Asian hate crimesin the United States since March 2020. According to the report, there have been nearly 3,800 documented cases of anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide over the last year, and a majority of the victims were women. This is only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur annually, with cases of xenophobia and bigotry mounting since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the numbers remain a formidable reflection of recent hate crimes.All but one of the eight victims of Tuesday's massage-parlor shootings were women, and six were Asian, which is a chilling statistic that has only served to ""exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure,"" according toStop AAPI Hate. ""The reported shootings of multiple Asian American women today in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy — for the families of the victims first and foremost, but also for the Asian American community, which has been reeling from high levels of racist attacks over the course of the past year,"" the group said in a statement on March 17. ""Not enough has been done to protect Asian Americans from heightened levels of hate, discrimination and violence. Concrete action must be taken now. Anything else is unacceptable.""A closer look at the report reveals that verbal harassment and shunning make up the two largest portions of total incidents reported, collectively totaling at just over 80 percent. Physical assault comprises 11.1 percent of reported incidents, while civil-rights violations — including workplace discrimination, refusal of service, and so on — make up 8.5 percent, and online harassment follows closely behind at 6.8 percent. More than one-third (35.4 percent) of these instances of discrimination and harassment happen while a member of the Asian community is at a business, such as a store, salon, or workplace, while one-quarter of incidents take place in public streets or on the sidewalk.Across all 50 states, women are 2.3 times more likely than men to report these crimes. Chinese individuals are the largest ethnic group affected, constituting more than 42 percent of reported incidents. Together, people of Korean, Vietnamese, and Filipino descent make up an additional 31 percent of reported experiences of hate. Just days before the March 16 attacks, Georgia state SenatorMichelle Au gave a chilling accountdetailing the reality of hateful encounters APIA individuals have faced on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Georgia should not consider itself immune from this epidemic,"" Dr. Au said. ""And to be clear, the epidemic I'm referring to is not COVID-19, but racism towards Asian Americans. . . . The thing is, racism against AAPI Americans is not new. Otherization or exoticization of AAPI Americans is not new. Violence against AAPI Americans is not new.""While speaking with Stop AAPI Hate for the purposes of the statistical report, a student from College Park, MD, said, ""One of my professors was talking about the public health response to COVID-19 and explicitly called it the 'China Virus' and that 'we've gotta be very careful about that country and what they'd do to us.'"" Another added, ""Two white, middle-aged men, who have been my neighbors for over fifteen years, approached me threateningly on the street, pulled down the corners of their eyes and said, 'Go back to Wuhan, b*tch and take the virus with you!' When I called them vile, they then called me a 'Thai wh*re' and threatened to beat up my husband.""Six days after taking office,President Joe Biden released a memorandumaimed at combatting racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US. The memo reads: ""The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons. These actions defied the best practices and guidelines of public health officials and have caused significant harm to AAPI families and communities that must be addressed.""In the wake of such prevalent violence toward the APIA community, mandates can only do so much. It is the responsibility of community members to speak up in the face of blatant hatred and take action by donating, supporting local businesses, and being actively mindful of anti-Asian rhetoric.

Why Double Masking Is More Protective Against COVID-19 — and How to Do It Effectively,0.0,39.67,https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/does-wearing-two-masks-help-protect-against-covid-19-48137761,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.popsugar.com,"As COVID-19 cases continue to surge,more-contagious variants of the virusare beginning to circulate in the US. As people look for ways to better protect themselves and others, double masking has emerged as one strategy. But does wearing two masks actually make a difference in curbing the spread of these variants? And if so, how can you do it effectively? We asked experts.Based on current knowledge, experts agree that two masks are better than one. ""Double masking likely does help increase protection, especially against the emerging mutant strains of COVID-19,"" Sri Banerjee, PhD, an epidemiologist and core faculty member in Walden University'sPhD in Public Healthprogram, told POPSUGAR. Dr. Banerjee explained thatthe new variants may have an easier time binding to human cells. If we have more layers covering our faces, we'reless likely to be exposed to the viral particlesthat infect our cells and make us sick.""Double masking creates more of an obstacle course for the viral particle to navigate its way from the air into your nose, throat, and then lungs,"" Dr. Banjeree said. ""This is how two masks may help create a stronger shield between you and the virus.""""It is not just anecdotal but scientifically proven too that double masking can offer a high percentage of protection,"" explainedSunitha Posina, MD, a board-certified internist in New York City who works on the front lines with COVID-19 patients. Specifically, you should try wearing a well-fitted cloth mask over a surgical mask or a mask with two layers of tightly woven fabric witha filter, such as a vacuum bag, in between. Research suggests that these combinations should helpblock at least 90 percent of particles one micron or larger, ""which happens to be the average aerosol size responsible for transmitting the COVID-19 virus,"" Dr. Posina told POPSUGAR.Of course, you still need to wear the masks correctly, or you risk not being adequately protected. ""It's not uncommon to see people with a loose-fitting mask or masks that don't fully cover the nose,"" said Amit Kumar, PhD, a researcher and scientist and CEO ofAnixa Biosciences, a company that's working to develop therapies and vaccines focused on critical unmet needs in infectious disease.""If you're double masking, make sure the first mask completely covers the nose and mouth,"" Dr. Banerjee said. He also emphasized the importance of continuing to follow all other safety measures. ""Even while wearing two masks, it is still essential to social distance and wash hands frequently and thoroughly. Double masking alone is not enough protection."""

Following the sentencing, Floyd's family gathered outside the courthouse to share their heartbreak after Chauvin evaded the 30-year maximum sentencing.""I've got a lot of emotions going through my head right now,"" said George's brother Philonise Floyd. ""I felt that I begged for some kind of justice for my brother, some kind of accountability . . . You have good police officers and you have bad ones, [but] you shouldn't have to sort them out."" Philonise continued, saying justice will not be truly served until the families of people like Philando Castile, Anthony McClain, and Daunte Wright can rest easy, until members of the Black community stop being the target of police brutality.""This 22-year sentence they gave this man is a slap on the wrist. We're serving a life sentence [by] not having [George] in our life, and that hurts me to death,"" George's brother Rodney Floyd said, echoing Philonise's sentiment along with George's cousins Tara Brown and Shareeduh Tate. Philonise added, ""I have a family; we wake up every day and we don't see my brother. [There are] empty seats all around the house he would have been in. The fact that Gianna will grow up knowing that her father had made a difference in the world, but [there's still] the fact that she cannot have a sweet 16 [with him]; she cannot have him walk her down the aisle; she will not be able to have prom with a daddy dance.""Brandon Williams, George's nephew, reiterated the fact that the court's verdict felt like a slap on the wrist compared to what their family has endured, and it's important for justice to be carried out fully and effectively on behalf of others whose lives have been lost to police brutality.""When you think about George being murdered in cold blood with a knee on his neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, execution style in broad daylight, 22 and a half years is not enough,"" he said. ""We will serve the life sentence. We can't get George back . . . In retrospect, I feel that [Chauvin] should have received a life sentence, as well. What kind of message are you sending to our country? What kind of message are you sending to the younger kids like Gianna? That you can kill a man in cold blood and get a slap on the wrist? That's like a slap in the face to all of us standing up here and everybody around the world who feels what we feel and saw that video. So I won't celebrate this at all, but I will celebrate a guilty conviction on a police officer that killed a Black man, because far too many times, we see them kill us and get away with it.""The family went on to call for justice for the families of those who have died as a result of police brutality, including Breonna Taylor. Additionally, several members of George's family demanded the passage of theGeorge Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would address the prevalence of racial bias in policing, create a national registry documenting police misconduct, and limit qualified immunity and the use of excessive and unwarranted force.""I have so many different people I spoke to all around the world and they all think the same way: your skin color should not define who you are; it should never be a weapon,"" Philonise said, urging listeners to continue the fight for justice and equality. ""[You] can't get comfortable, because when you get comfortable, people forget about you. So the legend will still live on. George is not here, but his spirit lives here. Breonna Taylor is not here, but the spirit still lives here. Eric Garner is not here, but the spirit is still right here. I want all of you to stand up and fight."""
Governor Cuomo's Nonapology Is a Classic Case of Gaslighting,-6.67,37.33,https://www.popsugar.com/news/governor-cuomo-responds-to-sexual-harassment-allegations-48196963,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-03,www.popsugar.com,"On March 3, following several allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomoapologized if the women accusing him ""felt hurt"" by or ""felt pain""as a result of his words and actions. ""I never knew at the time I was making anyone feel uncomfortable,"" he said.The press conference followeda statement Cuomo releasedover the weekend offering a tepid apology if his words and actions had ""been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation."" He wrote, ""To the extent anyone felt that way, I am truly sorry about that.""If the governor's nonapology statement and press conference — which focused on what he claimed were the intentions behind his actions rather than their impact — felt like déjà vu, there's a reason. It's more of the same, tired gaslighting we've seen from nearly every powerful man accused of harassing and harming women in recent years. Over and over, powerful men, and especially male politicians, have ""apologized"" if a woman they allegedly harassed or harmed ""felt"" or ""interpreted"" their words and actions in a certain way. In other words, the abuse was all in the woman's head, and the man accused doesn't bear responsibility. So far, Cuomo has refused to resign. And he has yet to clarify how he'll face accountability or what, if any, changes he's making to prevent future misconduct.Any statement that purports to apologize but claims a woman misinterpreted the exchange is rooted in victim blaming, as if it were their victim's choice to be offended or intimidated, doubling down on the harm that's already been inflicted. This defense against allegations of sexist misconduct is also deeply infantilizing, treating women as if they lack the maturity, experience, or worldliness to know how to properly read a situation and denying them credibility when it comes to their own lived experience.Theallegations against Cuomo primarily come from womenwho worked for him. Former top staffer Lindsey Boylan was the first woman to offera detailed accusation last week, alleging that in 2016, her boss told her Cuomo had a ""crush"" on her. Boylan said that in 2017, the governor suggested they play strip poker, and in 2018, he gave her an unwanted kiss on the lips. Another former aide, Charlotte Bennett, 25, said that last year, the governor asked her a number of invasive questions about her personal life while they were in his office, including whether she had been with older men, and told her he was open to a relationship with a woman in her 20s. And a third accuser, Anna Ruch, said she had never met Cuomo before a wedding they both attended in 2019. Just after they met, she said, he placed his hand on her bare lower back, then put his hands on her cheeks and asked if he could kiss her. (These allegations also come as Cuomo faces other serious allegations related to his alleged cover-up of nursing-home-related deaths amid the pandemic.)Since the sexual-harassment allegations against Cuomo first surfaced, a small but growing group of Democratic lawmakers, including New York Congresswoman Kathleen Rice, as well as the New York Working Families Party have called for the governor's resignation. Others have defended Cuomo byclaiming calls for his resignation are ""premature""— to whichNew York state Sen. Jessica Ramos responded in a biting tweet, ""You know what's premature and unfair? Grabbing someone's face without their consent.""According to a 2016 study by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,60 percent of women say they experience""unwanted sexual attention, sexual coercion, sexually crude conduct, or sexist comments"" in the workplace. And despite the claims of powerful men like Cuomo that they have benign intentions and that their ""friendly"" treatment of women is simply being misinterpreted, male employees and men in general are rarely if ever subjected to the same ""friendly"" treatment. The inappropriate touching and comments by men like Cuomo targeting women and female employees are paternalistic and infantilizing at best and abusive and predatory at worst.When women allege a powerful man sexually harassed or harmed them, they face the same sexist scrutiny, the same insistence that calls for basic accountability are premature, and the same condescending assertions that they weren't actually harmed but merely misunderstood something. Cuomo's nonapology isn't frustrating because it wades into any sort of new territory in the #MeToo era, which has exposed seemingly countless powerful men accused of similar behaviors. It's frustrating because it'sexactlylike every nonapology we've heard before, sneakily and insidiously shifting blame onto victims of abuse.The change we desperately need in workplaces across the country, and in society at large, requires us to hold those in power to a higher standard. It requires us to believe women who say they feel violated and assign value and importance to women's comfort and safety, over maintaining the same power structures that got us here in the first place."

"The House Just Passed H.R. 8, a New Gun-Control Bill — Here's What It Would Do",-7.33,44.0,https://www.popsugar.com/news/hr-8-gun-control-bill-explained-48214555,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-12,www.popsugar.com,"On Thursday, March 11,the Housepassed two gun-control bills that wouldtighten regulations on commercial gun salesby expanding background checks. The two bills are H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, andH.R. 1446, otherwise known as the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021 — and many are applauding the steps towardgun restrictions. If you're feeling a bit confused about the exact details of the H.R. 8 bill, we've broken down exactly what it means for the country and what is still needed to set the legislation in place.If passed in the Senate, H.R. 8 would expand background checks and tighten gun-sale regulations. Specifically, theBipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021would broaden background checks for all firearm sales or transfers across the country. Right now, these checks are not required for gun sales or transfers by private sellers,known as the Gun Show Loophole. This bill would also apply to online purchases.By closing the Gun Show Loophole, H.R. 8 would expand background checks in these cases, making it illegal for anyone who is not a manufacturer, dealer, or licensed firearm importer to trade or sell guns, with current laws requiring background checks only for licensed firearm dealers. That being said, as reported byUSA Today, nonlicensed individuals can still sell or trade guns by doing so through a licensed dealer who would run background checks for them. The H.R. 8 bill would also not create any other kinds of background checks, it would simply expand the cases where they would be necessary.Also, the bill still allows temporary trading and sharing of firearms at shooting ranges, on hunting trips, or wherever it is necessary to prevent ""imminent death or great bodily harm.""Although it will be difficult to get the H.R. 8 bill past the Senate,where it needs at least 60 votes to go to the president to sign, the Democrat majority in both chambers of Congress has paved the way for the passing of this bill in the House — eight Republicans supported H.R. 8, while just one Democrat opposed it.Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has committed to getting H.R. 8 on the floor of the Senate for a vote. In a press conference, Schumer said, ""Last time, [H.R. 8] went into Mitch McConnell's legislative graveyard. The legislative graveyard is over. H.R. 8 will be on the floor of the Senate and we will see where everybody stands."" He continued, ""No more thoughts and prayers — a vote is what we need.""Moreover, the White House has also made it more than clear that PresidentJoe Bidenis prioritizing gun control. Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden is ""not afraid of standing up to the [National Rifle Association]"" and has advocated for ""smart gun safety measures."" As the president is committed to passing stricter gun control, outlined in his owngun-policy plans, getting the bills passed in the Senate will be the hurdle to overcome."
How Navajo Nation Activist Allie Young Is Helping Protect Her Community From COVID-19,-7.0,39.67,https://www.popsugar.com/news/how-navajo-nation-is-rolling-out-covid-19-vaccinations-48200871,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,www.popsugar.com,"At the height of the pandemic, Navajo Nation — which spans more than 27,000 square miles of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah —reported the highest per-capita deaths in the country. This devastating trend inspired a surge in action by Diné activists like 31-year-old Allie Young, who returned to her homeland to work remotely. As the founder ofProtect the Sacred— a grassroots initiative that educates and empowers Navajo youth about COVID-19 — Young has been instrumental in getting members of the community vaccinated against the virus. Currently,Navajo Nation is outpacing the rest of the US in terms of vaccine rollout, setting an impressive precedent for the rest of the country.The people of Navajo Nation face challenges that have made battling the pandemic particularly hard. ""Thirty percent of our community doesn't have access to running water, and 40 percent of our community doesn't have access to electricity,"" Young, who also works for Los Angeles-based nonprofitHarness, told POPSUGAR. ""Jonathan Nez —the president of the Navajo Nation— has been working with Navajo-owned businesses to improve the broken infrastructure and to equip more homes with electricity and running water. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is telling folks to wash their hands for 20 seconds. It's not as easy when you don't have running water.""Moreover, indigenous families living in the Navajo nation have limited access to resources like grocery stores. ""Approximately the size of West Virginia, there are very rural regions, and sometimes your neighbors are miles apart,"" Young explained. ""There are only 13 grocery stores in total.""In response to these challenges, people living in the Navajo Nation banded together to help each other. ""The community really came together as far as mutual aid goes,"" Young shared. ""We had to make sure that we were getting food and essentials to folks who lived in very remote areas and may have not had transportation.""""People would travel for up to two hours to the nearest grocery stores, which often were in border towns just outside the Navajo Nation,"" Young continued. ""Unfortunately, many of the border towns tend to be very racist. We visited those communities to do our shopping and often encountered Trump supporters who didn't wear masks.""Having witnessed a demonstrated need for education and empowerment in the community, Young founded Protect the Sacred in March 2020. ""We're the first peoples of this land and of this country, and we've been decimated over the centuries,"" she explained. ""Now, we only make up about two percent of the population in our own ancestral homelands. Over time, a lot of work has been put into assimilating us and erasing our culture and languages. We've done such a great job revitalizing and preserving our ancestral knowledge. Throughout the pandemic, there was a true threat to our culture, languages, and our elders.""Young has a succinct answer as to why COVID-19 hit the Navajo Nation particularly hard. ""We've been seeing that there's been a tremendous lack of funding and support for Indian Health Services, and that's why we've ended up in this situation,"" she said.Young's first step to addressing the health crisis was getting information regarding COVID-19 out to her community. ""I've partnered with theCommunity Organized Relief EffortandJohns Hopkins Center for American Indian Healthto organize panels,"" she explained. ""The first panel was released as a radio show through Gallup Public Radio in New Mexico. We gave people information about the vaccine and answered any questions that they had.""These panels attempt to address the unique cultural impact COVID-19 has had on the Navajo Nation. ""We had a physician named Dr. [Rose] Whitehair talk about the science and the data. We also had a medicine man speak from our cultural perspective about vaccines. We just finished up our second panel, which discussed how the pandemic has affected different tribal communities across the nation in a more general sense.""Currently, Young plans to continue ensuring members of Navajo Nation have access to both COVID-19 testing sites and vaccinations. ""The vaccine is something that's available to us and that we have access to,"" she said. ""It's another way to continue to protect our elders, especially now that we're a year into the pandemic and we've seen how it's affected our community very negatively.""A master of communication, Young is now encouraging Navajo youth to tap into social media to spread the news about COVID-19 relief options.

How a Gun-Control Bill Aims to Close the Charleston Loophole,-3.0,46.33,https://www.popsugar.com/news/what-is-charleston-loophole-48214138,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-13,www.popsugar.com,"On March 11, the US House of Representatives passed two measures aimed at strengthening background checks for gun buyers. Both pieces of legislation will now go to the Senate, where they'll need 60 votes to pass. According to NPR,it's unclear whether there's enough support in the Senateto send the bills to PresidentJoe Biden's desk, butadvocates for stricter gun lawsargue that they're an important step in tackling theepidemic of gun violencein the US.The first bill, called H.R. 8, wouldexpand background checks to private sales. The second aims to close the Charleston loophole, a term used to describe what many view as a gap in the background check system — one that has had tragic consequences.When someone buys a gun from a licensed dealer, the dealer is required to run a federal background check on the prospective buyer, through theNational Instant Criminal Background Check System(NICS). The buyer fills out a form with information about themselves and the potential purchase, and the dealer relays that information to the FBI. This can be done over the phone or online, and results aretypically delivered in less than two minutes.The Charleston loophole comes into play when those results take longer. Current federal law gives the FBI three business days to investigate a background check. If three days have passed and the background check still isn't complete, the firearm dealermay legally sell the gun to the prospective buyer. This is known as a default proceed sale.The Charleston loophole gets its name from a2015 mass shooting, in which Dylann Roof murdered nine worshippers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC. Roof had previously been arrested for a felony drug charge, but the FBI agent performing his background checkencountered flaws in paperwork and communication with local policethat prevented her from confirming he was convicted. A conviction would have meant an automatic denial of the gun purchase. Roof was convicted of that charge, but the agent was unable to find proof in three days, soRoof was able to purchase the gun that was later used in the shooting.If a background check isn't passed, it's either denied or delayed. If a person meets one or more of the federally prohibited criteria for owning a gun, they're denied the ability to purchase a weapon. But if their background check is delayed, that means that their profile has been matched with ""either a state or federal potentially prohibiting record containing a similar name and/or similar descriptive features."" Essentially, it means the FBI requires more time to investigate whether or not it's an accurate match, which would disqualify the buyer.But investigating those potential matches isn't easy, and requires accurate records and time. In the case of Roof, his original arrest record listed the wrong county. When the FBI agent called that county's police department, she was sent to a different county. Unable to find contact information for this county in her records, she called one with a similar name, which of course had no record of the case. Three days passed while she waited to hear back from prosecutors, and the gun was then sold. That wouldn't have been the case had the agent been working with accurate information or had more time to get to the bottom of the discrepancy.The bill that's now headed to the Senate would extend the three-day waiting period to 10 days, in order to give the FBI more time to investigate background checks. The House voted 227 to 203 to pass this measure.Critics of the Charleston loophole say that it allows people who shouldn't otherwise own a gun to slip through the cracks. According to an FBI report, in 2018,4,240 background checks were denied after the three-day period had passed; 3,960 had already resulted in a gun sale. That year, 93 percent of people without cleared background checks were able to purchase a gun. Extending the three-day period to 10 days would allow more time to investigate cases such as that of Roof.However, others say that the three-day waiting period can be the difference between life or death for someone who needs a gun to defend themselves, and that expanding it would only exacerbate that issue. Ultimately, that's up to Congress to decide."

Stand With the AAPI Community in Atlanta and Beyond by Amplifying These Organizations,-5.33,38.0,https://www.popsugar.com/news/organizations-to-support-asian-american-community-48222339,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,www.popsugar.com,"On March 16, a man by the name of Robert Aaron Longshot and killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women, in several Atlanta-area spas. The violent string of events occurred in the wake ofnearly 3,800 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islandersthat were documented by the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center in the last year, in addition to countless other racially motivated attacks that have gone unreported. These statistical findings were published just hours before the Atlanta attacks took place.As discrimination, harassment, and hate crimes targeting the Asian American communitycontinue to surge amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many upstanding organizations are working around the clock to thwart these often-overlooked incidents and help those who face xenophobia every single day. Ahead, we've compiled a list of GoFundMe fundraisers organized to help some of the victims' families, as well as both Atlanta-based and national organizations you can support from home right now to do your part. Follow them on social media, amplify their handles to continue spreading awareness, and donate to them if you're able."
Why Are People Hesitating to Call the Georgia Shootings of Asian American Women a Hate Crime?,-8.33,39.0,https://www.popsugar.com/news/atlanta-spa-shootings-hate-crime-opinion-essay-48223710,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-18,www.popsugar.com,"On March 16,Robert Aaron Long shot and killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women, at three different spa locations across Atlanta. These horrific shootings follow months of increased violence against the Asian American community, and yet, the police, the media, and politicians are reticent to label this massacre for what it is: a hate crime.By definition ofGeorgia's (fairly new) legislation, Long committed a hate crime. Gov. Brian Kemp signed the law into action last June, following the killing of Ahmaud Arbery by two armed white men. The legislation is meant to impose penalties on perpetrators who target victims based on ""actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability."" Sounds pretty clear-cut to me.However, Atlanta Police Department Chief Rodney Bryant saidit's too early to tell if the shootings are a hate crime. Long, a white man, told the Cherokee County Sheriff's department his actions weren't racially motivated. Authorities instead linked the shootings to his sex addiction, after Long revealed his urge to eliminate temptation. But are we obligated to take the word of a man who not 24 hours before slaughtered eight people, with the assumed intent to harm more? And if his killings were sexually motivated, is that not a hate crime in and of itself? He clearly targeted women; seven died at his hands. He killed six Asian American women specifically, revealing that either explicitly or implicitly, he targeted these women on the basis of their race. This is a hate crime.It's chilling to watch footage of Georgia state Sen. Michelle Au from March 15 asshe foretells further violence against Asian Americansone day before the shootings. ""Recognize that we need help, we need protection, and we need people in power to stand up with us against hate,"" she pleaded. Her remarks were accompanied by a devastating data update: the Stop AAPI Hate organization receivedmore than 3,800 documented casesof anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide over the last year. A majority of the victims were women.Long's insistence that he was targeting his sources of ""temptation"" also emphasizes the dark hypersexualization of Asian women. An Asian Pacific Institute study revealed that 16 to 55 percent of Asian women in the USreported experiences of physical or sexual violence by an intimate partnerin their lifetime. Journalist Audrea Lim addressedthe fetishization of Asian womenin her 2018New York Timesopinion piece, describing how white supremacists perceive them to be ""subservient"" and ""docile."" ""That the Asian women killed yesterday were working highly vulnerable and low-wage jobs during an ongoing pandemic speaks directly to the compounding impacts of misogyny, structural violence, and white supremacy,"" Phi Nguyen, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, saidin a statement.The United States' historic treatment of Asian people is rooted in racism, from the abuse of Chinese workers who built the Transcontinental Railroad, to Japanese internment camps, to the ""model minority"" myth, to most recently, the offensive COVID-19 conjecture. Asian Americans are subjected to hearing phrases like ""Kung Flu"" or ""China Virus,"" whether that's from an internet troll or by the former president. Even a Cherokee county sheriff, who claimed Long was having a ""really bad day"" before his killing spree, was later found to haveshared a racist photo on Facebooklinking COVID-19 to China.Police and politicians continue to skate around calling Long's shootings a hate crime. PresidentJoe Biden's attempt to comfort the nation fell short whenhe addressed the violencebefore an ill-timed St. Patrick's Day meeting. Vice PresidentKamala Harriswent further in her condemnation but still refused to define the shootings as hate crimes. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottomsdid everything but define the crimewhen she said, ""I think whatever the stiffest most appropriate charges there are, this guy should face those charges. In Georgia, you can be charged with a hate crime. It covers a variety of areas and I personally think it would be appropriate, but I will defer to the prosecutors to make that determination.""Why, when the demographic connection is so painstakingly obvious, do politicians vacillate? If you want to stand with the AAPI community, it's time to call it like it is. This is a crime against Asian Americans. A crime against women. A hate crime. To vacillate, to call it anything else, is an injustice. To wait on the word of a killer puts the power back in his hands."
"Evan Rachel Wood Alleges Horrific Abuse From Marilyn Manson: ""I Am Done Living in Fear""",-0.33,45.67,https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/evan-rachel-wood-quotes-about-marilyn-manson-abuse-48141329,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,www.popsugar.com,"Image Source:Getty/John Shearer/WireImageEvan Rachel Wood details years-long abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her ex-fiancé, Marilyn Manson, inthe new docuseries ""Phoenix Rising.""The series, which debuted at the 2022Sundance Film Festival, sees Wood recount in episode one an incident where Manson, born Brian Warner, reportedly raped her on the set of the music video for his 2007 song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand).""Wood alleges that during a ""simulated sex scene,"" the musician ""started penetrating me for real."" She adds, ""I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses. That's when the first crime was committed against me, and I was essentially raped on camera."" According to the actor, Manson gave her strict instructions following the photo shoot to paint the music video as a ""great, romantic time"" when speaking to journalists. ""I was scared to do anything that would upset Brian in any way. The video was just the beginning of the violence that would keep escalating over the course of the relationship,"" Wood says in the documentary.Manson previously denied the claims in a statement toEntertainment Weeklythrough his attorney, Howard King. ""Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the 'Heart-Shaped Glasses' music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses,"" the statement read. ""Evan was not only fully coherent and engaged during the three-day shoot but also heavily involved in weeks of pre-production planning and days of post-production editing of the final cut. The simulated sex scene took several hours to shoot with multiple takes using different angles and several long breaks in between camera setups. Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.""On March 3, Manson filed a defamation suit against Wood. According to documents obtained by ""People,"" Manson is suing the actor for defamation, emotional distress, and ""impersonation over the internet."" He accuses her and artist Illma Gore of allegedly recruiting and pressuring women into making allegations against him, as well as reportedly impersonating FBI agents to make their families believe they were in trouble.POPSUGAR has reached out to Wood's rep for comment and to Manson's attorney for comment.Nearly two weeks after Manson's defamation suit against her, Wood appeared on an episode of""The View,""where she briefly addressed the situation. ""I can't, obviously, speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I am not scared,"" Wood told ""The View"" cohosts. ""I am sad, because this is how it works, this is what pretty much every survivor that tries to expose someone in a position of power goes through, and this is part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet. This is why people don't want to come forward, because this is — this was expected.""""I am very confident that I have the truth on my side and that the truth will come out, and that this is clearly timed before the documentary. This is the reason. So yes, again, I'm not doing this to clear my name — I'm doing this to protect people,"" she continued. ""I'm doing this to sound the alarm that there's a dangerous person out there, and I don't want anybody getting near him. And so people can think whatever they want about me — I have to let the legal process run its course. And I'm steady as a rock.""In astatement obtained by Entertainment Weeklyon Monday, a representative for Manson said, ""As we have stated from the beginning, Mr. Warner vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone."" ""As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted,"" Manson's attorney Howard King added. ""This is just more of the same.""On Feb. 1, 2021, Wood came forward withallegations that Manson started grooming her when she was a teenand had ""horrifically"" abused her for years.""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.""Wood explained her decision to speak out, adding that she wants to ""expose this dangerous man"" and ""call out the many industries that have enabled him"" in hopes of preventing him from ruining more lives. She ended her note with, ""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""Along with her Instagram post, Wood reposted several accounts from others detailing their own alleged abuse from Manson, including photographer Ashley Walters and model Sarah McNeilly. She also shared previous tweets from Manson's former personal assistant, Dan Cleary, who stated that the singer ""broke"" Wood and ""turned her into a different person"" during their time together.Wood and Manson first got togetherin January 2007 andbecame engaged in January 2010beforebreaking up for goodseven months later. In February 2018,Wood appeared before the House Judiciary Committeeto support the Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights Act. While she did not name her abuser at the time, she did highlight her own experience with abuse. ""It started slow but escalated over time, including threats against my life, severe gaslighting and brainwashing, [and] waking up to the man that claimed to love me raping what he believed to be my unconscious body,"" she said. ""And the worst part: sick rituals of binding me up by my hands and feet to be mentally and physically tortured until my abuser felt I had proven my love for them.""The following year,Wood testified againin front of the California Senate Public Safety Committee, recalling an abusive relationship she had been in during her teenage years. In November 2020,Manson's team released a statementaddressing Wood's testimony after the singer ended an interview with ""Metal Hammer"" when the subject was brought up.""Unfortunately, we live in a time where people believe what they read on the Internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence,"" the statement read. ""The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non fact based information is wholly irresponsible. All we can try and do, as the media and individuals, is to use facts and truth and not hide behind gossip and conjecture to further our own agendas.""Manson has since been dropped from his music label, Loma Vista Recordings, andCAA talent agency. ""In light of today's disturbing allegations by Evan Rachel Wood and other women naming Marilyn Manson as their abuser, Loma Vista will cease to further promote his current album, effective immediately,"" the statement read, according to Variety. ""Due to these concerning developments, we have also decided not to work with Marilyn Manson on any future projects.""Manson releaseda statement of his ownon Instagram denying the harrowing allegations. ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,"" Manson wrote. ""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual.""If you or someone you know would like to speak with someone trained to assist sexual assault survivors, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673."
"Men, the Women in Your Life Are Tired",-8.0,18.67,https://www.popsugar.com/news/women-history-month-men-women-in-your-life-are-tired-48211340,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-11,www.popsugar.com,"Women's History Monthis meant to be a time for centering women. It's a time for celebrating how far we've come, sure, but more importantly, it's a time to push for change on the issues that still face women — particularly trans, Black, and women of color — every single day.Of course, the shining crown in the Women's History Month is Monday, 8 March — International Women's Day. In previous years, I've listened to panels filled with inspiring women, I've attended lunches where I've felt the overwhelming support of my female peers. I've felt hope.This year was different. This year, I watchedMeghan Markle tell Oprahshe has experienced suicidal thoughts after her abhorrent treatment by the tabloid media, which is sexist at best and blatantly racist at worst. Within hours, I listened as she wastorn apart by men like Piers Morgan(and many men like him) on national television.At the same time, I heard the screams of women calling for an investigation into thedisappearance of Sarah Everard, who was abducted on a busy, well-lit street in South London. On streets that I too have walked in the dark, on my own, many times. I watched on in horror as police combed ponds and woodlands in search of any clue to her whereabouts and as women were told to not walk alone at night. As theyarrested a police officerfor allegedly committing the crime.Along with the horror, and the sadness, I just kept thinking:I'm so tired.Women are tired of walking home with keys between their fingers. We're tired of being told what to wear or not to walk alone at night. We're tired of crossing the road every time we see a man approaching us on a quiet street, even in broad daylight. We're tired of having to call someone on our way home ""just in case something happens."" Of taking the longer, better-lit route home. Of dropping pins and sharing Uber trips when the driver seems a bit sketchy.This month, one that's meant to celebrate women's achievements, Australia has seen thousands of women slam their federal government. A government that has not onlyallegedly allowed rape and abuse to take placeinside the walls of Parliament House for years, but has hidden crimes committed by the men they employ and silenced the women who have tried to report them. I won't speak for all women, but I will say that it certainly feels like we're sh*t out of luck when it comes to reporting crimes or holding perpetrators accountable.This story isn't new, and I'm certainly not pulling back the curtain on an issue that's been hiding in the shadows until now. According to a survey by UN Women,97 percent of women in the UK have been sexually harassed. Let that number really sink in — it's almost all women. And of the 1,000 women they polled, 96 percent of respondents who'd experienced harassment also said they didn't report the incident, with a further 45 percent said it was because they felt it would not change anything.So, men, I'll say it again: the women in your life are bone tired.We need you. We need you to share posts on Instagram about women not feeling safe, too. More importantly, we need you to speak to your friends about their disgusting behavior toward women. We need you to shut down the ""locker room chat"". Call them out. Or better yet, have the conversation before they ever do anything to hurt a woman in the first place.Men, we don't just need you to talk about this issue: we need you to yell about it — because we've tried to fix it on our own and, newsflash, it's not working."
