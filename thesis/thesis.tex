\begin{abstract}
    In today's digital, information-rich society, media bias poses a significant challenge to the objectivity and credibility of news reporting. As someone living in our current society, one has inevitably encountered some form of bias in the media, either consciously or unconsciously. Media bias can shape our perceptions, influence our opinions, and affect our understanding on various issues. It is crucial to recognise and address this bias to ensure a well-informed and balanced perspective. By being aware of the inherent biases in media sources, individuals can critically evaluate the information they consume and seek out diverse viewpoints to form a more comprehensive understanding of the world. This thesis project aims to understand forms of media bias appearing in articles and build a system to detect and classify existence of media bias on the article-level.
