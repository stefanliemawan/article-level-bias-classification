\section{Media Bias}

Allsides \cite{allsides-2022-bias-definition} defines media bias as "The tendency of news media to report in a way that reinforces a viewpoint, world-view, preference, political ideology, corporate or financial interests, moral framework, or policy inclination, instead of reporting in an objective way (simply describing the facts)". Media bias has existed and been researched since the 1950s \cite{white-1950-case-study-selection-news}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/bias-types-taxonomy.png}
    \caption{Media bias types as defined in The Media Bias Taxonomy \cite{spinde-2024-taxonomy}}
    \label{fig:media-bias-taxonomy}
\end{figure}

Many works and authors have tried to categorise media bias based on its types and characteristics \cite{rodrigo-2024-systematic-review-media-bias,eberl-2017-bias-political,spinde-2024-taxonomy,allsides-media-bias-types}. This project will follow The Media Bias Taxonomy by Spinde et al. (Figure \ref{fig:media-bias-taxonomy}), primarily focusing on \textbf{Text-level Context Bias}, which pertains to the context of a text and the manner in which it is conveyed \cite{spinde-2024-taxonomy}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/phrasing_bias_example.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/spin_bias_example.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/statement_bias_example.png}
    \caption{Example of phrasing bias (top), spin bias (middle), and statement bias (bottom) \cite{allsides-media-bias-types}}
    \label{fig:bias-examples}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:bias-examples} shows examples taken from the Allsides website \cite{allsides-media-bias-types} referring to the three types of text-level context bias: phrasing bias, spin bias, and statement bias. \textit{Phrasing bias} is characterised by the use of provocative, inflammatory, or non-neutral language, using words that may evoke specific feelings or emotions in the reader \cite{spinde-2024-taxonomy,hube-2019-neural-biased-language}. The top article snippet in Figure \ref{fig:bias-examples} shows the phrase "it's going to be a bloodbath". The phrase can be considered phrasing bias as it evokes a violent image and may lead readers to perceive the election as extremely chaotic or violent, even though it is not literal.\textit{Spin bias} is introduced when essential information is omitted from the narrative, or when irrelevant information is added instead \cite{spinde-2024-taxonomy}, often as an effort to craft a memorable story \cite{mullainathan-2002-media-bias}. The middle article in Figure \ref{fig:bias-examples} purposefully omitted the crucial information that the number of agencies reporting hate crime incidents has also increased. This creates a false narrative that hate crimes are on the rise, despite the possibility that the increase in reported incidents might be attributed due to higher number of reporting agencies. \textit{Statement bias} occurs when media personnel insert their personal views into the content, resulting in certain news being presented in a manner that is more or less favourable towards a particular view or position \cite{spinde-2024-taxonomy,d-alessio-2000-meta-analysis}. The sentence "He's a delicate snowflake" shown in the example (Figure \ref{fig:bias-examples} bottom article) is clearly a personal opinion of the author of the post.

\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/statistic_id1462057_frequency-of-seeing-false-information-online-in-the-us-2023-by-age-group.png}
    \caption{Frequency of seeing false or misleading information online in the United States as of April 2023, by age group \cite{yougov-2023-frequency}}
    \label{fig:frequency-of-seeing-false-information-online-in-the-us-2023-by-age-group}
\end{figure}


Media bias and misinformation are particularly prominent and visible within the United States, compared to other countries. Based on surveys from Reuters \cite{reuters-2023-false-info} and YouGov \cite{yougov-2023-frequency} (Figure \ref{fig:consumers-witnessing-false-information-on-certain-topics-worldwide-2023} and Figure \ref{fig:frequency-of-seeing-false-information-online-in-the-us-2023-by-age-group}), the United States is shown to have the highest rate of encountering false or misleading information related to politics, COVID-19, and climate change. Nearly half of the respondents reported seeing such information in the week prior to the survey. Additionally, most adults across all age groups reported seeing false or misleading information on a \textbf{daily} basis.

Furthermore, Trust in news media in the US is at an all-time low, declining consistently and significantly over the past 20 years \cite{pew-2021-partisan-divides, gallup-knight-2020-american-views, reuters-2023-digital-news-report}. Approximately half of Americans believe that the media is significantly responsible for the political divisions within the United States, with a growing number of Americans losing faith in the media's objectivity and perceiving it as actively engaging in ideological wars \cite{gallup-knight-2020-american-views}. Reuters Institute also reported less than half of their respondents (40\%) generally trust the majority of news sources, with the US ranked on 29\textsuperscript{th} out of 40 countries (32\%) in terms of trust \cite{reuters-2023-digital-news-report,reuters-2023-trust} (full figure shown in Figure \ref{fig:trustworthiness-of-news-media-worldwide-2023}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/statistic_id308468_trustworthiness-of-news-media-worldwide-2023.png}
    \caption{Trustworthiness of news media worldwide, as of February 2023 \cite{reuters-2023-trust}}
    \label{fig:trustworthiness-of-news-media-worldwide-2023}
\end{figure}

Given that the majority of research and resources on media bias are typically focused on the US \cite{allsides, adfontes,rodrigo-2024-systematic-review-media-bias}, it is therefore both reasonable and practical for this project to concentrate on US-based articles and domains.

\begin{comment}
Objectivity itself is defined by Cambridge Dictionary as "the fact of being based on facts and not influenced by personal beliefs or feelings" \cite{cambridge-dictionary-objectivity}.

(Journalism has abandoned the idea of seeking neutrality and objectivity, aiming instead to adopt a more engaged and committed approach) Objectivity in the media has been rejected both as an impossible standard and as an undesirable norm. \cite{boudana-2011-journalistic-objectivity}.

A survey of journalists from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and Sweden found evidence that journalists' personal beliefs substantially influence their news decisions, expressed within the stories they choose and the statements they write \cite{patterson-donsbach-1996-news-decisions}.

Panagopoulos' study \cite{panagopoulos-2020} revealed systemic biases leaning towards Democratic candidates during national and state levels pre-election polls conducted during the 2020 U.S. general election cycle. Rafail et al. \cite{rafail-2018-tea-party} examined 201,678 media documents from Tea Party organizations, Fox News, MSNBC, and 785 newspapers, revealing significant differences in how the Tea Party frames itself compared to how other media sources frame the movement, MSNBC portrays it as the worst aspect of the Republican Party, while Fox News sees it as the best, sharply in contrasts with how activists frame the movement as conservative but not strictly Republican, often clashing with Republican Party goals.

An analysis by Pew Research Center \cite{pew-2021-election2020} found that miscalculations observed in the 2020 U.S. election polls would adjust public opinion on issues by an average of just under 1 percentage point. Although errors of such scale would not have produced substantial differences on the American public opinions, this shows the underlying bias within polls specifically and the failure of accurately representing surveys.

Readers themselves are not exempt from bias, as they are known to prefer to pick, follow, and consume articles that align with their own beliefs and ideology, an issue known as filter bubble \cite{lim-2018-understanding} or selective exposure \cite{spinde-2024-taxonomy}. This incident reinforces existing biases and limits exposure to diverse perspectives, creating echo chambers that hinder critical thinking and informed decision-making. The combination of media bias and filter bubbles can distort reality, perpetuate misinformation, and deepen societal divisions.

\section{Machine Learning Concepts and Techniques}

This section introduces general machine learning concepts and techniques relevant to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and media bias classification, with a particular focus on article-level media bias classification.

\subsection{Text Representation}

\textbf{Bag-of-words (BoW)} one of the most common techniques to represent text. In text classification, the BoW method works by counting the occurrences of each word for each instance and ignoring the order of the words and grammatical structure \cite{qader-2019-bow}. The biggest advantage of this technique is that it is computationally cheap and conceptually simple.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/word_embeddings.png}
    \caption{Word embeddings visualisation \cite{narayanan-2019-word-embeddings}}
    \label{fig:word-embeddings}
\end{figure}

Embeddings, which represent knowledge through low-dimensional vectors that integrate easily into modern machine learning models, have been a crucial topic in NLP \cite{camacho-collados-2020-embeddings}. This approach gained significant popularity with the introduction of \textit{word2vec} and GloVE \cite{pennington-2014-glove} as methods to generate word embeddings \cite{mikolov-2013-embeddings}, which map each word to a fixed vector (visualised in Figure \ref{fig:word-embeddings}). Embeddings can be extended further to encode sentences and documents instead of words (sentence embeddings and document embeddings). Paragraph vector, or \textit(doc2vec), is a continuation from word2vec, which learns fixed-length feature representations from text segments of varying lengths, including sentences, paragraphs, and documents \cite{mikolov-2014-doc2vec}. However, word embeddings and bag-of-words have been shown to perform better than paragraph vectors models for sentence classification \cite{white-2015-how-well-sentence-embeddings}.

\begin{comment}
Therefore, word-level embeddings remain as the commonly used technique for most NLP tasks for a while.
\end{comment}

Nevertheless, word embeddings have an important limitation. Since every word is mapped into a fixed single vector, word embeddings are considered static or non-contextualised, therefore, unable to distinguish between different meanings of a word \cite{camacho-collados-2020-embeddings}. Words such as 'break,' 'cut,' or 'duck' can have multiple meanings depending on their context, and thus require better modelling to achieve an accurate semantic representation. This problem is solved by \textbf{contextualised word embeddings}, which assign each word with a representation based on its context, allowing it to capture usage in different contexts and encode knowledge that can be transferred across languages \cite{liu-2020-survey-contextual-embeddings}. The embedding is typically encoded dynamically through the use of a pre-trained language model, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:contextualised-word-embeddings}.

\begin{comment}
Sentence embeddings generated by pre-trained language models often fail to effectively capture the semantic meaning of sentences \cite{li-2020-sentence-embeddings-pretrained-language}
\end{comment}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/contextualised_word_embeddings.png}
    \caption{An illustration of contextualised word embeddings. A language modelling component analyses the context of the target word (as shown in the figure) and generates its dynamic embedding. \cite{camacho-collados-2020-embeddings}}
    \label{fig:contextualised-word-embeddings}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Neural Networks}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/mlp.png}
    \caption{MultiLayer Perceptron visualisation \cite{perez-enciso-2019-guide}}
    \label{fig:mlp}
\end{figure}

Neural Networks or Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) saw a resurgence of interest after the development of back-propagation algorithm in 1986 \cite{rumelhart-1986-ann}, which made training multi-layer networks feasible and practical. A neural network, composed of interconnected nodes called neurons arranged in layers that somewhat mimic the human brain, uses the back-propagation algorithm to learn from its mistakes and continuously improve \cite{aws-neural-network}.

\textbf{A MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)} is a fully connected ANN that consists of single or multiple hidden layers, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:mlp}. Hidden layers refer to the collection of neurons that are between the input and output layers, transforming data from layer to layer \cite{uzair-2020-hidden-layers}. MLP is widely used due to its ability to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to approximate complex functions that are beyond the capability of simple linear models \cite{popescue-2009-mlp}.

\begin{comment}
The weighted sum (\( \mathbf{z} \)) in a hidden layer of a neural network is computed as follows (Equation \eqref{eq:z}):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:z}
    \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}
\end{equation} where \( \mathbf{x} \) is the input vector, \( \mathbf{W} \) is the weight matrix, \( \mathbf{b} \) is the bias vector. After computing \( \mathbf{z} \), an activation function \( f \) is applied element-wise to produce the output \( \mathbf{h} \) (Equation \eqref{eq:h}):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:h}
    \mathbf{h} = f(\mathbf{z})
\end{equation}
\end{comment}

\subsection{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/lstm.jpeg}
    \caption{LSTM architecture \cite{rahman-2023-lstm-networks}}
    \label{fig:lstm}
\end{figure}

LSTM \cite{hochreiter-1997-lstm} is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. It incorporates two fundamental components: memory cells and gates. Memory cells maintain a cell state, which can store information over long sequences and allows the model to retain information for longer durations compared to traditional RNNs. Gates control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell, controlled by sigmoid and tanh activation functions, which regulate the information flow based on the input data and the current state. Figure \ref{fig:lstm} shows the full architecture of a LSTM block.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Transformer and Large Language Model (LLM)}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/transformer.png}
    \caption{Transformer visualisation \cite{vaswani-2023-attention}}
    \label{fig:transformer}
\end{figure}

The Transformer has become the preferred architecture in NLP, particularly for pre-trained models, due to its capabilities \cite{lin-2022-survey-transformers}. Its architecture relies entirely on attention mechanism to capture global dependencies across input and output sequences, allowing for unprecedented levels of parallelisation instead of sequential processing \cite{vaswani-2023-attention}.

\textbf{Large Language Models (LLMs)} are artificial neural networks that utilise the transformer architecture, designed to understand and generate human language. They are trained on vast amounts of diverse text data using unsupervised learning techniques, often containing millions or even billions of parameters. Two of the most popular and widely used LLMs are \textbf{Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)} \cite{devlin-2019-bert}, comprised of 110 million parameters, and GPT, particularly GPT-4 \cite{openai-2024-gpt4}, which is reported to have an astonishing 1.76 trillion parameters, based on a report by SemiAnalysis in 2023 \cite{semianalysis-gpt4}.

As in the BERT original paper \cite{devlin-2019-bert}, pre-trained language representations can be utilised for downstream tasks through two main approaches: \textbf{feature-based} and \textbf{fine-tuning}. Feature-based approach \cite{devlin-2019-bert} leverages a pre-trained model to extract embeddings or features from text and use them as input to other machine learning models for various downstream tasks. Fine-tuning \cite{devlin-2019-bert} adjust the model weights based on the training data for the downstream task, allowing the model to adapt its pre-trained representations to the specific requirements of the task.

Transformers and LLMs have sparked a revolution in the domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), having achieved remarkable successes across diverse fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing \cite{lin-2022-survey-transformers}. They have single-handedly catalysed the emergence of a new era in AI capabilities observed today, predicted to have an even greater influence than the Industrial and digital revolutions combined \cite{makridakis-2017-ai-revolution}.

\end{figure}

\begin{comment}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:attention}
    \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) \mathbf{V}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:multihead}
    \text{MultiHead}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h) \mathbf{W}^O
\end{equation}
where
\[
    \text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{W}^Q_i, \mathbf{K} \mathbf{W}^K_i, \mathbf{V} \mathbf{W}^V_i)
\]
\end{comment}

\subsection{MAGPIE}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/magpie.png}
    \caption{MAGPIE containing a pre-trained representation of various biases \cite{horych-2024-magpie}.}
    \label{fig:magpie}
\end{figure}

\textbf{MAGPIE} \cite{horych-2024-magpie} is a large-scale, RoBERTa-based, multitask pre-training approach specifically designed for media bias detection, pre-fine-tuned on fifty-nine bias-related tasks covering a broad spectrum of biases. Pre-fine-tuning is a large-scale training phase situated between language model pre-training and fine-tuning. It involves extensive multitask learning (MTL) \cite{caruana-1997-mtl} and aims to foster the development of representations that generalise more effectively across various tasks \cite{aghajanyan-2021-muppet}. Pre-fine-tuning allows multitask-approach such as MAGPIE to generalise better on various tasks related to media bias, enabling better performance on these tasks compared to single-task RoBERTa approach \cite{horych-2024-magpie}.

Unfortunately, MAGPIE is only trained to output binary classification (biased or unbiased) and mostly trained on sentences, therefore unable to be directly fine-tuned for article-level media bias classification task. However, the model and its feature representations can still be utilised for a feature-based approach \cite{devlin-2019-bert}.


\subsection{Chunking and Hierarchical Techniques}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick,->,>=stealth]

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Illustration of chunking}
    \label{fig:chunking}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Chunking} is a technique used to break down text into smaller, more manageable units. This technique can be applied to segment documents into smaller paragraphs or sentences, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:chunking}, facilitating more efficient processing and analysis. \textbf{Hierarchical models} \cite{sun-2020-fine-tune} incorporate multiple levels of abstraction or granularity to capture complex relationships within data. These models are particularly useful when dealing with structured data that naturally falls into a hierarchical organisation, such as documents composed of paragraphs and sentences. Furthermore, \textbf{hierarchical transformer model} is a variant of the transformer architecture that incorporate hierarchical structures to handle long sequences more efficiently. These models process data at different levels, such as sentences within paragraphs, to capture hierarchical relationships. Figure \ref{fig:hi_transformer} shows an example of hierarchical transformer model used to produce document embeddings by utilising sentence-level and word-level information \cite{wu-2021-hi-transformer}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/hi_transformer.png}

\section{Literature Review}

This section will discuss related works within the domain of document classification, media bias classification, and article-level media bias classification.

\subsection{Document Classification}

Document classification refers to the task of assigning one or more labels to a document from a predefined set of categories \cite{wan-2019-long-length}. This task was first mentioned in 1963 \cite{borko-1963-auto-doc-classification}, with statistical text processing concepts and techniques defined earlier in the 1950s \cite{luhn-1958-business-intelligence-system}. In modern times, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \cite{afzal-deepdocclassifier,liu-2017-xmlcnn} have been conventionally implemented for this task. However, CNNs have largely been surpassed by more recent methods such as Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN) \cite{yang-2016-han}, which use word and sentence-level attention to extract significant features from documents, and DocBERT \cite{adhikari-2019-docbert}, which leverages knowledge distillation from the BERT-large model.

A limitation with transformer-based approach for document classification, is that models such as BERT are only able to process a maximum of 512 input tokens \cite{devlin-2019-bert}. Therefore, additional techniques such as chunking or hierarchical approach are necessary to process longer sequences. There exist other LLMs that are designed specifically to handle longer sequences, such as Longformer \cite{beltagy-2020-longformer} and BigBird \cite{zaheer-2021-bigbird}. Both are hierarchical transformer models that utilises combination of global and local attention mechanisms. However, Longformer has been reported to be inconsistent in classification of long documents, performing only notably better than the baseline models (e.g. BERT of the first 512 tokens) on only two datasets \cite{park-2022-efficient}.

Therefore, chunking and hierarchical techniques have been implemented to combat the problem of handling long sequences. Pappagari et al. \cite{pappagari-2019-hierarchical} are among the first to utilise the transformer architecture for long sequences classification, introducing chunking and propagation methods. Su et al. \cite{su-2021-classifying} used chunking methods in a hierarchical transformer model with 'CLS-Pooling' (as also described in \cite{adhikari-2019-docbert}) to extract representations on the document-level for the task of clinical document classification. Khandve et al. \cite{khandve-2022-hierarchical-longdoc} also implemented a hierarchical model by utilising BERT and Bi-LSTM layers for long document classification tasks.

\begin{comment}
In 2022, according to International Data Corporation (IDC) report, unstructured data accounted for 90\& of the total of organisation-generated data, in forms of purchase orders, product inventories, import/export records, sales agreements, contracts, patents, patient treatment notes, financial earning reports, and employee performance records, among many others \cite{box-2023-untapped}. Unstructured data refers to unorganised data that cannot be stored well into database, commonly in form of large collections of texts, terabytes or petabytes in size and growing exponentially \cite{mishra-2017-structured-unstructured}. Thus, the need to automatically manage and organise large amount of text and retrieve useful knowledge (knowledge discovery) is highly apparent \cite{mali-2021-relevance-of-preprocessing}.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Media Bias Classification}

Article classification can be seen as a subset of document classification, focusing primarily on assigning articles into a specific set of categories \cite{dien-2019-article-classification}. In this project articles refer to mostly news pieces published by media outlets. Most news articles typically range between 500 and 1200 words on average \cite{newswhip-2013-article-length}, shorter than many general applications of document classification. Media bias classification refers to the task of analysing and categorising media content to determine the presence and extent of bias. Thus, article-level media bias classification involves performing media bias classification on entire articles rather than on sentences or phrases.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \fbox{
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/media_bias_dataset_overview.png}}
    \caption{Overview of available media bias datasets \cite{rodrigo-2024-systematic-review-media-bias}}
    \label{fig:media-bias-datasets-overview}
\end{figure}


Current available datasets for article-level and media bias classification often vary in formats or incorporate different types of bias \cite{rodrigo-2024-systematic-review-media-bias} (Figure \ref{fig:media-bias-datasets-overview}). Consequently, it is challenging to compare these datasets directly in terms of their quality and usefulness.

The \textbf{BASIL} dataset \cite{fan-2019-basil} is the most commonly used bias dataset, containing 300 articles with both article-level and phrase-level annotations. The \textbf{NLPCSS} \cite{chen-2020-nlpcss} dataset, with 6,964 articles annotated via Ad Fontes labels, includes article-level textual content with three bias labels (bias, neutral, or unknown). 

The \textbf{NELA-GT-2022} dataset \cite{gruppi-2023-nela-gt-2022} includes 1,778,361 articles from 361 outlets, annotated with labels from the MBFC \cite{mbfc} website. Despite its large size, the primary issue with this dataset is the ambiguity of its three labels: reliable, mixed, and unreliable. I argue that these labels lack clarity and fail to provide sufficient information about the annotated articles. The 'mixed' label, in particular, poses a challenge as it is unclear how to interpret and utilise articles categorised under this label. This lack of precision in classification undermines the utility of the dataset for rigorous analysis and research purposes. Similarly, the NLPCSS dataset faces the same issue. 

The \textbf{BAT} dataset \cite{spinde-2023-bat} which includes 6,345 articles from 321 outlets annotated with Ad Fontes labels. Unlike other datasets, the BAT dataset provides clear and precise labels with its bias reliability scores for articles. However, the dataset lacks the textual content of the articles, requiring further extension by crawling the article content from the respective websites, a process which will be fully described in the next chapter. 

Other datasets shown in Figure \ref{fig:media-bias-datasets-overview} either have a political compass rating or are annotated at the sentence level, making them unsuitable for this project.

Past works on media bias classification typically use the BASIL dataset, operating on a sentence-level and outputting binary result (either biased or not) \cite{maab-2023-lexical-bias-detection, maab-2023-target-aware, guo-2022-modeling, van-den-berg-2020-context,lee-2021-unifying,lei-2022-sentence,lei-2024-event-relation}, complemented by the lack of appropriate and adequate datasets with article-level annotations \cite{demidov-2023-political-bias-classification}. Hence, There are only a few existing works on article-level media bias classification. Chen et al. \cite{chen-2020-detecting-media-bias-gaussian} utilised a Gaussian mixture model, incorporating probability distributions of frequency, positions, and sequential order of lexical and informational sentence-level bias to detect article-level bias. Kulkarni et al. \cite{kulkarni-2018-multi-view} proposed a more complex model that leverages signals from multiple views to predict the political ideology of news articles, demonstrating that incorporating cues from the title, link structure, and content surpasses the state-of-the-art performance significantly. Given that automated text classification of news articles has been shown to benefit from using segments instead of sentences as units of analysis \cite{barbera-2021-article-classification}, it may be advantageous to consider segment-length window size when developing methodologies.

Furthermore, annotating media bias is not a straightforward task. Traditionally, this is done by hiring experts and journalists to manually read and determine how biased the content is. Here it is important to use multiple annotators to minimise introducing another form of bias towards the dataset. This comes with its own set of challenges as annotators might not always agree on biased text \cite{lim-2018-understanding}. As with \cite{spinde-2021-babe}, annotations are generally compiled and majority voted to achieve the final annotation given a particular text. Moreover, annotators' personal background moderately influenced their decisions and should be taken into consideration when building datasets, along with other factors such as topics, reading news habits, and honest mistakes \cite{spinde-2021-bias-words}. Clearly, this is not a cheap procedure and can act as a bottleneck when building a reliable media bias dataset.

Alternatively, organisations such as Allsides \cite{allsides} and Ad Fontes \cite{adfontes} have their own experts and annotations which can be crawled and exploited. Several papers and datasets \cite{spinde-2023-bat,chen-2020-nlpcss,kulkarni-2018-multi-view} have utilised this approach. However, since these datasets depend on manual labelling from third-party organisations, the selection of articles likely also introduces bias into the dataset \cite{spinde-2023-bat}.
