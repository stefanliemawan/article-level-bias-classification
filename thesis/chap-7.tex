\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:7}

Simple, frequency-based methods such as BoW and TF-IDF combined with logistic regression already provided decent result given the circumstances.

While we can seemingly just take the outlet and use this information to classify media bias...

Furthermore, we have not tested the model with unseen data containing unseen outlets...

\subsection{Future Work}

The methods need to be reevaluated with a bigger dataset and particularly much more examples of biased articles, as the current dataset is highly-imbalanced.

Classifying media bias right now, in this way, does not provide much explanaibility. Ultimately, we would want a model to also output a reasoning behind the classification.

Implement a more global methods using graph-based approach to encode multiple articles and define relationships between them.

Carefully tune the test set to enable more representational metric, include unseen outlets.
