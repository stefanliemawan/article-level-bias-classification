The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

Will the forthcoming AI revolution produce similar, far-reaching effects? By examining analogous inventions of the industrial, digital and AI revolutions, this article claims that the latter is on target and that it would bring extensive changes that will also affect all aspects of our society and life. In addition, its impact on firms and employment will be considerable, resulting in richly interconnected organizations with decision making based on the analysis and exploitation of “big” data and intensified, global competition among firms. People will be capable of buying goods and obtaining services from anywhere in the world using the Internet, and exploiting the unlimited, additional benefits that will open through the widespread usage of AI inventions. The paper concludes that significant competitive advantages will continue to accrue to those utilizing the Internet widely and willing to take entrepreneurial risks in order to turn innovative products/services into worldwide commercial success stories. The greatest challenge facing societies and firms would be utilizing the benefits of availing AI technologies, providing vast opportunities for both new products/services and immense productivity improvements while avoiding the dangers and disadvantages in terms of increased unemployment and greater wealth inequalities.},

Therefore, it is natural to attract lots of interest from academic and industry researchers. Up to the present, a great variety of Transformer variants (a.k.a.

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various X-formers. We first briefly introduce the vanilla Transformer and then propose a new taxonomy of X-formers. Next, we introduce the various X-formers from three perspectives: architectural modification, pre-training, and applications. Finally, we outline some potential directions for future research.},

Pre-finetuning is massively multi-task learning (around 50 datasets, over 4.8 million total labeled examples), and is designed to encourage learning of representations that generalize better to many different tasks. We show that pre-finetuning consistently improves performance for pretrained discriminators (e.g. RoBERTa) and generation models (e.g. BART) on a wide range of tasks (sentence prediction, commonsense reasoning, MRC, etc.), while also significantly improving sample efficiency during fine-tuning. We also show that large-scale multi-tasking is crucial; pre-finetuning can hurt performance when few tasks are used up until a critical point (usually above 15) after which performance improves linearly in the number of tasks.},

@article{rodrigo-2024-systematic-review-media-bias,
  abstract = {Media bias and the intolerance of media outlets and citizens to deal with opposing points of view pose a threat to the proper functioning of democratic processes. In this respect, we present a systematic review of the literature related to media bias detection, in order to characterize and classify the different types of media bias, and to explore the state-of-the-art of automatic media bias detection systems. The main objectives of this paper were twofold. First, we framed information, misinformation and disinformation within a theoretical framework that allows us to differentiate the different existing misinformation problems such as us media bias, fake news, or propaganda. Second, we studied the state of the art of automatic media bias detection systems: analyzing the most recently used techniques and their results, listing the available resources and the most relevant datasets, and establishing a discussion about how to increase the maturity of this area. After doing a comprehensive literature review, we have identified and selected a total of 17 forms of media bias that can be classified depending on the context (e.g., coverage bias, gatekeeping bias, or statement bias), and on the author’s intention (e.g., spin bias, or ideology bias). We also reviewed, following the PRISMA methodology, the main automatic media bias detection systems that have been developed so far, selecting 63 relevant articles, from which we extracted the most used techniques; including non-deep learning methods (e.g., linguistic-based methods, and reported speech-based methods), and deep learning methods (e.g., RNNs-based methods, and transformers-based methods). Additionally, we listed and summarized 18 available datasets for the task of automatic media bias detection. In conclusion, the current methods for automatic media bias detection are still in their infancy and there is still a lot of potential for improvement in terms of accuracy and robustness. We have proposed some future research lines that could potentially contribute to the development of more advanced techniques.},

@article{eberl-2017-bias-political,
  abstract = {Bias in political news coverage may have a profound influence on voter opinions and preferences. However, the concept of media bias actually encompasses different sub-types: Visibility bias is the salience of political actors, tonality bias the evaluation of these actors, and agenda bias the extent to which parties address preferred issues in media coverage. The present study is the first to explore how each type of bias influences party preferences. Using data from the Austrian parliamentary election campaign of 2013, we combine an online panel survey (n = 1,285) with measures of media bias from content analyses of party press releases (n = 1,922) and media coverage in eight newspapers (n = 6,970). We find substantial effects on party preferences for tonality bias and agenda bias, while visibility bias has no clear impact. Voters who are less politically sophisticated and lack a party identification are more susceptible to bias, and media bias can also reinforce existing partisan identities. },

@article{d-alessio-2000-meta-analysis,
  abstract = {A meta-analysis considered 59 quantitative studies containing data concerned with partisan media bias in presidential election campaigns since 1948. Types of bias considered were gatekeeping bias, which is the preference for selecting stories from one party or the other; coverage bias, which considers the relative amounts of coverage each party receives; and statement bias, which focuses on the favorability of coverage toward one party or the other. On the whole, no significant biases were found for the newspaper industry. Biases in newsmagazines were virtually zero as well. However, meta-analysis of studies of television network news showed small, measurable, but probably insubstantial coverage and statement biases.},
