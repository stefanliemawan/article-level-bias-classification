    \label{table:eval}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:eval} shows the evaluation of all methods given only title and content of articles as features. It can be seen that frequency-based approaches such as BoW and TF-IDF performed generally decent. However, looking at per-class metrics, it is evident that the overall scores are heavily influenced by the performance of the 'Reliable' class due to its large support. On all of the other less represented classes, the models' performance suffered with much lower F1 scores with the TF-IDF + LR model having the worst F1 score on the 'Problematic' class. The BoW + MLP model achieved slight improvement in almost all instances compared to its predecessor due to the use of neural network. A typical BERT fine-tuning outperformed all frequency-based methods, though only with a close margin compared to the BoW + MLP model. The BERT sliding window fine-tuning (BERT SW FT) method outperformed all BoW and TF-IDF methods, also performing slightly better to a standard BERT fine-tuning of the first 512 tokens. Similarly, the CLS methods mostly outperformed traditional methods with best F1 score on the 'Problematic' class, able to generalise on the most biased class. While BERT CLS achieved slightly worse performance compared to the two fine-tuning methods, \textbf{MAGPIE CLS performed best among all other methods with the highest overall precision, recall, and F1 score.}

Table \ref{table:eval-outlet} shows the evaluation of methods, given the article's outlet information as additional features to the title and content. As a comparison, \textbf{using outlet information as the sole feature without any other information (with majority votes) outperformed all methods on overall recall and F1 scores}. This result signified how influential outlet information can be in terms of classifying media bias, with regards to this specific dataset and circumstances. Out of all the other methods, BERT fine-tuning reigned superior with the best overall precision score and a particularly strong F1 score on the 'Problematic' class, performing slightly better than the sliding window implementation (BERT SW FT). Interestingly, both BERT CLS and MAGPIE CLS methods were not able to capitalise on the outlet information as well as BERT FT and BERT SW FT as both CLS methods only saw little improvement compared to when outlet features were unavailable.

All methods demonstrate reasonably well with overall precision, recall, and F1 scores above 0.67, with a particularly strong performance on the 'Reliable' class, achieving F1 scores consistently above 0.84.
